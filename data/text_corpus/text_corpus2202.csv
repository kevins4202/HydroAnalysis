11010,nitrate contamination of groundwater has been identified as a major environmental problem of the last few decades in this study stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o of groundwater samples from the varamin aquifer located southeast of tehran iran were analyzed in two periods in order to determine the sources of nitrate pollution and nitrogen transformation processes where treated wastewater from the capital city is used for irrigation purpose the approach in this study was based on isotopic fingerprinting of nitrate contaminant sources of groundwater using δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in addition a hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to classify groundwater samples into three different hydrochemical facieses groups 1 3 furthermore the stable isotope ratios of molecular water showed that most of the groundwater samples were plotted along the local meteoric line and distinguishable isotopic compositions from those of river water and treated wastewater stable isotopic analysis together with these hydrochemical classifications suggested that the main sources of nitrate in groundwater are chemical fertilizers and treated wastewater in the irrigated area group 1 in addition to domestic wastes in the residential area group 2 and chemical fertilizers and sewage water recharged by the shour river group 3 denitrification is a major transformation process occurring at the western and southwestern parts of the aquifer seasonal variations in the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of nitrate were more obvious in the wet season compared to the dry season this study is unique in that it describes how groundwater nitrate contamination is enhanced in the area using treated wastewater for irrigation purposes the results of the current study are applicable for other areas with similar settings since treated wastewaters are important water resources for water users in arid to semi arid regions all over the world keywords groundwater nitrate contamination stable isotope ratios denitrification cluster analysis 1 introduction nitrate pollution in groundwater resources is a persistent problem that is typically caused by non point source nitrogen loads from a variety of land uses identifying the sources of dissolved nitrate and its behavior along water flows is therefore the first step in reducing the nitrate pollution of groundwater groundwater nitrate can be initiated by a natural or anthropogenic origin the concentration of naturally occurring no3 n does not usually exceed concentrations of 3 mg l in aquatic environments burkart and kolpin 1993 except in areas with high geological impact sources lowe and wallace 2001 min et al 2003 stadler et al 2008 higher concentrations of no3 n in groundwater are typically caused by anthropogenic activities including the use of nitrogen compounds in synthetic fertilizers and or manure in agriculture leakage from septic systems and other wastewaters mclay et al 2001 widory et al 2005 kendall et al 2007 heaton et al 2012 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2015 in drinking water a high concentration of no3 n 10 mg l may result in blue baby syndrome in infants methemoglobinemia and may be a contributing factor for some types of cancers who 2004 galloway et al 2008 ward et al 2010 pastén zapata et al 2014 xue et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 in fact groundwater is often a major source of water for drinking purposes and thus the cause and fate of nitrate contamination should be examined properly in addition to regular monitoring for nitrate concentrations in the water the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater may be considerably affected by temporal variations depending on precipitation hydrogeological conditions and land use menció et al 2011 álvarez cabria et al 2016 epelde et al 2016 exner kittridge et al 2016 observations on the linkage between land uses with different anthropogenic activities and intensities in nitrate contamination of the groundwater mclay et al 2001 kaown et al 2007 pastén zapata et al 2014 suggest the usefulness of land use information in examining the anthropogenic impacts of source regions however it may be difficult to distinguish the type of fertilizers manure vs inorganic fertilizers that particularly affect the observed nitrate contamination using land information only zhang et al 1996 to overcome this problem many investigations have used stable isotope analysis to identify the origins of the nitrate li et al 2007 barnes and raymond 2010 jin et al 2015 sun et al 2011 vrzel et al 2016 dual nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate are valuable fingerprinting tools used especially to identify predominant sources of nitrate contamination and its attenuation processes in aquifers böttcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 umezawa et al 2008 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2011 urresti estala et al 2015 xu et al 2016 puig et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 biddau et al 2019 taufiq et al 2019 in some cases however the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of nitrate overlap among the different source materials and or between source signatures and process signals chang et al 2003 itoh et al 2011 jin et al 2012 vidal gavilan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 vavilin and rytov 2015 this drawback may be addressed by combining the n and o isotopic data with hydrochemical data widory et al 2013 chen et al 2014 dun et al 2014 urresti estala et al 2015 ma et al 2016 biddau et al 2019 assessing groundwater nitrate pollution in semi arid regions faces spatial complexity to overcome this issue stadler et al 2008 applied a multidisciplinary approach investigating known potential sources and aquifer immanent sinks of nitrate groundwater recharge processes in semi arid areas are highly complex in these environments solutes may be carried into the groundwater under present day climatic and hydrologic conditions during active recharge but the transport of water through the saturated zone is considerably slow de vries and simmers 2002 some authors believe that leaching is negligible as n sink in soils in these areas e g boring et al 1988 peterjohn and schlesinger 1990 while other researchers suggest that substantial quantities of nitrogen have leached and accumulated below the soil cover zone jackson et al 2002 2004 the elevated nitrate concentrations found in the groundwater of semi arid regions are explained by the interaction of numerous factors for example in barely inhabited semi arid regions it is assumed that causes of increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater have indirect anthropogenic influences such as land use for cattle grazing manure laftouhi et al 2003 which is a common practice in these regions non anthropogenic reasons are mostly related to the evaporative enrichment of dry and wet depositions biogenic point sources through n fixing organisms or to a geogenic origin stadler et al 2008 in recent years elevated nitrate concentrations have also been recorded in the groundwater of mostly uninhabited regions around the world especially in semi arid settings the isotopic composition of nitrate is a useful indicator of the sources of nitrogen to groundwater in this area stadler et al 2008 2012 jackson et al 2015 awaleh et al 2017 the present study reports the first results of nitrate isotopes of groundwater from a semi arid environment located in iran the study area varamin plain is located in north central iran fig 1 and is an intensively agricultural region with over 40 years of irrigation history irrigation water is supplied mainly from groundwater and treated wastewater from southern parts of the capital city tehran see study area the overexploitation of water resources a succession of drought years and several sources of pollution constitute major challenges for compatibility between securing the existing activity and safeguarding the groundwater in order to cope with water scarcity and attenuate the impacts on groundwater policy makers encourage the reuse of treated wastewater as a substitute resource for agricultural practices the groundwater in this area is an important source of drinking water for the citizens of varamin city this study aimed to identify the pollution sources and transformations of nitrate from groundwaters in the varamin aquifer the environmental isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o were used simultaneously with hydrochemical hydrogeological and land use data to achieve a better understanding of the sources and processes affecting groundwater nitrate concentrations in the varamin aquifer the novelty of this study is the examination of the effect of treated wastewater used for irrigation to enhance groundwater nitrate contamination the results of this study are important as the basis for designing treatment methods for polluted groundwater in the study areas as well as other arid and semi arid regions applying the same water management style 2 study area the varamin plain 971 km2 is located in the eastern part of tehran iran fig 1 and is surrounded by the tehran karaj plain to the west and northwest the changi mountain to the north 2310 m and pishva mountain to the east 972 m the altitude of this area tends to decrease from north 1148 m to southeast 810 m according to the national population and housing census in 2011 there are 990 447 inhabitants within the area the mean annual temperature and precipitation in the plain are about 16 4 c and 187 4 mm respectively varamin station 2016 2017 trwa 2018 therefore this region is classified as an arid area according to the emberger method emberger 1930 the distribution of precipitation is irregular and more than 70 of the rainfall events occur during january to april idwrm 2017 the main river in the study area the jajrood river originates from a northern mountainous area fig 1 the river flows southward and supplies agricultural water currently mamlou dam is being constructed to provide a small portion of tehran s drinking water supply thus some of the surface flow is present only in the spring and summer seasons furthermore the kan river and surface wastewater from the sorkhehesar river originating from tehran city flow into the shour river in the west northwest part of the varamin plain fig 2 the chief land uses of the varamin plain are agricultural 76 27 of the total area fig 2 followed by residential 10 83 the income and sustenance of the people in this area depend on agricultural activities in this area groundwater provides drinking water 8 29 107 m3 yr 1 and industrial water 2 18 107 m3 yr 1 as well as a portion of the water used for agricultural activities 3 12 108 m3 yr 1 because of severe urbanization and industrialization as well as agricultural development the pumping rate has recently increased dramatically the increasing water demands combined with climatological impacts such as droughts have led to the continuous decrease of the groundwater table 2 5 m per year during the last five years idwrm 2017 the remaining portion of the agricultural water has been supplied by treated wastewater from southern tehran since 2004 1 16 108 m3 yr 1 and the wastewater irrigation still is going on the treated wastewater is transferred from the southern tehran wastewater refinery to the chahgah station and then it enters the varamin channel for irrigation fig 2 geological outcrops in the area fig 3 consist of a variety of formations mostly sandstone shale marl and a conglomerate of the eocene to the quaternary ages comprising the hydrogeological basement of this area most of the varamin plain lies on an alluvial fan complex a groundwater host aquifer in which the thickness of the alluvial deposits decreases from the northwest to south of the study area northwest highlands in varamin consist of a sedimentary formation of shale and tuff of karaj formation eocene with moderate to weak permeability and the sandstone marl conglomerate and evaporite of the upper red formation miocene with weak to moderate permeability in addition outcrops of kahrizak and hezardarreh formation conglomerate are present in the northeastern part of the study area in general geological formations in the northern mountainous area do not affect the groundwater quality of the varamin aquifer very much because of the lack of a geological unit containing dissolvable minerals such as halite and gypsum near the recharge area however in the western and southwestern parts of the area the geological units that contain gypsum and marl may affect the groundwater quality through dissolution the varamin aquifer is an unconfined aquifer its highest thickness is 280 m in the center of the north half of the plain and the lowest thickness of the aquifer is 150 m in the southwest part of the plain the main possible recharge sources of the varamin aquifer are precipitation surface streams and wastewater irrigation groundwater is generally situated around 30 170 m under the ground surface the iso potential map of the varamin aquifer indicates the general direction of the groundwater flow is from nw to se fig 3 the pattern of transmissivity is dissimilar in the north half and in the south half of the deep aquifer the maximum transmissivity is estimated to reach 5000 m2 day in the north plain however it decreases toward the south half of the plain because of a significant change in the aquifer thickness or sediment grain size the maximum value of transmissivity in the south half of the aquifer is up to 150 m2 day atarzadeh et al 2014 to clarify the agriculture activities in the study area section the brief information about the area under cultivation annual crop water demands in the irrigation network of varamin and fertilizer consumption for each of crops are presented in table 1 the area under cultivation in varamin plain is about 53 500 ha of which 51 360 ha is area crops are currently cultivated while rest of area 2 140 ha is of arboretum and nursery the main crops of varamin plain are wheat barley forage maize alfalfa vegetable pistachio and grape the agricultural water has been supplied by two main sources groundwater which is about 3 12 108 m3 yr 1 and treated wastewater about 1 16 108 m3 yr 1 from southern tehran the amount of chemical fertilizers used in varamin networks varies for each of crops and are given to crops in two period time by half in the beginning of the grown season and rest of half in the mid grown season of crops based on our knowledge and field surveys in the study area the organic manures are not used for crops the elevated concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater are thought to have several causes such as the mixing of different waters accumulation of wastewater derived nitrogen from tehran city intensive use of fertilizers chemical fertilizers and manure and or leakage of municipal and industrial wastewater within the plain the most important compositions of chemical fertilizer in the varamin plain were found to be urea co nh2 2 ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 diammonium phosphate nh4 2hpo4 triple superphosphate ca h2po4 2 h2o potassium sulfate k2so4 and potassium chloride kcl and their annual applications were 12 31 103 0 11 103 0 21 103 3 27 103 0 67 103 and 0 63 103 tons respectively during the hydrologic year 2016 2017 yargholi et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling in total 76 groundwater samples were collected from 38 representative deep wells in two different seasons november 2016 dry season and february 2017 wet season from an unconfined aquifer the sampling time dry and wet seasons were accordance with the crops growth the dry season sampling was in line with the beginning time of wheat barley and alfalfa in varamin plain cultivation the second sampling times wet season was chosen to be in the mid time of wheat and barley also alfalfa cultivation maize and vegetation do not exist because they are cultivated in summer therefore we have tried to gather the groundwater data in a sensible time water samples for major ion concentrations ca2 mg2 k na nh4 hco3 cl so4 2 no3 no2 stable isotope ratios δ18o h2o and δd h2o for molecular water h2o and isotope ratios δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of nitrate analyses were collected within four days for each sampling campaign all data obtained including field measurements concentrations and isotope ratios are shown in tables 2 and 3 additionally a total of two treated wastewater samples two shour river water samples and two precipitation samples were collected and analyzed for the same parameters as were done for the groundwater samples from both periods analytical results for these comparison samples are shown in table 4 3 2 analytical techniques groundwater samples were collected after the selected wells had been pumped continuously to remove stagnant water and all field parameters had stabilized groundwater ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using portable instruments oxi 3205 set 3 wtw germany the water samples collected for nutrient concentration analyses and nitrate isotope ratios were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters before storing in 50 ml volume polyethylene bottles samples were stored in a freezer with a constant controlled temperature of 15 c until just before use other samples were stored at room temperature ion concentrations except hco3 were measured by ion chromatography 883 basic ic plus ic metrohm switzerland in a laboratory of the water organization of tehran and based on the standard method described in apha 1989 bicarbonate ion concentrations hco3 were determined using the titration method stumm and morgan 2012 all data was re analyzed and its reliability was checked in the hydro environmental laboratory kumamoto university japan using ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the ratios of 2h d 1h 15n 14n and 18o 16o were expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow for hydrogen atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen and the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow for oxygen respectively the stable isotope ratios were expressed in delta δ notation and a per mil unit relative to an international standard 1 δ sample rsample rstandard 1 1000 δd h2o and δ18o h2o were measured using a continuous flow gas ratio mass spectrometer at the kumamoto university delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa the analytical precision of the water isotope measurements was better than 0 05 and 0 5 respectively the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 compositions were determined in the same laboratory at kumamoto university using the same mass spectrometer coupled with a headspace gas sampler gasbench ii thermo fisher scientific usa sample preparation followed the conventional denitrifier method proposed by sigman et al 2001 and casciotti et al 2002 as described in previous works hosono et al 2013 2015 the analytical precision rates for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 based on replicate measurements of standards and samples were better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 hierarchical clustering based on hydrochemical data cluster analysis is a statistical method for grouping data according to their similarity and degree of closeness not only are there several methods of clustering but also hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely used methods in earth sciences and is usually used in the classification of hydrogeochemical data guler et al 2002 suvedha et al 2009 for clustering and placing samples in separate groups methods such as between group linkage within group linkage nearest neighbor furthest neighbor and ward were used to group the groundwater samples ward s method was used guler et al 2002 ward 1963 with this method the combination of each pair of samples may be considered in each step of the analysis and both groups whose integration brought about a lesser increase in the amount of variance fell into one category this pattern was also considered in the next stages of grouping to calculate the similarity coefficient in quantitative traits different methods can be used such as the euclidean distance squared euclidean distance and cosine coefficient the squared euclidean distance method guler et al 2002 was used in this study the advantage this coefficient has is that it can still be used if the data matrix has lost values this coefficient ejk is obtained from the following formula where x ij is the value of the i th character for the j th sample and x ik is the value of the i th character for the k th sample in this study hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis was performed based on the values of ec do no3 nh4 cl so4 2 hco3 k na ca2 mg2 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 at different sampling sites using ward s method ward 1963 with squared euclidean distances as a measure of similarity spatial and statistical analyses were performed with arcgis ver 10 and spss ver 15 respectively 4 results 4 1 water chemistry for groundwater samples tables 2 and 3 ec values varied from 453 to 10 360 μs cm in the dry season and 436 to 10 700 μs cm in the wet season the ph values of groundwater samples ranged from 6 8 to 7 5 mean value of 7 07 0 19 in the dry season and from 6 6 7 9 mean value of 7 2 0 29 in the wet season these variations are not significantly different between the two seasons the do concentrations ranged from 0 4 8 7 and 0 3 7 5 in the dry and wet seasons respectively based on hierarchical clustering analysis the groundwater samples from 38 well stations for both seasons dry and wet seasons were divided into three clusters in terms of hydrochemical characteristics group 1 group 2 and group 3 fig 4 a samples from group 1 45 of the total sample numbers were taken from locations in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the varamin aquifer fig 4b the dominant land use in this area is agricultural irrigated by in situ groundwater and treated wastewater from the southern parts of tehran samples from group 2 29 of total samples were taken from locations in the central part of the aquifer fig 4b where a mixture of land uses residential and agricultural develop fig 2 samples from group 3 26 of total samples were taken from locations in the west and southwest parts of the aquifer these areas are covered mainly by agricultural fields the aquifer waters under these areas are largely recharged by shour river fig 3 which has a seasonal hydrologic regime thus groundwater shows higher seasonal fluctuations than the other areas of the varamin aquifer ionic concentrations were plotted on a piper diagram piper 1944 to evaluate the geochemical characteristics of the sampled groundwater fig 5 groundwaters collected in both november 2016 and february 2017 showed similar patterns predominant water types were ca2 hco3 recharge areas to mg2 ca2 hco3 for group 1 the ca2 hco3 water type represents the pristine groundwater in the study area prasanna et al 2011 for group 2 the samples were characterized as ca2 mg2 hco3 no3 to ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 suggesting the presence of some anthropogenic pollutions municipal and untreated domestic wastewater as well as agricultural runoff can be potential causes of elevated cl and no3 in groundwater the groundwater samples of group 3 were characterized by na mg2 so4 2 cl type water which showed a seasonal fractionation in do value as it tends to decrease in the wet season tables 2 and 3 although there were no significant changes in water types between the two seasons the quality of groundwater is significantly influenced by weathering and anthropogenic inputs vadiati et al 2018 the gibbs diagram is widely used to establish the relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 three distinct fields precipitation dominance evaporation dominance and rock water interaction dominance are shown in the gibbs diagram fig 6 the samples predominantly fell in the rock water interaction dominance and evaporation dominance fields of the gibbs diagram the rock water interaction dominance field indicates the interaction between rock chemistry and the chemistry of the percolation waters under the subsurface fig 6 shows that all samples of group 3 fell into the field of evaporation dominance suggesting that the water chemistry was formed mainly by the contribution of solutes enriched water originating from the dissolution of evaporate minerals in the bedrock or surface soil in an arid environmental in contrast the samples of group 1 and group 2 were plotted in the field of rock weathering suggesting that the chemistry of these waters was created partly by silicate mineral weathering through water rock interaction the concentration of specific nitrogenous species no3 and nh4 can be used to indicate potential environmental problems fewtrell 2004 galloway et al 2004 the no3 concentrations of the groundwater samples in the varamin aquifer ranged from 0 45 79 58 mg l mean value of 21 54 17 13 mg l in the dry season table 2 and from 0 22 74 14 mg l mean value of 21 88 17 3 mg l in the wet season table 3 only 8 samples among the total analyzed samples n 70 exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l therefore the current nitrate concentration was judged to be generally lower than environmental criteria although the trend of increasing concentrations in many water wells threatens the future drinking water supply no3 concentrations remained basically unchanged between water samples collected at high and low water seasons in both seasons no3 concentrations in group 2 were significantly greatest while group 3 displayed the lowest values see fig 7 a for no3 distributions and fig 4b for areal boundaries of each group in general the well depths for group 1 well are deeper than those for the other groups for most samples from groups 1 and 2 no3 concentration generally decrease with depth fig 7b based on previous findings higher concentrations in the shallow aquifer are due to greater impacts of anthropogenically sourced of nitrogen kross et al 1993 musgrove et al 2014 ako et al 2014 in fact shallow groundwaters are more vulnerable to nitrate contamination due to natural n fixing under aerobic conditions no3 concentration in group 3 is lower than the other groups no3 decreasing trend with increasing depth is not clear for these wells nh4 concentrations varied from 0 01 to 1 74 mg l with a mean value of 0 33 0 47 mg l in groundwater samples taken in the dry season and from 0 02 to 1 51 mg l with a mean value of 0 37 0 46 mg l in the wet seasons tables 2 and 3 concentrations of nh4 tended to be greatest in group 3 consequently nitrate was identified as a major water pollutant in the study area it is critical to understand the dynamics of no3 through further analyses of spatial distribution and nitrate sources hydrochemical characterization by conventional classification using piper plots and gibbs diagram and nutrient analysis corresponds well to results from statistical classification using hierarchical cluster analysis suggesting combination of these methods is efficient to describe spatial hydrochemical variability in the studied field 4 2 isotopic compositions of nitrate ion the δ15n no3 values in the varamin aquifer ranged from 4 2 to 19 2 with a mean value of 10 2 4 1 for the dry season and 6 6 to 23 1 with a mean value of 13 3 5 1 for the wet season the mean δ18o no3 values for the dry and wet seasons were 2 8 2 6 ranging from 0 6 to 8 2 and 3 9 3 1 ranging from 0 3 to 10 4 respectively the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the groundwater samples were generally higher in the wet season than in the dry season fig 8 during the sampling periods the mean values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in group 1 were 7 0 2 1 ranging from 4 2 to 13 1 and 2 3 1 9 ranging from 0 4 to 7 3 respectively for the dry season and 9 7 2 4 ranging from 6 6 to 13 4 and 3 1 2 1 ranging from 0 3 to 8 1 respectively for the wet season tables 2 and 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the groundwater in group 2 were in the range of 8 5 to 12 1 mean value of 10 2 1 1 and 0 6 to 1 9 mean value of 0 6 0 8 in the dry season and 7 4 to 14 4 mean value of 11 7 1 8 and 0 3 to 3 3 mean value of 1 5 0 9 in the wet season in samples from group 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for the dry season averaged 16 1 2 1 ranging from 12 8 to 19 2 and 6 2 1 4 ranging from 3 6 to 8 2 respectively and for the wet season they averaged 20 7 2 4 ranging from 15 5 to 23 1 and 8 1 1 6 ranging from 5 1 to 10 4 respectively consequently the groundwaters of group 1 showed the lowest δ15n no3 and intermediate δ18o no3 compositions while those of group 2 showed the intermediate δ15n no3 and the lowest δ18o no3 compositions the groundwaters of group 3 had the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 compositions among the collected samples figs 8b and 9 4 3 isotopic composition of molecular water using 12 collected precipitation samples the local meteoric water line for varamin vmwl was established and compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl of δd 8 1δ18o 10 8 craig 1961 and eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl of δd 8δ18o 22 gat and carmi 1970 fig 10 the vmwl δd 6 6 δ18o 4 7 was first developed in the study area and it shows almost the same slope as previously identified by the tehran meteoric water line tmwl δd 6 5δ18o 1 6 mosaffa et al 2015 fig 10 as shown in tables 2 and 3 δd h2o values of the groundwater samples ranged from 58 to 45 6 with a mean value of 53 3 2 8 for the dry season and 58 8 to 46 8 with a mean value of 54 8 2 3 for the wet season the δ18o h2o compositions of groundwater varied from 9 36 to 6 17 with a mean value of 8 21 0 71 for the dry season and 9 30 to 7 57 with a mean value of 8 72 0 37 for the wet season the δ18o h2o and δd h2o compositions of surface and groundwater were used to examine their interactions rodgers et al 2004 petelet giraud et al 2007 einsiedl 2012 cook 2013 the slope of the regression line between the δ18o h2o and δd h2o compositions in precipitation could generally differ depending on the local climatic conditions hoefs 2009 the groundwater samples were generally plotted along vmwl and between global and eastern mediterranean meteoric water lines fig 10 most of the groundwater samples are plotted on fig 10 along the vmwl and show more depleted isotopic compositions compared to those of river water and treated wastewater however some groundwater samples tend to be plotted in a more isotopically enriched area than vmml fig 10 indicating the occurrence of evaporation this means that local precipitation after evaporation is the main source of groundwater in the study area contributions from surface runoff and leakage of treated wastewater would not be neglected as some of groundwater samples show similar isotopic compositions to their compositions fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 nitrification and denitrification processes except sources heterogeneity nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification affect the composition of the isotope ratios of nitrate in aquatic systems kendall et al 1998 the δ18o no3 values of all collected groundwater samples from the study area ranged from 0 6 to 10 4 figs 8 and 9 the values obtained for the δ18o no3 of precipitation in the study area averaged 62 46 n 2 which is consistent with previous studies showing the δ18o no3 values of precipitation being generally above 60 kendall et al 2007 fig 8 chemical nitrate fertilizers typically have δ18o no3 values around 23 5 which is near that of atmospheric oxygen amberger and schmidt 1987 xue et al 2009 these sources had considerably higher δ18o no3 values than those of the water samples from the varamin aquifer fig 8 the decline in δ18o no3 values in groundwater samples might be explained by isotopic fractionations during microbial mediated nitrogen cycling before reaching catchment waters in theory the produced nitrate ion of no3 formed during nitriﬁcation in the surface aerobic environment contains two thirds water oxygen of ambient water and one third atmospheric oxygen δ18o 23 5 andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 yoshinari and wahlen 1985 if oxygen in dissolved no3 was formed according to this theory without isotope fractionation due to the denitrification and dissolution of nitrate compounds the δ18o no3 values of groundwater can be calculated with the following equation 4 δ18o no3 2 3δ18o h2o 1 3 δ18o o2 where δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 represent water oxygen isotope ratios of contacted water collected groundwater samples and atmospheric oxygen in ambient atmosphere applied value of 23 5 wexler et al 2011 in fig 11 the calculated oxygen isotopic compositions for most samples from groups 1 and 2 in both seasons were plotted on the near field of the theoretical line eq 4 which indicates that nitrification is the main process forming dissolved nitrate in this area however some samples showed δ18o no3 values slightly lower than the theoretical line fig 11 the possibility of the exchange of oxygen atoms between nitrite and water that could produce nitrate oxygen isotope ratios lower than theoretical values has recently been discussed kool et al 2011 wexler et al 2012 and this might explain why the calculated δ18o no3 values were slightly reduced for some of the groundwater samples from groups 1 and 2 in contrast all samples in group 3 and some samples in group 1 showed calculated δ18o no3 values higher than theoretical values in both seasons which may be caused by denitrification process and or source contribution of nitrate compounds kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2014 denitrification is the microbial process occurring in soil or aquatic environments that reduces nitrate to gaseous forms of nitrogen largely nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas depending on the reaction rate temperature and substrate concentrations this process can lead to isotopic fractionation of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate kendall et al 2007 vavilin and rytov 2015 this process causes an increase of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the residual nitrate by means of isotopic fractionation e g kendall 1998 with a εn εo ratio that ranges from 1 3 fukada et al 2003 to 2 1 böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 in groundwater where ε is the isotopic fractionation all samples in group 3 are plotted between calculated denitrification lines from cey et al 1999 with εn εo 1 7 and aravena and robertson 1998 with εn εo 2 1 fig 8a for collected samples values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 tended to be linearly correlated in both season fig 8a this reaction has been commonly observed under anaerobic environments typically do 0 5 2 0 mg l pina ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 golterman 2007 measured do concentrations were below these values corresponding to findings from isotopic analysis for groundwater samples from groups 1 and 2 no positive relationships between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for either dry or wet seasons were observed fig 8 in contrast in the same diagram the plots for most groundwater samples from group 3 lie on the trend array for the case that denitrification reaction occurs regardless of the season figs 8 11 and 12 in addition the δ15n no3 values for group 3 water samples tend to increase with a decrease in nitrate concentration fig 12 therefore with the evidence of their low do values tables 2 and 3 0 4 1 4 mg l for the dry season and 0 3 1 2 mg l for the wet season it is suggested that the isotopic compositions of nitrate for these samples were fractionated during the denitrification process resulting in the attenuation of nitrate contamination with relatively low nitrate concentration figs 7 and 12 similar to the scenario identified in other fields ohte et al 2010 baily et al 2011 hosono et al 2011 li et al 2013 clague et al 2015 puig et al 2017 li et al 2018 this process was more intense in the wet season probably because of enhanced stagnant water infiltration in around the shour river riverbed somewhat elevated δ18o no3 values for some samples from group 1 fig 11 did not link with an elevation of δ15n no3 fig 8 suggesting the contribution of nitrate compounds with high δ18o signature for these groundwaters the linear correlations of δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values with the natural logarithm of nitrate concentrations fig 13 for november 2016 and february 2018 corroborate the applicability of the classical rayleigh equation to denitrification process in this study this equation describes that during denitrification the isotopic values of the residual nitrate increases in proportion to the logarithm of the residual nitrate fraction which can be expressed as kendall 1998 5 δr δr0 εln f where δr is the δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 value of the reactant nitrate at time t δr0 is the initial δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 value of the nitrate f is the remaining fraction of the nitrate and ε is the enrichment factor as can see in fig 13 ε values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in group 3 are estimated to be 5 8 and 2 2 in dry season and 4 2 and 2 9 in wet season respectively samples of this group are located in the transition zone between shour river and their riparian aquifer where river water and groundwater interact riparian zones that link the terrestrial and the aquatic environment have been shown to have a significant potential for the natural attenuation of no3 pollution and to function as a no3 buffer zone along rivers in these areas converging flow paths in the discharge zone the mixing of water with different no3 loads mengis et al 1999 anoxic conditions and soil rich in organic matter provide optimal conditions for the occurrence of denitrification hill 1996 puckett 2004 ranalli and macalady 2010 therefore this zone may play an important role in mediating nitrate exports as it can facilitate intensive denitrification which permanently removes nitrate from the aquatic system factors affecting denitrification during infiltration of river water consist on the effect of different hydrogeological settings and land use patterns clément et al 2003 devito et al 2000 peter et al 2012 vidon and hill 2004 on the implications of seasonal changes in temperature and hydrology cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 grischek et al 1998 pfenning and mcmahon 1997 and availability of electron donors carbon source and acceptors no3 hedin et al 1998 ostrom et al 2002 close to the river groundwater hydraulics and hydrochemistry are strongly affected by river water infiltration here consumption of do and the enrichment of δ15n and δ18o of the no3 molecule provide evidence for the occurrence of denitrification especially during february 2017 these high river water fractions occur at locations where river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer which presumably is a key driver for the supply of bioavailable carbon fueling microbial activity in these area hydrological factors that have been linked to an increased mobilization of carbon sources e g during high river discharges or high groundwater levels can play an important role for both consumption of do and denitrification especially february 2017 5 2 identification of nitrate sources and behaviors using dual isotopes of nitrate and water chemistry nitrate contamination source identification using δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 plot diagram fig 8 has been applied in many studies aravena and robertson 1998 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 umezawa et al 2008 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2011 2013 urresti estala et al 2015 xu et al 2016 puig et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however the use of this method has limitations especially in cases where sampled waters are plotted on a compositional field where compositions of possible source materials and or denitrification signals are overlapping e g mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2013 chen et al 2014 bu et al 2017 the combined use of hydrochemical data together with isotopic data would be effective for identifying the source of nitrate contamination in particular the approach of dual isotope ratios of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in combination with the molar ratio of no3 cl figs 8 and 13 can be used to distinguish more strictly the waters affected by denitrification because cl behaves as conservative ions in water while no3 concentrations decline with the denitrification process in general the amount of nitrogen leaching to groundwater increase by crops such as maize and vegetation that need more fertilizers wheat and barley need moderate fertilizers alfalfa is the lowest amount of fertilizer need about 100 kg ha 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in group 1 water samples fell closer ranges representing chemical fertilizers in the dry season and chemical fertilizers soil n and manure sewage in the wet season fig 14 most samples from group 1 revealed a moderate no3 cl ratio with δ15n no3 values lower than 8 especially in dry seasons fig 14 the groundwater samples are characterized by do concentration values 4 5 mg l and thus the denitrification effect might be neglected together with land use information the main source could be considered to be chemical fertilizers both ammonium fertilizer and no3 fertilizer and sewage water used for irrigation however some samples in areas where livestock farms are distributed g29 and g37 the δ15n no3 values of groundwater were greater than 10 probably due to contributions of manure from the farms most samples from group 2 revealed high no3 cl molar ratios with δ15n no3 values greater than 8 indicating that no3 was influenced directly by sewage fig 14 actually it has been suggested that the nitrogen isotope ratio of nitrate in animal manure and sewage is usually enriched with heavy isotope within the range of 8 and 25 kendall et al 2007 widory et al 2013 as mentioned previously the denitrification effect was not significant in this area figs 12 and 13 this group was characterized by a high proportion of residential areas without enough implementation of the sewage pipe system therefore a high concentration of nitrate in the central part of the varamin plain must be attributed to the seeping of septic wastes from the city with the probable additional input from treated water used for irrigation and manure group 3 samples had the lowest no3 and do concentrations and tended to have higher isotopic compositions all samples in this group which constituted aquifer waters interacting with shour river water revealed low no3 cl molar ratios with δ15n no3 values greater than 15 fig 14 suggesting that denitrification caused the decreasing nitrate concentrations the land uses in the area of this group consist mainly of agricultural irrigated with water from wells and shour river and partly of residential activities the original isotopic compositions of waters from this area before denitrification can be regarded as those of chemical fertilizers and sewage water by way of water infiltration from the shour river the results showed that the nitrate concentration in the area is more affected by different pollutant sources in the study area the downward flowing groundwater from the recharge area generally displayed a clear tendency to increased no3 concentration with an increase in δ15n no3 in urbanized areas due to the leakage of municipal wastes in the western and southwestern regions pre existing nitrate transported from upgrading areas and infiltered nitrogen contaminants from the shour river have reduced the no3 concentration with a very sudden depression of do and a major increase in δ15n no3 showing clear evidence for the drastic progress of the denitrification reaction this research is important in that the groundwater environments are examined in an area where treated wastewater reuse projects in arid areas with persistent water scarcity have implemented as a potentially nonconventional resource to satisfy the increasing water demand our observations using isotope ratios suggest a potential impact of the wastewaters on groundwater qualities although the nitrate concentration in the samples collected are not greater than 30 mg l the treated wastewater should be monitored including these components for further investigation since urban wastewaters could contain some harmful materials of anthropogenic origins finally multiple cumulative environmental exposures affecting populations in wastewater use areas such as water and sanitation access must be comprehensively examined 6 conclusions in this study the varamin aquifer located in southeastern tehran iran was chosen for study with the aim of ascertaining the sources of nitrate pollution and nitrogen transformation processes in groundwaters in an area where treated wastewaters are used for irrigation purposes stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o in groundwater samples taken from two periods in november 2016 dry season and february 2017 wet season were analyzed in addition the hierarchical clustering analysis method was applied to classify groundwater samples from 38 water wells into three clusters groups 1 3 in terms of hydrochemical characteristics the main sources of the nitrate contamination in group 1 groundwaters could be derived from chemical fertilizers and treated wastewaters used for irrigation the sources of nitrate contamination in group 2 waters are likely to originate from domestic waste from residential areas the main sources of nitrate in the waters of group 3 could be attributed to chemical fertilizers and sewage waters through recharges from the shour river denitrification occurs mainly in the west and southwest group 3 the concentrations of nitrate were the highest 60 mg l in residential areas within the studied watershed area the current results show that the groundwater quality in agricultural areas is affected by irrigation activities using treated wastewaters the nitrate concentrations of these groundwaters are not greater than 30 mg l in this area even though the current contamination levels are not critical it is proposed that the effects of treated wastewaters should continuously be assessed for nitrates and other parameters such as organic chemical compounds and microbiological facies because the concentrations of these elements from treated wastewater are important environmental issues affecting the quality of food products and the health of water consumers in addition isotopic fingerprinting for tracing the effects of treated wastewaters could be improved if different isotopic tracers such as δ11b δ13c and δ34s and other tracers could be incorporated in future work widory

11010,nitrate contamination of groundwater has been identified as a major environmental problem of the last few decades in this study stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o of groundwater samples from the varamin aquifer located southeast of tehran iran were analyzed in two periods in order to determine the sources of nitrate pollution and nitrogen transformation processes where treated wastewater from the capital city is used for irrigation purpose the approach in this study was based on isotopic fingerprinting of nitrate contaminant sources of groundwater using δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in addition a hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to classify groundwater samples into three different hydrochemical facieses groups 1 3 furthermore the stable isotope ratios of molecular water showed that most of the groundwater samples were plotted along the local meteoric line and distinguishable isotopic compositions from those of river water and treated wastewater stable isotopic analysis together with these hydrochemical classifications suggested that the main sources of nitrate in groundwater are chemical fertilizers and treated wastewater in the irrigated area group 1 in addition to domestic wastes in the residential area group 2 and chemical fertilizers and sewage water recharged by the shour river group 3 denitrification is a major transformation process occurring at the western and southwestern parts of the aquifer seasonal variations in the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of nitrate were more obvious in the wet season compared to the dry season this study is unique in that it describes how groundwater nitrate contamination is enhanced in the area using treated wastewater for irrigation purposes the results of the current study are applicable for other areas with similar settings since treated wastewaters are important water resources for water users in arid to semi arid regions all over the world keywords groundwater nitrate contamination stable isotope ratios denitrification cluster analysis 1 introduction nitrate pollution in groundwater resources is a persistent problem that is typically caused by non point source nitrogen loads from a variety of land uses identifying the sources of dissolved nitrate and its behavior along water flows is therefore the first step in reducing the nitrate pollution of groundwater groundwater nitrate can be initiated by a natural or anthropogenic origin the concentration of naturally occurring no3 n does not usually exceed concentrations of 3 mg l in aquatic environments burkart and kolpin 1993 except in areas with high geological impact sources lowe and wallace 2001 min et al 2003 stadler et al 2008 higher concentrations of no3 n in groundwater are typically caused by anthropogenic activities including the use of nitrogen compounds in synthetic fertilizers and or manure in agriculture leakage from septic systems and other wastewaters mclay et al 2001 widory et al 2005 kendall et al 2007 heaton et al 2012 wang et al 2013 ma et al 2015 in drinking water a high concentration of no3 n 10 mg l may result in blue baby syndrome in infants methemoglobinemia and may be a contributing factor for some types of cancers who 2004 galloway et al 2008 ward et al 2010 pastén zapata et al 2014 xue et al 2016 nikolenko et al 2018 in fact groundwater is often a major source of water for drinking purposes and thus the cause and fate of nitrate contamination should be examined properly in addition to regular monitoring for nitrate concentrations in the water the occurrence of nitrate in groundwater may be considerably affected by temporal variations depending on precipitation hydrogeological conditions and land use menció et al 2011 álvarez cabria et al 2016 epelde et al 2016 exner kittridge et al 2016 observations on the linkage between land uses with different anthropogenic activities and intensities in nitrate contamination of the groundwater mclay et al 2001 kaown et al 2007 pastén zapata et al 2014 suggest the usefulness of land use information in examining the anthropogenic impacts of source regions however it may be difficult to distinguish the type of fertilizers manure vs inorganic fertilizers that particularly affect the observed nitrate contamination using land information only zhang et al 1996 to overcome this problem many investigations have used stable isotope analysis to identify the origins of the nitrate li et al 2007 barnes and raymond 2010 jin et al 2015 sun et al 2011 vrzel et al 2016 dual nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate are valuable fingerprinting tools used especially to identify predominant sources of nitrate contamination and its attenuation processes in aquifers böttcher et al 1990 wassenaar 1995 aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 umezawa et al 2008 otero et al 2009 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2011 urresti estala et al 2015 xu et al 2016 puig et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 biddau et al 2019 taufiq et al 2019 in some cases however the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of nitrate overlap among the different source materials and or between source signatures and process signals chang et al 2003 itoh et al 2011 jin et al 2012 vidal gavilan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 vavilin and rytov 2015 this drawback may be addressed by combining the n and o isotopic data with hydrochemical data widory et al 2013 chen et al 2014 dun et al 2014 urresti estala et al 2015 ma et al 2016 biddau et al 2019 assessing groundwater nitrate pollution in semi arid regions faces spatial complexity to overcome this issue stadler et al 2008 applied a multidisciplinary approach investigating known potential sources and aquifer immanent sinks of nitrate groundwater recharge processes in semi arid areas are highly complex in these environments solutes may be carried into the groundwater under present day climatic and hydrologic conditions during active recharge but the transport of water through the saturated zone is considerably slow de vries and simmers 2002 some authors believe that leaching is negligible as n sink in soils in these areas e g boring et al 1988 peterjohn and schlesinger 1990 while other researchers suggest that substantial quantities of nitrogen have leached and accumulated below the soil cover zone jackson et al 2002 2004 the elevated nitrate concentrations found in the groundwater of semi arid regions are explained by the interaction of numerous factors for example in barely inhabited semi arid regions it is assumed that causes of increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater have indirect anthropogenic influences such as land use for cattle grazing manure laftouhi et al 2003 which is a common practice in these regions non anthropogenic reasons are mostly related to the evaporative enrichment of dry and wet depositions biogenic point sources through n fixing organisms or to a geogenic origin stadler et al 2008 in recent years elevated nitrate concentrations have also been recorded in the groundwater of mostly uninhabited regions around the world especially in semi arid settings the isotopic composition of nitrate is a useful indicator of the sources of nitrogen to groundwater in this area stadler et al 2008 2012 jackson et al 2015 awaleh et al 2017 the present study reports the first results of nitrate isotopes of groundwater from a semi arid environment located in iran the study area varamin plain is located in north central iran fig 1 and is an intensively agricultural region with over 40 years of irrigation history irrigation water is supplied mainly from groundwater and treated wastewater from southern parts of the capital city tehran see study area the overexploitation of water resources a succession of drought years and several sources of pollution constitute major challenges for compatibility between securing the existing activity and safeguarding the groundwater in order to cope with water scarcity and attenuate the impacts on groundwater policy makers encourage the reuse of treated wastewater as a substitute resource for agricultural practices the groundwater in this area is an important source of drinking water for the citizens of varamin city this study aimed to identify the pollution sources and transformations of nitrate from groundwaters in the varamin aquifer the environmental isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o were used simultaneously with hydrochemical hydrogeological and land use data to achieve a better understanding of the sources and processes affecting groundwater nitrate concentrations in the varamin aquifer the novelty of this study is the examination of the effect of treated wastewater used for irrigation to enhance groundwater nitrate contamination the results of this study are important as the basis for designing treatment methods for polluted groundwater in the study areas as well as other arid and semi arid regions applying the same water management style 2 study area the varamin plain 971 km2 is located in the eastern part of tehran iran fig 1 and is surrounded by the tehran karaj plain to the west and northwest the changi mountain to the north 2310 m and pishva mountain to the east 972 m the altitude of this area tends to decrease from north 1148 m to southeast 810 m according to the national population and housing census in 2011 there are 990 447 inhabitants within the area the mean annual temperature and precipitation in the plain are about 16 4 c and 187 4 mm respectively varamin station 2016 2017 trwa 2018 therefore this region is classified as an arid area according to the emberger method emberger 1930 the distribution of precipitation is irregular and more than 70 of the rainfall events occur during january to april idwrm 2017 the main river in the study area the jajrood river originates from a northern mountainous area fig 1 the river flows southward and supplies agricultural water currently mamlou dam is being constructed to provide a small portion of tehran s drinking water supply thus some of the surface flow is present only in the spring and summer seasons furthermore the kan river and surface wastewater from the sorkhehesar river originating from tehran city flow into the shour river in the west northwest part of the varamin plain fig 2 the chief land uses of the varamin plain are agricultural 76 27 of the total area fig 2 followed by residential 10 83 the income and sustenance of the people in this area depend on agricultural activities in this area groundwater provides drinking water 8 29 107 m3 yr 1 and industrial water 2 18 107 m3 yr 1 as well as a portion of the water used for agricultural activities 3 12 108 m3 yr 1 because of severe urbanization and industrialization as well as agricultural development the pumping rate has recently increased dramatically the increasing water demands combined with climatological impacts such as droughts have led to the continuous decrease of the groundwater table 2 5 m per year during the last five years idwrm 2017 the remaining portion of the agricultural water has been supplied by treated wastewater from southern tehran since 2004 1 16 108 m3 yr 1 and the wastewater irrigation still is going on the treated wastewater is transferred from the southern tehran wastewater refinery to the chahgah station and then it enters the varamin channel for irrigation fig 2 geological outcrops in the area fig 3 consist of a variety of formations mostly sandstone shale marl and a conglomerate of the eocene to the quaternary ages comprising the hydrogeological basement of this area most of the varamin plain lies on an alluvial fan complex a groundwater host aquifer in which the thickness of the alluvial deposits decreases from the northwest to south of the study area northwest highlands in varamin consist of a sedimentary formation of shale and tuff of karaj formation eocene with moderate to weak permeability and the sandstone marl conglomerate and evaporite of the upper red formation miocene with weak to moderate permeability in addition outcrops of kahrizak and hezardarreh formation conglomerate are present in the northeastern part of the study area in general geological formations in the northern mountainous area do not affect the groundwater quality of the varamin aquifer very much because of the lack of a geological unit containing dissolvable minerals such as halite and gypsum near the recharge area however in the western and southwestern parts of the area the geological units that contain gypsum and marl may affect the groundwater quality through dissolution the varamin aquifer is an unconfined aquifer its highest thickness is 280 m in the center of the north half of the plain and the lowest thickness of the aquifer is 150 m in the southwest part of the plain the main possible recharge sources of the varamin aquifer are precipitation surface streams and wastewater irrigation groundwater is generally situated around 30 170 m under the ground surface the iso potential map of the varamin aquifer indicates the general direction of the groundwater flow is from nw to se fig 3 the pattern of transmissivity is dissimilar in the north half and in the south half of the deep aquifer the maximum transmissivity is estimated to reach 5000 m2 day in the north plain however it decreases toward the south half of the plain because of a significant change in the aquifer thickness or sediment grain size the maximum value of transmissivity in the south half of the aquifer is up to 150 m2 day atarzadeh et al 2014 to clarify the agriculture activities in the study area section the brief information about the area under cultivation annual crop water demands in the irrigation network of varamin and fertilizer consumption for each of crops are presented in table 1 the area under cultivation in varamin plain is about 53 500 ha of which 51 360 ha is area crops are currently cultivated while rest of area 2 140 ha is of arboretum and nursery the main crops of varamin plain are wheat barley forage maize alfalfa vegetable pistachio and grape the agricultural water has been supplied by two main sources groundwater which is about 3 12 108 m3 yr 1 and treated wastewater about 1 16 108 m3 yr 1 from southern tehran the amount of chemical fertilizers used in varamin networks varies for each of crops and are given to crops in two period time by half in the beginning of the grown season and rest of half in the mid grown season of crops based on our knowledge and field surveys in the study area the organic manures are not used for crops the elevated concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater are thought to have several causes such as the mixing of different waters accumulation of wastewater derived nitrogen from tehran city intensive use of fertilizers chemical fertilizers and manure and or leakage of municipal and industrial wastewater within the plain the most important compositions of chemical fertilizer in the varamin plain were found to be urea co nh2 2 ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 diammonium phosphate nh4 2hpo4 triple superphosphate ca h2po4 2 h2o potassium sulfate k2so4 and potassium chloride kcl and their annual applications were 12 31 103 0 11 103 0 21 103 3 27 103 0 67 103 and 0 63 103 tons respectively during the hydrologic year 2016 2017 yargholi et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling in total 76 groundwater samples were collected from 38 representative deep wells in two different seasons november 2016 dry season and february 2017 wet season from an unconfined aquifer the sampling time dry and wet seasons were accordance with the crops growth the dry season sampling was in line with the beginning time of wheat barley and alfalfa in varamin plain cultivation the second sampling times wet season was chosen to be in the mid time of wheat and barley also alfalfa cultivation maize and vegetation do not exist because they are cultivated in summer therefore we have tried to gather the groundwater data in a sensible time water samples for major ion concentrations ca2 mg2 k na nh4 hco3 cl so4 2 no3 no2 stable isotope ratios δ18o h2o and δd h2o for molecular water h2o and isotope ratios δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of nitrate analyses were collected within four days for each sampling campaign all data obtained including field measurements concentrations and isotope ratios are shown in tables 2 and 3 additionally a total of two treated wastewater samples two shour river water samples and two precipitation samples were collected and analyzed for the same parameters as were done for the groundwater samples from both periods analytical results for these comparison samples are shown in table 4 3 2 analytical techniques groundwater samples were collected after the selected wells had been pumped continuously to remove stagnant water and all field parameters had stabilized groundwater ph temperature dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using portable instruments oxi 3205 set 3 wtw germany the water samples collected for nutrient concentration analyses and nitrate isotope ratios were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters before storing in 50 ml volume polyethylene bottles samples were stored in a freezer with a constant controlled temperature of 15 c until just before use other samples were stored at room temperature ion concentrations except hco3 were measured by ion chromatography 883 basic ic plus ic metrohm switzerland in a laboratory of the water organization of tehran and based on the standard method described in apha 1989 bicarbonate ion concentrations hco3 were determined using the titration method stumm and morgan 2012 all data was re analyzed and its reliability was checked in the hydro environmental laboratory kumamoto university japan using ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm switzerland the ratios of 2h d 1h 15n 14n and 18o 16o were expressed relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow for hydrogen atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen and the vienna standard mean

h2o and δ18o h2o were measured using a continuous flow gas ratio mass spectrometer at the kumamoto university delta v advantage thermo fisher scientific usa the analytical precision of the water isotope measurements was better than 0 05 and 0 5 respectively the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 compositions were determined in the same laboratory at kumamoto university using the same mass spectrometer coupled with a headspace gas sampler gasbench ii thermo fisher scientific usa sample preparation followed the conventional denitrifier method proposed by sigman et al 2001 and casciotti et al 2002 as described in previous works hosono et al 2013 2015 the analytical precision rates for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 based on replicate measurements of standards and samples were better than 0 2 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 hierarchical clustering based on hydrochemical data cluster analysis is a statistical method for grouping data according to their similarity and degree of closeness not only are there several methods of clustering but also hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely used methods in earth sciences and is usually used in the classification of hydrogeochemical data guler et al 2002 suvedha et al 2009 for clustering and placing samples in separate groups methods such as between group linkage within group linkage nearest neighbor furthest neighbor and ward were used to group the groundwater samples ward s method was used guler et al 2002 ward 1963 with this method the combination of each pair of samples may be considered in each step of the analysis and both groups whose integration brought about a lesser increase in the amount of variance fell into one category this pattern was also considered in the next stages of grouping to calculate the similarity coefficient in quantitative traits different methods can be used such as the euclidean distance squared euclidean distance and cosine coefficient the squared euclidean distance method guler et al 2002 was used in this study the advantage this coefficient has is that it can still be used if the data matrix has lost values this coefficient ejk is obtained from the following formula where x ij is the value of the i th character for the j th sample and x ik is the value of the i th character for the k th sample in this study hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis was performed based on the values of ec do no3 nh4 cl so4 2 hco3 k na ca2 mg2 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 at different sampling sites using ward s method ward 1963 with squared euclidean distances as a measure of similarity spatial and statistical analyses were performed with arcgis ver 10 and spss ver 15 respectively 4 results 4 1 water chemistry for groundwater samples tables 2 and 3 ec values varied from 453 to 10 360 μs cm in the dry season and 436 to 10 700 μs cm in the wet season the ph values of groundwater samples ranged from 6 8 to 7 5 mean value of 7 07 0 19 in the dry season and from 6 6 7 9 mean value of 7 2 0 29 in the wet season these variations are not significantly different between the two seasons the do concentrations ranged from 0 4 8 7 and 0 3 7 5 in the dry and wet seasons respectively based on hierarchical clustering analysis the groundwater samples from 38 well stations for both seasons dry and wet seasons were divided into three clusters in terms of hydrochemical characteristics group 1 group 2 and group 3 fig 4 a samples from group 1 45 of the total sample numbers were taken from locations in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the varamin aquifer fig 4b the dominant land use in this area is agricultural irrigated by in situ groundwater and treated wastewater from the southern parts of tehran samples from group 2 29 of total samples were taken from locations in the central part of the aquifer fig 4b where a mixture of land uses residential and agricultural develop fig 2 samples from group 3 26 of total samples were taken from locations in the west and southwest parts of the aquifer these areas are covered mainly by agricultural fields the aquifer waters under these areas are largely recharged by shour river fig 3 which has a seasonal hydrologic regime thus groundwater shows higher seasonal fluctuations than the other areas of the varamin aquifer ionic concentrations were plotted on a piper diagram piper 1944 to evaluate the geochemical characteristics of the sampled groundwater fig 5 groundwaters collected in both november 2016 and february 2017 showed similar patterns predominant water types were ca2 hco3 recharge areas to mg2 ca2 hco3 for group 1 the ca2 hco3 water type represents the pristine groundwater in the study area prasanna et al 2011 for group 2 the samples were characterized as ca2 mg2 hco3 no3 to ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 suggesting the presence of some anthropogenic pollutions municipal and untreated domestic wastewater as well as agricultural runoff can be potential causes of elevated cl and no3 in groundwater the groundwater samples of group 3 were characterized by na mg2 so4 2 cl type water which showed a seasonal fractionation in do value as it tends to decrease in the wet season tables 2 and 3 although there were no significant changes in water types between the two seasons the quality of groundwater is significantly influenced by weathering and anthropogenic inputs vadiati et al 2018 the gibbs diagram is widely used to establish the relationship between water composition and aquifer lithological characteristics gibbs 1970 three distinct fields precipitation dominance evaporation dominance and rock water interaction dominance are shown in the gibbs diagram fig 6 the samples predominantly fell in the rock water interaction dominance and evaporation dominance fields of the gibbs diagram the rock water interaction dominance field indicates the interaction between rock chemistry and the chemistry of the percolation waters under the subsurface fig 6 shows that all samples of group 3 fell into the field of evaporation dominance suggesting that the water chemistry was formed mainly by the contribution of solutes enriched water originating from the dissolution of evaporate minerals in the bedrock or surface soil in an arid environmental in contrast the samples of group 1 and group 2 were plotted in the field of rock weathering suggesting that the chemistry of these waters was created partly by silicate mineral weathering through water rock interaction the concentration of specific nitrogenous species no3 and nh4 can be used to indicate potential environmental problems fewtrell 2004 galloway et al 2004 the no3 concentrations of the groundwater samples in the varamin aquifer ranged from 0 45 79 58 mg l mean value of 21 54 17 13 mg l in the dry season table 2 and from 0 22 74 14 mg l mean value of 21 88 17 3 mg l in the wet season table 3 only 8 samples among the total analyzed samples n 70 exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l therefore the current nitrate concentration was judged to be generally lower than environmental criteria although the trend of increasing concentrations in many water wells threatens the future drinking water supply no3 concentrations remained basically unchanged between water samples collected at high and low water seasons in both seasons no3 concentrations in group 2 were significantly greatest while group 3 displayed the lowest values see fig 7 a for no3 distributions and fig 4b for areal boundaries of each group in general the well depths for group 1 well are deeper than those for the other groups for most samples from groups 1 and 2 no3 concentration generally decrease with depth fig 7b based on previous findings higher concentrations in the shallow aquifer are due to greater impacts of anthropogenically sourced of nitrogen kross et al 1993 musgrove et al 2014 ako et al 2014 in fact shallow groundwaters are more vulnerable to nitrate contamination due to natural n fixing under aerobic conditions no3 concentration in group 3 is lower than the other groups no3 decreasing trend with increasing depth is not clear for these wells nh4 concentrations varied from 0 01 to 1 74 mg l with a mean value of 0 33 0 47 mg l in groundwater samples taken in the dry season and from 0 02 to 1 51 mg l with a mean value of 0 37 0 46 mg l in the wet seasons tables 2 and 3 concentrations of nh4 tended to be greatest in group 3 consequently nitrate was identified as a major water pollutant in the study area it is critical to understand the dynamics of no3 through further analyses of spatial distribution and nitrate sources hydrochemical characterization by conventional classification using piper plots and gibbs diagram and nutrient analysis corresponds well to results from statistical classification using hierarchical cluster analysis suggesting combination of these methods is efficient to describe spatial hydrochemical variability in the studied field 4 2 isotopic compositions of nitrate ion the δ15n no3 values in the varamin aquifer ranged from 4 2 to 19 2 with a mean value of 10 2 4 1 for the dry season and 6 6 to 23 1 with a mean value of 13 3 5 1 for the wet season the mean δ18o no3 values for the dry and wet seasons were 2 8 2 6 ranging from 0 6 to 8 2 and 3 9 3 1 ranging from 0 3 to 10 4 respectively the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the groundwater samples were generally higher in the wet season than in the dry season fig 8 during the sampling periods the mean values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in group 1 were 7 0 2 1 ranging from 4 2 to 13 1 and 2 3 1 9 ranging from 0 4 to 7 3 respectively for the dry season and 9 7 2 4 ranging from 6 6 to 13 4 and 3 1 2 1 ranging from 0 3 to 8 1 respectively for the wet season tables 2 and 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the groundwater in group 2 were in the range of 8 5 to 12 1 mean value of 10 2 1 1 and 0 6 to 1 9 mean value of 0 6 0 8 in the dry season and 7 4 to 14 4 mean value of 11 7 1 8 and 0 3 to 3 3 mean value of 1 5 0 9 in the wet season in samples from group 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for the dry season averaged 16 1 2 1 ranging from 12 8 to 19 2 and 6 2 1 4 ranging from 3 6 to 8 2 respectively and for the wet season they averaged 20 7 2 4 ranging from 15 5 to 23 1 and 8 1 1 6 ranging from 5 1 to 10 4 respectively consequently the groundwaters of group 1 showed the lowest δ15n no3 and intermediate δ18o no3 compositions while those of group 2 showed the intermediate δ15n no3 and the lowest δ18o no3 compositions the groundwaters of group 3 had the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 compositions among the collected samples figs 8b and 9 4 3 isotopic composition of molecular water using 12 collected precipitation samples the local meteoric water line for varamin vmwl was established and compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl of δd 8 1δ18o 10 8 craig 1961 and eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl of δd 8δ18o 22 gat and carmi 1970 fig 10 the vmwl δd 6 6 δ18o 4 7 was first developed in the study area and it shows almost the same slope as previously identified by the tehran meteoric water line tmwl δd 6 5δ18o 1 6 mosaffa et al 2015 fig 10 as shown in tables 2 and 3 δd h2o values of the groundwater samples ranged from 58 to 45 6 with a mean value of 53 3 2 8 for the dry season and 58 8 to 46 8 with a mean value of 54 8 2 3 for the wet season the δ18o h2o compositions of groundwater varied from 9 36 to 6 17 with a mean value of 8 21 0 71 for the dry season and 9 30 to 7 57 with a mean value of 8 72 0 37 for the wet season the δ18o h2o and δd h2o compositions of surface and groundwater were used to examine their interactions rodgers et al 2004 petelet giraud et al 2007 einsiedl 2012 cook 2013 the slope of the regression line between the δ18o h2o and δd h2o compositions in precipitation could generally differ depending on the local climatic conditions hoefs 2009 the groundwater samples were generally plotted along vmwl and between global and eastern mediterranean meteoric water lines fig 10 most of the groundwater samples are plotted on fig 10 along the vmwl and show more depleted isotopic compositions compared to those of river water and treated wastewater however some groundwater samples tend to be plotted in a more isotopically enriched area than vmml fig 10 indicating the occurrence of evaporation this means that local precipitation after evaporation is the main source of groundwater in the study area contributions from surface runoff and leakage of treated wastewater would not be neglected as some of groundwater samples show similar isotopic compositions to their compositions fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 nitrification and denitrification processes except sources heterogeneity nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification affect the composition of the isotope ratios of nitrate in aquatic systems kendall et al 1998 the δ18o no3 values of all collected groundwater samples from the study area ranged from 0 6 to 10 4 figs 8 and 9 the values obtained for the δ18o no3 of precipitation in the study area averaged 62 46 n 2 which is consistent with previous studies showing the δ18o no3 values of precipitation being generally above 60 kendall et al 2007 fig 8 chemical nitrate fertilizers typically have δ18o no3 values around 23 5 which is near that of atmospheric oxygen amberger and schmidt 1987 xue et al 2009 these sources had considerably higher δ18o no3 values than those of the water samples from the varamin aquifer fig 8 the decline in δ18o no3 values in groundwater samples might be explained by isotopic fractionations during microbial mediated nitrogen cycling before reaching catchment waters in theory the produced nitrate ion of no3 formed during nitriﬁcation in the surface aerobic environment contains two thirds water oxygen of ambient water and one third atmospheric oxygen δ18o 23 5 andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 yoshinari and wahlen 1985 if oxygen in dissolved no3 was formed according to this theory without isotope fractionation due to the denitrification and dissolution of nitrate compounds the δ18o no3 values of groundwater can be calculated with the following equation 4 δ18o no3 2 3δ18o h2o 1 3 δ18o o2 where δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 represent water oxygen isotope ratios of contacted water collected groundwater samples and atmospheric oxygen in ambient atmosphere applied value of 23 5 wexler et al 2011 in fig 11 the calculated oxygen isotopic compositions for most samples from groups 1 and 2 in both seasons were plotted on the near field of the theoretical line eq 4 which indicates that nitrification is the main process forming dissolved nitrate in this area however some samples showed δ18o no3 values slightly lower than the theoretical line fig 11 the possibility of the exchange of oxygen atoms between nitrite and water that could produce nitrate oxygen isotope ratios lower than theoretical values has recently been discussed kool et al 2011 wexler et al 2012 and this might explain why the calculated δ18o no3 values were slightly reduced for some of the groundwater samples from groups 1 and 2 in contrast all samples in group 3 and some samples in group 1 showed calculated δ18o no3 values higher than theoretical values in both seasons which may be caused by denitrification process and or source contribution of nitrate compounds kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2014 denitrification is the microbial process occurring in soil or aquatic environments that reduces nitrate to gaseous forms of nitrogen largely nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas depending on the reaction rate temperature and substrate concentrations this process can lead to isotopic fractionation of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate kendall et al 2007 vavilin and rytov 2015 this process causes an increase of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the residual nitrate by means of isotopic fractionation e g kendall 1998 with a εn εo ratio that ranges from 1 3 fukada et al 2003 to 2 1 böttcher et al 1990 aravena and robertson 1998 in groundwater where ε is the isotopic fractionation all samples in group 3 are plotted between calculated denitrification lines from cey et al 1999 with εn εo 1 7 and aravena and robertson 1998 with εn εo 2 1 fig 8a for collected samples values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 tended to be linearly correlated in both season fig 8a this reaction has been commonly observed under anaerobic environments typically do 0 5 2 0 mg l pina ochoa and alvarez cobelas 2006 golterman 2007 measured do concentrations were below these values corresponding to findings from isotopic analysis for groundwater samples from groups 1 and 2 no positive relationships between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for either dry or wet seasons were observed fig 8 in contrast in the same diagram the plots for most groundwater samples from group 3 lie on the trend array for the case that denitrification reaction occurs regardless of the season figs 8 11 and 12 in addition the δ15n no3 values for group 3 water samples tend to increase with a decrease in nitrate concentration fig 12 therefore with the evidence of their low do values tables 2 and 3 0 4 1 4 mg l for the dry season and 0 3 1 2 mg l for the wet season it is suggested that the isotopic compositions of nitrate for these samples were fractionated during the denitrification process resulting in the attenuation of nitrate contamination with relatively low nitrate concentration figs 7 and 12 similar to the scenario identified in other fields ohte et al 2010 baily et al 2011 hosono et al 2011 li et al 2013 clague et al 2015 puig et al 2017 li et al 2018 this process was more intense in the wet season probably because of enhanced stagnant water infiltration in around the shour river riverbed somewhat elevated δ18o no3 values for some samples from group 1 fig 11 did not link with an elevation of δ15n no3 fig 8 suggesting the contribution of nitrate compounds with high δ18o signature for these groundwaters the linear correlations of δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values with the natural logarithm of nitrate concentrations fig 13 for november 2016 and february 2018 corroborate the applicability of the classical rayleigh equation to denitrification process in this study this equation describes that during denitrification the isotopic values of the residual nitrate increases in proportion to the logarithm of the residual nitrate fraction which can be expressed as kendall 1998 5 δr δr0 εln f where δr is the δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 value of the reactant nitrate at time t δr0 is the initial δ15n no3 or δ18o no3 value of the nitrate f is the remaining fraction of the nitrate and ε is the enrichment factor as can see in fig 13 ε values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in group 3 are estimated to be 5 8 and 2 2 in dry season and 4 2 and 2 9 in wet season respectively samples of this group are located in the transition zone between shour river and their riparian aquifer where river water and groundwater interact riparian zones that link the terrestrial and the aquatic environment have been shown to have a significant potential for the natural attenuation of no3 pollution and to function as a no3 buffer zone along rivers in these areas converging flow paths in the discharge zone the mixing of water with different no3 loads mengis et al 1999 anoxic conditions and soil rich in organic matter provide optimal conditions for the occurrence of denitrification hill 1996 puckett 2004 ranalli and macalady 2010 therefore this zone may play an important role in mediating nitrate exports as it can facilitate intensive denitrification which permanently removes nitrate from the aquatic system factors affecting denitrification during infiltration of river water consist on the effect of different hydrogeological settings and land use patterns clément et al 2003 devito et al 2000 peter et al 2012 vidon and hill 2004 on the implications of seasonal changes in temperature and hydrology cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 grischek et al 1998 pfenning and mcmahon 1997 and availability of electron donors carbon source and acceptors no3 hedin et al 1998 ostrom et al 2002 close to the river groundwater hydraulics and hydrochemistry are strongly affected by river water infiltration here consumption of do and the enrichment of δ15n and δ18o of the no3 molecule provide evidence for the occurrence of denitrification especially during february 2017 these high river water fractions occur at locations where river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer which presumably is a key driver for the supply of bioavailable carbon fueling microbial activity in these area hydrological factors that have been linked to an increased mobilization of carbon sources e g during high river discharges or high groundwater levels can play an important role for both consumption of do and denitrification especially february 2017 5 2 identification of nitrate sources and behaviors using dual isotopes of nitrate and water chemistry nitrate contamination source identification using δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 plot diagram fig 8 has been applied in many studies aravena and robertson 1998 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 umezawa et al 2008 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2011 2013 urresti estala et al 2015 xu et al 2016 puig et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however the use of this method has limitations especially in cases where sampled waters are plotted on a compositional field where compositions of possible source materials and or denitrification signals are overlapping e g mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 hosono et al 2013 chen et al 2014 bu et al 2017 the combined use of hydrochemical data together with isotopic data would be effective for identifying the source of nitrate contamination in particular the approach of dual isotope ratios of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in combination with the molar ratio of no3 cl figs 8 and 13 can be used to distinguish more strictly the waters affected by denitrification because cl behaves as conservative ions in water while no3 concentrations decline with the denitrification process in general the amount of nitrogen leaching to groundwater increase by crops such as maize and vegetation that need more fertilizers wheat and barley need moderate fertilizers alfalfa is the lowest amount of fertilizer need about 100 kg ha 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in group 1 water samples fell closer ranges representing chemical fertilizers in the dry season and chemical fertilizers soil n and manure sewage in the wet season fig 14 most samples from group 1 revealed a moderate no3 cl ratio with δ15n no3 values lower than 8 especially in dry seasons fig 14 the groundwater samples are characterized by do concentration values 4 5 mg l and thus the denitrification effect might be neglected together with land use information the main source could be considered to be chemical fertilizers both ammonium fertilizer and no3 fertilizer and sewage water used for irrigation however some samples in areas where livestock farms are distributed g29 and g37 the δ15n no3 values of groundwater were greater than 10 probably due to contributions of manure from the farms most samples from group 2 revealed high no3 cl molar ratios with δ15n no3 values greater than 8 indicating that no3 was influenced directly by sewage fig 14 actually it has been suggested that the nitrogen isotope ratio of nitrate in animal manure and sewage is usually enriched with heavy isotope within the range of 8 and 25 kendall et al 2007 widory et al 2013 as mentioned previously the denitrification effect was not significant in this area figs 12 and 13 this group was characterized by a high proportion of residential areas without enough implementation of the sewage pipe system therefore a high concentration of nitrate in the central part of the varamin plain must be attributed to the seeping of septic wastes from the city with the probable additional input from treated water used for irrigation and manure group 3 samples had the lowest no3 and do concentrations and tended to have higher isotopic compositions all samples in this group which constituted aquifer waters interacting with shour river water revealed low no3 cl molar ratios with δ15n no3 values greater than 15 fig 14 suggesting that denitrification caused the decreasing nitrate concentrations the land uses in the area of this group consist mainly of agricultural irrigated with water from wells and shour river and partly of residential activities the original isotopic compositions of waters from this area before denitrification can be regarded as those of chemical fertilizers and sewage water by way of water infiltration from the shour river the results showed that the nitrate concentration in the area is more affected by different pollutant sources in the study area the downward flowing groundwater from the recharge area generally displayed a clear tendency to increased no3 concentration with an increase in δ15n no3 in urbanized areas due to the leakage of municipal wastes in the western and southwestern regions pre existing nitrate transported from upgrading areas and infiltered nitrogen contaminants from the shour river have reduced the no3 concentration with a very sudden depression of do and a major increase in δ15n no3 showing clear evidence for the drastic progress of the denitrification reaction this research is important in that the groundwater environments are examined in an area where treated wastewater reuse projects in arid areas with persistent water scarcity have implemented as a potentially nonconventional resource to satisfy the increasing water demand our observations using isotope ratios suggest a potential impact of the wastewaters on groundwater qualities although the nitrate concentration in the samples collected are not greater than 30 mg l the treated wastewater should be monitored including these components for further investigation since urban wastewaters could contain some harmful materials of anthropogenic origins finally multiple cumulative environmental exposures affecting populations in wastewater use areas such as water and sanitation access must be comprehensively examined 6 conclusions in this study the varamin aquifer located in southeastern tehran iran was chosen for study with the aim of ascertaining the sources of nitrate pollution and nitrogen transformation processes in groundwaters in an area where treated wastewaters are used for irrigation purposes stable isotope ratios δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ18o h2o and δd h2o in groundwater samples taken from two periods in november 2016 dry season and february 2017 wet season were analyzed in addition the hierarchical clustering analysis method was applied to classify groundwater samples from 38 water wells into three clusters groups 1 3 in terms of hydrochemical characteristics the main sources of the nitrate contamination in group 1 groundwaters could be derived from chemical fertilizers and treated wastewaters used for irrigation the sources of nitrate contamination in group 2 waters are likely to originate from domestic waste from residential areas the main sources of nitrate in the waters of group 3 could be attributed to chemical fertilizers and sewage waters through recharges from the shour river denitrification occurs mainly in the west and southwest group 3 the concentrations of nitrate were the highest 60 mg l in residential areas within the studied watershed area the current results show that the groundwater quality in agricultural areas is affected by irrigation activities using treated wastewaters the nitrate concentrations of these groundwaters are not greater than 30 mg l in this area even though the current contamination levels are not critical it is proposed that the effects of treated wastewaters should continuously be assessed for nitrates and other parameters such as organic chemical compounds and microbiological facies because the concentrations of these elements from treated wastewater are important environmental issues affecting the quality of food products and the health of water consumers in addition isotopic fingerprinting for tracing the effects of treated wastewaters could be improved if different isotopic tracers such as δ11b δ13c and δ34s and other tracers could be incorporated in future work widory

water consumption the aim of this work was to study the effect of rdi on olives when applied before harvesting without a rehydration period on the quality of table olives the experiment was performed in la hampa the experimental farm of irnas csic at coria del río seville spain during 2015 and 2016 two deficit irrigation treatments were compared with a full irrigated control treatment 1 t1 reduced

agriculture forced farmers to implement irrigation following food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommendations nowadays fresh water resources are scarce even for non agricultural applications regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a technique that reduces the use of water and it has been already tested on olive crops several benefits on oil composition such as the improvement of phenolic compounds content phytoprostanes fatty acids etc have been related with rdi of olive crops cano lamadrid et al 2015 collado gonzález et al 2015 sánchez rodríguez et al 2019a hydrosostainable vegetables are products with unique characteristics including the reduced use of water economic benefit for farmers and water sustainability for the environment and the enhanced

countries due to their taste and functional properties table olives are a nutritional rich food because they provide proteins carbohydrates lipids dietary fiber minerals phosphorous iron calcium magnesium potassium copper zinc manganese and vitamins vitamin e b complex β carotene boskou et al 2015 some of the most valued functional properties are due to the fatty acid profile high content of oleic acid and the non dietary constituents these healthy compounds lend to table olives some health benefits associated with cardiovascular immune nervous respiratory and digestive systems boskou et al 2015 it is well known that the olive fruit development in the tree could be divided in three stages stage i fruit growth stage ii pit hardening and stage iii oil accumulation and maturation goldhamer 1999 in previous studies when water stress techniques were applied during stage ii the effect in yield was not significant and some beneficial properties were reported on hydrosostainable table olives cano lamadrid et al 2015 however if the stress is applied during stage iii it has to be taken into account that it is a critical period for compounds synthesis and so special attention needs to be paid to the changes in the concentration of some compounds thus it is necessary to study the effect of applying rdi during stage iii of fruit growth on the both ro and to composition after

ii p 0 01 and iii p 0 001 additionally correlation coefficients were calculated to study the relationship between si and all analyses done in raw and processed olives of both seasons 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation minimum stem water potential min ψstem and stress integral si results of each year for each treatment under study are shown in table 1 during 2015 season both parameters were smaller than during 2016 for the period of 2015 although non statistical differences were found due to the high variability of data moderate deficit irrigation during long time t2 showed the highest min ψstem and the si was the same than control regarding 2016 season also t2 showed the highest min ψstem and in this case si showed statistical significant differences it could be seen that t2 was the most stressed treatment while t1 was the least one it has to be considered that even though researchers could control the applied irrigation other natural factors due to real on field conditions rain overall weather soil differences among areas of the same field among others significantly affect si and modified the targeted values thus statistical differences were found between both seasons being 2016 significantly more stressed than 2015 3 2 morphological analyses morphological parameters of raw and table olives are shown in table 2 regarding ro fruit weight pit weight equatorial and longitudinal diameters and color were not affected by rdi treatments at any season only the results of one of the texture tests mtt was affected by irrigation in both seasons rdi decreased the hardness of the pulp of ro in relation to to in 2015 season fruit weight was significantly affected by rdi treatments with t1 and t0 having the smallest and highest values respectively regarding longitudinal diameter t1 table olives were longer than the other ones with respect to color a and b parameters showed statistical differences t2 provided the greenest and less yellow table olives during 2016 season the only morphological parameter affected by rdi treatments was mtt showing that t2 table olives had the hardest pulp if both seasons are compared it could be found that the highest stress 2016 produced smallest olives affecting the weight and the diameters previous studies were done with the same cultivar but applying the deficit irrigation during stage ii of fruit growth and it was found that the higher the stress the higher the differences of olives in comparison with the control sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b therefore the timing of application of rdi is a highly relevant variable given that when the stress was applied during stage iii a different behavior was reported the higher the stress the lower the morphological differences between olives fruit pit ratio is one of the most important quality factors for table olive production and also for olive oil extraction gucci et al 2009 in the current study no statistically significant differences were found for fruit pit ratio this result agreed with that by gucci et al 2019 who studied the effect of rdi applied before pit hardening period and during rehydration phase 3 3 antioxidants and total phenol content antioxidants abts dpph and frap assays and tpc results of ro and to during the two studied seasons are shown in table 3 regarding ro in abts assay t2 performed as the control and in frap assay t2 had the highest values in both studied seasons although for dpph radical the highest values were found for t1 treatment 2 showed the same tpc values than control while t1 had the lowest values in general t1 olives had the lowest values of aa and tpc as compared to t0 and t2 fruits if both seasons are compared 2015 showed highest values of aa regarding frap assay while dpph and tpc showed highest values on 2016 season in relation to to aa was affected by irrigation in both seasons in the dpph assay t1 and t2 presented higher antioxidant power than control while in the frap assay t2 had the same concentration than control in table olives also both rdi treatments yielded higher concentrations of tpc than t0 no statistical differences were found in to between seasons no significant differences were found in previous studies with the same cultivar but different irrigation strategies cano lamadrid et al 2017 sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b in such studies rdi was applied during stage ii consequently the timing of rdi application is very important regarding antioxidants and tpc stage iii of fruit growth corresponds to the maturation and oil accumulation period and when the stress was applied in that period phenol content and antioxidant power increased their concentration a similar result was also obtained when the polyphenol profile was studied sánchez rodríguez et al 2019a in such study it was reported that the application of rdi at stage iii improved the polyphenolic profile of table olives because several polyphenols increased their concentration oleuropein oleoside di glucoside or comselogoside among others many studies have demonstrated that the increase of polyphenol concentration on olive oil is due to rdi gucci et al 2019 in a study on the effect of irrigation time on the polyphenolic compounds of olive oil in the frantoio cultivar reported the highest increase in the concentration of polyphenols when rdi was applied before the hardening period of the pit differences with the current work could be due to agronomic conditions cultivar water stress conditions etc 3 4 fatty acids the fatty acids profile of the olives under study are shown in table 4 regarding ro during 2015 season no statistical differences were found among irrigation treatments whereas in 2016 the percentages of stearic and oleic acids slightly changed it was found that stearic acid increased in t2 3 40 and oleic increased in t1 70 7 as compared to 2 90 and 68 8 in the control treatment t0 this observation may be related to the fact that during 2016 the midday stem water potential ψstem values were smaller than in 2015 and the stress integral values were larger that means that the stress in the trees was higher than in 2015 thus only under a high water stress of the trees the fatty acid profile was altered regarding to when the stress in trees was smaller 2015 no differences were found in the fatty acid profile following the same trend reported for ro although total saturated fatty acids sfa slightly decreased in t2 however in 2016 season palmitic acid percentage decreased in both rdi treatments and oleic acid concentration increased in t2 71 4 as compared to 70 1 in the control olives therefore these results showed a trend to a positive functional quality of table olives under water stress as saturated fatty acids sfa decreased while simultaneously monounsaturated fatty acids mufa increased on the total fatty acid profile under water stress other studies were done on olive trees with different rdi treatments cano lamadrid et al 2015 2017 in which the rdi was conducted during pit hardening stage non critical stage and no differences were found on antioxidant activity or total phenol content although mufa percentage increased with high stress and pufa with moderate stress thus similar results were found when moderate deficit irrigation during long time was applied during stage iii because mufa content increased although in this situation also the sfa content decreased leading to an improvement of the fatty acid profile however enhanced functional quality needs to be evaluated considering changes in other components on the olives there are some studies that demonstrated that timing of olive tree irrigation influenced the fruit tissues evolution gucci et al 2009 rapoport et al 2004 although there is small information about timing gucci et al 2019 did not found a clear trend on frantoio olive oil fatty acid composition after applying rdi before stage ii and during iii 3 5 organic acids and sugars organic acids and sugars profiles of ro are shown in table 5 the main organic acids found in ro were citric tartaric malic and succinic acids while the main sugars were sucrose glucose and fructose both seasons under study yielded similar contents of organic acids and sugars so it could be said that differences between the stress levels in both seasons did not affect the organic acids and sugars profiles regarding differences between irrigation treatments the two seasons showed the same trend only tartaric and succinic acids decreased their concentration when both rdi treatments were applied tartaric acid decreased from 0 14 g kg 1 fw t0 to 0 07 g kg 1 fw t1 and 0 08 g kg 1 fw t2 and succinic acid decreased from 0 50 g kg 1 fw t0 to 0 14 g kg 1 fw t1 and t2 regarding to data not shown in table 5 phytic 6 42 g kg 1 fw lactic 1 50 g kg 1 fw and acetic acids 0 79 g kg 1 fw were found as major organic acids while maltoheptaose 2 03 g kg 1 fw mannitol 2 46 g kg 1 fw and glycerol 0 77 g kg 1 fw as sugar no statistical differences were found on to due to irrigation treatments and seasons same profiles of organic acids and sugars were previously found in ro and to sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b in manzanilla olives the differences among the organic acid and sugar profiles in ro and to were the consequence of the transformation of ro into to via fermentation during the spanish style process 3 6 correlation for further information about the effect of the water stress in the parameters studied correlations were done among all parameters for both ro and to and si including both seasons fig 1 negative correlations among si and i fruit weight fig 1a ii pit weight fig 1b and iii equatorial diameter fig 1c although non statistically significant regarding morphological characteristics table 2 it was observed that the higher the stress applied during stage iii the higher the decrease in fruit and pit weight thus the relation fruit pit was maintained and similar fruit quality was obtained as it was expected equatorial diameter was also negatively correlated with si and it was definitely linked to the weight loss regarding fatty acids positive correlations among si and i mufas figure e for ro and to ii linolenic acid fig 1d and iii mufa pufa sfa fig 1f percentages only for to only to data are represented in such figures the higher the stress applied during stage iii the higher the concentration of linolenic acid in to also the sum pufa mufas slightly increased due to water stress the higher the stress applied the higher the content on mufa in ro and to olives 4 conclusions this is the first study investigating functional parameters of raw olives and table olives under the effect of a rdi applied just before harvest and without a rehydration period after processing raw into table olives by the spanish style process the differences due to rdi treatments were reduced in general the quality of fruit morphological parameters was maintained reduced size but maintained pulp proportion while the antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were increased due to rdi and the fatty acid profile was improved enhanced mufa content when the stress integral was higher 2016 season consequently and after application of rdi strategies just before olives harvesting the higher the si the better the nutritional quality of the hydrosostainable table olives obtained hence farmers interested on saving water techniques now have more information about effect on timing i moderate stress applied during stage ii led to maintained fruit size and yield with no significant differences on composition and ii high stress applied during stage iii led to reduced olive size but improved the nutritional quality of fruits acknowledgements the study has been funded spanish

11011,fresh water scarcity is a major worldwide issue there is a need to reduce water use whereas preserving the quality of food products regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a strategy to reduce fresh water consumption the aim of this work was to study the effect of rdi on olives when applied before harvesting without a rehydration period on the quality of table olives the experiment was performed in la hampa the experimental farm of irnas csic at coria del río seville spain during 2015 and 2016 two deficit irrigation treatments were compared with a full irrigated control treatment 1 t1 reduced irrigation from early september about 2 weeks before harvest until values of midday stem water potential were around 2 mpa treatment 2 t2 reduced irrigation from mid august about 4 weeks before harvest with a similar water stress level the duration and level of water stress was described with the stress integral si fruit features were studied before and after the industrial process to obtain spanish style table olives in order to evaluate differences due to irrigation on raw olives and due to processing on table olives water stress conditions slightly changed olive characteristics affecting size and composition the industrial processing to table olives masked differences between irrigation treatments though some features such as total polyphenols content tpc were still different si was significantly related with fruit weight pit weight equatorial diameter linolenic acid and mufas content and mufa pufa sfa ratio keywords hydrosostainable vegetables fatty acids oleic acid stress integral total phenolic content 1 introduction olive tree has been traditionally one of the most cultivated trees under rainfed conditions but in the recent years the intensification of agriculture forced farmers to implement irrigation following food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommendations nowadays fresh water resources are scarce even for non agricultural applications regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a technique that reduces the use of water and it has been already tested on olive crops several benefits on oil composition such as the improvement of phenolic compounds content phytoprostanes fatty acids etc have been related with rdi of olive crops cano lamadrid et al 2015 collado gonzález et al 2015 sánchez rodríguez et al 2019a hydrosostainable vegetables are products with unique characteristics including the reduced use of water economic benefit for farmers and water sustainability for the environment and the enhanced concentration of some functional components of the vegetables carbonell barrachina et al 2015 noguera artiaga et al 2016 spanish style process is one of the most typical methods for preparing table olives to in spain it is based on the lye treatment and fermentation of green olives to allow raw olives ro to become edible this type of to is one of the most consumed appetizer in the mediterranean countries due to their taste and functional properties table olives are a nutritional rich food because they provide proteins carbohydrates lipids dietary fiber minerals phosphorous iron calcium magnesium potassium copper zinc manganese and vitamins vitamin e b complex β carotene boskou et al 2015 some of the most valued functional properties are due to the fatty acid profile high content of oleic acid and the non dietary constituents these healthy compounds lend to table olives some health benefits associated with cardiovascular immune nervous respiratory and digestive systems boskou et al 2015 it is well known that the olive fruit development in the tree could be divided in three stages stage i fruit growth stage ii pit hardening and stage iii oil accumulation and maturation goldhamer 1999 in previous studies when water stress techniques were applied during stage ii the effect in yield was not significant and some beneficial properties were reported on hydrosostainable table olives cano lamadrid et al 2015 however if the stress is applied during stage iii it has to be taken into account that it is a critical period for compounds synthesis and so special attention needs to be paid to the changes in the concentration of some compounds thus it is necessary to study the effect of applying rdi during stage iii of fruit growth on the both ro and to composition after spanish style process therefore the aim of this work was to study the effect of two rdi treatments in the morphological parameters fruit and pit weight fruit pit ratio equatorial and longitudinal diameters texture and color antioxidant activity abts dpph and frap total phenol content tpc fatty acid profile organic acids and sugars of ro and to experiments and analyses were carried out in two

analyses one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s multiple range test were carried out for the results of each season results were expressed as means of triplicate analysis from each batch in each treatment statistical analyses were performed using statgraphics plus 5 0 software manugistics inc rockville md and differences were considered statistically significant at three levels i p 0 05 ii p 0 01 and iii p 0 001 additionally correlation coefficients were calculated to study the relationship between si and all analyses done in raw and processed olives of both seasons 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation minimum stem water potential min ψstem and stress integral si results of each year for each treatment under study are shown in table 1 during 2015 season both parameters were smaller than during 2016 for the period of 2015 although non statistical differences were found due to the high variability of data moderate deficit irrigation during long time t2 showed the highest min ψstem and the si was the same than control regarding 2016 season also t2 showed the highest min ψstem and in this case si showed statistical significant differences it could be seen that t2 was the most stressed treatment while t1 was the least one it has to be considered that even though researchers could control the applied irrigation other natural factors due to real on field conditions rain overall weather soil differences among areas of the same field among others significantly affect si and modified the targeted values thus statistical differences were found between both seasons being 2016 significantly more stressed than 2015 3 2 morphological analyses morphological parameters of raw and table olives are shown in table 2 regarding ro fruit weight pit weight equatorial and longitudinal diameters and color were not affected by rdi treatments at any season only the results of one of the texture tests mtt was affected by irrigation in both seasons rdi decreased the hardness of the pulp of ro in relation to to in 2015 season fruit weight was significantly affected by rdi treatments with t1 and t0 having the smallest and highest values respectively regarding longitudinal diameter t1 table olives were longer than the other ones with respect to color a and b parameters showed statistical differences t2 provided the greenest and less yellow table olives during 2016 season the only morphological parameter affected by rdi treatments was mtt showing that t2 table olives had the hardest pulp if both seasons are compared it could be found that the highest stress 2016 produced smallest olives affecting the weight and the diameters previous studies were done with the same cultivar but applying the deficit irrigation during stage ii of fruit growth and it was found that the higher the stress the higher the differences of olives in comparison with the control sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b therefore the timing of application of rdi is a highly relevant variable given that when the stress was applied during stage iii a different behavior was reported the higher the stress the lower the morphological differences between olives fruit pit ratio is one of the most important quality factors for table olive production and also for olive oil extraction gucci et al 2009 in the current study no statistically significant differences were found for fruit pit ratio this result agreed with that by gucci et al 2019 who studied the effect of rdi applied before pit hardening period and during rehydration phase 3 3 antioxidants and total phenol content antioxidants abts dpph and frap assays and tpc results of ro and to during the two studied seasons are shown in table 3 regarding ro in abts assay t2 performed as the control and in frap assay t2 had the highest values in both studied seasons although for dpph radical the highest values were found for t1 treatment 2 showed the same tpc values than control while t1 had the lowest values in general t1 olives had the lowest values of aa and tpc as compared to t0 and t2 fruits if both seasons are compared 2015 showed highest values of aa regarding frap assay while dpph and tpc showed highest values on 2016 season in relation to to aa was affected by irrigation in both seasons in the dpph assay t1 and t2 presented higher antioxidant power than control while in the frap assay t2 had the same concentration than control in table olives also both rdi treatments yielded higher concentrations of tpc than t0 no statistical differences were found in to between seasons no significant differences were found in previous studies with the same cultivar but different irrigation strategies cano lamadrid et al 2017 sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b in such studies rdi was applied during stage ii consequently the timing of rdi application is very important regarding antioxidants and tpc stage iii of fruit growth corresponds to the maturation and oil accumulation period and when the stress was applied in that period phenol content and antioxidant power increased their concentration a similar result was also obtained when the polyphenol profile was studied sánchez rodríguez et al 2019a in such study it was reported that the application of rdi at stage iii improved the polyphenolic profile of table olives because several polyphenols increased their concentration oleuropein oleoside di glucoside or comselogoside among others many studies have demonstrated that the increase of polyphenol concentration on olive oil is due to rdi gucci et al 2019 in a study on the effect of irrigation time on the polyphenolic compounds of olive oil in the frantoio cultivar reported the highest increase in the concentration of polyphenols when rdi was applied before the hardening period of the pit differences with the current work could be due to agronomic conditions cultivar water stress conditions etc 3 4 fatty acids the fatty acids profile of the olives under study are shown in table 4 regarding ro during 2015 season no statistical differences were found among irrigation treatments whereas in 2016 the percentages of stearic and oleic acids slightly changed it was found that stearic acid increased in t2 3 40 and oleic increased in t1 70 7 as compared to 2 90 and 68 8 in the control treatment t0 this observation may be related to the fact that during 2016 the midday stem water potential ψstem values were smaller than in 2015 and the stress integral values were larger that means that the stress in the trees was higher than in 2015 thus only under a high water stress of the trees the fatty acid profile was altered regarding to when the stress in trees was smaller 2015 no differences were found in the fatty acid profile following the same trend reported for ro although total saturated fatty acids sfa slightly decreased in t2 however in 2016 season palmitic acid percentage decreased in both rdi treatments and oleic acid concentration increased in t2 71 4 as compared to 70 1 in the control olives therefore these results showed a trend to a positive functional quality of table olives under water stress as saturated fatty acids sfa decreased while simultaneously monounsaturated fatty acids mufa increased on the total fatty acid profile under water stress other studies were done on olive trees with different rdi treatments cano lamadrid et al 2015 2017 in which the rdi was conducted during pit hardening stage non critical stage and no differences were found on antioxidant activity or total phenol content although mufa percentage increased with high stress and pufa with moderate stress thus similar results were found when moderate deficit irrigation during long time was applied during stage iii because mufa content increased although in this situation also the sfa content decreased leading to an improvement of the fatty acid profile however enhanced functional quality needs to be evaluated considering changes in other components on the olives there are some studies that demonstrated that timing of olive tree irrigation influenced the fruit tissues evolution gucci et al 2009 rapoport et al 2004 although there is small information about timing gucci et al 2019 did not found a clear trend on frantoio olive oil fatty acid composition after applying rdi before stage ii and during iii 3 5 organic acids and sugars organic acids and sugars profiles of ro are shown in table 5 the main organic acids found in ro were citric tartaric malic and succinic acids while the main sugars were sucrose glucose and fructose both seasons under study yielded similar contents of organic acids and sugars so it could be said that differences between the stress levels in both seasons did not affect the organic acids and sugars profiles regarding differences between irrigation treatments the two seasons showed the same trend only tartaric and succinic acids decreased their concentration when both rdi treatments were applied tartaric acid decreased from 0 14 g kg 1 fw t0 to 0 07 g kg 1 fw t1 and 0 08 g kg 1 fw t2 and succinic acid decreased from 0 50 g kg 1 fw t0 to 0 14 g kg 1 fw t1 and t2 regarding to data not shown in table 5 phytic 6 42 g kg 1 fw lactic 1 50 g kg 1 fw and acetic acids 0 79 g kg 1 fw were found as major organic acids while maltoheptaose 2 03 g kg 1 fw mannitol 2 46 g kg 1 fw and glycerol 0 77 g kg 1 fw as sugar no statistical differences were found on to due to irrigation treatments and seasons same profiles of organic acids and sugars were previously found in ro and to sánchez rodríguez et al 2019b in manzanilla olives the differences among the organic acid and sugar profiles in ro and to were the consequence of the transformation of ro into to via fermentation during the spanish style process 3 6 correlation for further information about the effect of the water stress in the parameters studied correlations were done among all parameters for both ro and to and si including both seasons fig 1 negative correlations among si and i fruit weight fig 1a ii pit weight fig 1b and iii equatorial diameter fig 1c although non statistically significant regarding morphological characteristics table 2 it was observed that the higher the stress applied during stage iii the higher the decrease in fruit and pit weight thus the relation fruit pit was maintained and similar fruit quality was obtained as it was expected equatorial diameter was also negatively correlated with si and it was definitely linked to the weight loss regarding fatty acids positive correlations among si and i mufas figure e for ro and to ii linolenic acid fig 1d and iii mufa pufa sfa fig 1f percentages only for to only to data are represented in such figures the higher the stress applied during stage iii the higher the concentration of linolenic acid in to also the sum pufa mufas slightly increased due to water stress the higher the stress applied the higher the content on mufa in ro and to olives 4 conclusions this is the first study investigating functional parameters of raw olives and table olives under the effect of a rdi applied just before harvest and without a rehydration period after processing raw into table olives by the spanish style process the differences due to rdi treatments were reduced in general the quality of fruit morphological parameters was maintained reduced size but maintained pulp proportion while the antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were increased due to rdi and the fatty acid profile was improved enhanced mufa content when the stress integral was higher 2016 season consequently and after application of rdi strategies just before olives harvesting the higher the si the better the nutritional quality of the hydrosostainable table olives obtained hence farmers interested on saving water techniques now have more information about effect on timing i moderate stress applied during stage ii led to maintained fruit size and yield with no significant differences on composition and ii high stress applied during stage iii led to reduced olive size but improved the nutritional quality of fruits acknowledgements the study has been funded spanish

11012,despite the fact that the pressure chamber has been used as a tool to assess vine water status and assist in scheduling vineyard irrigation for more than 30 years there remains some disagreement in sampling protocol with respect to midday leaf water potential ψleaf and midday stem water potential ψstem determination therefore the primary goal of this study was to test various sampling protocols associated with the measurement of these two variables specifically experiments were conducted to test the effects of 1 re cutting the petiole prior to placing the leaf in the chamber 2 time span between sample excision and pressurization 3 sample equilibration time on ψstem values and 4 the effect of operator results showed that there was no significant effect of re cutting the petiole on ψleaf values furthermore up to 30 s of time span between sample excision and pressurization was acceptable for accurate ψleaf determinations as long as the sample was kept shaded during that time finally only 10 min of equilibration time was necessary for accurate ψstem determination in most cases the effect of operator on all ψ determinations was greater than any of the sample preparation methods tested this reinforces the need to properly train vineyard technicians in using the pressure chamber however improved flexibility in sampling protocol for either ψleaf or ψstem determinations

chamber is closely related to soil water content williams and araujo 2002 gas exchange williams 2012 and subsequently vine water use williams et al 2012 accordingly the pressure chamber remains a relevant irrigation management tool in commercial vineyards today williams 2017 and is used to validate developing irrigation management technologies such as infrared thermometry king and shellie 2016 pou et al 2014 and dendrometry conesa et al 2016 goldhamer and fereres 2001a despite its near ubiquity in irrigated regions as an irrigation management tool there continues to be disagreement among users about proper pressure chamber technique perhaps most common are disagreements regarding the protocol for sample excision and preparation prior to pressurization specifically the issue of whether or not the leaf petiole should be re cut after excision from the vine is often debated among users a d levin personal communications most users cite turner 1988 who wrote recutting of the petiole of leaf must be avoided as this can lead to error scholander et al 1965 however an examination of scholander et al 1965 who was describing the measurement technique across tree species does not clarify the issue as the authors do not provide any data to substantiate the claim of turner 1988 only writing that when the vessel elements are long a significant amount of sap withdraws from the cut producing a steep rise in the turgor in the leaves if a piece is trimmed off to make the twig fit in the chamber the elevated pressure persists and gives a wrong reading for the tree it is therefore necessary to cut the proper length from the tree and carefully limit the trimming indeed turner 1988 acknowledges that the source errors due to re cutting are not known but there are no data reported another point of contention in procedure relates to the time span sample excision and pressurization initially experiments by turner and long 1980 showed that rapid water loss occurred from leaf samples within 20 to 30 s of excision in uncovered leaves leaves that were not covered with any bag or cheesecloth prior to excision the effect of covering the leaf sample prior to excision has recently been shown to significantly affect the reading particularly under well watered conditions williams 2017 nevertheless there are no data showing how long an operator can hold a covered sample prior to pressurization before significant errors occur most users follow the method of williams and araujo 2002 that states samples are to be pressurized within 15 s of excision however this time interval may be inconvenient under field conditions particularly if the instrument is located far away from the sampled vine finally the appropriate minimum time interval required for sample equilibration in the measurement of stem water potential ψstem has varied widely in the literature cited equilibration times have varied from 24 h begg and turner 1970 mccutchan and shackel 1992 to 90 to 120 min keller et al 2016 williams and araujo 2002 to 10 min fulton et al 2001 prior to sampling of course from a management perspective vine water status monitoring using ψstem would be of lesser flexibility if the appropriate equilibration time were greater than 60 min as technicians would need to bag leaves well in advance of measurement in addition with a lower required equilibration time operators would have a greater ability to repeat measurements as new samples could be chosen and measured while still remaining within the two hour midday window to resolve these discrepancies three experiments we conducted in order to understand how varied techniques affect both ψleaf and ψstem values because the effect of operator has also been shown to strongly affect the reading in almonds goldhamer and fereres 2001b each experiment was also conducted across two operators to characterize this effect in grapevine each experiment was designed to specifically test techniques that has been discordantly described in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites plant material and management two sites were used for this study a mixed cultivar vitis spp table grape vineyard and a v vinifera l cv pinot noir wine grape vineyard both sites were located within the rogue valley american viticultural area of southern oregon the 31 year old table grape vineyard was a demonstration plot planted at the southern oregon research and extension center sorec near central point oregon 42 3304 n 122 9390 w the 8 year old pinot noir vineyard was a commercial site planted near jacksonville oregon 42 3135 n 122 9670 w approximately 3 km away from sorec vines in the table grape vineyard were own rooted and vines in the pinot noir vineyard were grafted onto schwarzmann v riparia x v rupestris rootstock vine and row spacings for the table and wine grape vineyards were 2 44 and 3 65 m and 1 83 and 2 74 m respectively the trellis system used in the table grape vineyard was a geneva double curtain gdc and the trellis in the wine grape vineyard was a vertical shoot positioned vsp system row directions in the table and wine grape vineyards were approximately east west and north south respectively the soil in the table grape vineyard was a central point coarse loamy mixed superactive mesic pachic haploxeroll the soil in the wine grape vineyard was a ruch fine loamy mixed superactive mesic mollic palexeralf the average rooting zone soil ph in the table and wine grape vineyards was 6 5 and 6 0 respectively table grape vines used for this study were einset seedless an interspecific hybrid both vineyards were irrigated weekly with two 2 l hr 1 drip emitters vine 1 and water was applied at 100 of estimated crop evapotranspiration etc for grapes according to values obtained from the weather station located at sorec mdfo agrimet united states bureau of reclamation irrigation was cut off following veraison in mid august at both sites in each year all water potential measurements were made post veraison and pre harvest at both sites in each year 2 2 water potential measurements and operator training the leaves chosen for all measurements were mature fully expanded leaves and all determinations were made between 13 00 to 15 00 h pacific daylight time pdt using the same instrument model 615 pms instrument company albany or for midday leaf water potential ψleaf measurements chosen leaves were exposed to direct full sunlight and were located on the afternoon side of the canopy e g south or west for midday stem water potential ψstem measurements chosen leaves were located on the shaded morning side of the canopy e g north or east within each experiment leaf samples were collected randomly from a set of four to five vines that were all located between trellis line posts for ψleaf samples were placed in a clear plastic bag and excised from the vine with a sharp razor blade within 1 to 2 s s from bagging for ψstem leaf samples were covered with opaque reflective foil laminate bags and were allowed to equilibrate prior to being excised from the vine with a sharp razor blade post excision sample preparation sample bag placement storage location time span between excision and pressurization and sample equilibration time depended on the experiment see details below single leaf replicates were sampled and used for data analyses the same two operators carried out all experiments in each year though they were different between years none of the operators in either year had any previous experience operators sampled leaves from the same vines within each experiment all operators were trained to safely use the instrurment and to identify the endpoint with a magnifying hand lens as the first appearance of water at the cut surface of the petiole as described by hsiao 1990 in addition no more than 2 cm of petiole tissue was allowed to protrude outside the chamber for each determination finally pressure increase rate was kept constant below 0 05 mpa s 1 to minimize error naor and peres 2001 a non stressed baseline value of ψleaf or ψstem was calculated as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd each time ψleaf or ψstem was measured to determine a relative degree of water deficit of grapevines at the time of measurement the non stressed baseline was taken from williams and baeza 2007 where non stressed ψleaf 0 49 0 79 vpd and non stressed ψstem 0 23 0 068 vpd the calculation of vpd was made from measurements of ambient temperature and relative humidity taken by the mdfo weather station located at sorec 2 3 experiment 1 leaf excision and petiole re cutting to test the effect of sample preparation on ψleaf three methods were tested between two operators using the same instrument over two years in the table grape vineyard methods were as follows one cut excising the leaf directly off the vine with a sharp razor blade before pressurization cut and re cut excising the leaf directly off the vine as above then re cutting the petiole before pressurization snap and re cut snapping the leaf off the vine at the leaf stem junction and re cutting the petiole before pressurization sample bags were securely closed and put in the shade to minimize water loss to the atmosphere and the time interval between excision and pressurization was approximately 15 s the one cut treatment was regarded as the control 2 4 experiment 2 time span between excision and pressurization to test the effect of time span between excision and pressurization on ψleaf leaf samples were excised and held for various time intervals prior to pressurization using the same vines and instrument as in experiment 1 the time intervals between excision and pressurization were 15 30 60 120 240 and 600 s sample storage location either in the sun or in the shade prior to pressurization was also evaluated in 2017 only and by only one operator the time span of 15 s was regarded as the control 2 5 experiment 3 equilibration time to test the effect of sample equilibration time on ψstem leaf samples were bagged and allowed to equilibrate for various time intervals in the pinot noir vineyard bags were placed on leaves 240 in 2017 only 120 60 30 15 10 and 5 min prior to determination for 240 120 60 and 30 min treatments bags were placed on leaves at 10 00 12 00 13 00 and 13 30 h pdt respectively for 15 10 and 5 min treatments bags were placed on leaves at 12 45 12 50 and 12 55 h pdt respectively the time interval between excision and pressurization was approximately 15 s the equilibration time of 10 min was regarded as the control 2 6 statistical analyses each experiment was analyzed by two way analysis of variance anova since the operators and number of replications were different in 2017 and 2018 n 3 and 5 for 2017 and 2018 respectively each year was analyzed separately for experiment 1 the design was a completely randomized design crd with a 2 3 factorial treatment structure for experiments 2 and 3 the design was a crd with a split plot factorial treatment structure with operator as the main plot either time span before pressurization or equilibration time as sub plots statistical analyses were done using r statistical software and the base package stats v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 together with the packages lme4 v 1 1 19 bates et al 2015 lmertest v 3 0 1 kuznetsova et al 2017 and emmeans v 1 3 0 lenth 2018 linear models were fit using the lm function for experiment 1 and the lmer function for split plot design in experiments 2 and 3 raw data from experiment 2 were log transformed to meet assumptions of anova reported means and standard errors for experiment 2 are back transformed to original units relative effect sizes were calculated as partial eta squared ηp

calculated using the function emmeans and pairwise comparisions of treatment means were made relative to controls p value multiplicity adjustments were made using the dunnett method p values were considered statistically significant at α 0 05 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 leaf excision and petiole re cutting there were no significant interaction effects between operator and sample preparation method on ψleaf in each year of the study and there were inconsistent main effects between years table 1 the environmental conditions during measurement were different between the two years with warmer and drier conditions in 2017 tair 33 7 c vpd 4 19 kpa compared to those in 2018 tair 27 4 c vpd 2 45 kpa accordingly the experimental vines also experienced a slightly greater water deficit in 2017 compared to 2018 with lower ψleaf values relative to the calculated non stressed baseline ψleaf 0 4 mpa and 0 2 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the main effect of sample preparation method on ψleaf was marginally significant p 0 034 but the main effect of operator was 1 5 fold stronger ηp 2 0 65 and 0 43 for operator and method respectively and highly significant p 0 001 by comparison table 1 averaged across methods operator 1 measured ψleaf values approximately 0 17 mpa lower more negative than operator 2 averaged across operators the snap and re cut method resulted in the highest least negative ψleaf values that were significantly higher than the cut and re cut method whereas the control method one cut resulted in intermediate ψleaf values nevertheless neither of the other two methods resulted in significantly different ψleaf values relative to the control method for either operator in 2018 neither petiole re cutting nor operator significantly affected ψleaf operators were within 0 02 mpa of one another across all sample preparation methods and sample preparation methods were within 0 06 mpa of one another across both operators table 1 notably the snap and re cut method resulted in the lowest most negative ψleaf values for both operators while the control method resulted in the highest least negative 3 2 experiment 2 time span between excision and pressurization 3 2 1 storage location when comparing time span between excision and pressurization across sample storage locations there was a highly significant interaction effect p 0 001 between the location of the sample and the time before pressurization table 2 the storage location of the leaf sample prior to pressurization significantly reduced ψleaf relative to the control but whereas the effect was significant after 60 s for leaves held in the sun it was not significant for leaves held in the shade until 240 s ψleaf decreased with time before pressurization over the entire 10 minute range by 0 52 mpa for leaves that were held in the shade and by 0 93 mpa for leaves that were held in the sun there were no significant differences among time points before 60 s regardless of storage location and measured values in both storage locations were within 0 1 mpa during this time span ultimately most of the decrease in ψleaf occurred after 60 s and was more exaggerated for leaves that were held in the sun 3 2 2 operators when comparing samples held in the shade between operators the effect of time span between excision and pressurization on ψleaf was highly significant p 0 001 in both years of the study table 3 there were significant main and interaction effects with operator in 2017 but no significant effects in 2018 environmental conditions were similar between years tair 25 7 c vpd 1 66 kpa in 2017 tair 25 4 c vpd 2 14 kpa in 2018 though vines were more stressed for water in 2018 relative to 2017 when comparing measured ψleaf values to the calculated non stressed baseline ψleaf 0 05 mpa and 0 28 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the effect size of time span between excision and pressurization was more than 2 fold larger compared to that of operator and nearly 2 fold larger than the interaction effect table 3 time span between excision and pressurization significantly reduced ψleaf values relative to the control at 60 s for operator 2 but values were not significantly different relative to the control until 120 s for operator 1 ψleaf decreased with time span before pressurization over the entire 10 min range by just over 0 5 mpa for both operators but most of the decrease occurred after 60 s in 2018 the effect size of time span between excision and pressurization was more than 262 fold larger compared to that of operator and more than 16 fold larger than the interaction effect table 3 time span between excision and pressurization did not significantly reduce ψleaf values until 240 s for both operators relative to the control 15 s as in 2017 ψleaf decreased over the entire 10 min range by just under 0 5 mpa for both operators and most of the decrease occurred after 60 s 3 3 experiment 3 equilibration time when comparing the effect of operator and sample equilibration time on ψstem both main effects were statistically significant in each year of the study but the interaction effect was inconsistent between years not significant in 2017 but marginally significant in 2018 p 0 044 table 4 while the environmental conditions were slightly warmer and drier in 2018 tair 25 3 c vpd 1 68 kpa in 2017 tair 29 0 c vpd 2 95 kpa in 2018 vines were much more water stressed in 2017 relative to 2018 when comparing measured ψstem values to the calculated non stressed baseline ψstem 0 95 mpa and 0 47 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the effect size of operator on ψstem was similar to effect size for sample equilibration time and both were nearly 2 fold larger than the non signifiant interaction effect table 4 for both operators none of the different equilibration times were significantly different than the control and all were within 0 1 mpa except for operator 2 at 240 min averaged across operators ψstem increased by 0 09 mpa when sample equilibration time increased from 5 min to 4 h differences between operators were statistically significant but were 0 08 mpa when averaged across all time points in 2018 the effect size of operator on ψstem was less than half that of sample equilibration time ηp 2 0 17 and 0 37 for operator and equilibration time respectively but there was a significant though weak ηp 2 0 22 p 0 044 interaction effect table 4 for operator 1 there were no significant differences among equilibration times relative to the control in contrast ψstem values for operator 2 were significantly lower i e more negative than the control at 60 min which was unexpected 4 discussion 4 1 statistical vs physiological vs practical significance of results in the recutting experiment there were no significant differences in the ψleaf reading with different preparation methods relative to the control in either year table 1 experiment 1 nevertheless preparation method was a significant factor in the 2017 anova and larger differences were observed among methods in 2017 for operator 2 in this experiment that ranged from 0 12 to 0 13 mpa this range could be the result of transpiration gradients between sample leaves along the shoot or between shoots on the vine shackel 2007 and is well within the difference between leaves shown for field grown tobacco begg and turner 1970 in this study leaves were randomly sampled from the same general section of the shoot mid canopy but some were sampled across several shoots located at different distances further away from the trunk this could have given rise to the differences in water potential between leaves and should be considered in any follow up studies the fact that petiole re cutting did not consistently nor significantly influence ψleaf for either operator or in either year provides evidence that the method of sample excision and or re cutting does not significantly impact the water potential reading turner 1988 cautioned against re cutting the petiole prior to pressurization due to the introduction of error but reported no data to justify his claim scholander et al 1965 also reported no data regarding errors associated with re cutting but suggested that since cutting breaks the tension in the water column water may fill the remaining tissue of the leaf sample thus increasing turgor and raising ψleaf while this may occur especially in large vesseled vitis spp jacobsen et al 2015 this effect should have been noticed as a consistent trend across both operators and years and would have resulted in higher ψleaf values in the one cut method compared to the other two fulton et al 2001 showed that the 95 confidence interval for ψstem measurements assuming only measurement error with n 3 ranged from 0 06 to 0 08 mpa across three woody perennial crop species prunus domestica p dulcis and juglans regia assuming this to be true for grapevine and for ψleaf and factoring in the accuracy of the instrument gauge itself 0 5 across the 4 0 mpa range equaling 0 02 mpa this reduces the unexplained range to 0 05 mpa this may simply have been due to differences among leaves due to their position in the canopy relative to the trunk as discussed above and it is unclear whether or not a difference of 0 05 mpa is of practical significance in grapevine irrigation scheduling ultimately anticipated differences among sample preparation methods were either not observed were small and not practically significant or did not trend in the direction as suggested in the literature the results of experiment 2 show that one could wait up to two times longer than traditionally thought before pressurizing the sample without sacrificing accuracy most users employ the technique of williams and araujo 2002 and pressurize the leaf sample within 15 s after excision the data herein show that leaf samples could be held up to 30 s before pressurization without losing accuracy and this was true for samples held in the sun or the shade and across operators and two years nevertheless keeping leaves in the sun post sampling increases variability and should ultimately be avoided in general anova showed that time was always a highly significant factor in each year in experiment 2 and the data do undeniably show that ψleaf trends lower with a longer time span between excision and pressurization for some operators in some years the difference in ψleaf from 15 to 60 s approached 0 1 mpa but differences were not statistically significant therefore it is likely that with more replication there would have been statistically significant differences among treatment levels from 15 to 60 s post excision regardless of statistical differences however the practical significance of ψleaf differences 0 1 mpa are unclear particularly given the other built in sources of error that exist due to variation in sample location on the plant and instrument gauge accuracy as discussed above physiologically differences of 0 1 mpa may not matter at very high or very low water status but may become more important for irrigation scheduling decisions if implementing a specific deficit or regulated deficit irrigation program for grapevines that relies on specific threshold ψleaf values romero et al 2010 however our results still indicate that within the first 30 s the effect of time span between excision and pressurization is not a major factor affecting reading accuracy especially considering the low standard error 0 02 0 04 mpa practically this longer time interval may provide the operator with more time to transport prepare the sample in the field potentially reducing errors resulting from hurried preparation overall the response of ψstem to increasing equilibration time was strongly dependent on operator in only one year but the change in values across the entire range of equilibration times was different in each year table 4 in 2017 ψstem values trended higher i e less negative with longer equilibration time for both operators but operator 1 was significantly lower than operator 2 across the whole range operators were also significantly different from one another in 2018 for one operator ψstem values did not change across the whole range of equilibration times but ψstem values trended lower with equilibration time for the other it is likely that this operator simply over shot the endpoint i e stopped pressurization too late hsiao 1990 stresses that the cut end of the petiole should be observed with a magnifying lens and adequate lighting while the operators all received the same training and used a magnifying lens this operator may have somehow shaded the instrument with his body position thus obstructing the appropriate light and making the endpoint difficult to observe this unusual and unexpected result corroborates the findings of goldhamer and fereres 2001b and underscores the impact of operator on water status determination in the field for three of four operators across two years and differing environmental conditions ψstem values were not significantly different from 5 to 120 min corroborating the work of fulton et al 2001 in their study fulton et al 2001 compared a range of short equilibration times 1 to 50 min relative to a control time 2 h across three woody perennial crop species and found that 10 min of equilibration time was sufficient to accurately estimate ψstem in addition fulton et al 2001 used previously shaded leaves inside the tree canopy for their determinations whereas we used leaves located on the morning side of the canopy due to the lack of adequately shaded leaves in the vsp trellis nevertheless given that we found similar results in another woody perennial crop species and also using slightly different leaf samples the results of this study support the conclusion of fulton et al 2001 that 10 min of equilibration time is sufficient for accurate ψstem determination and suggest that equilibration time could be further reduced to 5 min 4 2 some limitations of the study indeed there are two noteworthy limitations of this study s results 1 small sample sizes across experiments and 2 limited measurement dates with respect to vine phenology and environmental conditions a higher degree of measurement accuracy may have been attained with more subsampled leaves per replicate and an undoubtedly higher degree of experimental precision would have been attained with more replication within each experiment little and hills 1978 pg 41 in addition sampling vines at different phenological time points and ultimately different environmental conditions would have taken into account any effects associated with differences in leaf development or physiology or at different levels of soil or atmospheric water deficit in this study a single leaf sample per replicate was used as by williams 2012 and williams and baeza 2007 whereas other studies have subsampled two leaves per replicate keller et al 2016 king and shellie 2016 however considering that all sampled vines within each experiment were the of the same age managed in the same manner and located close to one another it is unclear to what degree further subsampling would have improved accuracy especially considering the aforementioned accuracy of the instrument gauge itself furthermore the small sample size was taken into consideration from 2017 to 2018 when n was increased from 3 to 5 respectively with the anticipation that there would have been more statistically significant differences among treatments however the results show that there were in fact fewer statistically significant differences in 2018 across all experiments all experiments performed in this study occurred during that latter half of the season during the fruit ripening phase post veraison and near harvest at this point in the season shoot elongation has typically ceased few new leaves are produced and existing leaves are mature and fully expanded matthews et al 1987 since irrigation had been cut off before the times of measurement it is likely that all vines were experiencing some degree of soil water deficit though its magnitude ranged across all measurement times in addition measurements occurred across a broad range of vpds from 1 68 to 4 19 kpa whereas water status of well waterd vines responds strongly to changes in vpd vines experiencing a water deficit typically do not williams and baeza 2007 as stomata will close to decrease leaf transpiration and control grapevine water use williams et al 2012 it is possible that leaves measured during other phenological periods may have responded differently to the environment and ultimately to the treatments imposed herein basile et al 2011 showed that leaf senescence was a function of weighted average midday ψleaf and that the relationship depended on time of year they also reported that the relationship between net carbon assimilation and ψleaf changed with time of year but did not report any data thus it is unclear to what degree this would have impacted individual leaf water relations at the time of measurement indeed grapevine leaf water relations have been shown to change over time and can even acclimate to water deficit conditions martorell et al 2015 however examination of leaf water relations variables reported in the previously cited work across two v vinifera cultivars and two irrigation treatments reveals that there was little change after june in leaf water relations with most water demand and irrigation requirements occurring in july and august it is unlikely that measurements during an earlier time of year would have strongly impacted the results of this study and more importantly their relevance to irrigation scheduling 4 3 operator training it was interesting to find that the effect of operator was significant in all experiments in 2017 and only in one experiment in 2018 considering that operators were different between years but received the same training in each year may suggest that operator training should be improved or simply that the significant differences found herein are not practically different the largest difference between operators was 0 17 mpa averaged across treatments for the re cutting experiment experiment 1 in 2017 the other two differences in 2017 were 0 06 and 0 08 mpa for experiments 2 and 3 respectively given the inherent measurement error found in the literature as previously cited and the accuracy of the instrument gauge as previously referenced it is likely that those differences would not be resolved with more repetition moreover the limited window for making measurements in the field constrains the technician s ability to make multiple measurements on the same plant ultimately it becomes a management decision between vineyard hectares or measurement accuracy however the fact remains that the observation of the endpoint is the most critical aspect of an accurate determination hsiao 1990 therefore training should emphasize this step in the procedure technicians should be familiar with common problems that may arise such as bubbling at the cut surface from air being forced into the leaf through a broken leaf blade or petiole in addition technicians should be familiar with leaf anatomy and physiology so that they understand where to look at the cut surface and that the water level may not rise evenly up through the petiole finally a well trained technician would be able to accurately identify the endpoint by feathering the wetting front through rapid and repeated pressurizations and exhuastions of the chamber in this way the technician can observe the rise and fall of the wetting front in the petiole and accurately determine the endpoint as the balancing pressure required to bring the front to the cut surface 5 conclusions despite a few limitations our results show a straightforward picture of pressure chamber sampling technique first there is no significant effect of re cutting the petiole on ψleaf practically it is likely re cutting may in fact aid the operator in more precisely determining the endpoint by providing a smooth perpendicularly cut surface to observe the rise of xylem sap second up to 30 s of time interval between sample excision and pressurization is acceptable for accurate determination third only 10 min of equilibration time is necessary for accurate ψstem measurement this reduces the inconvenience of waiting or making two trips before measuring ψstem notably the magnitude of error in each experiment fell within the manufactured accuracy of the instrument itself however across all three experiments the effect of the operator stood out as the one of the most important factors affecting ψleaf and ψstem readings thus it is imperative that vineyard managers properly train all technicians to use the pressure chamber if accurate data are desired this involves proper sampling technique sample preparation appropriate and constant pressure increase rate and most importantly proper identification of the endpoint furthermore it may be advisable to have a dedicated operator monitoring specific blocks or ranches to provide consistent information upon which to base irrigation scheduling decisions acknowledgements the author would like to thank k a shackel and m w fidelibus for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript the author would also

11012,despite the fact that the pressure chamber has been used as a tool to assess vine water status and assist in scheduling vineyard irrigation for more than 30 years there remains some disagreement in sampling protocol with respect to midday leaf water potential ψleaf and midday stem water potential ψstem determination therefore the primary goal of this study was to test various sampling protocols associated with the measurement of these two variables specifically experiments were conducted to test the effects of 1 re cutting the petiole prior to placing the leaf in the chamber 2 time span between sample excision and pressurization 3 sample equilibration time on ψstem values and 4 the effect of operator results showed that there was no significant effect of re cutting the petiole on ψleaf values furthermore up to 30 s of time span between sample excision and pressurization was acceptable for accurate ψleaf determinations as long as the sample was kept shaded during that time finally only 10 min of equilibration time was necessary for accurate ψstem determination in most cases the effect of operator on all ψ determinations was greater than any of the sample preparation methods tested this reinforces the need to properly train vineyard technicians in using the pressure chamber however improved flexibility in sampling protocol for either ψleaf or ψstem determinations may improve efficiency of vine water status monitoring in vineyards thus reducing labor costs associated with pressure chamber based irrigation scheduling keywords plant water status water potential sampling protocols water stress pressure chamber 1 introduction the pressure chamber is a widely used tool for the rapid assessment of water potential ψ in both potted and field grown plants hsiao 1990 introduced as an experimental tool by scholander et al scholander et al 1965 the first published reports of its use for the determination of water status in grapevine vitis spp appeared approximately 40 years ago in the field coombe and monk 1979 in pots hardie and considine 1976 soon after the pressure chamber was brought into commercial grape production systems and vine water status was shown to be closely related to aspects of grapevine vegetative growth matthews et al 1987 reproductive growth matthews and anderson 1989 fruit ripening matthews and anderson 1988 and resulting wine sensory characteristics matthews et al 1990 these phenomena have largely been corroborated and extended in recent studies to show that vine water status as measured with a pressure chamber is closely related to soil water content williams and araujo 2002 gas exchange williams 2012 and subsequently vine water use williams et al 2012 accordingly the pressure chamber remains a

pou et al 2014 and dendrometry conesa et al 2016 goldhamer and fereres 2001a despite its near ubiquity in irrigated regions as an irrigation management tool there continues to be disagreement among users about proper pressure chamber technique perhaps most common are disagreements regarding the protocol for sample excision and preparation prior to pressurization specifically the issue of whether or not the leaf petiole should be re cut after excision from the vine is often debated among users a d levin personal communications most users cite turner 1988 who wrote recutting of the petiole of leaf must be avoided as this can lead to error scholander et al 1965 however an examination of scholander et al 1965 who was describing the measurement technique across tree species does not clarify the issue as the authors do not provide any data to substantiate the claim of turner 1988 only writing that when the vessel elements are long a significant amount of sap withdraws from the cut producing a steep rise in the turgor in the leaves if a piece is trimmed off to make the twig fit in the chamber the elevated pressure persists and gives a wrong reading for the tree it is therefore necessary to cut the proper length from the tree and carefully limit the trimming indeed turner 1988 acknowledges that the source errors due to re cutting are not known but there are no data reported another point of contention in procedure relates to the time span sample excision and pressurization initially experiments by turner and long 1980 showed that rapid water loss occurred from leaf samples within 20 to 30 s of excision in uncovered leaves leaves that were not covered with any bag or cheesecloth prior to excision the effect of covering the leaf sample prior to excision has recently been shown to significantly affect the reading particularly under well watered conditions williams 2017 nevertheless there are no data showing how long an operator can hold a covered sample prior to pressurization before significant errors occur most users follow the method of williams and araujo 2002 that states samples are to be pressurized within 15 s of excision however this time interval may be inconvenient under field conditions particularly if the instrument is located far away from the sampled vine finally the appropriate minimum time interval required for sample equilibration in the measurement of stem water potential ψstem has varied widely in the literature cited equilibration times have varied from 24 h begg and turner 1970 mccutchan and shackel 1992 to 90 to 120 min keller et al 2016 williams and araujo 2002 to 10 min fulton et al 2001 prior to sampling of course from a management perspective vine water status monitoring using ψstem would be of lesser flexibility if the appropriate equilibration time were greater than 60 min as technicians would need to bag leaves well in advance of measurement in addition with a lower required equilibration time operators would have a greater ability to repeat measurements as new samples could be chosen and measured while still remaining within the two hour midday window to resolve these discrepancies three experiments we conducted in order to understand how varied techniques affect both ψleaf and ψstem values because the effect of operator has also been shown to strongly affect the reading in almonds goldhamer and fereres 2001b each experiment was also conducted across two operators to characterize this effect in grapevine each experiment was designed to specifically test techniques that has been discordantly described in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites plant material and management two sites were used for this study a mixed cultivar vitis spp table grape vineyard and a v vinifera l cv pinot noir wine grape vineyard both sites were located within the rogue valley american viticultural area of southern oregon the 31 year old table grape vineyard was a demonstration plot planted at the southern oregon research and extension center sorec near central point oregon 42 3304 n 122 9390 w the 8 year old pinot noir vineyard was a commercial site planted near jacksonville oregon 42 3135 n 122 9670 w approximately 3 km away from sorec vines in the table grape vineyard were own rooted and vines in the pinot noir vineyard were grafted onto schwarzmann v riparia x v rupestris rootstock vine and row spacings for the table and wine grape vineyards were 2 44 and 3 65 m and 1 83 and 2 74 m respectively the trellis system used in the table grape vineyard was a geneva double curtain gdc and the trellis in the wine grape vineyard was a vertical shoot positioned vsp system row directions in the table and wine grape vineyards were approximately east west and north south respectively the soil in the table grape vineyard was a central point coarse loamy mixed superactive mesic pachic haploxeroll the soil in the wine grape vineyard was a ruch fine loamy mixed superactive mesic mollic palexeralf the average rooting zone soil ph in the table and wine grape vineyards was 6 5 and 6 0 respectively table grape vines used for this study were einset seedless an interspecific hybrid both vineyards were irrigated weekly with two 2 l hr 1 drip emitters vine 1 and water was applied at 100 of estimated crop evapotranspiration etc for grapes according to values obtained from the weather station located at sorec mdfo agrimet united states bureau of reclamation irrigation was cut off following veraison in mid august at both sites in each year all water potential measurements were made post veraison and pre harvest at both sites in each year 2 2 water potential measurements and operator training the leaves chosen for all measurements were mature fully expanded leaves and all determinations were made between 13 00 to 15 00 h pacific daylight time pdt using the same instrument model 615 pms instrument company albany or for midday leaf water potential ψleaf measurements chosen leaves were exposed to direct full sunlight and were located on the afternoon side of the canopy e g south or west for midday stem water potential ψstem measurements chosen leaves were located on the shaded morning side of the canopy e g north or east within each experiment leaf samples were collected randomly from a set of four to five vines that were all located between trellis line posts for ψleaf samples were placed in a clear plastic bag and excised from the vine with a sharp razor blade within 1 to 2 s s from bagging for ψstem leaf samples were covered with opaque reflective foil laminate bags and were allowed to equilibrate prior to being excised from the vine with a sharp razor blade post excision sample preparation sample bag placement storage location time span between excision and pressurization and sample equilibration time depended on the experiment see details below single leaf replicates were sampled and used for data analyses the same two operators carried out all experiments in each year though they were different between years none of the operators in either year had any previous experience operators sampled leaves from the same vines within each experiment all operators were trained to safely use the instrurment and to identify the endpoint with a magnifying hand lens as the first appearance of water at the cut surface of the petiole as described by hsiao 1990 in addition no more than 2 cm of petiole tissue was allowed to protrude outside the chamber for each determination finally pressure increase rate was kept constant below 0 05 mpa s 1 to minimize error naor and peres 2001 a non stressed baseline value of ψleaf or ψstem was calculated as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd each time ψleaf or ψstem was measured to determine a relative degree of water deficit of grapevines at the time of measurement the non stressed baseline was taken from williams and baeza 2007 where non stressed ψleaf 0 49 0 79 vpd and non stressed ψstem 0 23 0 068 vpd the calculation of vpd was made from measurements of ambient temperature and relative humidity taken by the mdfo weather station located at sorec 2 3 experiment 1 leaf excision and petiole re cutting to test the effect of sample preparation on ψleaf three methods were tested between two operators using the same instrument over two years in the table grape vineyard methods were as follows one cut excising the leaf directly off the vine with a sharp razor blade before pressurization cut and re cut excising the leaf directly off the vine as above then re cutting the petiole before pressurization snap and re cut snapping the leaf off the vine at the leaf stem junction and re cutting the petiole before pressurization sample bags were securely closed and put in the shade to minimize water loss to the atmosphere and the time interval between excision and pressurization was approximately 15 s the one cut treatment was regarded as the control 2 4 experiment 2 time span between excision and pressurization to test the effect of time span between excision and pressurization on ψleaf leaf samples were excised and held for various time intervals prior to pressurization using the same vines and instrument as in experiment 1 the time intervals between excision and pressurization were 15 30 60 120 240 and 600 s sample storage location either in the sun or in the shade prior to pressurization was also evaluated in 2017 only and by only one operator the time span of 15 s was regarded as the control 2 5 experiment 3 equilibration time to test the effect of sample equilibration time on ψstem leaf samples were bagged and allowed to equilibrate for various time intervals in the pinot noir vineyard bags were placed on leaves 240 in 2017 only 120 60 30 15 10 and 5 min prior to determination for 240 120 60 and 30 min treatments bags were placed on leaves at 10 00 12 00 13 00 and 13 30 h pdt respectively for 15 10 and 5 min treatments bags were placed on leaves at 12 45 12 50 and 12 55 h pdt respectively the time interval between excision and pressurization was approximately 15 s the equilibration time of 10 min was regarded as the control 2 6 statistical analyses each experiment was analyzed by two way analysis of variance anova since the operators and number of replications were different in 2017 and 2018 n 3 and 5 for 2017 and 2018 respectively each year was analyzed separately for experiment 1 the design was a completely randomized design crd with a 2 3 factorial treatment structure for experiments 2 and 3 the design was a crd with a split plot factorial treatment structure with operator as the main plot either time span before pressurization or equilibration time as sub plots statistical analyses were done using r statistical software and the base package stats v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 together with the packages lme4 v 1 1 19 bates et al 2015 lmertest v 3 0 1 kuznetsova et al 2017 and emmeans v 1 3 0 lenth 2018 linear models were fit using the lm function for experiment 1 and the lmer function for split plot design in experiments 2 and 3 raw data from experiment 2 were log transformed to meet assumptions of anova reported means and standard errors for experiment 2 are back transformed to original units relative effect sizes were calculated as partial eta squared ηp

calculated using the function emmeans and pairwise comparisions of treatment means were made relative to controls p value multiplicity adjustments were made using the dunnett method p values were considered statistically significant at α 0 05 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 leaf excision and petiole re cutting there were no significant interaction effects between operator and sample preparation method on ψleaf in each year of the study and there were inconsistent main effects between years table 1 the environmental conditions during measurement were different between the two years with warmer and drier conditions in 2017 tair 33 7 c vpd 4 19 kpa compared to those in 2018 tair 27 4 c vpd 2 45 kpa accordingly the experimental vines also experienced a slightly greater water deficit in 2017 compared to 2018 with lower ψleaf values relative to the calculated non stressed baseline ψleaf 0 4 mpa and 0 2 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the main effect of sample preparation method on ψleaf was marginally significant p 0 034 but the main effect of operator was 1 5 fold stronger ηp 2 0 65 and 0 43 for operator and method respectively and highly significant p 0 001 by comparison table 1 averaged across methods operator 1 measured ψleaf values approximately 0 17 mpa lower more negative than operator 2 averaged across operators the snap and re cut method resulted in the highest least negative ψleaf values that were significantly higher than the cut and re cut method whereas the control method one cut resulted in intermediate ψleaf values nevertheless neither of the other two methods resulted in significantly different ψleaf values relative to the control method for either operator in 2018 neither petiole re cutting nor operator significantly affected ψleaf operators were within 0 02 mpa of one another across all sample preparation methods and sample preparation methods were within 0 06 mpa of one another across both operators table 1 notably the snap and re cut method resulted in the lowest most negative ψleaf values for both operators while the control method resulted in the highest least negative 3 2 experiment 2 time span between excision and pressurization 3 2 1 storage location when comparing time span between excision and pressurization across sample storage locations there was a highly significant interaction effect p 0 001 between the location of the sample and the time before pressurization table 2 the storage location of the leaf sample prior to pressurization significantly reduced ψleaf relative to the control but whereas the effect was significant after 60 s for leaves held in the sun it was not significant for leaves held in the shade until 240 s ψleaf decreased with time before pressurization over the entire 10 minute range by 0 52 mpa for leaves that were held in the shade and by 0 93 mpa for leaves that were held in the sun there were no significant differences among time points before 60 s regardless of storage location and measured values in both storage locations were within 0 1 mpa during this time span ultimately most of the decrease in ψleaf occurred after 60 s and was more exaggerated for leaves that were held in the sun 3 2 2 operators when comparing samples held in the shade between operators the effect of time span between excision and pressurization on ψleaf was highly significant p 0 001 in both years of the study table 3 there were significant main and interaction effects with operator in 2017 but no significant effects in 2018 environmental conditions were similar between years tair 25 7 c vpd 1 66 kpa in 2017 tair 25 4 c vpd 2 14 kpa in 2018 though vines were more stressed for water in 2018 relative to 2017 when comparing measured ψleaf values to the calculated non stressed baseline ψleaf 0 05 mpa and 0 28 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the effect size of time span between excision and pressurization was more than 2 fold larger compared to that of operator and nearly 2 fold larger than the interaction effect table 3 time span between excision and pressurization significantly reduced ψleaf values relative to the control at 60 s for operator 2 but values were not significantly different relative to the control until 120 s for operator 1 ψleaf decreased with time span before pressurization over the entire 10 min range by just over 0 5 mpa for both operators but most of the decrease occurred after 60 s in 2018 the effect size of time span between excision and pressurization was more than 262 fold larger compared to that of operator and more than 16 fold larger than the interaction effect table 3 time span between excision and pressurization did not significantly reduce ψleaf values until 240 s for both operators relative to the control 15 s as in 2017 ψleaf decreased over the entire 10 min range by just under 0 5 mpa for both operators and most of the decrease occurred after 60 s 3 3 experiment 3 equilibration time when comparing the effect of operator and sample equilibration time on ψstem both main effects were statistically significant in each year of the study but the interaction effect was inconsistent between years not significant in 2017 but marginally significant in 2018 p 0 044 table 4 while the environmental conditions were slightly warmer and drier in 2018 tair 25 3 c vpd 1 68 kpa in 2017 tair 29 0 c vpd 2 95 kpa in 2018 vines were much more water stressed in 2017 relative to 2018 when comparing measured ψstem values to the calculated non stressed baseline ψstem 0 95 mpa and 0 47 mpa below baseline on average in 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 the effect size of operator on ψstem was similar to effect size for sample equilibration time and both were nearly 2 fold larger than the non signifiant interaction effect table 4 for both operators none of the different equilibration times were significantly different than the control and all were within 0 1 mpa except for operator 2 at 240 min averaged across operators ψstem increased by 0 09 mpa when sample equilibration time increased from 5 min to 4 h differences between operators were statistically significant but were 0 08 mpa when averaged across all time points in 2018 the effect size of operator on ψstem was less than half that of sample equilibration time ηp 2 0 17 and 0 37 for operator and equilibration time respectively but there was a significant though weak ηp 2 0 22 p 0 044 interaction effect table 4 for operator 1 there were no significant differences among equilibration times relative to the control in contrast ψstem values for operator 2 were significantly lower i e more negative than the control at 60 min which was unexpected 4 discussion 4 1 statistical vs physiological vs practical significance of results in the recutting experiment there were no significant differences in the ψleaf reading with different preparation methods relative to the control in either year table 1 experiment 1 nevertheless preparation method was a significant factor in the 2017 anova and larger differences were observed among methods in 2017 for operator 2 in this experiment that ranged from 0 12 to 0 13 mpa this range could be the result of transpiration gradients between sample leaves along the shoot or between shoots on the vine shackel 2007 and is well within the difference between leaves shown for field grown tobacco begg and turner 1970 in this study leaves were randomly sampled from the same general section of the shoot mid canopy but some were sampled across several shoots located at different distances further away from the trunk this could have given rise to the differences in water potential between leaves and should be considered in any follow up studies the fact that petiole re cutting did not consistently nor significantly influence ψleaf for either operator or in either year provides evidence that the method of sample excision and or re cutting does not significantly impact the water potential reading turner 1988 cautioned against re cutting the petiole prior to pressurization due to the introduction of error but reported no data to justify his claim scholander et al 1965 also reported no data regarding errors associated with re cutting but suggested that since cutting breaks the tension in the water column water may fill the remaining tissue of the leaf sample thus increasing turgor and raising ψleaf while this may occur especially in large vesseled vitis spp jacobsen et al 2015 this effect should have been noticed as a consistent trend across both operators and years and would have resulted in higher ψleaf values in the one cut method compared to the other two fulton et al 2001 showed that the 95 confidence interval for ψstem measurements assuming only measurement error with n 3 ranged from 0 06 to 0 08 mpa across three woody perennial crop species prunus domestica p dulcis and juglans regia assuming this to be true for grapevine and for ψleaf and factoring in the accuracy of the instrument gauge itself 0 5 across the 4 0 mpa range equaling 0 02 mpa this reduces the unexplained range to 0 05 mpa this may simply have been due to differences among leaves due to their position in the canopy relative to the trunk as discussed above and it is unclear whether or not a difference of 0 05 mpa is of practical significance in grapevine irrigation scheduling ultimately anticipated differences among sample preparation methods were either not observed were small and not practically significant or did not trend in the direction as suggested in the literature the results of experiment 2 show that one could wait up to two times longer than traditionally thought before pressurizing the sample without sacrificing accuracy most users employ the technique of williams and araujo 2002 and pressurize the leaf sample within 15 s after excision the data herein show that leaf samples could be held up to 30 s before pressurization without losing accuracy and this was true for samples held in the sun or the shade and across operators and two years nevertheless keeping leaves in the sun post sampling increases variability and should ultimately be avoided in general anova showed that time was always a highly significant factor in each year in experiment 2 and the data do undeniably show that ψleaf trends lower with a longer time span between excision and pressurization for some operators in some years the difference in ψleaf from 15 to 60 s approached 0 1 mpa but differences were not statistically significant therefore it is likely that with more replication there would have been statistically significant differences among treatment levels from 15 to 60 s post excision regardless of statistical differences however the practical significance of ψleaf differences 0 1 mpa are unclear particularly given the other built in sources of error that exist due to variation in sample location on the plant and instrument gauge accuracy as discussed above physiologically differences of 0 1 mpa may not matter at very high or very low water status but may become more important for irrigation scheduling decisions if implementing a specific deficit or regulated deficit irrigation program for grapevines that relies on specific threshold ψleaf values romero et al 2010 however our results still indicate that within the first 30 s the effect of time span between excision and pressurization is not a major factor affecting reading accuracy especially considering the low standard error 0 02 0 04 mpa practically this longer time interval may provide the operator with more time to transport prepare the sample in the field potentially reducing errors resulting from hurried preparation overall the response of ψstem to increasing equilibration time was strongly dependent on operator in only one year but the change in values across the entire range of equilibration times was different in each year table 4 in 2017 ψstem values trended higher i e less negative with longer equilibration time for both operators but operator 1 was significantly lower than operator 2 across the whole range operators were also significantly different from one another in 2018 for one operator ψstem values did not change across the whole range of equilibration times but ψstem values trended lower with equilibration time for the other it is likely that this operator simply over shot the endpoint i e stopped pressurization too late hsiao 1990 stresses that the cut end of the petiole should be observed with a magnifying lens and adequate lighting while the operators all received the same training and used a magnifying lens this operator may have somehow shaded the instrument with his body position thus obstructing the appropriate light and making the endpoint difficult to observe this unusual and unexpected result corroborates the findings of goldhamer and fereres 2001b and underscores the impact of operator on water status determination in the field for three of four operators across two years and differing environmental conditions ψstem values were not significantly different from 5 to 120 min corroborating the work of fulton et al 2001 in their study fulton et al 2001 compared a range of short equilibration times 1 to 50 min relative to a control time 2 h across three woody perennial crop species and found that 10 min of equilibration time was sufficient to accurately estimate ψstem in addition fulton et al 2001 used previously shaded leaves inside the tree canopy for their determinations whereas we used leaves located on the morning side of the canopy due to the lack of adequately shaded leaves in the vsp trellis nevertheless given that we found similar results in another woody perennial crop species and also using slightly different leaf samples the results of this study support the conclusion of fulton et al 2001 that 10 min of equilibration time is sufficient for accurate ψstem determination and suggest that equilibration time could be further reduced to 5 min 4 2 some limitations of the study indeed there are two noteworthy limitations of this study s results 1 small sample sizes across experiments and 2 limited measurement dates with respect to vine phenology and environmental conditions a higher degree of measurement accuracy may have been attained with more subsampled leaves per replicate and an undoubtedly higher degree of experimental precision would have been attained with more replication within each experiment little and hills 1978 pg 41 in addition sampling vines at different phenological time points and ultimately different environmental conditions would have taken into account any effects associated with differences in leaf development or physiology or at different levels of soil or atmospheric water deficit in this study a single leaf sample per replicate was used as by williams 2012 and williams and baeza 2007 whereas other studies have subsampled two leaves per replicate keller et al 2016 king and shellie 2016 however considering that all sampled vines within each experiment were the of the same age managed in the same manner and located close to one another it is unclear to what degree further subsampling would have improved accuracy especially considering the aforementioned accuracy of the instrument gauge itself furthermore the small sample size was taken into consideration from 2017 to 2018 when n was increased from 3 to 5 respectively with the anticipation that there would have been more statistically significant differences among treatments however the results show that there were in fact fewer statistically significant differences in 2018 across all experiments all experiments performed in this study occurred during that latter half of the season during the fruit ripening phase post veraison and near harvest at this point in the season shoot elongation has typically ceased few new leaves are produced and existing leaves are mature and fully expanded matthews et al 1987 since irrigation had been cut off before the times of measurement it is likely that all vines were experiencing some degree of soil water deficit though its magnitude ranged across all measurement times in addition measurements occurred across a broad range of vpds from 1 68 to 4 19 kpa whereas water status of well waterd vines responds strongly to changes in vpd vines experiencing a water deficit typically do not williams and baeza 2007 as stomata will close to decrease leaf transpiration and control grapevine water use williams et al 2012 it is possible that leaves measured during other phenological periods may have responded differently to the environment and ultimately to the treatments imposed herein basile et al 2011 showed that leaf senescence was a function of weighted average midday ψleaf and that the relationship depended on time of year they also reported that the relationship between net carbon assimilation and ψleaf changed with time of year but did not report any data thus it is unclear to what degree this would have impacted individual leaf water relations at the time of measurement indeed grapevine leaf water relations have been shown to change over time and can even acclimate to water deficit conditions martorell et al 2015 however examination of leaf water relations variables reported in the previously cited work across two v vinifera cultivars and two irrigation treatments reveals that there was little change after june in leaf water relations with most water demand and irrigation requirements occurring in july and august it is unlikely that measurements during an earlier time of year would have strongly impacted the results of this study and more importantly their relevance to irrigation scheduling 4 3 operator training it was interesting to find that the effect of operator was significant in all experiments in 2017 and only in one experiment in 2018 considering that operators were different between years but received the same training in each year may suggest that operator training should be improved or simply that the significant differences found herein are not practically different the largest difference between operators was 0 17 mpa averaged across treatments for the re cutting experiment experiment 1 in 2017 the other two differences in 2017 were 0 06 and 0 08 mpa for experiments 2 and 3 respectively given the inherent measurement error found in the literature as previously cited and the accuracy of the instrument gauge as previously referenced it is likely that those differences would not be resolved with more repetition moreover the limited window for making measurements in the field constrains the technician s ability to make multiple measurements on the same plant ultimately it becomes a management decision between vineyard hectares or measurement accuracy however the fact remains that the observation of the endpoint is the most critical aspect of an accurate determination hsiao 1990 therefore training should emphasize this step in the procedure technicians should be familiar with common problems that may arise such as bubbling at the cut surface from air being forced into the leaf through a broken leaf blade or petiole in addition technicians should be familiar with leaf anatomy and physiology so that they understand where to look at the cut surface and that the water level may not rise evenly up through the petiole finally a well trained technician would be able to accurately identify the endpoint by feathering the wetting front through rapid and repeated pressurizations and exhuastions of the chamber in this way the technician can observe the rise and fall of the wetting front in the petiole and accurately determine the endpoint as the balancing pressure required to bring the front to the cut surface 5 conclusions despite a few limitations our results show a straightforward picture of pressure chamber sampling technique first there is no significant effect of re cutting the petiole on ψleaf practically it is likely re cutting may in fact aid the operator in more precisely determining the endpoint by providing a smooth perpendicularly cut surface to observe the rise of xylem sap second up to 30 s of time interval between sample excision and pressurization is acceptable for accurate determination third only 10 min of equilibration time is necessary for accurate ψstem measurement this reduces the inconvenience of waiting or making two trips before measuring ψstem notably the magnitude of error in each experiment fell within the manufactured accuracy of the instrument itself however across all three experiments the effect of the operator stood out as the one of the most important factors affecting ψleaf and ψstem readings thus it is imperative that vineyard managers properly train all technicians to use the pressure chamber if accurate data are desired this involves proper sampling technique sample preparation appropriate and constant pressure increase rate and most importantly proper identification of the endpoint furthermore it may be advisable to have a dedicated operator monitoring specific blocks or ranches to provide consistent information upon which to

11013,climate information appears to be underutilized in water stress management in agriculture a systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation measures and the economic value of climate information voi may inform decision making and facilitate the uptake and use of climate information hence we have developed an integrated modeling framework consisting of a statistical climate model a crop rotation model a bio physical process model a portfolio optimization model the computation of the economic value of climate information and a spatial hot spot analysis and applied it to the context of water stress management in crop production in austria results from the integrated modeling framework show that the average economic value of climate information ranges between 13 and 99 ha for austrian cropland depending on the scenario of multi seasonal dry spells and the farmers risk aversion level on average the value of climate information is highest on flat and productive soils for root and oil crops under more extreme multi seasonal dry spells and if farmers are highly risk averse quantifying the value of climate information may guide data provision efforts and highlight agricultural production regions which would particularly benefit from such information to improve water stress management keywords value of information multi

dry spells and droughts can severely affect crop production systems across the world thornton et al 2014 water deficit can limit crop growth development and yields through lower photosynthesis it may thus lead to global food insecurity and substantial agro economic losses if adequate water stress management is absent the magnitude of yield response to dry spells and droughts differs by crop soil texture and intensity and timing of dry spells daryanto et al 2017 daryanto et al 2016 daryanto et al 2015 maize for instance experiences higher yield reductions than wheat under similar water reductions as indicated by a meta analysis of global datasets from historical field experiments daryanto et al 2016 soil texture is an important factor influencing soil water holding capacity and plant available water capacity crops grown on coarse textured soils i e sandy soils tend to be more vulnerable to dry spells and droughts because of low plant available water lal and shukla 2004 however deep and extensive root systems may reduce the vulnerability of crops even on coarse textured soils daryanto et al 2017 2016 johnen et al 2014 impacts are particularly severe when dry spells and droughts occur concomitantly with critical phenological development stages barnabás et al 2008 farooq et al 2009 kadeam et al 2014 in general crops are more vulnerable during their reproductive than during their vegetative stages for instance daryanto et al 2015 show that legume yields are reduced by more than 40 if dry spells and droughts occur during the reproductive stages whereby the early reproductive stage i e flowering is found to be most vulnerable in europe recent dry spell and drought events affected large parts of the continent and had considerable impacts on crop production with substantial economic losses the drought and heat wave in 2003 for instance hit a third of the eu territory including austria maize and wheat were the most damaged crops which resulted in considerable profit cuts garcía herrera et al 2010 in 2013 central europe suffered from a summer drought and heat wave with severe negative impacts on late harvested crops in austria grain maize and soybean yields were about 30 below the long term averages mitter et al 2015c whereby damages varied regionally the drought in 2015 affected much of the european continent and was caused by a combination of precipitation shortages and high temperatures european commission joint research centre 2015 for austria considerable yield reductions were reported for late harvested crops such as maize root crops soybean and sunflower statistics austria 2016 2015 in 2018 central and northern europe experienced a severe drought during the growing season masante et al 2018a 2018b masante and vogt 2018 as well as high crop yield losses north western austria was also affected by a rainfall deficit bussay et al 2018 and thus the austrian government provided financial support for farmers 1 2 projections of dry spells and droughts and information systems for water stress management dry spells and droughts could increase in duration and severity in major agricultural production regions over the next decades as a result of climate change which may lead to even more severe impacts on agricultural production ipcc 2012 even though there are discrepancies in the interpretation of global trends see e g briffa et al 2009 dai 2013 2011 sheffield et al 2012 spinoni et al 2014 van der schrier et al 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has expressed medium confidence that dry spells and droughts will intensify in the 21st century inter alia in the mediterranean region and central europe ipcc 2012 in the alpine region including austria probabilities of dry spells and droughts are shown to increase in the near and long term future albeit the magnitude of change is subject to high uncertainties gobiet et al 2014 haslinger et al 2016 local feedbacks such as land cover change may even enhance and prolong dry spells dai 2011 the likely increase in frequency and severity of dry spells and droughts has stimulated the development of information systems for water stress management currently such systems are available to the public at different scales e g global continental national and with varying spatial and temporal resolutions e g deng et al 2013 horion et al 2012 shah and mishra 2014 sheffiled et al 2013 svoboda et al 2002 trnka 2016 zink et al 2016 for austria a crop specific information system has recently been launched and provides a 10 day forecast on plant available water drought intensity and drought and heat stress eitzinger 2016 substantial advances in near term and seasonal weather and climate forecasts have improved the decision making basis for anticipatory water stress management during the past decades doblas reyes et al 2013 klemm and mcpherson 2017 accordingly farmers interest and uptake has increased for such information see e g zebiak et al 2015 additional efforts have been devoted to projections of dry spells and droughts on inter annual to decadal time scales ionita et al 2017 2012 pozzi et al 2013 schubert et al 2007 strauss et al 2013 despite inherent uncertainties such projections aim at informing climate change adaptation processes on farms and in regions hudson 1972 1 3 economic value of climate information for water stress management voi quantifying the voi is crucial in order to guide climate information collection and processing which helps to reduce uncertainty in agricultural decision making information on dry spells and droughts can be of economic value if its use improves adaptation e g water stress management farm income resource use efficiency e g for water environmental quality e g decline in nutrient and greenhouse gas emissions or efficiency of public expenditure e g disaster fund schubert et al 2007 vaughan and dessai 2014 in decision theory the value of information is defined as the amount a rational actor would be willing to pay to gain this information raiffa and schlaifer 1961 thus it represents the difference between the expected outcome of crop management choices based on prior beliefs i e the initial state of knowledge and when additional information is obtained the level of the voi depends on the initial state of knowledge the quality of the additional information the expected outcome of available adaptation measures and the individuals risk attitude canessa et al 2015 meza et al 2008 the quality of the additional information is however not easy to quantify chavas and pope 1984 and climate information is typically associated with uncertainty because of long lead times and thus never perfect kusunose and mahmood 2016 previous research on the economic value of climate information has focused on seasonal forecasts choi et al 2015 crean et al 2015 mushtaq et al 2012 solís and letson 2013 and much of this work was initiated as a response to the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon letson et al 2009 meza et al 2008 2003 thornton et al 2004 different methodological approaches have been used to study the economic value of climate information for instance solís and letson 2013 employ a multi output input stochastic distance frontier model to analyze the value of climate information for the agricultural sector in the southern u s and find positive effects of seasonal forecasts on agricultural production crean et al 2015 apply a state contingent approach and reveal that the value of seasonal climate forecasts is relatively low for an agricultural production region in australia mainly because of low forecast skill during the time when major crop management decisions e g sowing and fertilizer application dates are taken mushtaq et al 2012 use a non linear programming model to estimate the economic value of water allocation forecasts in southeastern australia showing high benefits from forecasts under water scarcity choi et al 2015 establish an integrated modeling framework and show that seasonal climate forecasts may be beneficial to society by enhancing agricultural and resource use efficiency quiroga et al 2011a b use the certainty equivalence approach and show that both the availability of drought information and risk attitude affect farmers decisions and thus maize and rice production in spain an vo et al 2019 employ an expected profit approach and show that the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for sugarcane irrigation decision making in an australian region increases with more extreme wet or dry climate forecasts despite the interest in climate services has increased in the agricultural sector see e g zebiak et al 2015 information on multi seasonal dry spells and droughts is not yet commonly used for adaptation decision making climate and drought information appears to be underutilized mainly because farmers doubt their relevance and accuracy haigh et al 2015 kusunose and mahmood 2016 a systematic assessment of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective water stress management for adaptation and the voi to advise climate information collection and processing may inform decision making and may thus facilitate the uptake and use of information on multi seasonal dry spells and droughts 1 4 research objectives we develop and apply a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework exemplified by austrian cropland to i investigate impacts of multi seasonal dry spells on crop yields crop gross margins and irrigation water use ii identify optimal crop production portfolios for adaptation iii quantify the voi and iv assess the effect of farmers risk aversion levels the major aim is to provide a methodological approach an integrated modelling framework for quantifying the voi the voi should deepen the understanding on whether it is worth investing in more accurate climate information for water stress management and where and for which agents such information would be most valuable for adaptation decision making we address uncertainties in climate information by considering a distribution of daily weather data for three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells and a period of 30 years the economic value of information has been discussed in the literature despite its potential there are only few applications in agri environmental and climate change adaptation decision making canessa et al 2015 and its level and variability have rarely been examined in an integrated modeling framework the major advantages of our integrated spatially explicit approach are that it allows us to i assess a set of potential adaptation measures ii consider irrigation water use in addition to crop yields and gross margins and iii explicitly address uncertainties in projections of multi seasonal dry spells the article is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the integrated modeling framework which is applied for austrian cropland in section 3 we present results on impacts from multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation to manage water stress in crop production and the computation of the voi we discuss obtained results with respect to the applied integrated modeling framework in section 4 and draw conclusions in section 5 2 integrated modeling framework we combine a statistical climate model for austria strauss et al 2013 the crop rotation model croprota schönhart et al 2011 the bio physical process model epic environmental policy integrated climate model williams 1995 crop gross margin calculations and a portfolio optimization model mitter et al 2015a to calculate the voi for three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells on austrian cropland for each scenario 30 realizations of 30 years periods are considered in order to capture multi seasonal variability and uncertainties total cropland of approximately 1 27 million ha is represented by 40 244 grid cells with a 1 km spatial resolution each cropland grid cell combines information on soil properties mean elevation and slope and thus considers natural heterogeneity schmid 2006 stürmer et al 2013 the integrated modeling framework is illustrated in fig 1 and explained in more detail in the following sections 2 1 statistical climate model for austria three spatially explicit scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells are provided by a statistical climate model for austria considering a period of 30 years strauss et al 2013 the scenarios have been specified based on a dry day index which is combined with block bootstrapping from historically observed daily weather data for the period 1975 2007 strauss et al 2012 the dry day index represents the proportion of the austrian territory which is dry on a random day it ranges between zero if it is raining or snowing in the entire country and one if it is completely dry in the block bootstrapping procedure each month is divided in four blocks of eight or seven days i e each block is limited to a particular month resulting in blocks of eight or seven days depending on the number of days per month the dry day index is calculated for each historical eight and seven day block which is the proportion of total area dry during those days this calculation allows to identify dry and wet blocks for a scenario period of 30 years daily weather data are derived by drawing samples from the historical eight and seven day blocks of a specific month the month specific set up of the sampling procedure was chosen in order to take into account seasonal variation in the weather parameters thus for example blocks from any past september serve as a basis for sampling blocks for september 2035 the block bootstrapping procedure is repeated 30 times in order to consider uncertainties hence a distribution of daily weather data is available at 1 km grid resolution and a period of 30 years i e 30 bootstrapped realizations for each scenario on multi seasonal dry spells with a spatial temporal resolution of 1 km and 1 day the dataset for each realization includes daily weather data for maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for a period of 30 years and thus represents daily and inter annual weather variabilities strauss et al 2013 the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells differ in the projected proportion of dry days and its spatial extents in the reference scenario sdry1 the distribution of the dry day index nearly resembles historically observed values daily weather data for a particular month are randomly sampled from the pool of all historical blocks for the respective month i e each eight or seven day block has an equal probability of being sampled sdry1 can be interpreted as a projection of historically reported dry spells and droughts historically experienced dry spells and droughts are typically argued to be a major information source for water stress management and agricultural adaptation decisions and can be interpreted as the initial state of farmers knowledge in the scenarios on moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spells dry blocks are chosen more frequently such that the situation where nearly the whole country is dry in an eight or seven day block occurs more often than in sdry1 precipitation sums are lower by about 17 in sdry2 and 30 in sdry3 compared to sdry1 on austrian cropland largest reductions in precipitation sums are modelled in sdry3 with about 40 prevailing in the autumn and winter seasons see fig a1 in the appendix and strauss et al 2013 the seasonal variations in precipitation change follow the historical patterns considered in the block bootstrapping procedure in comparison cosmo clm consortium for small scale modeling climate limited area model simulations tailored to the greater alpine region show highest precipitation decreases of about 40 in summer haslinger et al 2016 however this projection until the end of the 21st century depends on the driving general circulation models gcms and emission scenarios the major advantage of the statistical approach over gcms and rcms regional climate models is the spatio temporal and physical consistency of the projected weather parameters for near time climate change and extreme events investigations mishra and singh 2011 strauss et al 2013 2 2 crop rotation model croprota croprota is applied to derive typical crop rotations for each austrian municipality as well as their relative shares on cropland input data to croprota comprise of historically observed crop mixes extracted from the iacs integrated administration and control system database and an agronomic score matrix that values pre crop main crop combinations of 22 crops according to their agronomic suitability considered crops comprise root oil and protein crops winter and spring cereals maize and temporary grassland fallow land is also included croprota maximizes the total value of agronomic suitability over all crop rotations at municipality level in order to generate typical crop rotations and relative shares schönhart et al 2011 up to 22 different crop rotations are derived per municipality they consist of one monoculture to six crops in a sequence and are proportionally assigned to the observed cropland shares at 1 km grid resolution such that spatially explicit crop rotations are available for austrian cropland considering crop rotations acknowledges that crops and crop rotations differ in their effects on soil hydraulic properties and thus water movement for instance infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity may vary by crop rotations see bodner et al 2015 for an extensive review on how crop rotations affect soil hydraulic properties crops that are new to the region are not considered in the crop rotations acknowledging that major system changes are often deferred mitter et al 2018 2 3 bio physical process model epic the environmental policy integrated climate model epic is applied to simulate annual dry matter crop yields and hydrology at 1 km grid resolution for different crop management practices and the 30 bootstrapped realizations for each of the three scenarios sdry1 3 covering a period of 30 years epic builds on theoretically established and empirically verified knowledge on bio physical processes in the soil crop atmosphere system and has been validated extensively both at global and regional scales see e g balkovič et al 2013 chavas et al 2009 eitzinger et al 2013 wang et al 2012 major bio physical processes simulated in epic at daily time steps are among others crop growth evapotranspiration runoff percolation mineralization and nitrification as well as water and wind erosion williams 1995 epic simulates crop biomass accumulation by converting intercepted photo synthetically active radiation through a synthetic coefficient known as radiation use efficiency crop yields are calculated using crop specific harvest indices they define crop yields as a fraction of above ground biomass and are adjusted as water stress occurs other crop growth constraints considered in epic are temperature nutrient aluminum toxicity and aeration stresses major model outputs include dry matter crop yields evapotranspiration surface and sub surface runoff percolation and the number of stress days typical model inputs are data on soil properties topography daily weather parameters and crop characteristics and management izaurralde et al 2006 williams 1995 soil data comprise information on soil texture ph organic carbon coarse fragment calcium carbonate contents and bulk density with up to 7 soil layers which have been extracted from the austrian soil map 2011 elevation and slope data have been derived from the global shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model the statistical climate model for austria as described in 2 1 provides daily weather data for six parameters i e maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for each of the 30 bootstrapped realizations of the three scenarios sdry1 3 potential evapotranspiration is estimated with the penman monteith method monteith 1965 monteith and moss 1977 stockle et al 1992 crop management practices for adaptation include changes in timing of cultivation i e sowing fertilizer application and harvesting dates crop rotations as described in section 2 2 three fertilizer application levels under rain fed conditions and two fertilizer application levels under irrigated conditions timing of cultivation is automatically adjusted in epic to account for inter annual variabilities and changes in seasonal growing conditions it is specified by using fractions of total heat units a crop requires to reach maturity it differs between the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells because temperature increases are higher in more severe scenarios crop rotations are modelled over a period of 30 years and are combined with three fertilizer application levels under rain fed conditions i e high moderate and low and two fertilizer application levels i e high and moderate with sprinkler irrigation i e hirr and mirr fertilizer application levels are crop specific and kept constant among the three scenarios sdry1 3 see table a1 in the appendix they refer to legal standards and policy guidelines such as the guidelines for appropriate fertilization bmlfuw 2006 the action program nitrate bmlfuw 2012 and the special directive öpul bmlfuw 2015 sprinkler irrigation is chosen because it is the technology preferred by austrian farmers bmlfuw 2013 application of irrigation water i e crop management practices hirr and mirr is automatically triggered in epic such that 90 of the crop growth period is water stress free until a total limit of 500 mm per annum is reached a single irrigation activity is limited between 20 and 50 mm the assumptions are based on information from regional water supply cooperatives reisner 2014 wpa beratende ingenieure 2011 because multi year statistical data on irrigation volumes are not available for austria irrigation water is mostly withdrawn from groundwater whereas surface water from lakes rivers or reservoirs is of minor relevance statistics austria 2013 we assume sufficient irrigation water availability across austria because data on groundwater levels and flows and surface water regime are not available for this analysis 2 4 crop gross margin calculation annual crop gross margins are defined as revenues minus variable production costs they are calculated by cropland grid cell crop management practice and bootstrapped realization of the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells sdry1 3 according to equation 1 1 g m i m s c y i c m s p c k c m a m i m s where g m are annual crop gross margins in ha y are annual dry matter crop yields simulated with epic in t ha p are commodity prices from statistics austria averaged over a period of three years 2010 2012 in t k represent variable production costs for standard crop management in austria in ha and a are agricultural policy premiums in ha the index i i 40 244 denotes cropland grid cells containing cropland acreages in ha crops are indexed by c following the typical crop rotations derived by croprota for each grid cell c 22 m represents crop management practices i e fertilizer application levels and irrigation m 5 and s represents annual states of nature consisting of the 30 bootstrapped realizations with periods of 30 years for each scenario sdry1 3 s 900 variable production costs are based on reported levels from bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 and bmlfuw 2008 they apply for rain fed and irrigated conditions and include costs for seeds fertilizers pesticides irrigation fuel electricity repair insurance and labor fertilizer and irrigation costs are derived by multiplying the input levels per hectare simulated with epic by constant nitrogen 1 1 kg phosphorus 1 6 kg and irrigation costs the latter include annualized capital costs for irrigation equipment labor and electricity costs bayerische landesanstalt für landwirtschaft 2017 bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 heumesser et al 2012 it should be noted that groundwater and surface water are currently free of charge for agricultural use in austria unless officially imposed limits are exceeded see wasserrechtsgesetz 1959 labor hours are valued with 10 h the costs typically considered for agricultural workers see bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 agricultural policy premiums comprise of a uniform decoupled payment of 290 ha and agri environmental payments for moderate 50 ha and low fertilizer application levels 115 ha bmlfuw 2015 2009 commodity prices variable production costs annualized capital costs for sprinkler irrigation equipment and policy payments are kept constant in the 30 years period because it allows us to separate effects of multi seasonal dry spells from potential future price dynamics and agricultural policy developments 2 5 portfolio optimization model a non linear mean standard deviation model similar to mean variance model markowitz 1952 1987 is applied to identify optimal crop production portfolios for adaptation i e optimal combinations of crop management practices to reduce adverse developments or take advantage of emerging opportunities due to changes in multi seasonal dry spell conditions portfolio optimization models have been recommend for economic decision making under uncertainty to advance agricultural adaptation because of their structured transparent and replicable way of accounting for variabilities and uncertainties of climate scenarios watkiss et al 2014 the portfolio optimization model maximizes the weighted sum of expected crop gross margins per cropland grid cell as derived from equation 1 and considers a given level of risk which is characterized by the standard deviation of crop gross margins weighted by a risk aversion parameter θ freund 1956 mccarl and spreen 1999 mitter et al 2015a the risk aversion parameter θ represents the number of standard deviations in discounting gross margin expectations farmers risk aversion levels have not yet been systematically analyzed in austria therefore we increase its level in four steps from θ 0 0 t o 2 5 whereby 0 0 may be interpreted that a farmer is risk neutral 1 0 may be interpreted as low 2 0 as moderate and 2 5 as high risk aversion alternatively about 68 95 or 99 of the calculated gross margins g m i m s are within the associated standard deviations of 1 0 2 0 or 2 5 assuming normality the risk aversion parameters can be linked with confidence limits the mean standard deviation model is given by the equation system in 2 8 see mccarl and spreen 1999 it derives crop production portfolios for the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells sdry1 3 independently for each 1 km cropland grid cell i and risk aversion parameter level θ five crop management practices are considered in the crop production portfolios i e high moderate low hirr and mirr these crop management practices can be easily implemented by farmers in response to changes in multi seasonal dry spells see section 2 3 the portfolio optimization model does not allow for changes in land cover i e it is assumed that the total cropland area remains the same in the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells by applying a mean standard deviation model we implicitly assume constant absolute risk aversion as well as a normal distribution of crop gross margins in order to be consistent with the expected utility framework chavas 2004 2 m a x z i t g m i θ s 1 s d i s 2 d i s 2 1 2

definition equal to the standard deviation θ refers to the risk aversion parameter x represents the hectare shares that each crop management practice m realizes in the portfolio of each cropland grid cell i the equality constraint equation 3 assures that the hectare shares of crop management practices in the portfolio have to sum up to the cropland endowment b in the cropland grid cells gm are annual crop gross margins per ha stratified by i m and s see equation 1 equation 4 aggregates annual crop gross margins per ha multiplied by x to t g m by cropland grid cell i and state of nature s 2 6 computing the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi we obtain the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi or the value of improved quality of climate information by comparing optimal crop management choices i e perfect adaptation under improved climate information i e sdry2 and sdry3 to that resulting from a reference climate information i e sdry1 the underlying assumption is that crop management choices in sdry2 and sdry3 would be based on the reference scenario sdry1 if additional information on multi seasonal dry spells was not available sdry1 represents the reference climate information which is based on the historical climatology based on the results from the portfolio optimization model the voi is quantified in two steps first we derive optimal crop production portfolios in sdry1 sdry2 and sdry3 second differences in expected values of gross margins and corresponding standard deviations are calculated between optimal crop production portfolios realized in sdry2 or sdry3 i e sdry2 3 in equation 9 and optimal crop production portfolios realized in sdry1 evaluated in sdry2 or sdry3 i e sdry2 3 in equation 9 respectively the average annual voi in ha is finally computed as described in equation 9 and is always positive or zero 9 v o i i s d r y 2 3 z i s d r y 2 3 m x i m s d r y 2 3 z i s d r y 2 3 m x i m s d r y 1 i 2 7 spatial analysis spatial variability of the voi i e its distribution across agricultural production regions indicates where information on multi seasonal dry spells would be most relevant to inform adaptation we use the getis ord gi statistics getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 to identify significant clusters of high and low voi by multi seasonal dry spell scenario and risk aversion parameter level regions of particular interest i e hot spots are determined based on the calculations of the voi at cropland grid cell level we choose a fixed euclidean distance band of 15 km for modeling spatial relationships the fixed distance band is chosen such that each cropland grid cell has at least one neighbor and to show medium scale patterns where high low voi concentrate a false discovery rate fdr correction is applied in order to account for multiple testing and spatial dependency benjamini and hochberg 2000 1995 caldas de castro and singer 2006 hot and cold spots of the voi are identified at a significance level of 0 01 3 results results from the portfolio optimization model for the total austrian cropland of approximately 1 27 million ha are presented in section 3 1 the model results show how crop yields gross margins and irrigation water use are affected in the reference scenario sdry1 and the scenarios on moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spells if scenario information and risk aversion parameter levels are considered in optimal crop management choices we assume that managed cropland including fallow land remains constant in the 30 years period the voi is presented in section 3 2 for four risk aversion parameter levels at national and regional cropland levels and indicates where scenario information on multi seasonal dry spells is more valuable for adapting crop management practices furthermore implications of scenario information uptake are explored for agricultural production gross margins and irrigation water use 3 1 efficient crop production portfolios under multi seasonal dry spell conditions 3 1 1 dry matter crop yields and gross margins at national level we find that area weighted annual averages of dry matter crop yields are similar in the reference sdry1 moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells regardless of the risk aversion parameter level according to the model results they are about 7 t ha if crop production portfolios are optimized for multi seasonal dry spell conditions table 1 this indicates that total crop production can be kept almost constant if information is available and used for adaptation decision making the spatial variability of dry matter crop yields is slightly higher under sdry2 3 compared to sdry1 model results show that dry matter crop yields increase slightly in sdry2 3 on between 53 and 67 of the total cropland area compared to sdry1 crops benefit of higher mean temperatures and the co2 fertilization effect where water is not limiting during the growing season i e mostly in western austria slight decreases in dry matter crop yields are found in selected cropland grid cells in the semi arid eastern parts of the country where water is limiting crop growth table a2 and fig a2 in the appendix average annual gross margins are between 422 ha sdry3 under high risk aversion and 515 ha sdry1 under risk neutrality and decrease under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions compared to sdry1 average gross margins are about 6 lower in sdry2 and about 12 lower in sdry3 which reveals potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells even though information is used for adapting crop production portfolios table 1 however model results show high spatial disparities we find that gross margins increase in sdry2 sdry3 on about 42 30 of the total cropland compared to sdry1 highest increases are found in the western parts of the country with alpine climate whereas highest decreases appear in the semi arid eastern parts of austria due to irrigation costs table a3 and fig a3 in the appendix compared to risk neutrality average gross margins decrease under low moderate high risk aversion between 1 4 and 2 1 5 2 and 6 1 6 6 and 7 4 depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells 3 1 2 crop management for adaptation optimal crop production portfolios under multi seasonal dry spell conditions are identified for four levels of risk aversion at cropland grid cell level they are summarized for two major agricultural production regions i e the north eastern plains and the alpine foothills which represent almost two thirds of the austrian cropland fig a4 in the appendix it should be noted that the agricultural production regions have been developed based on bio physical conditions topography and dominant farm types wagner 1990a 1990b the north eastern plains are characterized by semi arid climate fertile soils and cash crop farms in the alpine foothills altitude and precipitation sums increase from north to south and animal husbandry and field forage production dominate bmlfuw 2017 in the north eastern plains optimal crop management combinations change considerably with risk aversion and the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells under risk neutrality crop production portfolios including moderate fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions i e moderate are most important in the reference sdry1 and the moderate sdry2 scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells whereas moderate fertilization intensity under irrigated conditions i e mirr prevails in the scenario on severe multi seasonal dry spells sdry3 the share of moderate fertilization intensity on rain fed cropland is between 20 and 66 in sdry1 and between 1 and 11 in sdry3 moderate fertilization intensity combined with irrigation is applied on 15 19 of the cropland in sdry1 and on 54 64 of the cropland in sdry3 with risk aversion low fertilization intensity rain fed i e low and high fertilization intensity irrigated i e hirr gain in importance indicating that risk aversion may lead to either extensification or intensification furthermore diversification increases with risk aversion and more crop production portfolios include three or more crop management practices table 2 and fig a5 in the appendix in the alpine foothills crop production portfolios including moderate or high fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions either as single management strategy or as part of the portfolio are most important regardless of the risk aversion parameter level and the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells moderate fertilization intensity rain fed is chosen on between 28 sdry2 under high risk aversion and 51 sdry1 under risk neutrality of the cropland the share of high fertilization intensity rain fed i e high on cropland is between 34 sdry3 under high risk aversion and 48 sdry2 under low risk aversion low fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions increases in importance with risk aversion and is employed on between 2 sdry1 under risk neutrality and 17 of the cropland sdry1 under high risk aversion combinations of low fertilization intensity with alternative management practices are more relevant with high risk aversion and under more severe multi seasonal dry spell conditions sdry2 3 indicating that portfolio diversification increases the share of irrigated cropland also increases with risk aversion and under sdry2 3 whereby irrigation is more often applied with high fertilizer inputs on up to 15 of the cropland than with moderate fertilizer inputs on up to 6 of the cropland table 2 and fig a5 in the appendix 3 1 3 irrigation water use on cropland impacts of multi seasonal dry spell scenarios on irrigated cropland and irrigation water use are examined for optimal crop production portfolios i e after adaptation measures have been considered model results show that the share of irrigated cropland increases substantially in the moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spell scenarios particularly in the semi arid eastern parts of austria fig a6 in the appendix compared to the reference scenario sdry1 irrigated cropland is between 1 9 and 3 1 2 6 and 5 6 times higher in sdry2 sdry3 model results also reveal that the share of irrigated cropland rises with risk aversion compared to risk neutrality the share of irrigated cropland is between 1 3 and 2 8 times higher with high risk aversion whereby increases are highest under sdry1 area weighted average annual water use on irrigated cropland increases in sdry2 and sdry3 compared to sdry1 but decreases with risk aversion table 3 irrigation water productivity defined as the change in crop yield per unit of irrigation water use see abdullaev and molden 2004 li et al 2016 molden 1997 has been analyzed at national level we have compared average area weighted crop yields on irrigated cropland if irrigation is considered in the portfolio optimization i e crop management practices hirr and mirr as presented in 3 1 2 with average area weighted crop yields that can be achieved if irrigation is not available we find that average crop yields increase between 1 5 and 1 8 kg per m³ irrigation water whereby higher increases are found for high risk aversion and under more severe scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells 3 2 economic value of climate information for water stress management voi 3 2 1 national cropland level information on multi seasonal dry spells needs to be available for efficient crop management adaptation if information is lacking we assume that the choice of crop production portfolios would be based on the reference scenario sdry1 even under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions sdry2 3 for austria the model results show that the average voi is higher if multi seasonal dry spells are expected to increase in severity and frequency and if farmers are more risk averse depending on the risk aversion parameter level θ the voi is between 13 and 33 ha in scenario sdry2 and between 57 and 99 ha in scenario sdry3 table 4 average annual dry matter crop yields are about 4 sdry2 and between 11 and 13 sdry3 higher if information on multi seasonal dry spells is accessed for crop management choices compared to the situation where this information is not available similarly average gross margins are up to 3 sdry2 and between 5 and 14 sdry3 higher with information on multi seasonal dry spells the share of irrigated cropland and the area weighted average annual water use on irrigated cropland are also affected if additional information on multi seasonal dry spells is used for crop management choices the area weighted average annual irrigation water use decreases between 10 high risk aversion under sdry2 3 and 27 risk neutral under sdry3 if crop management choices are based on multi seasonal dry spell scenario information compared to the situation where this information is not available this is because of an increase in the share of irrigated cropland in general and an increase in cropland with comparably low irrigation water use in particular irrigation water productivity decreases between 0 21 kg m³ in sdry2 and 0 76 kg m³ in sdry3 compared to sdry1 if information on multi seasonal dry spells is not used for irrigation management 3 2 2 regional cropland level spatial disparities in the annual voi display where information on multi seasonal dry spells is more or less beneficial to inform adaptation fig 2 and fig a7 in the appendix results from the spatial analysis reveal that the voi follows climate topographic and soil gradients hot spots with values above 150 ha are concentrated in the semi arid eastern parts of austria which are characterized by flat and fertile soils such high values are also found in some inner alpine valleys particularly under risk neutrality θ 0 0 cold spots with values of 50 ha or less are found in the hilly and mountainous western parts of the country with alpine climate regardless of the risk aversion parameter level modelled changes in crop yields are often positive or only slightly negative in these regions because water is not limiting crop growth see section 3 1 1 and fig a2 in the appendix however the voi shows a rising trend in western austria under more severe multi seasonal dry spell conditions indicating that scenario information gains in importance across the country if the voi equals zero crop management choices are deemed to be robust to a range of plausible scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells cropland grid cells with a voi of 0 ha are found in the hilly and mountainous western parts of austria mainly under risk neutrality in these regions crop production portfolios are robust and do not change with additional information on multi seasonal dry spells average annual voi has been calculated by soil type altitude slope and crop group in order to show how site conditions and crops affect its level brown earth i e cambisol and luvisol black soil i e chernozem and phaeozem and pseudogley i e stagnosol are the three major soil types and represent about 75 of austrian cropland average annual voi is highest on black soils which are typically rich in humus and offer good growing conditions for crops i e between 29 and 145 ha depending on the multi seasonal dry spell scenario and the risk aversion parameter level the productivity of pseudogley and brown earth for crop production is generally lower than for black soils average voi for pseudogley is similar to the national averages between 6 and 107 ha those for brown earth are between 5 and 64 ha in sdry3 table 5 with respect to topography we find that average annual voi is highest in flat regions and at low altitudes where cropland is preferably located almost three quarters of the austrian cropland is found on plains with slopes below 5 average voi for plains are above the national averages they are between 17 and 116 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the voi decreases with increasing steepness for instance average values for slopes between 5 and 10 are between 32 and 57 of those for plains however voi exceed 50 ha on slopes between 10 and 15 under severe multi seasonal dry spells sdry3 and high risk aversion table a4 in the appendix in lowland altitude below 300 m where about 46 of the cropland is located average annual voi is between 26 and 163 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the average values for cropland decrease with higher altitudes for altitudes between 300 and 600 m 600 and 1100 m they are between 11 and 33 4 and 7 of the values for lowland table a5 in the appendix we define dominant crop groups if crops in the rotation belonging to a specific crop group are grown in at least 16 out of 30 years on a particular cropland grid cell average annual voi is highest for root and oil crops which indicates that scenario information on multi seasonal dry spells is of particular importance if the share of root and oil crops in the rotation should be increased their major production regions are in eastern austria where a regional hot spot of the voi has been identified fig 2 average voi for root and oil crops is clearly above the national average i e between 16 and 301 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level average values for maize are around the national averages and above those for cereals protein crops and perennial grassland which reflects that maize is more sensitive to water reductions lowest values between 2 and 17 ha are found for perennial grass table 6 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi our analysis shows that the average voi is highest on flat and productive soils for root and oil crops under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions and if farmers are highly risk averse average annual values for austrian cropland range between 13 and 99 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the calculated average annual voi amounts to between 2 and 17 of the average income of cash crop farms in austria in 2017 which is approximately 600 ha bmnt 2018 the voi results can be interpreted as an upper bound this is because we assume that accurate information on multi seasonal dry spells is available disseminated and fully used by farmers to inform water stress management in crop production in our analysis in reality however the voi is affected by uncertainties in projections on multi seasonal dry spells farmers limited access to and utilization of information and their limited flexibility in decision making our voi results seem to be reasonable compared to other studies on the economic value of information using different methodological approaches for instance meza and wilks 2003 estimate the economic value of perfect forecast for seasonal sea surface temperature to range between 13 ha 11 ha and 243 ha 202 ha depending on cultivated crops and soil conditions mushtaq et al 2012 find that the value of improved seasonal water allocation forecasts is between 1 and 6 ha for different levels of risk aversion at farm level cabrera et al 2007 show that the average value of enso based climate information is between 3 ha 2 5 ha and 25 ha 21 ha for different levels of risk aversion the hot and cold cropland spots of the voi are clearly influenced by a combination of soil topographic and climate conditions affecting crop and crop management choices hot spots for instance are concentrated in the semi arid eastern parts of austria where fertile black soils are dominating and root crops which typically materialize high gross margins are important in the crop rotation similar to our findings on the voi which is higher in semi arid regions and under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions mushtaq et al 2012 show higher benefits from additional information under water scarcity and an vo et al 2019 report higher gains from extreme wet and dry than from moderate seasonal forecasts by contrast choi et al 2015 reveal that the value of climate information is lower under extreme drought conditions compared to favorable climate conditions this is mainly because of production and welfare transfers outside the country which have not been considered in our analysis choi et al 2015 also show that irrigation water use decreases if climate information is available and farmers adjust crop mixes however our analysis shows an increase in total irrigation water use on austrian cropland if drought information is available which results from changes from rain fed under reference climate conditions to irrigated agriculture under moderate and extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions in large parts of the country in our analysis the average annual voi is higher on flat and fertile soils and decreases substantially with slope and altitude this seems reasonable because soil properties and topography are closely related to crops dominant in the crop rotation a high share of root and oil crops is specific to the flat and productive crop production regions in eastern and north western austria where hot spots of the average annual voi are located root and oil crops show highest average values of climate information in our analysis followed by maize cereals protein crops and perennial grassland this finding is in line with previous studies indicating that the value of perfect information is on average higher for root crops such as potato and sugar beet than for cereals such as wheat and oat meza et al 2003 meza and wilks 2003 maize typically experiences higher yield reductions than cereals if water is limiting daryanto et al 2016 which may explain its higher average voi exceptions are however found for specific soil characteristics meza et al 2003 indicating the importance to consider spatial heterogeneities in such analyses risk aversion leads to a higher average voi in our analysis which is also confirmed by other studies for instance letson et al 2009 and cabrera et al 2007 find that risk aversion increases the value of information on the enso phenomenon and show that its effect is higher for land owners than for tenants similarly quiroga et al 2011a show that accurate information about drought probability is of higher value for risk averse actors however in many cases the effect of scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells has a higher impact on the voi than the level of risk aversion in our analyses 4 2 discussion of the integrated modeling framework we present a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework for austrian cropland that integrates bio physical and socio economic data and models to calculate the voi for different scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells and risk aversion parameter levels a broad range of aspects is considered in our analysis including scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells soil and topographic conditions adaptation measures to dry spells and farmers risk aversion levels with respect to the accuracy of the integrated modeling framework we refer to several national and regional analyses that have been carried out with the statistical climate model for austria the crop rotation model croprota and the bio physical process model epic see e g feusthuber et al 2017 heumesser et al 2012 kirchner et al 2015 mitter et al 2015a 2015b schönhart et al 2014 2011 strauss et al 2013 stürmer et al 2013 these studies are considered as input validation of the portfolio optimization model and the computation of the voi however our approach has limitations because of underlying assumptions and aspects that have not been incorporated in the analysis yet above all we consider selected crop management practices for adapting to water stress in our analysis and assume high flexibility of farming systems in the portfolio optimization model furthermore optimal crop management choices at a spatial resolution of 1 km as derived from our analysis may be the result of choices made at several different farms limiting the representativeness of the model results for particular farms or farming systems we chose to investigate timing of cultivation and crop rotations as well as fertilizer and irrigation water application levels because of their high potential of adoption on austrian farms mitter et al 2019 2018 however a wide spectrum of soil and plant related measures has been identified effective for crop management under dry conditions including for instance crop stand management alternative tillage systems progress in breeding and changes in land cover bodner et al 2015 considering additional adaptation measures would allow for more flexibility in crop management choices in the portfolio optimization model and would likely increase portfolio diversification particularly under high risk aversion another aspect yet to be explored are potential irrigation water constraints in the future which could necessitate the reversion of irrigated to rain fed management see e g elliott et al 2014 schewe et al 2014 currently we consider sprinkler irrigation as the preferred irrigation technology in austria bmlfuw 2013 and assume that irrigation water supply is not limited more efficient technologies such as precision irrigation could help to save water decrease resource depletion and reduce detrimental impacts of multi seasonal dry spells on agricultural productivity perea et al 2017 however their nationwide implementation may require long lead times because of high investment costs see e g heumesser et al 2012 which we include as annualized capital costs in the gross margin calculations additionally the financial situation and debt levels of farms may be determining for irrigation implementation which are both not considered in our analysis comparing irrigation water use to available resources from rivers lakes and groundwater aquifers would enable us to identify regions most vulnerable to water scarcity in these regions we would expect a higher average voi similar to the findings of mushtaq et al 2012 we assume that farmers access and take up information on multi seasonal dry spells to inform their adaptation decisions however previous research suggests that climate and drought information is underutilized by farmers and the use of climate services further declines with higher uncertainties greater lead times and low adaptive capacity hansen et al 2011 2004 kusunose and mahmood 2016 the role of knowledge brokers working as intermediaries between producers and users of climate and drought information has been emphasized in order to increase information uptake and knowledge transfer in agriculture dilling and lemos 2011 kirchhoff et al 2013 zebiak et al 2015 our systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation measures and the voi may facilitate information brokering and uptake to realize the evident adaptation potential in any integrated modelling activity uncertainty regarding data and models which accumulate steadily over each step of the modeling process has to be kept in mind walker et al 2003 wilby and dessai 2010 this may include uncertainties in model quantities such as input data and parameters i e technical uncertainties model form i e methodological uncertainties and model completeness i e epistemological uncertainties pruyt 2007 for instance model inter comparison studies at global scale have revealed considerable uncertainties as to how effects of temperature and precipitation extremes are represented in bio physical process models asseng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 a recent publication suggests that the majority of models underestimates agricultural impacts from extreme heat waves dry spells and droughts schewe et al 2019 for epic previous studies showed that it can satisfactorily reproduce soil dynamics and crop yield responses to heat waves dry spells and droughts at regional to national levels easterling et al 1996 van der velde et al 2012 however epic results have been found to be less reliable but still credible under precipitation extremes than under temperature extremes easterling et al 1996 furthermore we neglect water constraints for irrigation thus the portfolio optimization model results likely overestimate the choice of irrigation on cropland which likely leads to and overestimation of the average annual voi as well we disregard changes in input and output prices future market developments and international trade dynamics despite controversial debates see e g hampicke 2011 we adopt a partial approach because it enables us to separate impacts from multi seasonal dry spells from price market and trade dynamics ciscar et al 2011 however we would expect an intensification of crop production portfolios and a higher average annual voi with increasing output prices as suggested by global economic models nelson et al 2014 von lampe et al 2014 5 summary and conclusions we have analyzed how scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells affect dry matter crop yields gross margins and irrigation water use in austria model results show that total dry matter crop yields are around 8 75 million t and similar in the reference sdry1 moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 scenarios this is mainly because of a switch from rain fed to irrigated agriculture in major production regions under more extreme scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells which results in a 3 to 6fold increase in irrigation water use in sdry2 3 compared to sdry1 total gross margins are between 6 and 13 lower under more extreme scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells compared to the reference scenario reductions in total gross margins are due to higher costs e g for irrigation water and lower agricultural policy premiums e g due to intensification information on multi seasonal dry spells is required to facilitate agricultural adaptation and water stress management the economic value of information voi represents the net benefit of adapting crop production portfolios to multi seasonal dry spell conditions and reflects the opportunity costs of not having the information available for decision making quantifying the voi may help to direct climate data provision guide regional water governance and drought policy efforts and to highlight agricultural production regions which would particularly benefit from such information model results reveal that the average voi increases under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions and with farmers risk aversion these results suggest that information on multi seasonal dry spells gains in importance with the projected increase in frequency and severity of dry spells and droughts in the alpine region in the 21st century the voi is even higher if farmers risk aversion rises due to uncertainty in dry spell and drought conditions such an increase in risk aversion seems reasonable because of empirically based evidence for both an increase in risk aversion with climate induced risks as well as negative correlations between risk aversion and mean annual precipitation sums see alpizar et al 2011 bezabih and sarr 2012 di falco 2014 the voi is also related to site conditions and crops our spatially explicit results suggest that the highly productive flat regions in the semi arid eastern parts of austria where cropland is the dominating land cover would benefit most of additional information on multi seasonal dry spells crop specific information on multi seasonal dry spells would be most desirable for root and oil crops indicating that the relevance of information increases if root and oil crops should gain in importance in the crop rotation such crop and site specific information may be valuable for farmers water resource managers policy makers and other agricultural stakeholders at national and regional scales especially in the context of likely increasing frequency and severity of multi seasonal dry spells under climate change the spatially explicit integrated modeling framework allows to systematically analyze impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells on agricultural production gross margins and irrigation water use to identify effective adaptation measures for crop production and to quantify the voi while explicitly addressing uncertainty the results may improve the provision uptake and use of information on multi seasonal dry spells for adaptation decision making facilitate the development of water management plans and guide the design of structured information monitoring and evaluation processes for adaptation to multi seasonal dry spells and droughts

11013,climate information appears to be underutilized in water stress management in agriculture a systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation measures and the economic value of climate information voi may inform decision making and facilitate the uptake and use of climate information hence we have developed an integrated modeling framework consisting of a statistical climate model a crop rotation model a bio physical process model a portfolio optimization model the computation of the economic value of climate information and a spatial hot spot analysis and applied it to the context of water stress management in crop production in austria results from the integrated modeling framework show that the average economic value of climate information ranges between 13 and 99 ha for austrian cropland depending on the scenario of multi seasonal dry spells and the farmers risk aversion level on average the value of climate information is highest on flat and productive soils for root and oil crops under more extreme multi seasonal dry spells and if farmers are highly risk averse quantifying the value of climate information may guide data provision efforts and highlight agricultural production regions which would particularly benefit from such information to improve water stress management keywords value of information multi seasonal dry spell and drought climate change adaptation integrated modeling portfolio optimization irrigation water use 1 introduction 1 1 impacts of dry spells and droughts on crops and agro economy dry spells and droughts can severely affect crop production systems across the world thornton et al 2014 water deficit can limit crop growth development and yields through lower photosynthesis it may thus lead to global food insecurity and substantial agro economic losses if adequate water stress management is absent the magnitude of yield response to dry spells and droughts differs by crop soil texture and intensity and timing of dry spells daryanto et al 2017 daryanto et al 2016 daryanto et al 2015 maize for instance experiences higher yield reductions than wheat under similar water reductions as indicated by a meta analysis of global datasets from historical field experiments daryanto et al 2016 soil texture is an important factor influencing soil water holding capacity and plant available water capacity crops grown on coarse textured soils i e sandy soils tend to be more vulnerable to dry spells and droughts because of low plant available water lal and shukla 2004 however deep and extensive root systems may reduce the vulnerability of crops even on coarse textured soils daryanto et al 2017 2016 johnen et al 2014 impacts are particularly severe when dry spells and droughts occur concomitantly with critical phenological development stages barnabás et al 2008 farooq et al 2009 kadeam et al 2014 in general crops are more vulnerable during their reproductive than during their vegetative stages for instance daryanto et al 2015 show that legume yields are reduced by more than 40 if dry spells and droughts occur during the reproductive stages whereby the early reproductive stage i e flowering is found to be most vulnerable in europe recent dry spell and drought events affected large parts of the continent and had considerable impacts on crop production with substantial economic losses the drought and heat wave in 2003 for instance hit a third of the eu territory including austria maize and wheat were the most damaged crops which resulted in considerable profit cuts garcía herrera et al 2010 in 2013 central europe suffered from a summer drought and heat wave with severe negative impacts on late harvested crops in austria grain maize and soybean yields were about 30 below the long term averages mitter et al 2015c whereby damages varied regionally the drought in 2015 affected much of the european continent and was caused by a combination of precipitation shortages and high temperatures european commission joint research centre 2015 for austria considerable yield reductions were reported for late harvested crops such as maize root crops soybean and sunflower statistics austria 2016 2015 in 2018 central and northern europe experienced a severe drought during the growing season masante et al 2018a 2018b masante and vogt 2018 as well as high crop yield losses north western austria was also affected by a rainfall deficit bussay et al 2018 and thus the austrian government provided financial support for farmers 1 2 projections of dry spells and droughts and information systems for water stress management dry spells and droughts could increase in duration and severity in major agricultural production regions over the next decades as a result of climate change which may lead to even more severe impacts on agricultural production ipcc 2012 even though there are discrepancies in the interpretation of global trends see e g briffa et al 2009 dai 2013 2011 sheffield et al 2012 spinoni et al 2014 van der schrier et al 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has expressed medium confidence that dry spells and droughts will intensify in the 21st century inter alia in the mediterranean region and central europe ipcc 2012 in the alpine region including austria probabilities of dry spells and droughts are shown to increase in the near and long term future albeit the magnitude of change is subject to high uncertainties gobiet et al 2014 haslinger et al 2016 local feedbacks such as land cover change may even enhance and prolong dry spells dai 2011 the likely increase in frequency and severity of dry spells and droughts has stimulated the development of information systems for water stress management currently such systems are available to the public at different scales e g global continental national and with varying spatial and temporal resolutions e g deng et al 2013 horion et al 2012 shah and mishra 2014 sheffiled et al 2013 svoboda et al 2002 trnka 2016 zink et al 2016 for austria a crop specific information system has recently been launched and provides a 10 day forecast on plant available water drought intensity and drought and heat stress eitzinger 2016 substantial advances in near term and seasonal weather and climate forecasts have improved the decision making basis for anticipatory water stress management during the past decades doblas reyes et al 2013 klemm and mcpherson 2017 accordingly farmers interest and uptake has increased for such information see e g zebiak et al 2015 additional efforts have been devoted to projections of dry spells and droughts on inter annual to decadal time scales ionita et al 2017 2012 pozzi et al 2013 schubert et al 2007 strauss et al 2013 despite inherent uncertainties such projections aim at informing climate change adaptation processes on farms and in regions hudson 1972 1 3 economic value of climate information

decline in nutrient and greenhouse gas emissions or efficiency of public expenditure e g disaster fund schubert et al 2007 vaughan and dessai 2014 in decision theory the value of information is defined as the amount a rational actor would be willing to pay to gain this information raiffa and schlaifer 1961 thus it represents the difference between the expected outcome of crop management choices based on prior beliefs i e the initial state of knowledge and when additional information is obtained the level of the voi depends on the initial state of knowledge the quality of the additional information the expected outcome of available adaptation measures and the individuals risk attitude canessa et al 2015 meza et al 2008 the quality of the additional information is however not easy to quantify chavas and pope 1984 and climate information is typically associated with uncertainty because of long lead times and thus never perfect kusunose and mahmood 2016 previous research on the economic value of climate information has focused on seasonal forecasts choi et al 2015 crean et al 2015 mushtaq et al 2012 solís and letson 2013 and much of this work was initiated as a response to the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon letson et al 2009 meza et al 2008 2003 thornton et al 2004 different methodological approaches have been used to study the economic value of climate information for instance solís and letson 2013 employ a multi output input stochastic distance frontier model to analyze the value of climate information for the agricultural sector in the southern u s and find positive effects of seasonal forecasts on agricultural production crean et al 2015 apply a state contingent approach and reveal that the value of seasonal climate forecasts is relatively low for an agricultural production region in australia mainly because of low forecast skill during the time when major crop management decisions e g sowing and fertilizer application dates are taken mushtaq et al 2012 use a non linear programming model to estimate the economic value of water allocation forecasts in southeastern australia showing high benefits from forecasts under water scarcity choi et al 2015 establish an integrated modeling framework and show that seasonal climate forecasts may be beneficial to society by enhancing agricultural and resource use efficiency quiroga et al 2011a b use the certainty equivalence approach and show that both the availability of drought information and risk attitude affect farmers decisions and thus maize and rice production in spain an vo et al 2019 employ an expected profit approach and show that the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for sugarcane irrigation decision making in an australian region increases with more extreme wet or dry climate forecasts despite the interest in climate services has increased in the agricultural sector see e g zebiak et al 2015 information on multi seasonal dry spells and droughts is not yet commonly used for adaptation decision making climate and drought information appears to be underutilized mainly because farmers doubt their relevance and accuracy haigh et al 2015 kusunose and mahmood 2016 a systematic assessment of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective water stress management for adaptation and the voi to advise climate information collection and processing may inform decision making and may thus facilitate the uptake and use of information on multi seasonal dry spells and droughts 1 4 research objectives we develop and apply a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework exemplified by austrian cropland to i investigate impacts of multi seasonal dry spells on crop yields crop gross margins and irrigation water use ii identify optimal crop production portfolios for adaptation iii quantify the voi and iv assess the effect of farmers risk aversion levels the major aim is to provide a methodological approach an integrated modelling framework for quantifying the voi the voi should deepen the understanding on whether it is worth investing in more accurate climate information for water stress management and where and for which agents such information would be most valuable for adaptation decision making we address uncertainties in climate information by considering a distribution of daily weather data for three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells and a period of 30 years the economic value of information has been discussed in the literature despite its potential there are only few applications in agri environmental and climate change adaptation decision making canessa et al 2015 and its level and variability have rarely been examined in an integrated modeling framework the major advantages of our integrated spatially explicit approach are that it allows us to i assess a set of potential adaptation measures ii consider irrigation water use in addition to crop yields and gross margins and iii explicitly address uncertainties in projections of multi seasonal dry spells the article is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the integrated modeling framework which is applied for austrian cropland in section 3 we present results on impacts from multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation to manage water stress in crop production and the computation of the voi we discuss obtained results with respect to the applied integrated modeling framework in section 4 and draw conclusions in section 5 2 integrated modeling framework we combine a statistical climate model for austria strauss et al 2013 the crop rotation model croprota schönhart et al 2011 the bio physical process model epic environmental policy integrated climate model williams 1995 crop gross margin calculations and a portfolio optimization model mitter et al 2015a to calculate the voi for three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells on austrian cropland for each scenario 30 realizations of 30 years periods are considered in order to capture multi seasonal variability and uncertainties total cropland of approximately 1 27 million ha is represented by 40 244 grid cells with a 1 km spatial resolution each cropland grid cell combines information on soil properties mean elevation and slope and thus considers natural heterogeneity schmid 2006 stürmer et al 2013 the integrated modeling framework is illustrated in fig 1 and explained in more detail in the following sections 2 1 statistical climate model for austria three spatially explicit scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells are provided by a statistical climate model for austria considering a period of 30 years strauss et al 2013 the scenarios have been specified based on a dry day index which is combined with block bootstrapping from historically observed daily weather data for the period 1975 2007 strauss et al 2012 the dry day index represents the proportion of the austrian territory which is dry on a random day it ranges between zero if it is raining or snowing in the entire country and one if it is completely dry in the block bootstrapping procedure each month is divided in four blocks of eight or seven days i e each block is limited to a particular month resulting in blocks of eight or seven days depending on the number of days per month the dry day index is calculated for each historical eight and seven day block which is the proportion of total area dry during those days this calculation allows to identify dry and wet blocks for a scenario period of 30 years daily weather data are derived by drawing samples from the historical eight and seven day blocks of a specific month the month specific set up of the sampling procedure was chosen in order to take into account seasonal variation in the weather parameters thus for example blocks from any past september serve as a basis for sampling blocks for september 2035 the block bootstrapping procedure is repeated 30 times in order to consider uncertainties hence a distribution of daily weather data is available at 1 km grid resolution and a period of 30 years i e 30 bootstrapped realizations for each scenario on multi seasonal dry spells with a spatial temporal resolution of 1 km and 1 day the dataset for each realization includes daily weather data for maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for a period of 30 years and thus represents daily and inter annual weather variabilities strauss et al 2013 the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells differ in the projected proportion of dry days and its spatial extents in the reference scenario sdry1 the distribution of the dry day index nearly resembles historically observed values daily weather data for a particular month are randomly sampled from the pool of all historical blocks for the respective month i e each eight or seven day block has an equal probability of being sampled sdry1 can be interpreted as a projection of historically reported dry spells and droughts historically experienced dry spells and droughts are typically argued to be a major information source for water stress management and agricultural adaptation decisions and can be interpreted as the initial state of farmers knowledge in the scenarios on moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spells dry blocks are chosen more frequently such that the situation where nearly the whole country is dry in an eight or seven day block occurs more often than in sdry1 precipitation sums are lower by about 17 in sdry2 and 30 in sdry3 compared to sdry1 on austrian cropland largest reductions in precipitation sums are modelled in sdry3 with about 40 prevailing in the autumn and winter seasons see fig a1 in the appendix and strauss et al 2013 the seasonal variations in precipitation change follow the historical patterns considered in the block bootstrapping procedure in comparison cosmo clm consortium for small scale modeling climate limited area model simulations tailored to the greater alpine region show highest precipitation decreases of about 40 in summer haslinger et al 2016 however this projection until the end of the 21st century depends on the driving general circulation models gcms and emission scenarios the major advantage of the statistical approach over gcms and rcms regional climate models is the spatio temporal and physical consistency of the projected weather parameters for near time climate change and extreme events investigations mishra and singh 2011 strauss et al 2013 2 2 crop rotation model croprota croprota is applied to derive typical crop rotations for each austrian municipality as well as their relative shares on cropland input data to croprota comprise of historically observed crop mixes extracted from the iacs integrated administration and control system database and an agronomic score matrix that values pre crop main crop combinations of 22 crops according to their agronomic suitability considered crops comprise root oil and protein crops winter and spring cereals maize and temporary grassland fallow land is also included croprota maximizes the total value of agronomic suitability over all crop rotations at municipality level in order to generate typical crop rotations and relative shares schönhart et al 2011 up to 22 different crop rotations are derived per municipality they consist of one monoculture to six crops in a sequence and are proportionally assigned to the observed cropland shares at 1 km grid resolution such that spatially explicit crop rotations are available for austrian cropland considering crop rotations acknowledges that crops and crop rotations differ in their effects on soil hydraulic properties and thus water movement for instance infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity may vary by crop rotations see bodner et al 2015 for an extensive review on how crop rotations affect soil hydraulic properties crops that are new to the region are not considered in the crop rotations acknowledging that major system changes are often deferred mitter et al 2018 2 3 bio physical process model epic the environmental policy integrated climate model epic is applied to simulate annual dry matter crop yields and hydrology at 1 km grid resolution for different crop management practices and the 30 bootstrapped realizations for each of the three scenarios sdry1 3 covering a period of 30 years epic builds on theoretically established and empirically verified knowledge on bio physical processes in the soil crop atmosphere system and has been validated extensively both at global and regional scales see e g balkovič et al 2013 chavas et al 2009 eitzinger et al 2013 wang et al 2012 major bio physical processes simulated in epic at daily time steps are among others crop growth evapotranspiration runoff percolation mineralization and nitrification as well as water and wind erosion williams 1995 epic simulates crop biomass accumulation by converting intercepted photo synthetically active radiation through a synthetic coefficient known as radiation use efficiency crop yields are calculated using crop specific harvest indices they define crop yields as a fraction of above ground biomass and are adjusted as water stress occurs other crop growth constraints considered in epic are temperature nutrient aluminum toxicity and aeration stresses major model outputs include dry matter crop yields evapotranspiration surface and sub surface runoff percolation and the number of stress days typical model inputs are data on soil properties topography daily weather parameters and crop characteristics and management izaurralde et al 2006 williams 1995 soil data comprise information on soil texture ph organic carbon coarse fragment calcium carbonate contents and bulk density with up to 7 soil layers which have been extracted from the austrian soil map 2011 elevation and slope data have been derived from the global shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model the statistical climate model for austria as described in 2 1 provides daily weather data for six parameters i e maximum and minimum temperature precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for each of the 30 bootstrapped realizations of the three scenarios sdry1 3 potential evapotranspiration is estimated with the penman monteith method monteith 1965 monteith and moss 1977 stockle et al 1992 crop management practices for adaptation include changes in timing of cultivation i e sowing fertilizer application and harvesting dates crop rotations as described in section 2 2 three fertilizer application levels under rain fed conditions and two fertilizer application levels under irrigated conditions timing of cultivation is automatically adjusted in epic to account for inter annual variabilities and changes in seasonal growing conditions it is specified by using fractions of total heat units a crop requires to reach maturity it differs between the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells because temperature increases are higher in more severe scenarios crop rotations are modelled over a period of 30 years and are combined with three fertilizer application levels under rain fed conditions i e high moderate and low and two fertilizer application levels i e high and moderate with sprinkler irrigation i e hirr and mirr fertilizer application levels are crop specific and kept constant among the three scenarios sdry1 3 see table a1 in the appendix they refer to legal standards and policy guidelines such as the guidelines for appropriate fertilization bmlfuw 2006 the action program nitrate bmlfuw 2012 and the special directive öpul bmlfuw 2015 sprinkler irrigation is chosen because it is the technology preferred by austrian farmers bmlfuw 2013 application of irrigation water i e crop management practices hirr and mirr is automatically triggered in epic such that 90 of the crop growth period is water stress free until a total limit of 500 mm per annum is reached a single irrigation activity is limited between 20 and 50 mm the assumptions are based on information from regional water supply cooperatives reisner 2014 wpa beratende ingenieure 2011 because multi year statistical data on irrigation volumes are not available for austria irrigation water is mostly withdrawn from groundwater whereas surface water from lakes rivers or reservoirs is of minor relevance statistics austria 2013 we assume sufficient irrigation water availability across austria because data on groundwater levels and flows and surface water regime are not available for this analysis 2 4 crop gross margin calculation annual crop gross margins are defined as revenues minus variable production costs they are calculated by cropland grid cell crop management practice and bootstrapped realization of the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells sdry1 3 according to equation 1 1 g m i m s c y i c m s p c k c m a m i m s where g m are annual crop gross margins in ha y are annual dry matter crop yields simulated with epic in t ha p are commodity prices from statistics austria averaged over a period of three years 2010 2012 in t k represent variable production costs for standard crop management in austria in ha and a are agricultural policy premiums in ha the index i i 40 244 denotes cropland grid cells containing cropland acreages in ha crops are indexed by c following the typical crop rotations derived by croprota for each grid cell c 22 m represents crop management practices i e fertilizer application levels and irrigation m 5 and s represents annual states of nature consisting of the 30 bootstrapped realizations with periods of 30 years for each scenario sdry1 3 s 900 variable production costs are based on reported levels from bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 and bmlfuw 2008 they apply for rain fed and irrigated conditions and include costs for seeds fertilizers pesticides irrigation fuel electricity repair insurance and labor fertilizer and irrigation costs are derived by multiplying the input levels per hectare simulated with epic by constant nitrogen 1 1 kg phosphorus 1 6 kg and irrigation costs the latter include annualized capital costs for irrigation equipment labor and electricity costs bayerische landesanstalt für landwirtschaft 2017 bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 heumesser et al 2012 it should be noted that groundwater and surface water are currently free of charge for agricultural use in austria unless officially imposed limits are exceeded see wasserrechtsgesetz 1959 labor hours are valued with 10 h the costs typically considered for agricultural workers see bundesanstalt für agrarwirtschaft 2017 agricultural policy premiums comprise of a uniform decoupled payment of 290 ha and agri environmental payments for moderate 50 ha and low fertilizer application levels 115 ha bmlfuw 2015 2009 commodity prices variable production costs annualized capital costs for sprinkler irrigation equipment and policy payments are kept constant in the 30 years period because it allows us to separate effects of multi seasonal dry spells from potential future price dynamics and agricultural policy developments 2 5 portfolio optimization model a non linear mean standard deviation model similar to mean variance model markowitz 1952 1987 is applied to identify optimal crop production portfolios for adaptation i e optimal combinations of crop management practices to reduce adverse developments or take advantage of emerging opportunities due to changes in multi seasonal dry spell conditions portfolio optimization models have been recommend for economic decision making under uncertainty to advance agricultural adaptation because of their structured transparent and replicable way of accounting for variabilities and uncertainties of climate scenarios watkiss et al 2014 the portfolio optimization model maximizes the weighted sum of expected crop gross margins per cropland grid cell as derived from equation 1 and considers a given level of risk which is characterized by the standard deviation of crop gross margins weighted by a risk aversion parameter θ freund 1956 mccarl and spreen 1999 mitter et al 2015a the risk aversion parameter θ represents the number of standard deviations in discounting gross margin expectations farmers risk aversion levels have not yet been systematically analyzed in austria therefore we increase its level in four steps from θ 0 0 t o 2 5 whereby 0 0 may be interpreted that a farmer is risk neutral 1 0 may be interpreted as low 2 0 as moderate and 2 5 as high risk aversion alternatively about 68 95 or 99 of the calculated gross margins g m i m s are within the associated standard deviations of 1 0 2 0 or 2 5 assuming normality the risk aversion parameters can be linked with confidence limits the mean standard deviation model is given by the equation system in 2 8 see mccarl and spreen 1999 it derives crop production portfolios for the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells sdry1 3 independently for each 1 km cropland grid cell i and risk aversion parameter level θ five crop management practices are considered in the crop production portfolios i e high moderate low hirr and mirr these crop management practices can be easily implemented by farmers in response to changes in multi seasonal dry spells see section 2 3 the portfolio optimization model does not allow for changes in land cover i e it is assumed that the total cropland area remains the same in the three scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells by applying a mean standard deviation model we implicitly assume constant absolute risk aversion as well as a normal distribution of crop gross margins in order to be consistent with the expected utility framework chavas 2004 2 m a x z i t g m i θ s 1 s d i s 2 d i s 2 1 2

6 computing the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi we obtain the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi or the value of improved quality of climate information by comparing optimal crop management choices i e perfect adaptation under improved climate information i e sdry2 and sdry3 to that resulting from a reference climate information i e sdry1 the underlying assumption is that crop management choices in sdry2 and sdry3 would be based on the reference scenario sdry1 if additional information on multi seasonal dry spells was not available sdry1 represents the reference climate information which is based on the historical climatology based on the results from the portfolio optimization model the voi is quantified in two steps first we derive optimal crop production portfolios in sdry1 sdry2 and sdry3 second differences in expected values of gross margins and corresponding standard deviations are calculated between optimal crop production portfolios realized in sdry2 or sdry3 i e sdry2 3 in equation 9 and optimal crop production portfolios realized in sdry1 evaluated in sdry2 or sdry3 i e sdry2 3 in equation 9 respectively the average annual voi in ha is finally computed as described in equation 9 and is always positive or zero 9 v o i i s d r y 2 3 z i s d r y 2 3 m x i m s d r y 2 3 z i s d r y 2 3 m x i m s d r y 1 i 2 7 spatial analysis spatial variability of the voi i e its distribution across agricultural production regions indicates where information on multi seasonal dry spells would be most relevant to inform adaptation we use the getis ord gi statistics getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 to identify significant clusters of high and low voi by multi seasonal dry spell scenario and risk aversion parameter level regions of particular interest i e hot spots are determined based on the calculations of the voi at cropland grid cell level we choose a fixed euclidean distance band of 15 km for modeling spatial relationships the fixed distance band is chosen such that each cropland grid cell has at least one neighbor and to show medium scale patterns where high low voi concentrate a false discovery rate fdr correction is applied in order to account for multiple testing and spatial dependency benjamini and hochberg 2000 1995 caldas de castro and singer 2006 hot and cold spots of the voi are identified at a significance level of 0 01 3 results results from the portfolio optimization model for the total austrian cropland of approximately 1 27 million ha are presented in section 3 1 the model results show how crop yields gross margins and irrigation water use are affected in the reference scenario sdry1 and the scenarios on moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spells if scenario information and risk aversion parameter levels are considered in optimal crop management choices we assume that managed cropland including fallow land remains constant in the 30 years period the voi is presented in section 3 2 for four risk aversion parameter levels at national and regional cropland levels and indicates where scenario information on multi seasonal dry spells is more valuable for adapting crop management practices furthermore implications of scenario information uptake are explored for agricultural production gross margins and irrigation water use 3 1 efficient crop production portfolios under multi seasonal dry spell conditions 3 1 1 dry matter crop yields and gross margins at national level we find that area weighted annual averages of dry matter crop yields are similar in the reference sdry1 moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells regardless of the risk aversion parameter level according to the model results they are about 7 t ha if crop production portfolios are optimized for multi seasonal dry spell conditions table 1 this indicates that total crop production can be kept almost constant if information is available and used for adaptation decision making the spatial variability of dry matter crop yields is slightly higher under sdry2 3 compared to sdry1 model results show that dry matter crop yields increase slightly in sdry2 3 on between 53 and 67 of the total cropland area compared to sdry1 crops benefit of higher mean temperatures and the co2 fertilization effect where water is not limiting during the growing season i e mostly in western austria slight decreases in dry matter crop yields are found in selected cropland grid cells in the semi arid eastern parts of the country where water is limiting crop growth table a2 and fig a2 in the appendix average annual gross margins are between 422 ha sdry3 under high risk aversion and 515 ha sdry1 under risk neutrality and decrease under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions compared to sdry1 average gross margins are about 6 lower in sdry2 and about 12 lower in sdry3 which reveals potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells even though information is used for adapting crop production portfolios table 1 however model results show high spatial disparities we find that gross margins increase in sdry2 sdry3 on about 42 30 of the total cropland compared to sdry1 highest increases are found in the western parts of the country with alpine climate whereas highest decreases appear in the semi arid eastern parts of austria due to irrigation costs table a3 and fig a3 in the appendix compared to risk neutrality average gross margins decrease under low moderate high risk aversion between 1 4 and 2 1 5 2 and 6 1 6 6 and 7 4 depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells 3 1 2 crop management for adaptation optimal crop production portfolios under multi seasonal dry spell conditions are identified for four levels of risk aversion at cropland grid cell level they are summarized for two major agricultural production regions i e the north eastern plains and the alpine foothills which represent almost two thirds of the austrian cropland fig a4 in the appendix it should be noted that the agricultural production regions have been developed based on bio physical conditions topography and dominant farm types wagner 1990a 1990b the north eastern plains are characterized by semi arid climate fertile soils and cash crop farms in the alpine foothills altitude and precipitation sums increase from north to south and animal husbandry and field forage production dominate bmlfuw 2017 in the north eastern plains optimal crop management combinations change considerably with risk aversion and the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells under risk neutrality crop production portfolios including moderate fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions i e moderate are most important in the reference sdry1 and the moderate sdry2 scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells whereas moderate fertilization intensity under irrigated conditions i e mirr prevails in the scenario on severe multi seasonal dry spells sdry3 the share of moderate fertilization intensity on rain fed cropland is between 20 and 66 in sdry1 and between 1 and 11 in sdry3 moderate fertilization intensity combined with irrigation is applied on 15 19 of the cropland in sdry1 and on 54 64 of the cropland in sdry3 with risk aversion low fertilization intensity rain fed i e low and high fertilization intensity irrigated i e hirr gain in importance indicating that risk aversion may lead to either extensification or intensification furthermore diversification increases with risk aversion and more crop production portfolios include three or more crop management practices table 2 and fig a5 in the appendix in the alpine foothills crop production portfolios including moderate or high fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions either as single management strategy or as part of the portfolio are most important regardless of the risk aversion parameter level and the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells moderate fertilization intensity rain fed is chosen on between 28 sdry2 under high risk aversion and 51 sdry1 under risk neutrality of the cropland the share of high fertilization intensity rain fed i e high on cropland is between 34 sdry3 under high risk aversion and 48 sdry2 under low risk aversion low fertilization intensity under rain fed conditions increases in importance with risk aversion and is employed on between 2 sdry1 under risk neutrality and 17 of the cropland sdry1 under high risk aversion combinations of low fertilization intensity with alternative management practices are more relevant with high risk aversion and under more severe multi seasonal dry spell conditions sdry2 3 indicating that portfolio diversification increases the share of irrigated cropland also increases with risk aversion and under sdry2 3 whereby irrigation is more often applied with high fertilizer inputs on up to 15 of the cropland than with moderate fertilizer inputs on up to 6 of the cropland table 2 and fig a5 in the appendix 3 1 3 irrigation water use on cropland impacts of multi seasonal dry spell scenarios on irrigated cropland and irrigation water use are examined for optimal crop production portfolios i e after adaptation measures have been considered model results show that the share of irrigated cropland increases substantially in the moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 multi seasonal dry spell scenarios particularly in the semi arid eastern parts of austria fig a6 in the appendix compared to the reference scenario sdry1 irrigated cropland is between 1 9 and 3 1 2 6 and 5 6 times higher in sdry2 sdry3 model results also reveal that the share of irrigated cropland rises with risk aversion compared to risk neutrality the share of irrigated cropland is between 1 3 and 2 8 times higher with high risk aversion whereby increases are highest under sdry1 area weighted average annual water use on irrigated cropland increases in sdry2 and sdry3 compared to sdry1 but decreases with risk aversion table 3 irrigation water productivity defined as the change in crop yield per unit of irrigation water use see abdullaev and molden 2004 li et al 2016 molden 1997 has been analyzed at national level we have compared average area weighted crop yields on irrigated cropland if irrigation is considered in the portfolio optimization i e crop management practices hirr and mirr as presented in 3 1 2 with average area weighted crop yields that can be achieved if irrigation is not available we find that average crop yields increase between 1 5 and 1 8 kg per m³ irrigation water whereby higher increases are found for high risk aversion and under more severe scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells 3 2 economic value of climate information for water stress management voi 3 2 1 national cropland level information on multi seasonal dry spells needs to be available for efficient crop management adaptation if information is lacking we assume that the choice of crop production portfolios would be based on the reference scenario sdry1 even under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions sdry2 3 for austria the model results show that the average voi is higher if multi seasonal dry spells are expected to increase in severity and frequency and if farmers are more risk averse depending on the risk aversion parameter level θ the voi is between 13 and 33 ha in scenario sdry2 and between 57 and 99 ha in scenario sdry3 table 4 average annual dry matter crop yields are about 4 sdry2 and between 11 and 13 sdry3 higher if information on multi seasonal dry spells is accessed for crop management choices compared to the situation where this information is not available similarly average gross margins are up to 3 sdry2 and between 5 and 14 sdry3 higher with information on multi seasonal dry spells the share of irrigated cropland and the area weighted average annual water use on irrigated cropland are also affected if additional information on multi seasonal dry spells is used for crop management choices the area weighted average annual irrigation water use decreases between 10 high risk aversion under sdry2 3 and 27 risk neutral under sdry3 if crop management choices are based on multi seasonal dry spell scenario information compared to the situation where this information is not available this is because of an increase in the share of irrigated cropland in general and an increase in cropland with comparably low irrigation water use in particular irrigation water productivity decreases between 0 21 kg m³ in sdry2 and 0 76 kg m³ in sdry3 compared to sdry1 if information on multi seasonal dry spells is not used for irrigation management 3 2 2 regional cropland level spatial disparities in the annual voi display where information on multi seasonal dry spells is more or less beneficial to inform adaptation fig 2 and fig a7 in the appendix results from the spatial analysis reveal that the voi follows climate topographic and soil gradients hot spots with values above 150 ha are concentrated in the semi arid eastern parts of austria which are characterized by flat and fertile soils such high values are also found in some inner alpine valleys particularly under risk neutrality θ 0 0 cold spots with values of 50 ha or less are found in the hilly and mountainous western parts of the country with alpine climate regardless of the risk aversion parameter level modelled changes in crop yields are often positive or only slightly negative in these regions because water is not limiting crop growth see section 3 1 1 and fig a2 in the appendix however the voi shows a rising trend in western austria under more severe multi seasonal dry spell conditions indicating that scenario information gains in importance across the country if the voi equals zero crop management choices are deemed to be robust to a range of plausible scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells cropland grid cells with a voi of 0 ha are found in the hilly and mountainous western parts of austria mainly under risk neutrality in these regions crop production portfolios are robust and do not change with additional information on multi seasonal dry spells average annual voi has been calculated by soil type altitude slope and crop group in order to show how site conditions and crops affect its level brown earth i e cambisol and luvisol black soil i e chernozem and phaeozem and pseudogley i e stagnosol are the three major soil types and represent about 75 of austrian cropland average annual voi is highest on black soils which are typically rich in humus and offer good growing conditions for crops i e between 29 and 145 ha depending on the multi seasonal dry spell scenario and the risk aversion parameter level the productivity of pseudogley and brown earth for crop production is generally lower than for black soils average voi for pseudogley is similar to the national averages between 6 and 107 ha those for brown earth are between 5 and 64 ha in sdry3 table 5 with respect to topography we find that average annual voi is highest in flat regions and at low altitudes where cropland is preferably located almost three quarters of the austrian cropland is found on plains with slopes below 5 average voi for plains are above the national averages they are between 17 and 116 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the voi decreases with increasing steepness for instance average values for slopes between 5 and 10 are between 32 and 57 of those for plains however voi exceed 50 ha on slopes between 10 and 15 under severe multi seasonal dry spells sdry3 and high risk aversion table a4 in the appendix in lowland altitude below 300 m where about 46 of the cropland is located average annual voi is between 26 and 163 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the average values for cropland decrease with higher altitudes for altitudes between 300 and 600 m 600 and 1100 m they are between 11 and 33 4 and 7 of the values for lowland table a5 in the appendix we define dominant crop groups if crops in the rotation belonging to a specific crop group are grown in at least 16 out of 30 years on a particular cropland grid cell average annual voi is highest for root and oil crops which indicates that scenario information on multi seasonal dry spells is of particular importance if the share of root and oil crops in the rotation should be increased their major production regions are in eastern austria where a regional hot spot of the voi has been identified fig 2 average voi for root and oil crops is clearly above the national average i e between 16 and 301 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level average values for maize are around the national averages and above those for cereals protein crops and perennial grassland which reflects that maize is more sensitive to water reductions lowest values between 2 and 17 ha are found for perennial grass table 6 4 discussion 4 1 discussion of the economic value of climate information for water stress management voi our analysis shows that the average voi is highest on flat and productive soils for root and oil crops under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions and if farmers are highly risk averse average annual values for austrian cropland range between 13 and 99 ha depending on the scenario on multi seasonal dry spells and the risk aversion parameter level the calculated average annual voi amounts to between 2 and 17 of the average income of cash crop farms in austria in 2017 which is approximately 600 ha bmnt 2018 the voi results can be interpreted as an upper bound this is because we assume that accurate information on multi seasonal dry spells is available disseminated and fully used by farmers to inform water stress management in crop production in our analysis in reality however the voi is affected by uncertainties in projections on multi seasonal dry spells farmers limited access to and utilization of information and their limited flexibility in decision making our voi results seem to be reasonable compared to other studies on the economic value of information using different methodological approaches for instance meza and wilks 2003 estimate the economic value of perfect forecast for seasonal sea surface temperature to range between 13 ha 11 ha and 243 ha 202 ha depending on cultivated crops and soil conditions mushtaq et al 2012 find that the value of improved seasonal water allocation forecasts is between 1 and 6 ha for different levels of risk aversion at farm level cabrera et al 2007 show that the average value of enso based climate information is between 3 ha 2 5 ha and 25 ha 21 ha for different levels of risk aversion the hot and cold cropland spots of the voi are clearly influenced by a combination of soil topographic and climate conditions affecting crop and crop management choices hot spots for instance are concentrated in the semi arid eastern parts of austria where fertile black soils are dominating and root crops which typically materialize high gross margins are important in the crop rotation similar to our findings on the voi which is higher in semi arid regions and under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions mushtaq et al 2012 show higher benefits from additional information under water scarcity and an vo et al 2019 report higher gains from extreme wet and dry than from moderate seasonal forecasts by contrast choi et al 2015 reveal that the value of climate information is lower under extreme drought conditions compared to favorable climate conditions this is mainly because of production and welfare transfers outside the country which have not been considered in our analysis choi et al 2015 also show that irrigation water use decreases if climate information is available and farmers adjust crop mixes however our analysis shows an increase in total irrigation water use on austrian cropland if drought information is available which results from changes from rain fed under reference climate conditions to irrigated agriculture under moderate and extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions in large parts of the country in our analysis the average annual voi is higher on flat and fertile soils and decreases substantially with slope and altitude this seems reasonable because soil properties and topography are closely related to crops dominant in the crop rotation a high share of root and oil crops is specific to the flat and productive crop production regions in eastern and north western austria where hot spots of the average annual voi are located root and oil crops show highest average values of climate information in our analysis followed by maize cereals protein crops and perennial grassland this finding is in line with previous studies indicating that the value of perfect information is on average higher for root crops such as potato and sugar beet than for cereals such as wheat and oat meza et al 2003 meza and wilks 2003 maize typically experiences higher yield reductions than cereals if water is limiting daryanto et al 2016 which may explain its higher average voi exceptions are however found for specific soil characteristics meza et al 2003 indicating the importance to consider spatial heterogeneities in such analyses risk aversion leads to a higher average voi in our analysis which is also confirmed by other studies for instance letson et al 2009 and cabrera et al 2007 find that risk aversion increases the value of information on the enso phenomenon and show that its effect is higher for land owners than for tenants similarly quiroga et al 2011a show that accurate information about drought probability is of higher value for risk averse actors however in many cases the effect of scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells has a higher impact on the voi than the level of risk aversion in our analyses 4 2 discussion of the integrated modeling framework we present a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework for austrian cropland that integrates bio physical and socio economic data and models to calculate the voi for different scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells and risk aversion parameter levels a broad range of aspects is considered in our analysis including scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells soil and topographic conditions adaptation measures to dry spells and farmers risk aversion levels with respect to the accuracy of the integrated modeling framework we refer to several national and regional analyses that have been carried out with the statistical climate model for austria the crop rotation model croprota and the bio physical process model epic see e g feusthuber et al 2017 heumesser et al 2012 kirchner et al 2015 mitter et al 2015a 2015b schönhart et al 2014 2011 strauss et al 2013 stürmer et al 2013 these studies are considered as input validation of the portfolio optimization model and the computation of the voi however our approach has limitations because of underlying assumptions and aspects that have not been incorporated in the analysis yet above all we consider selected crop management practices for adapting to water stress in our analysis and assume high flexibility of farming systems in the portfolio optimization model furthermore optimal crop management choices at a spatial resolution of 1 km as derived from our analysis may be the result of choices made at several different farms limiting the representativeness of the model results for particular farms or farming systems we chose to investigate timing of cultivation and crop rotations as well as fertilizer and irrigation water application levels because of their high potential of adoption on austrian farms mitter et al 2019 2018 however a wide spectrum of soil and plant related measures has been identified effective for crop management under dry conditions including for instance crop stand management alternative tillage systems progress in breeding and changes in land cover bodner et al 2015 considering additional adaptation measures would allow for more flexibility in crop management choices in the portfolio optimization model and would likely increase portfolio diversification particularly under high risk aversion another aspect yet to be explored are potential irrigation water constraints in the future which could necessitate the reversion of irrigated to rain fed management see e g elliott et al 2014 schewe et al 2014 currently we consider sprinkler irrigation as the preferred irrigation technology in austria bmlfuw 2013 and assume that irrigation water supply is not limited more efficient technologies such as precision irrigation could help to save water decrease resource depletion and reduce detrimental impacts of multi seasonal dry spells on agricultural productivity perea et al 2017 however their nationwide implementation may require long lead times because of high investment costs see e g heumesser et al 2012 which we include as annualized capital costs in the gross margin calculations additionally the financial situation and debt levels of farms may be determining for irrigation implementation which are both not considered in our analysis comparing irrigation water use to available resources from rivers lakes and groundwater aquifers would enable us to identify regions most vulnerable to water scarcity in these regions we would expect a higher average voi similar to the findings of mushtaq et al 2012 we assume that farmers access and take up information on multi seasonal dry spells to inform their adaptation decisions however previous research suggests that climate and drought information is underutilized by farmers and the use of climate services further declines with higher uncertainties greater lead times and low adaptive capacity hansen et al 2011 2004 kusunose and mahmood 2016 the role of knowledge brokers working as intermediaries between producers and users of climate and drought information has been emphasized in order to increase information uptake and knowledge transfer in agriculture dilling and lemos 2011 kirchhoff et al 2013 zebiak et al 2015 our systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells effective adaptation measures and the voi may facilitate information brokering and uptake to realize the evident adaptation potential in any integrated modelling activity uncertainty regarding data and models which accumulate steadily over each step of the modeling process has to be kept in mind walker et al 2003 wilby and dessai 2010 this may include uncertainties in model quantities such as input data and parameters i e technical uncertainties model form i e methodological uncertainties and model completeness i e epistemological uncertainties pruyt 2007 for instance model inter comparison studies at global scale have revealed considerable uncertainties as to how effects of temperature and precipitation extremes are represented in bio physical process models asseng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 a recent publication suggests that the majority of models underestimates agricultural impacts from extreme heat waves dry spells and droughts schewe et al 2019 for epic previous studies showed that it can satisfactorily reproduce soil dynamics and crop yield responses to heat waves dry spells and droughts at regional to national levels easterling et al 1996 van der velde et al 2012 however epic results have been found to be less reliable but still credible under precipitation extremes than under temperature extremes easterling et al 1996 furthermore we neglect water constraints for irrigation thus the portfolio optimization model results likely overestimate the choice of irrigation on cropland which likely leads to and overestimation of the average annual voi as well we disregard changes in input and output prices future market developments and international trade dynamics despite controversial debates see e g hampicke 2011 we adopt a partial approach because it enables us to separate impacts from multi seasonal dry spells from price market and trade dynamics ciscar et al 2011 however we would expect an intensification of crop production portfolios and a higher average annual voi with increasing output prices as suggested by global economic models nelson et al 2014 von lampe et al 2014 5 summary and conclusions we have analyzed how scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells affect dry matter crop yields gross margins and irrigation water use in austria model results show that total dry matter crop yields are around 8 75 million t and similar in the reference sdry1 moderate sdry2 and severe sdry3 scenarios this is mainly because of a switch from rain fed to irrigated agriculture in major production regions under more extreme scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells which results in a 3 to 6fold increase in irrigation water use in sdry2 3 compared to sdry1 total gross margins are between 6 and 13 lower under more extreme scenarios on multi seasonal dry spells compared to the reference scenario reductions in total gross margins are due to higher costs e g for irrigation water and lower agricultural policy premiums e g due to intensification information on multi seasonal dry spells is required to facilitate agricultural adaptation and water stress management the economic value of information voi represents the net benefit of adapting crop production portfolios to multi seasonal dry spell conditions and reflects the opportunity costs of not having the information available for decision making quantifying the voi may help to direct climate data provision guide regional water governance and drought policy efforts and to highlight agricultural production regions which would particularly benefit from such information model results reveal that the average voi increases under more extreme multi seasonal dry spell conditions and with farmers risk aversion these results suggest that information on multi seasonal dry spells gains in importance with the projected increase in frequency and severity of dry spells and droughts in the alpine region in the 21st century the voi is even higher if farmers risk aversion rises due to uncertainty in dry spell and drought conditions such an increase in risk aversion seems reasonable because of empirically based evidence for both an increase in risk aversion with climate induced risks as well as negative correlations between risk aversion and mean annual precipitation sums see alpizar et al 2011 bezabih and sarr 2012 di falco 2014 the voi is also related to site conditions and crops our spatially explicit results suggest that the highly productive flat regions in the semi arid eastern parts of austria where cropland is the dominating land cover would benefit most of additional information on multi seasonal dry spells crop specific information on multi seasonal dry spells would be most desirable for root and oil crops indicating that the relevance of information increases if root and oil crops should gain in importance in the crop rotation such crop and site specific information may be valuable for farmers water resource managers policy makers and other agricultural stakeholders at national and regional scales especially in the context of likely increasing frequency and severity of multi seasonal dry spells under climate change the spatially explicit integrated modeling framework allows to systematically analyze impacts related to multi seasonal dry spells on agricultural production gross margins and irrigation water use to identify effective adaptation measures for crop production and to quantify the voi while explicitly addressing uncertainty the results may improve the provision uptake and use of information on multi seasonal dry spells for adaptation decision making facilitate the development of water management plans and guide the design of structured information monitoring and evaluation processes for adaptation to multi seasonal dry spells and droughts we suggest that integrated assessments could be extended by empirical research on the uptake and use of imperfect information on multi seasonal dry spells by land and water users conflict of interest

gy grain yield 9 98 t ha wp water productivity 1 78 kg m3 and net profit us ha 1070 treatments under drip irrigation saved 48 irrigation water with an average irrigation depth of 556 mm in comparison to 1063 mm under ridge sowing the saltmed model simulations showed good performance with root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 007 to 0 012 for soil moisture and 0 305 to 0 376 for soil salinity coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 802 to 0 864 for soil moisture and 0 828 to 0 875 for soil salinity and coefficient of residual mass crm ranged from 0 028 to 0 024 for soil moisture and

125 rdf that reduced net profit upto 11 6 based on these findings it is recommended that drip irrigation should be operated on a daily basis coupled with 100rdf for economical corn production keywords corn drip irrigation fertigation rate irrigation frequency saltmed model 1 introduction pakistan is an agricultural based country and corn is the fourth largest grown crop which contributes 2 2 to its agricultural value added and 2 5 to agricultural gdp government of pakistan 2017 the annual production of corn is 4 9 million tons which can be increased by adopting modern technologies such as drip fertigation drip irrigation with 85 90 application efficiency allen et al 1998 applies irrigation water only to crop roots and ultimately enhances water productivity drip irrigation can also be an effective tool to enhance crop productivity if balanced fertilizers are applied during irrigation fertigation balanced fertigation can reduce fertilizer applications by 25 to achieve economically better crop production chauhdary et al 2017 several researchers have reported the advantages and benefits of drip irrigation systems and better crop response biswas et al 2015 dağdelen et al 2006 howell and meron 2015 mansour et al 2013 tayel et al 2008 despite these advantages drip irrigation has some limitations like the risk of salt accumulation in the crop root zone due to limited water applications which can affect plant growth the problem of salt accumulation becomes more severe with the use of saline water farmers in punjab pakistan primarily use groundwater for irrigation of crops due to shortage of fresh surface water but the groundwater of punjab pakistan is relatively saline in nature marginal to poor quality water having electrical conductivity ec ranging from 2 5 to 4 2 ds m qureshi et al 2002 that is causing salt accumulation in the root zone these accumulated salts can be leached from the root zone by applying flood irrigation once or twice during the cropping season but it can reduce water productivity so there is an option to leach salts from crop root zone using drip irrigation itself by applying intense irrigation through changing irrigation frequency to find optimized fertigation rate and irrigation frequency testing of several treatments can be a time consuming and an expensive practice in the field therefore the crop response under higher fertigation rates and different irrigation frequencies can be simulated under different management scenarios using computer models computer models such as saltmed are widely used in the field of agriculture to study crop and soil behavior under varying management conditions adam et al 2011 flowers et al 2005 murthy 2004 ragab 2002 the reliability of model simulations depends on proper model development calibration and validation for field conditions keeping in mind the above discussion the present study was designed to investigate the effects of different fertigation rates i e 100 rdf recommended dose of fertigation 75 rdf and 50 rdf on corn yields based on three irrigation frequencies daily irrigation frequency 3rd day irrigation frequency and 5th day irrigation frequency to optimize their use for economical production of corn under drip irrigation in addition the saltmed model was calibrated and tested for performing simulations regarding corn response and root zone salinity dynamics under different management scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and climate of study site the study area has a subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 350 mm most of which falls during monsoon july september in the form of high intensity rainfall the temperature of the study area varies from 50 c in summer june to around the freezing point in the winter january average annual evaporation of the study area is 1600 mm and daily values vary from 11 4 mm in summer to 2 mm in winter may and june are the driest months with 30 relative humidity the soil of the study area is sandy loam up to a depth of 1 m with flat topography a variety of crops can be grown due to highly productive soil of the study area ahmad et al 2007 the experiment was conducted in the spring seasons of two consecutive years 2015 and 2016 2 2 water sampling and analysis to study saline water effects on crop growth and root zone salinity dynamics tubewell water was applied three sources of tubewell water skimming well pars tubewell solar powered tubewell are available at the study area and water of these tubewells was used for irrigation of corn a skimming well is installed in a dug well 7 m deep from ground surface with a shallow bore depth of 21 m 10 m blind and 11 m screen with multi bores five bores the tubewell discharge is 100 m3 h 1 with total dynamic head of 45 m the pars tubewell has a 37 m bore depth and 100 m3 h 1 discharge the solar powered tubewell has a 32 m bore depth 18 m blind and 14 m screen and 50 m3 h 1 discharge in the solar powered tubewell a submersible pump is placed in 15 cm internal dia casing pipe at a depth of 22 m from the ground surface irrigation water samples were collected after the start of tubewell pumping upto 45 min at 15 min time intervals to analyze water quality in terms of ph electrical conductivity ec in ds m sodium adsorption ratio sar in meq l and residual sodium carbonate rsc in meq l the ec of irrigation water before every irrigation was measured using a portable ec meter dist 3 hanna in the field and the data were used as input for the model simulations 2 3 bulk density infiltration rate field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of soil soil samples were taken from different soil depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm just before sowing by using a sampling core and the bulk density was determined by dividing soil dry weight with soil bulk volume the soil infiltration rate was determined in the field at five locations using a double ring infiltrometer the infiltration data was used in the model run and to determine the suitable emitter discharge rate and their spacing on the lateral to avoid water ponding and runoff alberta agriculture food and rural development 2004 additional soil samples were analyzed using a pressure plate apparatus cat 1600 to determine field capacity and wilting point in the soil physics laboratory of the university of agriculture faisalabad the 1 3 bar pressure for field capacity and 15 bar pressure for permanent wilting point were applied to drain excess water from the soil samples the pressure application was continued until the drainage of water from soil samples was stopped after establishment of equilibrium after that the retained moisture content of the soil samples was measured using the gravimetric method for determination of the field capacity and permanent wilting point 2 4 experimental design and corn cultivation the experiment was laid out according to factorial design under a rcbd randomized complete block design arrangement with nine treatments and three replicates to analyze their effects on corn production as shown in fig 1 the experimental treatments included three irrigation frequencies dif daily irrigation frequency 3dif 3rd day irrigation frequency and 5dif 5th day irrigation frequency and three fertigation rates 100rdf 100 rdf recommended dose of fertigation 75rdf 75 rdf and 50rdf 50 rdf the nine treatments were t1 dif 100rdf t2 dif 75rdf t3 dif 50rdf t4 3dif 100rdf t5 3dif 75rdf t6 3dif 50rdf t7 5dif 100rdf t8 5dif 75rdf t9 5dif 50rdf along with these nine treatments under drip irrigation one control treatment ridge sowing with furrow irrigation was also included for comparison with treatments under drip irrigation the analysis of variance anova test was performed to determine the response of crop parameters to experimental treatments under both cropping seasons treatment means were compared using least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 probability according to the procedure adopted by chauhdary et al 2015 and chauhdary et al 2016 traditional planting of corn is mostly done on a ridge furrow irrigation system however it was replaced by flat sowing under drip irrigation drip laterals were placed at one meter distance from each other row to row spacing a 20 cm small channel called a drip channel was formed for placement of drip line as this is a popular practice for crops under drip irrigation this practice was adopted to avoid fertilizer loss and to get maximum emitter uniformity the recommended plant population was maintained by planting corn seeds on both sides of the drip channel with the help of a dibbler to maintain 23 cm plant to plant distance and at a distance of one cm from top corner of drip channel in a zigzag pattern the corn sowing was done after establishment of field capacity for better germination dehghanisanij et al 2006 the layout of corn planting is shown in fig 2 2 5 irrigation and water productivity the cropwat model was used to calculate crop water requirement cwr using the past ten years 2005 2014 climatic data for study area cropwat is a decision support system developed by food and agriculture organization fao and uses the penman monteith equation for calculating crop water requirements cwr based on soil climate and crop data in addition the program allows the development of irrigation schedules for different management conditions and calculation of the scheme water supply for varying crop patterns cropwat can also be used to evaluate farmers irrigation practices and to estimate crop performance under both rainfed and irrigated conditions under dif irrigation was applied on a daily basis according to the daily crop water requirement under 3dif cumulative irrigation of three days was applied on every 3rd day similarly under 5dif cumulative irrigation of five days was applied on every 5th day under control treatment irrigation was applied according to local farmer practices related to climatic and crop conditions the discharge for drip irrigation was noted by a flow meter and discharge for control treatment was measured with a cut throat flume 7 5 20 cm in size then the discharge was multiplied with irrigation time to calculate irrigation volume and total irrigation volume was calculated by adding all irrigations then irrigation volume was divided by respective cropping area to calculate irrigation depth the water productivity was calculated by dividing corn marketable yield grain yield with irrigation volume 2 6 fertigation for fertigation water soluble fertilizer wsf of n p k 20 20 20 was used according to recommendations of the punjab agriculture department pakistan the required quantities of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k were 250 kg ha 125 kg ha and 125 kg ha respectively for corn production in punjab pakistan as the n p k ratio in wsf was 1 1 1 and the required ratio of n p k was 2 1 1 therefore urea fertilizer was used as an additional nitrogen source to obtain the required ratio of n p k 2 1 1 the total calculated quantity of wsf along with urea table 1 was divided into a number of doses and applied in split applications with each irrigation under different irrigation frequencies accordingly the split application of fertilizer was recommended by tharmar and pandian 2010 for better utilization of nutrients by crops for fertilization of control treatment urea dap diammonium phosphate and mop muriate of potash were used the dap diammonium phosphate and mop muriate of potash were applied manually during land preparation as a basal dose and urea was applied manually in four split doses 1st application on 15 20th days after emergence dae 2nd application on 30 40th dae 3rd application on 50 60th dae and 4th application 70 80th dae during the growing season the required quantities of wsf urea dap and mop are given in table 1 for different treatments 2 7 soil moisture and salinity data collection for determination of initial conditions for soil moisture and salinity the soil samples from nine locations 3 at one side 3 at middle and 3 at other side along the length of the field were taken at different depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm these samples were analyzed in the wmrc lab for soil moisture by gravimetric method and soil salinity by soil solution extract ece moreover soil samples were taken four times during the growing season 25th day after sowing das 58th das 88th das 115th das from different treatments at different depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm these results were compared with the simulated model results regarding soil moisture and salinity for calibration and validation of the saltmed model 2 8 crop data collection crop data regarding emergence rate er plant height plh dry matter weight dmw and grain yield gy were measured during and at the end of growing season for determination of er dmw and gy one square meter frame was used three consecutive rows of corn were considered in one square meter frame according to the plant geometry the er was measured after emergence of corn plants and gy was measured at end of the season however dmw was measured five times during the cropping season 17th day after emergence dae 50th dae 66th dae 80th dae and at harvesting for better calibration of the saltmed model for this purpose plants from one square meter were harvested at three locations head middle and tail in each plot chopped and oven dried to determine dmw the corn ears were threshed manually to measure gy later on dmw and gy were converted into tones ha for determination of plh twelve plants were selected randomly along the length of each experimental plot four at head four at middle and four at tail and tagged at the start of season the height of tagged plants was measured at crop maturity 2 9 saltmed model and its applications the saltmed model ragab 2015 was developed to account for different water qualities irrigation systems irrigation strategies different soils and crops salinity n fertilizer applications drought and drainage systems for shallow groundwater the key processes of saltmed are evapotranspiration plant water uptake water and solute transport under different irrigation systems drainage and the relationship between crop yield and water use and relationship between salinity and crop yield and yield components the model has been used in different parts of the world under different management systems and climatic conditions for simulations of different crops a detailed description of saltmed has been provided by different researchers ragab 2015 2002 ragab et al 2005a b the saltmed model v 2015 was used in the current study for development of management scenarios under different experimental treatments in the semi arid climate of faisalabad pakistan the saltmed model was calibrated using treatment t1 dif 100rdf for the year 2015 for model calibration meteorological data were taken from the weather station installed at university of agriculture faisalabad uaf the irrigation data including irrigation time drip emitter flow rate salinity of irrigation water concentration of urea and nitrogen n in irrigation water were measured in field during every irrigation sowing and harvesting date of corn plant height harvest index and leaf area index were taken from field measurements the initial soil moisture soil salinity field capacity permanent wilting point and porosity were determined in the laboratory the crop root depth unstressed crop yield and length of each growth stage were taken from literature anjum et al 2014 chauhdary 2018 the values of crop coefficients kc kcb fc and π50 the osmotic pressure at which the water uptake is reduced to 50 of the maximum or potential water uptake for each growth stage were taken from model database the π50 is an indicator of crop salinity tolerance its high values represent salt tolerant plants and low values represent less salt tolerant plants the values of π50 for the initial stage mid stage and end stage of corn were taken as 5 ds m 5 9 ds m and 5 9 ds m for model validation model runs were performed for the remaining treatments of the 2015 season and all treatments of the 2016 season after successful calibration and validation model scenario simulations were performed for higher fertigation rates to find optimum fertigation rate 2 10 goodness of fit model evaluation criteria for evaluation of model performance five statistical indicators including percentage of difference d root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of residual mass crm were used to evaluate model simulation processes these indicators were used by several researchers bakhsh et al 2004 loague and green 1991 vinten et al 1991 the d calculates the difference between simulated data and observed data the d was calculated using eq 1 1 d s i o i o i 100 the value of rmse equal to zero indicated the goodness of fit between simulated and observed data it can be calculated by using eq 2 2 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 0 5 the r2 was determined by regression analysis between measured and predicted values using eq 3 the r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 r2 1 indicates a perfect correlation between observed and simulated values 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v e s i s a v e 2 i 1 n o i o a v e 2 i 1 n s i s a v e 2 the crm shows the overestimation or underestimation of model predictions negative value for crm indicates overestimation of model predictions and a positive value for crm indicates underestimation of model predictions crm was calculated using eq 4 4 c r m i 1 n o i i 1 n s i i 1 n o i where oi is the observed data oavg is the average of observed data si is the corresponding simulated data savg is the average of simulated data and n is number of observations 2 11 economic analysis the economic analysis of any agronomic practice is essential from farmer s point of view as they are often interested in benefits and cost of a certain technology the net profit is an indicator that shows the profitability and adoptability of any new sowing technique the net profit was taken as the difference between crop income and crop production cost the crop income and production cost were calculated according to the procedure adopted by chauhdary et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 quality of irrigation water due to shallow depth water quality of the skimming well was found as suitable for irrigation as it has average values of ec 1 49 ds m ph 7 58 sar 10 4 meq l and rsc 2 46 meq l the water quality of the pars tubewell was identified as unfit for irrigation with average values of ec 2 78 ds m ph 7 61 sar 18 1 meq l and rsc 5 15 meq l the water of the solar powered tubewell was marginally suitable for irrigation with average values of ec ph sar and rsc as 2 19 ds m 7 62 14 36 meq l and 3 45 meq l which lies in marginal ranges of water quality standards defined by wapda water and power development authority pakistan the quality of solar tubewell water was relatively better than that of the pars tubewell due to the shallow bore depth the minor variation in chemical properties occurred due to an up coning effect of saline water from lower groundwater layers with time equilibrium was established and the chemical properties of groundwater became stable the water quality standards and results of tubewell water quality are given in table 2 3 2 bulk density infiltration rate field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of soil the average values of soil bulk densities were 1 56 1 58 1 59 and 1 60 g cm3 for 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm soil depths respectively table 3 these results of bulk density for sandy loam soil are in accordance with the work of amin et al 2015 the infiltration rate varied from 0 79 to 0 94 cm h 1 and the average infiltration was 0 87 cm h 1 table 3 anjum 2013 anjum et al 2014 and gupta 1990 measured infiltration of sandy loam soil and reported similar ranges regarding infiltration rate comparatively the value of infiltration rate at location 3 was observed as lower it may be due to soil compaction at that point due to spatial variability and farm operations the field capacity fc of different soil samples varied from 17 95 to 18 18 at different locations and from 17 95 to 18 15 at different soil depths the permanent wilting point pwp ranged from 8 25 to 8 45 at different locations and from 8 30 to 8 48 at different depths this variation in the values of fc may be due to different factors that can affect fc kirkham 2014 described many factors in the field that can affect fc these factors include soil structure organic matter soil type water table and impermeable layers the overall average values of fc and pwp were 18 04 and 8 36 respectively and were used in the saltmed model run as input values the measured values of fc and pwp were very close to those reported by anjum 2013 and anjum et al 2014 who reported fc 21 7 and pwp 8 14 for sandy loam soil the results regarding fc and pwp are presented in table 4 3 3 emergence rate er corn er was observed after emergence eight days after sowing of corn plants in every experimental plot it should be noted that applications of the fertigation and irrigation treatments were started after completion of emergence therefore the results did not represent any treatment effects table 5 3 4 plant height plh the corn plant heights plh was 185 54 cm 172 93 cm and 179 06 cm under dif 3dif and 5dif respectively it was due to the fact that under both dif and 3dif the salts remained in the root zone but under dif salts did not retard crop growth due to dilution effects with daily water application as compared to 3dif therefore the plh was higher under dif than 3dif the plh under 5dif was higher than 3dif because of heavy irrigation application under the 5dif that leached salts from the root zone which ultimately created a favorable environment in the root zone for crop growth the effects of irrigation frequencies on plh was also studied by anjum et al 2014 chauhdary et al 2017 jiotode et al 2002 and they reported similar results variations in plh in response to different fertigation rates are shown in table 5 the highest plh was produced under 100rdf 189 12 cm that was statistically higher than that under 75rdf 178 96 cm and 50rdf 169 45 cm respectively increased plh under higher rates of fertigation to an optimum level has also been reported by inamullah et al 2011 3 5 dry matter weight dmw dmw was 17 18 t ha 15 67 t ha and 16 47 t ha under dif 3dif and 5dif respectively the dif produced significantly higher dmw than that under 5dif that is significantly higher than that under 3dif these results are in accordance with the work of amin et al 2015 anjum et al 2014 who studied the effects of 2 day 4 day and 6 day irrigation frequency on corn dry matter production the highest dmw was produced by 100rdf 17 87 t ha which was significantly higher than that under 75rdf 16 28 t ha and 50rdf 15 17 t ha the variation in dmw with respect to fertigation rates has also been reported by other researchers hammad et al 2011 inamullah et al 2011 muhammad et al 2002 3 6 grain yield gy the gy under dif 8 68 t ha was significantly higher than that under 3dif 7 79 t ha and 5dif 8 12 t ha the gy under 5dif was significantly higher than that under 3dif under dif crop response was better due to higher water uptake because of higher water potential due to enough soil moisture although the salts remained in the root zone under dif but due to dilution effects water potential was enough to support plant water uptake under 3dif water potential was higher before next irrigation on the 3rd day as compared to that under 5dif but due to presence of higher salt concentration in the root zone water uptake was restricted due to higher osmotic potential under 5dif the water potential was lower before next irrigation on the 5th day but due to less salt concentration due to leaching of salts from the root zone osmotic potential was lower and supported plant water uptake thus corn gy under 5dif was higher than that under 3dif this phenomenon has been supported by the literature ragab 2015 2002 better yield under higher irrigation frequency has also been reported by amin et al 2015 apostolakis et al 2016 dağdelen et al 2006 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 istanbulluoglu et al 2002 the highest gy was produced by 100rdf 9 47 t ha which was reduced when fertigation rate moved from 100rdf to 75rdf 8 44 t ha and 50 rdf 6 68 t ha the effect of fertigation rate on corn yield was studied by abayomi et al 2006 al kaisi and kwaw mensah 2007 arif 2011 who reported similar trends regarding corn gy the highest and lowest gy among the treatments with drip irrigation were produced by t1 dif 100rdf 9 98 t ha and t6 3dif 50rdf 6 61 t ha respectively the gy was 59 4 and 5 6 higher under t1 and t6 respectively than that under the control treatment 6 26 t ha 3 7 irrigation and water productivity the irrigation depth was 547 mm for the 2015 season and 564 mm for the 2016 season under all treatments irrigated with drip irrigation for control treatment applied irrigation was 1000 mm and 1125 mm for the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively drip irrigation reduced irrigation water use by 48 with average irrigation depth of 556 mm in comparison to that under ridge sowing 1063 mm water savings under drip irrigation has also been reported by ashraf 2014 chauhdary et al 2017 the amount of rainfall during cropping season was 131 mm and 104 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the highest water productivity was observed under t1 dif 100rdf 1 78 kg m3 which was 202 more than that under ridge sowing 0 59 kg m3 the lowest water productivity among treatments under drip irrigation was produced by t6 3dif 50rdf 1 19 kg m3 which was 102 more than that under ridge sowing control treatment the results regarding water productivity under different treatments are shown in table 5 3 8 saltmed model applications calibration validation and scenario simulation to calibrate saltmed for soil moisture and soil salinity soil samples were taken seven times before sowing 12 das 25 das 45 das 58 das 88 das and 115 das from t1 dif 100rf at different depths during the entire cropping season in 2015 these samples were analyzed in the laboratory for determination of soil moisture and extractable soil salinity ece the illustration of comparison between observed and simulated values of soil moisture and soil salinity for different soil layers is shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the r2 for soil moisture and soil salinity was 0 793 and 0 984 for 0 15 cm soil depth 0 814 and 0 918 for 16 30 cm soil depth 0 852 and 0 906 for 31 45 cm soil depth and 0 800 and 0 975 for 46 60 cm soil depth respectively the r2 of upper soil layers for soil moisture was low it may be due to more variation in soil moisture of the upper soil layer 0 15 cm which was directly under the influence of irrigation and evaporation silva et al 2013 reported another reason of similar behavior of the top soil layer regarding soil moisture variation and reported that this trend was due to higher root development in the top layer which relates to plant water uptake and ultimately more variation in the soil moisture the higher values of r2 for soil salinity showed the accuracy of the calibration process after model calibration for soil moisture and soil slinity calibration was performed for crop parameters i e dmw and gy a similar approach was used for calibration of crop parameters as used during calibration of the soil parameters plant dmw was measured five times 17th dae 50th dae 66th dae 80th dae and at harvesting during the growing season and gy once at the time of harvesting to compare it with simulated dmw and gy respectively the observed data along with respective simulated dmw and gy are given in table 6 the calibration process revealed the model ability to predict dmw within acceptable limits of d the d ranged from 7 19 to 2 41 for dmw for gy the d between observed and simulated data was 2 11 the data for soil samples taken four times 25th das 58th das 88th das 115th das at four depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm from all treatments except t1 were used to validate the model for soil moisture and soil salinity data the correlation between measured and simulated data of soil moisture and soil salinity in different soil layers are given in figs 5 and 6 the r2 for soil moisture and soil salinity was 0 864 and 0 829 respectively for 0 15 cm 0 802 and 0 875 respectively for 16 30 cm 0 853 and 0 86 respectively for 31 45 cm 0 816 and 0 828 respectively for 46 60 cm the results regarding goodness of fit for soil moisture and soil salinity are shown in table 7 the rmse for soil moisture varied from 0 007 to 0 012 within the soil profile the rmse for soil salinity was determined as 0 376 0 305 0 344 and 0 341 for 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm soil layer respectively the highest crm for soil moisture was obtained for the 0 15 cm layer crm 0 024 followed by the 31 45 cm layer crm 0 007 46 60 cm layer crm 0 004 and 16 30 cm layer crm 0 028 respectively the values of crm varied from 0 054 to 0 242 for soil salinity that shows the potential of model predictions simulated and observed values of dmw and gy from all treatments of both seasons except t1 in the 2015 season were used for validation of crop parameters i e dmw and gy the average values of simulated dmw against observed dmw for different irrigation frequencies are shown in fig 7 these results regarding simulated dmw showed that simulated dmw values under different irrigation frequencies were very close to each other at the start of the season and started to deviate later from each other with crop growth the average observed dmw values with standard error bars show significance between observed and simulated data sets fig 7 the close agreement between simulated and observed values of dmw and gy can also be seen from figs 8 and 9 the values of r2 for dmw and gy were 0 899 and 0 831 respectively the observed and simulated data for dmw and grain yields at the time of harvest are shown in table 8 to calculate d the highest d for dmw and gy were 7 64 and 11 32 respectively for the 2015 season and 2 56 and 19 65 respectively for the 2016 season the values of d between simulated and observed data were within an acceptable range of 20 defined by mahmood 2004 and thus the model predictions regarding dmw and gy were acceptable the accuracy of model predictions regarding dmw and gy can be examined from results of goodness of fit table 9 the values of rmse were 0 513 and 0 606 for dmw and gy respectively the model slightly overestimated dmw and gy with crm 0 013 and crm 0 028 respectively after successful calibration and validation of the model different simulations were developed using the saltmed model as dif fertilized with 100rdf produced the highest yield and yield components therefore simulations were developed using higher fertigation rates i e 125 rdf 125rdf and 150 rdf 150rdf with dif for the 2015 season to optimize fertigation rate for corn production the model simulations showed that the dmw was 19 76 t ha under 125rdf which was 2 91 more than that under 100rdf 19 2 t ha as fertigation rate increased from 125rdf 19 76 t ha to 150rdf 19 12 t ha dmw decreased 3 23 these rsults revealed that potential of fertigation to produce dmw started to decrease above 125rdf similarly gy was also simulated for 125rdf and 150rdf under dif the results showed that gy increased as the fertigation rate increased to 125rdf 10 62 t ha but when ferigation rate increased to 150rdf then the gy dropped to 10 11 t ha this reduction in gy was due to excessive fertigation that probably created hazardous environment that reduced plant water uptake and ultimately reduced gy reduction in gy with an increase in fertigation rate has also been reported by arif 2011 maqsood et al 2001 the results of crop response under different fertigation rates are shown in table 10 3 9 economic analysis total production cost of corn was calculated and shown in table 11 the market price of corn was taken as crop income the highest net profit was obtained under 100rdf us ha 1070 despite the higher yield under 125rdf the net profit dropped 11 6 when fertigation rate moved from 100rdf to 125rdf it shows that beyond 100rdf the potential of fertilizer to produce better crop yield became lower than its market price the lowest net profit among treatments under drip irrigation was obtained for 150rdf us ha 777 the net profit under the control treatment us ha 399 was 168 lower than that under 100 rdf the results regarding net profit are shown in table 12 4 conclusions and recommendations the treatment with 100rdf produced the highest plh 189 12 cm dmw 17 87 t ha and gy 9 47 t ha the highest crop parameters including plh 185 54 cm dmw 17 18 t ha and gy 8 68 t ha were produced by dif which was significantly higher than that under 5dif and 3dif respectively it was observed that drip irrigation saved 48 of irrigation water with an average irrigation depth of 556 mm in comparison to 1063 mm under ridge sowing treatment t1 dif 100rdf produced the highest water productivity 1 78 kg m3 and net profit us ha 1070 the saltmed model simulations showed good performance with rmse ranging from 0 007 to 0 012 for soil moisture and 0 305 to 0 376 for soil salinity r2 ranged from 0 802 to 0 864 for soil moisture and 0 828 to 0 875 for soil salinity and crm ranged from 0 028 to 0 024 for soil moisture and 0 054 to 0 242 for soil salinity the highest d between observed and simulated data of dmw and gy were 7 64 and 11 32 respectively for the 2015 season and 2 56 and 19 65 respectively for the 2016 season the rmse r2 and crm were 0 513 0 831 and 0 013 respectively for dmw and 0 606 0 899 and 0 028 respectively for gy based on the findings it is recommended that drip irrigation should be operated on a daily basis coupled with 100rdf for economically higher production of corn in semi arid climate such as the study site moreover saltmed proved its ability to perform simulations accurately under different irrigation and fertigation options acknowledgements the authors express their deepest appreciation to scientists of the nuclear institute for agriculture and biology niab faisalabad pakistan and water management research centre wmrc university of agriculture faisalabad uaf for

to 1063 mm under ridge sowing the saltmed model simulations showed good performance with root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 007 to 0 012 for soil moisture and 0 305 to 0 376 for soil salinity coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 802 to 0 864 for soil moisture and 0 828 to 0 875 for soil salinity and coefficient of residual mass crm ranged from 0 028 to 0 024 for soil moisture and 0 054 to 0 242 for soil salinity the highest percentage of difference d between observed and simulated values for dmw and gy was 2 56 and 19 65 respectively the rmse r2 and crm were found as 0 513 0 831 and 0 013 respectively for dmw and 0 606 0 899 and 0 028 respectively for gy the scenario simulation showed that dmw and gy increased 2 9 and 1 6 respectively with increase in rdf from 100 rdf to 125 rdf that reduced net profit upto 11 6 based on these findings it is recommended that drip irrigation should be operated on a daily basis coupled with 100rdf for economical corn production keywords corn drip irrigation fertigation rate irrigation frequency saltmed model 1 introduction pakistan is an agricultural based country and corn is the fourth largest grown crop which contributes 2 2 to its agricultural value added and 2 5 to agricultural gdp government of pakistan 2017 the annual production of corn is 4 9 million tons which can be increased by adopting modern technologies such as drip fertigation drip irrigation with 85 90 application efficiency allen et al 1998 applies irrigation water only to crop roots and ultimately enhances water productivity drip irrigation can also be an effective tool to enhance crop productivity if balanced fertilizers are applied during irrigation fertigation balanced fertigation can reduce fertilizer applications by 25 to achieve economically better crop production chauhdary et al 2017 several researchers have reported the advantages and benefits of drip irrigation systems and better crop response biswas et al 2015 dağdelen et al 2006 howell and meron 2015 mansour et al 2013 tayel et al 2008 despite these advantages drip irrigation has some limitations like the risk of salt accumulation in the crop root zone due to limited water applications which can affect plant growth the problem of salt accumulation becomes more severe with the use of saline water farmers in punjab pakistan primarily use groundwater for irrigation of crops due to shortage of fresh surface water but the groundwater of punjab pakistan is relatively saline in nature marginal to poor quality water having electrical conductivity ec ranging from 2 5 to 4 2 ds m qureshi et al 2002 that is causing salt accumulation in the root zone these accumulated salts can be leached from the root zone by applying flood irrigation once or twice during the cropping season but it can reduce water productivity so there is an option to leach salts from crop root zone using drip irrigation itself by applying intense irrigation through changing irrigation frequency to find optimized fertigation rate and irrigation frequency testing of several treatments can be a time consuming and an expensive practice in the field therefore the crop response under higher fertigation rates and different irrigation frequencies can be simulated under different management scenarios using computer models computer models such as saltmed are widely used in the field of agriculture to study crop and soil behavior under varying management conditions adam et al 2011 flowers et al 2005 murthy 2004 ragab 2002 the reliability of model simulations depends on proper model development calibration and validation for field conditions keeping in mind the above discussion the present study was designed to investigate the effects of different fertigation rates i e 100 rdf recommended dose of fertigation 75 rdf and 50 rdf on corn yields based on three irrigation frequencies daily irrigation frequency 3rd day irrigation frequency and 5th day irrigation frequency to optimize their use for economical production of corn under drip irrigation in addition the saltmed model was calibrated and tested for performing simulations regarding corn response and root zone salinity dynamics under different management scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and climate of study site the study area has a subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 350 mm most of which falls during monsoon july september in the form of high intensity rainfall the temperature of the study area varies from 50 c in summer june to around the freezing point in the winter january average annual evaporation of the study area is 1600 mm and daily values vary from 11 4 mm in summer to 2 mm in winter may and june are the driest months with 30 relative humidity the soil of the study area is sandy loam up to a depth of 1 m with flat topography a variety of crops can be grown due to highly productive soil of the study area ahmad et al 2007 the experiment was conducted in the spring seasons of two consecutive years 2015 and 2016 2 2 water sampling and analysis to study saline water effects on crop growth and root zone salinity dynamics tubewell water was applied three sources of tubewell water skimming well pars tubewell solar powered tubewell are available at the study area and water of these tubewells was used for irrigation of corn a skimming well is installed in a dug well 7 m deep from ground surface with a shallow bore depth of 21 m 10 m blind and 11 m screen with multi bores five bores the tubewell discharge is 100 m3 h 1 with total dynamic head of 45 m the pars tubewell has a 37 m bore depth and 100 m3 h 1 discharge the solar powered tubewell has a 32 m bore depth 18 m blind and 14 m screen and 50 m3 h 1 discharge in the solar powered tubewell a submersible pump is placed in 15 cm internal dia casing pipe at a depth of 22 m from the ground surface irrigation water samples were collected after the start of tubewell pumping upto 45 min at 15 min time intervals to analyze water quality in terms of ph electrical conductivity ec in ds m sodium adsorption ratio sar in meq l and residual sodium carbonate rsc in meq l the ec of irrigation water before every irrigation was measured using a portable ec meter dist 3 hanna in the field and the data were used as input for the model simulations 2 3 bulk density infiltration rate field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of soil soil samples were taken from different soil depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm just before sowing by using a sampling core and the bulk density was determined by dividing soil dry weight with soil bulk volume the soil infiltration rate was determined in the field at five locations using a double ring infiltrometer the infiltration data was used in the model run and to determine the suitable emitter discharge rate and their spacing on the lateral to avoid water ponding and runoff alberta agriculture food and rural development 2004 additional soil samples were analyzed using a pressure plate apparatus cat 1600 to determine field capacity and wilting point in the soil physics laboratory of the university of agriculture faisalabad the 1 3 bar pressure for field capacity and 15 bar pressure for permanent wilting point were applied to drain excess water from the soil samples the pressure application was continued until the drainage of water from soil samples was stopped after establishment of equilibrium after that the retained moisture content of the soil samples was measured using the gravimetric method for determination of the field capacity and permanent wilting point 2 4 experimental design and corn cultivation the experiment was laid out according to factorial design under a rcbd randomized complete block design arrangement with nine treatments and three replicates to analyze their effects on corn production as shown in fig 1 the experimental treatments included three irrigation frequencies dif daily irrigation frequency 3dif 3rd day irrigation frequency and 5dif 5th day irrigation frequency and three fertigation rates 100rdf 100 rdf recommended dose of fertigation 75rdf 75 rdf and 50rdf 50 rdf the nine treatments were t1 dif 100rdf t2 dif 75rdf t3 dif 50rdf t4 3dif 100rdf t5 3dif 75rdf t6 3dif 50rdf t7 5dif 100rdf t8 5dif 75rdf t9 5dif 50rdf along with these nine treatments under drip irrigation one control treatment ridge sowing with furrow irrigation was also included for comparison with treatments under drip irrigation the analysis of variance anova test was performed to determine the response of crop parameters to experimental treatments under both cropping seasons treatment means were compared using least significant difference lsd at p 0 05 probability according to the procedure adopted by chauhdary et al 2015 and chauhdary et al 2016 traditional planting of corn is mostly done on a ridge furrow irrigation system however it was replaced by flat sowing under drip irrigation drip laterals were placed at one meter distance from each other row to row spacing a 20 cm small channel called a drip channel was formed for placement of drip line as this is a popular practice for crops under drip irrigation this practice was adopted to avoid fertilizer loss and to get maximum emitter uniformity the recommended plant population was maintained by planting corn seeds on both sides of the drip channel with the help of a dibbler to maintain 23 cm plant to plant distance and at a distance of one cm from top corner of drip channel in a zigzag pattern the corn sowing was done after establishment of field capacity for better germination dehghanisanij et al 2006 the layout of corn planting is shown in fig 2 2 5 irrigation and water productivity the cropwat model was used to calculate crop water requirement cwr using the past ten years 2005 2014 climatic data for study area cropwat is a decision support system developed by food and agriculture organization fao and uses the penman monteith equation for calculating crop water requirements cwr based on soil climate and crop data in addition the program allows the development of irrigation schedules for different management conditions and calculation of the scheme water supply for varying crop patterns cropwat can also be used to evaluate farmers irrigation practices and to estimate crop performance under both rainfed and irrigated conditions under dif irrigation was applied on a daily basis according to the daily crop water requirement under 3dif cumulative irrigation of three days was applied on every 3rd day similarly under 5dif cumulative irrigation of five days was applied on every 5th day under control treatment irrigation was applied according to local farmer practices related to climatic and crop conditions the discharge for drip irrigation was noted by a flow meter and discharge for control treatment was measured with a cut throat flume 7 5 20 cm in size then the discharge was multiplied with irrigation time to calculate irrigation volume and total irrigation volume was calculated by adding all irrigations then irrigation volume was divided by respective cropping area to calculate irrigation depth the water productivity was calculated by dividing corn marketable yield grain yield with irrigation volume 2 6 fertigation for fertigation water soluble fertilizer wsf of n p k 20 20 20 was used according to recommendations of the punjab agriculture department pakistan the required quantities of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k were 250 kg ha 125 kg ha and 125 kg ha respectively for corn production in punjab pakistan as the n p k ratio in wsf was 1 1 1 and the required ratio of n p k was 2 1 1 therefore urea fertilizer was used as an additional nitrogen source to obtain the required ratio of n p k 2 1 1 the total calculated quantity of wsf along with urea table 1 was divided into a number of doses and applied in split applications with each irrigation under different irrigation frequencies accordingly the split application of fertilizer was recommended by tharmar and pandian 2010 for better utilization of nutrients by crops for fertilization of control treatment urea dap diammonium phosphate and mop muriate of potash were used the dap diammonium phosphate and mop muriate of potash were applied manually during land preparation as a basal dose and urea was applied manually in four split doses 1st application on 15 20th days after emergence dae 2nd application on 30 40th dae 3rd application on 50 60th dae and 4th application 70 80th dae during the growing season the required quantities of wsf urea dap and mop are given in table 1 for different treatments 2 7 soil moisture and salinity data collection for determination of initial conditions for soil moisture and salinity the soil samples from nine locations 3 at one side 3 at middle and 3 at other side along the length of the field were taken at different depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm these samples were analyzed in the wmrc lab for soil moisture by gravimetric method and soil salinity by soil solution extract ece moreover soil samples were taken four times during the growing season 25th day after sowing das 58th das 88th das 115th das from different treatments at different depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm these results were compared with the simulated model results regarding soil moisture and salinity for calibration and validation of the saltmed model 2 8 crop data collection crop data regarding emergence rate er plant height plh dry matter weight dmw and grain yield gy were measured during and at the end of growing season for determination of er dmw and gy one square meter frame was used three consecutive rows of corn were considered in one square meter frame according to the plant geometry the er was measured after emergence of corn plants and gy was measured at end of the season however dmw was measured five times during the cropping season 17th day after emergence dae 50th dae 66th dae 80th dae and at harvesting for better calibration of the saltmed model for this purpose plants from one square meter were harvested at three locations head middle and tail in each plot chopped and oven dried to determine dmw the corn ears were threshed manually to measure gy later on dmw and gy were converted into tones ha for determination of plh twelve plants were selected randomly along the length of each experimental plot four at head four at middle and four at tail and tagged at the start of season the height of tagged plants was measured at crop maturity 2 9 saltmed model and its applications the saltmed model ragab 2015 was developed to account for different water qualities irrigation systems irrigation strategies different soils and crops salinity n fertilizer applications drought and drainage systems for shallow groundwater the key processes of saltmed are evapotranspiration plant water uptake water and solute transport under different irrigation systems drainage and the relationship between crop yield and water use and relationship between salinity and crop yield and yield components the model has been used in different parts of the world under different management systems and climatic conditions for simulations of different crops a detailed description of saltmed has been provided by different researchers ragab 2015 2002 ragab et al 2005a b the saltmed model v 2015 was used in the current study for development of management scenarios under different experimental treatments in the semi arid climate of faisalabad pakistan the saltmed model was calibrated using treatment t1 dif 100rdf for the year 2015 for model calibration meteorological data were taken from the weather station installed at university of agriculture faisalabad uaf the irrigation data including irrigation time drip emitter flow rate salinity of irrigation water concentration of urea and nitrogen n in irrigation water were measured in field during every irrigation sowing and harvesting date of corn plant height harvest index and leaf area index were taken from field measurements the initial soil moisture soil salinity field capacity permanent wilting point and porosity were determined in the laboratory the crop root depth unstressed crop yield and length of each growth stage were taken from literature anjum et al 2014 chauhdary 2018 the values of crop coefficients kc kcb fc and π50 the osmotic pressure at which the water uptake is reduced to 50 of the maximum or potential water uptake for each growth stage were taken from model database the π50 is an indicator of crop salinity tolerance its high values represent salt tolerant plants and low values represent less salt tolerant plants the values of π50 for the initial stage mid stage and end stage of corn were taken as 5 ds m 5 9 ds m and 5 9 ds m for model validation model runs were performed for the remaining treatments of the 2015 season and all treatments of the 2016 season after successful calibration and validation model scenario simulations were performed for higher fertigation rates to find optimum fertigation rate 2 10 goodness of fit model evaluation criteria for evaluation of model performance five statistical indicators including percentage of difference d root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of residual mass crm were used to evaluate model simulation processes these indicators were used by several researchers bakhsh et al 2004 loague and green 1991 vinten et al 1991 the d calculates the difference between simulated data and observed data the d was calculated using eq 1 1 d s i o i o i 100 the value of rmse equal to zero indicated the goodness of fit between simulated and observed data it can be calculated by using eq 2 2 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 0 5 the r2 was determined by regression analysis between measured and predicted values using eq 3 the r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 r2 1 indicates a perfect correlation between observed and simulated values 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o a v e s i s a v e 2 i 1 n o i o a v e 2 i 1 n s i s a v e 2 the crm shows the overestimation or underestimation of model predictions negative value for crm indicates overestimation of model predictions and a positive value for crm indicates underestimation of model predictions crm was calculated using eq 4 4 c r m i 1 n o i i 1 n s i i 1 n o i where oi is the observed data oavg is the average of observed data si is the corresponding simulated data savg is the average of simulated data and n is number of observations 2 11 economic analysis the economic analysis of any agronomic practice is essential from farmer s point of view as they are often interested in benefits and cost of a certain technology the net profit is an indicator that shows the profitability and adoptability of any new sowing technique the net profit was taken as the difference between crop income and crop production cost the crop income and production cost were calculated according to the procedure adopted by chauhdary et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 quality of irrigation water due to shallow depth water quality of the skimming well was found as suitable for irrigation as it has average values of ec 1 49 ds m ph 7 58 sar 10 4 meq l and rsc 2 46 meq l the water quality of the pars tubewell was identified as unfit for irrigation with average values of ec 2 78 ds m ph 7 61 sar 18 1 meq l and rsc 5 15 meq l the water of the solar powered tubewell was marginally suitable for irrigation with average values of ec ph sar and rsc as 2 19 ds m 7 62 14 36 meq l and 3 45 meq l which lies in marginal ranges of water quality standards defined by wapda water and power development authority pakistan the quality of solar tubewell water was relatively better than that of the pars tubewell due to the shallow bore depth the minor variation in chemical properties occurred due to an up coning effect of saline water from lower groundwater layers with time equilibrium was established and the chemical properties of groundwater became stable the water quality standards and results of tubewell water quality are given in table 2 3 2 bulk density infiltration rate field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp of soil the average values of soil bulk densities were 1 56 1 58 1 59 and 1 60 g cm3 for 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm soil depths respectively table 3 these results of bulk density for sandy loam soil are in accordance with the work of amin et al 2015 the infiltration rate varied from 0 79 to 0 94 cm h 1 and the average infiltration was 0 87 cm h 1 table 3 anjum 2013 anjum et al 2014 and gupta 1990 measured infiltration of sandy loam soil and reported similar ranges regarding infiltration rate comparatively the value of infiltration rate at location 3 was observed as lower it may be due to soil compaction at that point due to spatial variability and farm operations the field capacity fc of different soil samples varied from 17 95 to 18 18 at different locations and from 17 95 to 18 15 at different soil depths the permanent wilting point pwp ranged from 8 25 to 8 45 at different locations and from 8 30 to 8 48 at different depths this variation in the values of fc may be due to different factors that can affect fc kirkham 2014 described many factors in the field that can affect fc these factors include soil structure organic matter soil type water table and impermeable layers the overall average values of fc and pwp were 18 04 and 8 36 respectively and were used in the saltmed model run as input values the measured values of fc and pwp were very close to those reported by anjum 2013 and anjum et al 2014 who reported fc 21 7 and pwp 8 14 for sandy loam soil the results regarding fc and pwp are presented in table 4 3 3 emergence rate er corn er was observed after emergence eight days after sowing of corn plants in every experimental plot it should be noted that applications of the fertigation and irrigation treatments were started after completion of emergence therefore the results did not represent any treatment effects table 5 3 4 plant height plh the corn plant heights plh was 185 54 cm 172 93 cm and 179 06 cm under dif 3dif and 5dif respectively it was due to the fact that under both dif and 3dif the salts remained in the root zone but under dif salts did not retard crop growth due to dilution effects with daily water application as compared to 3dif therefore the plh was higher under dif than 3dif the plh under 5dif was higher than 3dif because of heavy irrigation application under the 5dif that leached salts from the root zone which ultimately created a favorable environment in the root zone for crop growth the effects of irrigation frequencies on plh was also studied by anjum et al 2014 chauhdary et al 2017 jiotode et al 2002 and they reported similar results variations in plh in response to different fertigation rates are shown in table 5 the highest plh was produced under 100rdf 189 12 cm that was statistically higher than that under 75rdf 178 96 cm and 50rdf 169 45 cm respectively increased plh under higher rates of fertigation to an optimum level has also been reported by inamullah et al 2011 3 5 dry matter weight dmw dmw was 17 18 t ha 15 67 t ha and 16 47 t ha under dif 3dif and 5dif respectively the dif produced significantly higher dmw than that under 5dif that is significantly higher than that under 3dif these results are in accordance with the work of amin et al 2015 anjum et al 2014 who studied the effects of 2 day 4 day and 6 day irrigation frequency on corn dry matter production the highest dmw was produced by 100rdf 17 87 t ha which was significantly higher than that under 75rdf 16 28 t ha and 50rdf 15 17 t ha the variation in dmw with respect to fertigation rates has also been reported by other researchers hammad et al 2011 inamullah et al 2011 muhammad et al 2002 3 6 grain yield gy the gy under dif 8 68 t ha was significantly higher than that under 3dif 7 79 t ha and 5dif 8 12 t ha the gy under 5dif was significantly higher than that under 3dif under dif crop response was better due to higher water uptake because of higher water potential due to enough soil moisture although the salts remained in the root zone under dif but due to dilution effects water potential was enough to support plant water uptake under 3dif water potential was higher before next irrigation on the 3rd day as compared to that under 5dif but due to presence of higher salt concentration in the root zone water uptake was restricted due to higher osmotic potential under 5dif the water potential was lower before next irrigation on the 5th day but due to less salt concentration due to leaching of salts from the root zone osmotic potential was lower and supported plant water uptake thus corn gy under 5dif was higher than that under 3dif this phenomenon has been supported by the literature ragab 2015 2002 better yield under higher irrigation frequency has also been reported by amin et al 2015 apostolakis et al 2016 dağdelen et al 2006 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 istanbulluoglu et al 2002 the highest gy was produced by 100rdf 9 47 t ha which was reduced when fertigation rate moved from 100rdf to 75rdf 8 44 t ha and 50 rdf 6 68 t ha the effect of fertigation rate on corn yield was studied by abayomi et al 2006 al kaisi and kwaw mensah 2007 arif 2011 who reported similar trends regarding corn gy the highest and lowest gy among the treatments with drip irrigation were produced by t1 dif 100rdf 9 98 t ha and t6 3dif 50rdf 6 61 t ha respectively the gy was 59 4 and 5 6 higher under t1 and t6 respectively than that under the control treatment 6 26 t ha 3 7 irrigation and water productivity the irrigation depth was 547 mm for the 2015 season and 564 mm for the 2016 season under all treatments irrigated with drip irrigation for control treatment applied irrigation was 1000 mm and 1125 mm for the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively drip irrigation reduced irrigation water use by 48 with average irrigation depth of 556 mm in comparison to that under ridge sowing 1063 mm water savings under drip irrigation has also been reported by ashraf 2014 chauhdary et al 2017 the amount of rainfall during cropping season was 131 mm and 104 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the highest water productivity was observed under t1 dif 100rdf 1 78 kg m3 which was 202 more than that under ridge sowing 0 59 kg m3 the lowest water productivity among treatments under drip irrigation was produced by t6 3dif 50rdf 1 19 kg m3 which was 102 more than that under ridge sowing control treatment the results regarding water productivity under different treatments are shown in table 5 3 8 saltmed model applications calibration validation and scenario simulation to calibrate saltmed for soil moisture and soil salinity soil samples were taken seven times before sowing 12 das 25 das 45 das 58 das 88 das and 115 das from t1 dif 100rf at different depths during the entire cropping season in 2015 these samples were analyzed in the laboratory for determination of soil moisture and extractable soil salinity ece the illustration of comparison between observed and simulated values of soil moisture and soil salinity for different soil layers is shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the r2 for soil moisture and soil salinity was 0 793 and 0 984 for 0 15 cm soil depth 0 814 and 0 918 for 16 30 cm soil depth 0 852 and 0 906 for 31 45 cm soil depth and 0 800 and 0 975 for 46 60 cm soil depth respectively the r2 of upper soil layers for soil moisture was low it may be due to more variation in soil moisture of the upper soil layer 0 15 cm which was directly under the influence of irrigation and evaporation silva et al 2013 reported another reason of similar behavior of the top soil layer regarding soil moisture variation and reported that this trend was due to higher root development in the top layer which relates to plant water uptake and ultimately more variation in the soil moisture the higher values of r2 for soil salinity showed the accuracy of the calibration process after model calibration for soil moisture and soil slinity calibration was performed for crop parameters i e dmw and gy a similar approach was used for calibration of crop parameters as used during calibration of the soil parameters plant dmw was measured five times 17th dae 50th dae 66th dae 80th dae and at harvesting during the growing season and gy once at the time of harvesting to compare it with simulated dmw and gy respectively the observed data along with respective simulated dmw and gy are given in table 6 the calibration process revealed the model ability to predict dmw within acceptable limits of d the d ranged from 7 19 to 2 41 for dmw for gy the d between observed and simulated data was 2 11 the data for soil samples taken four times 25th das 58th das 88th das 115th das at four depths 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm from all treatments except t1 were used to validate the model for soil moisture and soil salinity data the correlation between measured and simulated data of soil moisture and soil salinity in different soil layers are given in figs 5 and 6 the r2 for soil moisture and soil salinity was 0 864 and 0 829 respectively for 0 15 cm 0 802 and 0 875 respectively for 16 30 cm 0 853 and 0 86 respectively for 31 45 cm 0 816 and 0 828 respectively for 46 60 cm the results regarding goodness of fit for soil moisture and soil salinity are shown in table 7 the rmse for soil moisture varied from 0 007 to 0 012 within the soil profile the rmse for soil salinity was determined as 0 376 0 305 0 344 and 0 341 for 0 15 cm 16 30 cm 31 45 cm and 46 60 cm soil layer respectively the highest crm for soil moisture was obtained for the 0 15 cm layer crm 0 024 followed by the 31 45 cm layer crm 0 007 46 60 cm layer crm 0 004 and 16 30 cm layer crm 0 028 respectively the values of crm varied from 0 054 to 0 242 for soil salinity that shows the potential of model predictions simulated and observed values of dmw and gy from all treatments of both seasons except t1 in the 2015 season were used for validation of crop parameters i e dmw and gy the average values of simulated dmw against observed dmw for different irrigation frequencies are shown in fig 7 these results regarding simulated dmw showed that simulated dmw values under different irrigation frequencies were very close to each other at the start of the season and started to deviate later from each other with crop growth the average observed dmw values with standard error bars show significance between observed and simulated data sets fig 7 the close agreement between simulated and observed values of dmw and gy can also be seen from figs 8 and 9 the values of r2 for dmw and gy were 0 899 and 0 831 respectively the observed and simulated data for dmw and grain yields at the time of harvest are shown in table 8 to calculate d the highest d for dmw and gy were 7 64 and 11 32 respectively for the 2015 season and 2 56 and 19 65 respectively for the 2016 season the values of d between simulated and observed data were within an acceptable range of 20 defined by mahmood 2004 and thus the model predictions regarding dmw and gy were acceptable the accuracy of model predictions regarding dmw and gy can be examined from results of goodness of fit table 9 the values of rmse were 0 513 and 0 606 for dmw and gy respectively the model slightly overestimated dmw and gy with crm 0 013 and crm 0 028 respectively after successful calibration and validation of the model different simulations were developed using the saltmed model as dif fertilized with 100rdf produced the highest yield and yield components therefore simulations were developed using higher fertigation rates i e 125 rdf 125rdf and 150 rdf 150rdf with dif for the 2015 season to optimize fertigation rate for corn production the model simulations showed that the dmw was 19 76 t ha under 125rdf which was 2 91 more than that under 100rdf 19 2 t ha as fertigation rate increased from 125rdf 19 76 t ha to 150rdf 19 12 t ha dmw decreased 3 23 these rsults revealed that potential of fertigation to produce dmw started to decrease above 125rdf similarly gy was also simulated for 125rdf and 150rdf under dif the results showed that gy increased as the fertigation rate increased to 125rdf 10 62 t ha but when ferigation rate increased to 150rdf then the gy dropped to 10 11 t ha this reduction in gy was due to excessive fertigation that probably created hazardous environment that reduced plant water uptake and ultimately reduced gy reduction in gy with an increase in fertigation rate has also been reported by arif 2011 maqsood et al 2001 the results of crop response under different fertigation rates are shown in table 10 3 9 economic analysis total production cost of corn was calculated and shown in table 11 the market price of corn was taken as crop income the highest net profit was obtained under 100rdf us ha 1070 despite the higher yield under 125rdf the net profit dropped 11 6 when fertigation rate moved from 100rdf to 125rdf it shows that beyond 100rdf the potential of fertilizer to produce better crop yield became lower than its market price the lowest net profit among treatments under drip irrigation was obtained for 150rdf us ha 777 the net profit under the control treatment us ha 399 was 168 lower than that under 100 rdf the results regarding net profit are shown in table 12 4 conclusions and recommendations the treatment with 100rdf produced the highest plh 189 12 cm dmw 17 87 t ha and gy 9 47 t ha the highest crop parameters including plh 185 54 cm dmw 17 18 t ha and gy 8 68 t ha were produced by dif which was significantly higher than that under 5dif and 3dif respectively it was observed that drip irrigation saved 48 of irrigation water with an average irrigation depth of 556 mm in comparison to 1063 mm under ridge sowing treatment t1 dif 100rdf produced the highest water productivity 1 78 kg m3 and net profit us ha 1070 the saltmed model simulations showed good performance with rmse ranging from 0 007 to 0 012 for soil moisture and 0 305 to 0 376 for soil salinity r2 ranged from 0 802 to 0 864 for soil moisture and 0 828 to 0 875 for soil salinity and crm ranged from 0 028 to 0 024 for soil moisture and 0 054 to 0 242 for soil salinity the highest d between observed and simulated data of dmw and gy were 7 64 and 11 32 respectively for the 2015 season and 2 56 and 19 65 respectively for the 2016 season the rmse r2 and crm were 0 513 0 831 and 0 013 respectively for dmw and 0 606 0 899 and 0 028 respectively for gy based on the findings it is recommended that drip irrigation should be operated on a daily basis coupled with 100rdf for economically higher production of corn in semi arid climate such as the study site moreover saltmed proved its ability to perform simulations accurately under different irrigation and fertigation options acknowledgements the authors express their
