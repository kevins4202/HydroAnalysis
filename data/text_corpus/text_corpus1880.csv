9400,evapotranspiration et a key component of crop water balance is essential for growers to manage agricultural irrigation metric model is increasingly used to estimate and map et with satellite observations especially at daily and field scales however the analysis of its uncertainties on tree crop et estimation is very limited we used metric model to estimate daily et over the almond and pistachio orchards throughout the entire growing season in the san joaquin valley california and evaluated the impacts of variations in meteorological variables land surface parameters and different study sizes on et estimation the results showed that the metric based daily et estimates of the almond and pistachio trees were most sensitive to net radiation rn followed by instantaneous reference et eto land surface temperature lst and near surface temperature difference dt when a 5 error was added to rn the uncertainty in daily et estimates was up to 8 44 1 24 corresponding to a mean increase of 0 45 0 02 mm day throughout the entire growing season a 5 or 0 5 k error in instantaneous eto lst and dt also caused changes in daily et estimates by 4 15 3 75 2 97 0 14 and 2 31 1 20 respectively et estimates with metric were relatively much less sensitive to other variables the results from different study sizes indicated that daily et estimates in size 2 were 0 33 0 08 mm day overestimation compared with those from size 1 in the almond site similarly a mean overestimation of 0 30 0 14 mm day was found between size 1 and size 3 in the pistachio sites throughout the entire growing season this study demonstrates the potential to further improve the accuracy of remote sensing based et estimation for complex tree crops with metric model by optimizing key parameters and choosing a proper domain size for study area keywords sensitivity analysis evapotranspiration metric tree crop remote sensing south san joaquin valley 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important component of the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance that links water energy and carbon cycles campbell and norman 1998 jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 it is closely related to crop water use in the context of agricultural irrigation management rana et al 2005 williams and ayars 2005 french et al 2015 he et al 2017 xue et al 2020 accurate estimation of crop et can improve crop water use efficiency and rationally allocate water resources qiu et al 2019 han et al 2021 wang et al 2021 especially for water scarce regions compared with ground based methods to measure et such as eddy covariance twine et al 2000 gu et al 2012 lysimeters allen et al 1991 and surface renewal techniques mcelrone et al 2013 shapland et al 2014 remote sensing based et models have a great advantage of estimating and mapping et in the temporal and spatial patterns it would be providing a scientific guidance for improving water resource management mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric was proposed by allen et al 2007a based on the theoretical and computational basis of surface energy balance algorithms for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 for estimating et by incorporating satellite observations and a few of high quality weather data metric model has its significant advantage over sebal in that using the weather station based reference et etr to serve as a real ground reference on the satellite image based actual et allen et al 2007a the etr was used to build surface energy balance conditions at the cold and hot pixels for a linear relationship between land surface temperature lst and near surface temperature difference dt in sensible heat flux h estimation also metric model applies fraction of reference et etrf as a real time crop coefficient for extrapolating from instantaneous et satellite overpassing time to daily et satellite overpassing date allen et al 2007a 2011 contrasting with other remote sensing et models such as the lst based atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model at continental scales anderson et al 2007 and simplified surface energy balance sseb model with modis images senay et al 2007 metric model was initially designed for regions smaller than a few hundred kilometers in scale and produced high accurate et maps at high spatial resolution allen et al 2007a for the relatively complex terrain and weather conditions it was suggested to divide the satellite image into several parts and to calculate et separately since the weather of study area need to be relatively uniform for cold and hot pixels selection in the metric model assumes allen et al 2014 the metric model is a feasible tool for estimating and mapping et in temporal spatial variability it has been widely used for water consumption from natural vegetation to agricultural crops determination of crop coefficients irrigation schedules and water rights accounting in idaho california and new mexico allen et al 2007b case studies concluded that errors for seasonal et estimates were less than 4 in the growing seasons and errors for daily et estimates were about 13 20 for irrigated meadow and sugar beet crop allen et al 2007b french et al 2015 found metric model was used to provide good estimates of daily et over a cotton study site and they suggested metric model was preferred when sufficient ancillary data were not available he et al 2017 showed that monthly et estimates had a 9 68 relative mean difference between metric based versus observed et over an almond orchard ortega salazar et al 2021 found that the estimated errors within the metric model for daily et estimates were only between 4 and 6 of the measurements and the root mean square error rmse was 0 42 mm day for a drip irrigated olive orchard sensitivity analysis is very useful to identify the sensitive variables in a model and the suitable study size for improving model accuracy zhang et al 2017 long et al 2011 valipour et al 2020 analyzed the effect of meteorological variables on the reference et eto they found that wind speed was the most important variable driving the trends of eto in most regions anwar et al 2021 examined the sensitivity of the simulated summer potential et pet of tropical africa to lai and vegetation runoff systems using the regcm4 model other studies focused on the sensitivity of actual et estimates to bias in calibration and lst of metric model morton et al 2013 kilic et al 2016 selection of cold and hot pixels of the triangle sebal and metric models long and singh 2013 and meteorological factors of penman method at a region scale yang et al 2019 biazar et al 2019 allen et al 2013 performed a sensitivity analysis on metric model in mountainous areas they showed that increasing aerodynamic roughness increased convective heat transfer and decreased et estimation french et al 2015 revealed that the sensitivity of metric model was related to the season the relatively great sensitivity showed in the early growth of cotton at a fine spatial resolution however tree crops have complex canopy structure and physiology which cause the energy exchange processes more complicated jin et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis of tree crop et has received less attention compared to agricultural row crops we are aware of no studies focusing on the quantifying errors of metric based daily et estimates over orchards during the entire growth period also it is not clear how different study sizes impact on daily et estimates in the metric model in this study we performed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of tree crop daily et estimates by using metric model on two types of commercial orchards throughout the growth period the objective was to quantify the sensitivity of daily et estimates to errors in various meteorological variables and land surface parameters in addition appropriate study size could improve the estimated accuracy and it is crucial for correctly selecting cold and hot pixels in the metric model therefore we also investigated the impact of different study sizes on daily et estimates of an almond and three pistachio orchards in the san joaquin valley california usa 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on two types of commercial mature orchards located in south san joaquin valley california us fig 1 including one almond orchard he et al 2017 and three pistachio orchards jin et al 2018 the study site has a typical meditterranean climate of a hot and dry summer and a mild and wet winter the almond trees were planted in 1999 with a well watered management of drip and fanjet during the period 2009 2012 the canopy structure was homogeneous with the summer ndvi of 0 72 0 02 and the trees were about 7 0 m tall the control pistachio orchard was planted in 1990 with a relatively homogeneous canopy structure and a mean summer ndvi was 0 72 0 06 and tree height was 4 29 0 09 m the med s pistachio orchard was adjacent to high s orchard and they were planted in late1980s with a long term impact of soil salinity the med s orchard had a low to moderate salinity with ece varying from 1 3ds m to 7 0ds m and the summer ndvi was 0 67 0 05 and tree height was 3 73 0 18 m the high s orchard had a relatively heterogeneous canopy and low tree height with a mean summer ndvi of 0 52 0 06 and height of 2 88 0 41 m since the trees were suffered severe salt stress and a mean ece was 5 8ds m 2 4 11 2ds m during the period 2015 2016 2 2 datasets we used landsat 5 tm satellite observations path 42 row 035 for sensitivity analysis of daily et estimates in the almond site on may 12 july 15 and september 17 in 2010 and used landsat 8 oli tirs images path 42 row 035 in the pistachio sites on may 12 july 15 and september 17 in 2016 the metric based daily et estimates agreed well with the ground measurements on the selected dates i e a mean absolute bias mab of 0 47 mm day over the almond trees and a mab of 0 78 mm day over the pistachio trees he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 the observations from may 12 july 15 to september 17 represented the growth state of trees in the early middle and late stages for this study meteorological inputs in the metric model of air temperature ta near surface vapor pressure vp wind speed ws hourly and daily reference et of grass eto were obtained from the cimis stations 146

roughness length zom aerodynamic resistance rah and monin obukhov length l are also used in h estimation zom was estimated using the equation of zom 0 12 h paw u and meyers 1989 where h was the average tree height measured in each orchard during the growing season in addition metric uses two extreme endmembers of cold and hot pixels to calibrate the sensible heat flux in an iterative process to make the selection consistent for the long time series daily et estimation we followed an automatic endmember selection method which was developed by he et al 2017 the method was based on the statistics and cumulative histogram of ndvi and lst maps which combined a threshold and values at the fixed percentage such as the values of ndvi at the point of 95 5 and the values of lst at the point of 5 95 in the accumulated percentage curves to identify the cold hot pixels 2 4 sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity analysis was implemented by individually changing each parameter under a given set of values within 50 varying with a step size of 5 except for ta and lst the upper limit of the given ta and lst change was 5 k and the lower limit was 5 k with a 0 5 k interval this method was referenced to sánchez et al 2008 and long et al 2011 the sensitivity of metric based daily et estimates over almond and pistachio trees was tested throughout the entire growing season in this study the initial values for running metric model the reference values were set in accordance with the data used in the two papers of he et al 2017 and jin et al 2018 for sensitivity analysis to meteorological variables and land surface parameters study size of 801 801 pixels was chosen for the almond orchard and of 1101 2001 pixels was for three pistachio orchards size 1 with the nearest weather station in the images the station 146 belridge of california irrigation management information system cimis is about 2 0 km from the almond orchard and the station 15 stratford is about 11 5 km from the med s and high s pistachio orchards fig 1 for sensitivity analysis to domain size of study area we extent the width of 500 pixels and 1000 pixels outward based on the original study size that is the original study size was 801 801 pixels size 1 the second study size was 1801 1801 pixels size 2 and the third study size was 2801 2801 pixels size 3 for the almond site and study size 1 of 1101 2001 pixels size 2 of 2102 3001 pixels and size 3 of 3101 4001 pixels were used for three pistachio sites 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis to meteorological variables the metric based daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees were more sensitive to instantaneous eto compared to ta vp and ws throughout the entire growing season fig 2 results indicated that an error of 5 in instantaneous eto can result in a mean increase of 6 80 4 41 0 31 0 21 mm day in the daily et of almond trees corresponding to the changes of 36 39 10 84 w m2 in h estimates and 0 05 0 03 in etof the change of daily et in the pistachio sites was smaller than that in the almond site but a 1 50 0 94 0 09 0 07 mm day increase was still found with a 5 error in instantaneous eto corresponding to a 27 66 7 99 w m2 decrease in h estimates also we found that daily et of pistachio trees was more sensitive to instantaneous eto in the control site than that in the high s site for example when there was an error of 5 in instantaneous eto the mean variations in daily et were 1 71 1 05 0 12 0 08 mm day and 1 13 0 73 0 05 0 05 mm day in the control and high s sites respectively fig 3 table 1 the metric based daily et of both almond and pistachio trees was insensitive to ta fig 2 the daily ets were almost the same with the reference values where the error in ta was 0 fig s1 when an error of 0 5 k was in ta a mean variation of daily et was 0 013 0 004 while the ta had a large error of 5 k the change of daily ets was still minor resulting in the mean variation of 0 12 0 02 and 0 13 0 04 in daily et of almond and pistachio trees throughout the entire growing season table 1 likewise a 5 error in vp caused 0 24 0 06 and 0 06 0 02 increases in daily et of almond and pistachio trees which resulted in a corresponding change value of 0 01 mm day in daily et fig s2 table 1 when a 50 error was added to vp there was also a small increase of 2 41 0 57 0 11 0 02 mm day and 0 58 0 24 0 03 0 02 mm day respectively a 5 error in ws resulted in 0 76 0 51 and 0 41 0 29 variations in daily et corresponding to the decrease values of 0 03 mm day and 0 02 mm day fig s3 table 1 when there was a 50 error in ws the decreases of daily et values were 0 20 mm day in the almond site and 0 16 mm day in the pistachio site overall when there was an error of 5 or 0 5 k in instantaneous eto ta vp and ws the mean variations in metric based daily et throughout the entire growing season were 4 15 3 75 0 01 0 15 0 13 and 0 50 0 29 respectively moreover when a 50 or 5 k error was in instantaneous eto ta vp and ws they can cause the mean variations of 66 16 30 05 0 12 0 02 2 41 0 57 and 7 64 4 53 in the almond daily et and 14 98 6 53 0 13 0 04 0 58 0 24 and 4 13 2 78 in the pistachio daily et 3 2 sensitivity analysis to land surface parameters comparing with meteorological variables except for instantaneous eto land surface parameters derived from landsat images had more impact on metric based daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees results showed that daily et estimates were most sensitive to rn followed by lst and dt while α zom and g had less impact on daily ets among the land surface parameters fig 4 the mean percentage changes in metric based daily et were 8 44 1 24 2 97 0 14 2 31 1 20 1 85 0 22 1 34 1 35 and 0 98 0 33 with an error of 5 or 0 5 k in rn lst dt α zom and g throughout the entire growing season on average an error of 5 in rn can result in relatively large increases in daily et i e a mean increase percentage of 9 31 1 56 0 43 0 07 mm day in the almond site and a mean variation of 7 56 0 93 0 45 0 06 mm day in the pistachio sites furthermore when the error in rn reached 50 the mean increase percentages in daily et were 93 11 18 91 and 75 59 9 80 corresponding to the increased daily et values of 4 28 0 83 mm day and 4 52 0 69 mm day fig 5 table 2 conversely a 0 5 k error in lst caused the decreased variations of 2 87 0 64 0 13 0 02 mm day and 3 07 0 89 0 18 0 05 mm day in daily et when there was a 5 k error in lst the mean variations were 28 69 6 96 and 30 66 9 04 leading to the decreases in daily et of 1 30 0 22 mm day and 1 79 0 45 mm day in the almond and pistachio sites fig 6 table 2 still a 5 error in dt also generated the decreased variations in daily et i e a mean decrease percentage of 3 15 1 37 0 14 0 05 mm day and 1 46 0 56 0 08 0 03 mm day respectively fig 7 table 2 in addition we also found that h estimates were directly proportional to dt and had the same sensitivity with dt on daily et in this study because aerodynamic resistance had no impact on daily et of both almond and pistachio trees fig s4 the metric based daily et estimates were relatively less sensitive to α zom and g than those of the aforementioned land surface parameters fig 4 results showed that the α zom and g can result in a slightly decrease in daily et when there was an error of 5 in them for example an error of 5 in α caused the mean decreases of 2 00 0 36 0 09 0 02 mm day and 1 69 0 34 0 10 0 02 mm day in the almond and pistachio sites fig s5 table 2 a 5 error in zom generated a 2 29 1 46 variation in daily et of almond trees and caused a relatively low variation of 0 38 0 12 in the pistachio sites fig s6 table 2 the daily et estimates were most insensitive to g among all the land surface parameters i e a mean variation in daily et over almond trees of 0 96 0 16 0 04 mm day and over pistachio trees of 0 98 0 36 0 06 0 01 mm day with a 5 error in g fig s7 table 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis to different study sizes results showed that the positions of selected pixels changed among the three study sizes however most of cold pixels were identified in the densely vegetated areas and hot pixels were selected on the dry and bare surface for each study size fig s8 the number of selected cold and hot pixels slightly increased as the size of study area expanded but the percentage of selected pixels in each study size decreased i e all selected pixels accounting for 0 50 in the image of size 1 and 0 28 in the image of size 3 in the almond study area the larger differences in lst of selected cold and hot pixels appeared in the pistachio study area between the three study sizes since it was a large area with the relatively complex land cover types however the almond study area was small and the land surface was relatively homogeneous with a few types of land cover which caused a relatively small change on the range of lst values the largest difference was the hot pixel lst on september 17 with a shift of 2 64 k between size 1 and size 3 of the pistachio sites whereas the differences of lst for cold pixels were minor i e a mean value of 0 61 k in the pistachio study area and 0 40 k in the almond study area between size 1 and size 3 table 3 in addition with the changes of study size the coefficients a and b also varied significantly for example the large differences in a and b were found on july 15 in the almond site and on may 12 in the pistachio sites between size 1 and size 3 the mean differences of a were 0 04 and 0 06 and the discrepancies of b were 11 68 k and 19 65 k the daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees in size 1 were slightly lower than those in size 2 and size 3 in this study fig 8 this was mainly related to h estimates decreasing in size 2 and size 3 because of changes of selected cold and hot pixels the largest contrast in the daily et estimates over the almond orchard was found on may 12 between size 1 and size 2 with a difference of 0 42 mm day and a percentage difference of 9 80 which corresponded to the largest difference in h estimates up to 27 43 w m2 the largest difference in pistachio orchard daily ets was observed on july 15 between size 1 and size 3 in the high s orchard with a difference of 0 47 mm day and a corresponding difference in h estimates of 26 18 w m2 however the smallest difference occurred in the control pistachio orchard between size 1 and size 2 with a mean difference in the daily ets of 0 07 0 08 mm day and the minor change in h estimates of 3 48 4 90 w m2 overall the relatively large difference in the daily et estimates over the almond orchard appeared between size 1 and size 2 throughout the entire growing season a mean difference was 0 33 0 08 mm day between size 1 and size 2 with a mean difference in h estimates of 22 78 4 30 w m2 and a mean difference between size 1 and size 3 was 0 24 0 06 mm day corresponding to a mean difference in h estimates of 16 76 4 27 w m2 however the difference in both daily et and h estimates between size 1 and size 2 was minor over three pistachio orchards and the large difference in the daily et estimates was found between size 1 and size 3 with a mean difference of 0 30 0 14 mm day and the corresponding mean difference in h estimates of 18 13 8 91 w m2 4 discussion 4 1 meteorological variables it is worth noting that instantaneous eto was a key variable in the metric model since it was used to internally calibrate to compute h and reference et fraction etof which is similar to the crop coefficient when errors varying from 50 to 50 were added to instantaneous eto h estimates decreased but etof increased thereby resulting in an increase in daily et of both almond and pistachio trees in the fig 3 the shape of the curves for almond trees was different from that for pistachio trees it showed that instantaneous eto had more impact on daily et estimates of almond trees than those of pistachio trees throughout the entire growing season on one hand compared to cimis station 15 in the pistachio study area cimis station 146 is closer to almond site thus eto as a ground reference could have a greater impact on daily et of almond trees on the other hand almond trees were tall and had a good growing condition which there was a careful management to ensure the sufficient water in roots no salt stress and homogeneous canopy structure similarly instantaneous eto had a larger influence on daily et of pistachio trees in the control orchard which had a relatively good growing condition among the three pistachio orchards in addition we found that the almond curves for july 15 and september 17 exhibited a discontinuity around 30 this could be related to the iterative process of h estimation under the same condition of the convergence it took 3 iterations to reach convergence when around 30 error was in instantaneous eto while others needed to take 7 10 iterations few iterations caused a fast fake convergence which resulted in a underestimation in h and overestimation in etof and daily et i e a low h value of 328 65 w m2 and a high etof value of 0 60 and a high et value of 2 73 mm day in the error of 30 comparing to 369 00 w m2 0 49 and 2 20 mm day in the error of 35 on september 17 therefore it should be also noted that errors in daily et may generate due to the fake convergence during the iteration in h estimation when there was a certain error in the reference eto by using the metric model wind speed ws was associated with the aerodynamic resistance and h estimates which had an indirectly impact on daily et estimates in the metric model when the error in ws varied from 50 to 50 it caused aerodynamic resistance decreasing but increased h estimates thereby reducing daily et estimates fig s3 it was noticing that relatively large variations in daily et were observed both in the almond and pistachio orchards when an error of 50 was introduced than that of an error of 50 in ws although the metric based daily et was not very sensitive to ws when ws had a 50 error there were 35 11 w m2 and 20 63 w m2 variations in h estimates as a result variations in daily et were 0 47 mm day and 0 30 mm day in the almond and pistachio orchards respectively however a 50 error in ws could only increase h estimates of 14 84 w m2 and 10 83 w m2 which caused the low changes of daily et values of 0 20 mm day in the almond site and 0 16 mm day in the pistachio site therefore we should pay more attention to the underestimation than the overestimation in ws 4 2 land surface parameters the rn represents the gain of surface energy from solar radiation and atmospheric longwave radiation which warms the earth s surface and provides the energy to drive weather and climate bisht et al 2005 bisht and bras 2010 2011 it had a significantly positive impact on daily et since the available energy for latent heat flux increased with the total energy increasing from 50 to 50 in fact rn had a close correlation with daily et and the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 96 n 676 in the almond orchard and 0 77 n 25200 in the pistachio orchards during the april september growing season so it is necessary to ensure that rn should be estimated accurately when using the metric model errors in lst were introduced after endmember selections to ensure that the selected endmembers had no influence on daily et estimates in the metric model thus errors in lst mainly had direct impact on outgoing longwave radiation and h estimates the daily et estimates decreased as errors were added to lst from 5 to 5 k fig 6 this was related to the increase in outgoing longwave radiation causing the decrease in rn and h estimates relating to the increasing dt momentum roughness length zom is a measure of roughness for the layer of air that interacts with the surface allen et al 2007a in the metric model zom is initially calculated as a function of lai for the agricultural row crops zom 0 018lai we estimated zom using a function of tree height for the almond and pistachio trees although errors in zom could cause variations in daily et estimates via the uncertainties in the estimations of friction velocity aerodynamic resistance and h the daily et estimates were relatively insensitive to zom especially for the ets of pistachio trees i e a 5 error resulting in a mean et variation of 0 02 0 01 mm day in this study however it is still noting that zom could be adjusted using the ground measurements of crop height and leaf area index for some tree crops such as olive orchards due to crop stress physiological and micrometeorological variations santos et al 2012 pôças et al 2014 further study is needed for its sensitivity on daily et of different tree crops in the future overall it should be noting that the metric based daily et was relatively sensitive to land surface parameters compared to weather variables except for reference eto the best way to minimize the uncertainties of metric based daily et of tree crops is to verify and calibrate each parameter based on the ground measurement the field measurements for all parameters are time consuming and laborious therefore when the metric model was applied to daily et of tree crops some sensitive variables could be selected for measurement and calibration for their needs in combination with our work in this study 4 3 different study size few studies focused on the influence of study size on daily et estimates long et al 2011 performed a sensitivity analysis to sebal based h estimates at the region scale and found that lst values of hot pixel increased and of cold pixel decreased with increasing domain size due to the increasing range of lst values then influencing h and le estimates actually for cold and hot pixel selection based et models the change in study size would impact the endmember selection whether it is the automated pixel selection method or the manual image interpretation method in the metric model the two extreme endmembers must be selected to establish a linear relationship between lst and dt within a study area however the relationship between lst and dt constructed on one study area cannot directly transfer to another study area any study area has its specific conditions and characteristics which may affect the selection of endmembers in this study we only analyzed the effect of the automated pixel selection method for metric model on daily et the impact of the manual image interpretation method on metric based daily et needs to be further studied since the accuracy and influence of this method mainly relies on the operators the metric based daily et estimates in size 1 were used as the reference values since the accuracies have been verified by he et al 2017 and jin et al 2018 the change of study size could impact on the selection of cold and hot pixels which changed the linear relationship between lst and dt coefficients a and b and played an important role in estimating h and daily et in metric model in general with the study size expanding lst values of selected cold and hot pixels could increase since the range of lst values could become large the increase in lst values of cold and hot pixels could reduce dt and h estimates thus leading to an increase in the estimation of daily et due to the principle of surface energy balance therefore a suitable study size needs to be considered to establish a reliable linear relationship between lst and dt which is conducive to accurately estimate h and daily et in the metric model also we must ensure that the cold and hot pixels meet the selected criteria and they are located on the right land surface i e cold pixels on well irrigated agricultural area and hot pixels on dry and bare soil area 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the sensitivity of metric based daily et estimates of almond and pistachio trees to weather variables and land surface parameters with the introduced errors up to 50 5 or 5 k 0 5 k we also analyzed the influence of different study sizes on daily et estimates throughout the entire growing season for the sensitivity to meteorological variables our results showed that instantaneous eto played an important role in determining metric based daily et estimates it had the biggest impact on daily et estimates compared to other variables i e a mean variation of 6 80 4 41 in the almond site and 1 50 0 94 in the pistachio site with a 5 error in instantaneous eto daily et estimates were not that sensitive to air temperature near surface vapor pressure and wind speed and the mean variations in daily ets varied from 0 01 to 0 76 with an introduced error of 0 5 k or 5 in those variables with regard to land surface parameters rn played the most important and positive role in metric based daily et estimation i e the mean increases of 9 31 1 56 and 7 56 0 93 in daily et of almond and pistachio trees with a 5 error in rn followed by lst

9400,evapotranspiration et a key component of crop water balance is essential for growers to manage agricultural irrigation metric model is increasingly used to estimate and map et with satellite observations especially at daily and field scales however the analysis of its uncertainties on tree crop et estimation is very limited we used metric model to estimate daily et over the almond and pistachio orchards throughout the entire growing season in the san joaquin valley california and evaluated the impacts of variations in meteorological variables land surface parameters and different study sizes on et estimation the results showed that the metric based daily et estimates of the almond and pistachio trees were most sensitive to net radiation rn followed by instantaneous reference et eto land surface temperature lst and near surface temperature difference dt when a 5 error was added to rn the uncertainty in daily et estimates was up to 8 44 1 24 corresponding to a mean increase of 0 45 0 02 mm day throughout the entire growing season a 5 or 0 5 k error in instantaneous eto lst and dt also caused changes in daily et estimates by 4 15 3 75 2 97 0 14 and 2 31 1 20 respectively et estimates with metric were relatively much less sensitive to other variables the results from different study sizes indicated that daily et estimates in size 2 were 0 33 0 08 mm day overestimation compared with those from size 1 in the almond site similarly a mean overestimation of 0 30 0 14 mm day was found between size 1 and size 3 in the pistachio sites throughout the entire growing season this study demonstrates the potential to further improve the accuracy of remote sensing based et estimation for complex tree crops with metric model by optimizing key parameters and choosing a proper domain size for study area keywords sensitivity analysis evapotranspiration metric tree crop remote sensing south san joaquin valley 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important component of the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance that links water energy and carbon cycles campbell and norman 1998 jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 it is closely related to crop water use in the context of agricultural irrigation management rana et al 2005 williams and ayars 2005 french et al 2015 he et al 2017 xue et al 2020 accurate estimation of crop et can improve crop water use efficiency and rationally allocate water resources qiu et al 2019 han et al 2021 wang et al 2021 especially for water scarce regions compared with ground based methods to measure et such as eddy covariance twine et al 2000 gu et al 2012 lysimeters allen et al 1991 and surface renewal techniques mcelrone et al 2013 shapland et al 2014 remote sensing based et models have a great advantage of estimating and mapping et in the temporal and spatial patterns it would be providing a scientific guidance for improving water resource management mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric was proposed by allen et al 2007a based on the theoretical and computational basis of surface energy balance algorithms for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 for estimating et by incorporating satellite observations and a few of high quality weather data metric model has its significant advantage over sebal in that using the weather station based reference et etr to serve as a real ground reference on the satellite image based actual et allen et al 2007a the etr was used to build surface energy balance conditions at the cold and hot pixels for a linear relationship between land surface temperature lst and near surface temperature difference dt in sensible heat flux h estimation also metric model applies fraction of reference et etrf as a real time crop coefficient for extrapolating from instantaneous et satellite overpassing time to daily et satellite overpassing date allen et al 2007a 2011 contrasting with other remote sensing et models such as the lst based atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model at continental scales anderson et al 2007 and simplified surface energy balance sseb model with modis images senay et al 2007 metric model was initially designed for regions smaller than a few hundred kilometers in scale and produced high accurate et maps at high spatial resolution allen et al 2007a for the relatively complex terrain and weather conditions it was suggested to divide the satellite image into several parts and to calculate et separately since the weather of study area need to be relatively uniform for cold and hot pixels selection in the metric model assumes allen et al 2014 the metric model is a feasible tool for estimating and mapping et in temporal spatial variability it has been widely used for water consumption from natural vegetation to agricultural crops determination of crop coefficients irrigation schedules and water rights accounting in idaho california and new mexico allen et al 2007b case studies concluded that errors for seasonal et estimates were less than 4 in the growing seasons and errors for daily et estimates were about 13 20 for irrigated meadow and sugar beet crop allen et al 2007b french et al 2015 found metric model was used to provide good estimates of daily et over a cotton study site and they suggested metric model was preferred when sufficient ancillary data were not available he et al 2017 showed that monthly et estimates had a 9 68 relative mean difference between metric based versus observed et over an almond orchard ortega salazar et al 2021 found that the estimated errors within the metric model for daily et estimates were only between 4 and 6 of the measurements and the root mean square error rmse was 0 42 mm day for a drip irrigated olive orchard sensitivity analysis is very useful to identify the sensitive variables in a model and the suitable study size for improving model accuracy zhang et al 2017 long et al 2011 valipour et al 2020 analyzed the effect of meteorological variables on the reference et eto they found that wind speed was the most important variable driving the trends of eto in most regions anwar et al 2021 examined the sensitivity of the simulated summer potential et pet of tropical africa to lai and vegetation runoff systems using the regcm4 model other studies focused on the sensitivity of actual et estimates

factors of penman method at a region scale yang et al 2019 biazar et al 2019 allen et al 2013 performed a sensitivity analysis on metric model in mountainous areas they showed that increasing aerodynamic roughness increased convective heat transfer and decreased et estimation french et al 2015 revealed that the sensitivity of metric model was related to the season the relatively great sensitivity showed in the early growth of cotton at a fine spatial resolution however tree crops have complex canopy structure and physiology which cause the energy exchange processes more complicated jin et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis of tree crop et has received less attention compared to agricultural row crops we are aware of no studies focusing on the quantifying errors of metric based daily et estimates over orchards during the entire growth period also it is not clear how different study sizes impact on daily et estimates in the metric model in this study we performed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of tree crop daily et estimates by using metric model on two types of commercial orchards throughout the growth period the objective was to quantify the sensitivity of daily et estimates to errors in various meteorological variables and land surface parameters in addition appropriate study size could improve the estimated accuracy and it is crucial for correctly selecting cold and hot pixels in the metric model therefore we also investigated the impact of different study sizes on daily et estimates of an almond and three pistachio orchards in the san joaquin valley california usa 2 data and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on two types of commercial mature orchards located in south san joaquin valley california us fig 1 including one almond orchard he et al 2017 and three pistachio orchards jin et al 2018 the study site has a typical meditterranean climate of a hot and dry summer and a mild and wet winter the almond trees were planted in 1999 with a well watered management of drip and fanjet during the period 2009 2012 the canopy structure was homogeneous with the summer ndvi of 0 72 0 02 and the trees were about 7 0 m tall the control pistachio orchard was planted in 1990 with a relatively homogeneous canopy structure and a mean summer ndvi was 0 72 0 06 and tree height was 4 29 0 09 m the med s pistachio orchard was adjacent to high s orchard and they were planted in late1980s with a long term impact of soil salinity the med s orchard had a low to moderate salinity with ece varying from 1 3ds m to 7 0ds m and the summer ndvi was 0 67 0 05 and tree height was 3 73 0 18 m the high s orchard had a relatively heterogeneous canopy and low tree height with a mean summer ndvi of 0 52 0 06 and height of 2 88 0 41 m since the trees were suffered severe salt stress and a mean ece was 5 8ds m 2 4 11 2ds m during the period 2015 2016 2 2 datasets we used landsat 5 tm satellite observations path 42 row 035 for sensitivity analysis of daily et estimates in the almond site on may 12 july 15 and september 17 in 2010 and used landsat 8 oli tirs images path 42 row 035 in the pistachio sites on may 12 july 15 and september 17 in 2016 the metric based daily et estimates agreed well with the ground measurements on the selected dates i e a mean absolute bias mab of 0 47 mm day over the almond trees and a mab of 0 78 mm day over the pistachio trees he et al 2017 jin et al 2018 the observations from may 12 july 15 to september 17 represented the growth state of trees in the early middle and late stages for this study meteorological inputs in the metric model of air temperature ta near surface vapor pressure vp wind speed ws hourly and daily reference et of grass eto were obtained from the cimis stations 146

roughness length zom aerodynamic resistance rah and monin obukhov length l are also used in h estimation zom was estimated using the equation of zom 0 12 h paw u and meyers 1989 where h was the average tree height measured in each orchard during the growing season in addition metric uses two extreme endmembers of cold and hot pixels to calibrate the sensible heat flux in an iterative process to make the selection consistent for the long time series daily et estimation we followed an automatic endmember selection method which was developed by he et al 2017 the method was based on the statistics and cumulative histogram of ndvi and lst maps which combined a threshold and values at the fixed percentage such as the values of ndvi at the point of 95 5 and the values of lst at the point of 5 95 in the accumulated percentage curves to identify the cold hot pixels 2 4 sensitivity analysis method the sensitivity analysis was implemented by individually changing each parameter under a given set of values within 50 varying with a step size of 5 except for ta and lst the upper limit of the given ta and lst change was 5 k and the lower limit was 5 k with a 0 5 k interval this method was referenced to sánchez et al 2008 and long et al 2011 the sensitivity of metric based daily et estimates over almond and pistachio trees was tested throughout the entire growing season in this study the initial values for running metric model the reference values were set in accordance with the data used in the two papers of he et al 2017 and jin et al 2018 for sensitivity analysis to meteorological variables and land surface parameters study size of 801 801 pixels was chosen for the almond orchard and of 1101 2001 pixels was for three pistachio orchards size 1 with the nearest weather station in the images the station 146 belridge of california irrigation management information system cimis is about 2 0 km from the almond orchard and the station 15 stratford is about 11 5 km from the med s and high s pistachio orchards fig 1 for sensitivity analysis to domain size of study area we extent the width of 500 pixels and 1000 pixels outward based on the original study size that is the original study size was 801 801 pixels size 1 the second study size was 1801 1801 pixels size 2 and the third study size was 2801 2801 pixels size 3 for the almond site and study size 1 of 1101 2001 pixels size 2 of 2102 3001 pixels and size 3 of 3101 4001 pixels were used for three pistachio sites 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis to meteorological variables the metric based daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees were more sensitive to instantaneous eto compared to ta vp and ws throughout the entire growing season fig 2 results indicated that an error of 5 in instantaneous eto can result in a mean increase of 6 80 4 41 0 31 0 21 mm day in the daily et of almond trees corresponding to the changes of 36 39 10 84 w m2 in h estimates and 0 05 0 03 in etof the change of daily et in the pistachio sites was smaller than that in the almond site but a 1 50 0 94 0 09 0 07 mm day increase was still found with a 5 error in instantaneous eto corresponding to a 27 66 7 99 w m2 decrease in h estimates also we found that daily et of pistachio trees was more sensitive to instantaneous eto in the control site than that in the high s site for example when there was an error of 5 in instantaneous eto the mean variations in daily et were 1 71 1 05 0 12 0 08 mm day and 1 13 0 73 0 05 0 05 mm day in the control and high s sites respectively fig 3 table 1 the metric based daily et of both almond and pistachio trees was insensitive to ta fig 2 the daily ets were almost the same with the reference values where the error in ta was 0 fig s1 when an error of 0 5 k was in ta a mean variation of daily et was 0 013 0 004 while the ta had a large error of 5 k the change of daily ets was still minor resulting in the mean variation of 0 12 0 02 and 0 13 0 04 in daily et of almond and pistachio trees throughout the entire growing season table 1 likewise a 5 error in vp caused 0 24 0 06 and 0 06 0 02 increases in daily et of almond and pistachio trees which resulted in a corresponding change value of 0 01 mm day in daily et fig s2 table 1 when a 50 error was added to vp there was also a small increase of 2 41 0 57 0 11 0 02 mm day and 0 58 0 24 0 03 0 02 mm day respectively a 5 error in ws resulted in 0 76 0 51 and 0 41 0 29 variations in daily et corresponding to the decrease values of 0 03 mm day and 0 02 mm day fig s3 table 1 when there was a 50 error in ws the decreases of daily et values were 0 20 mm day in the almond site and 0 16 mm day in the pistachio site overall when there was an error of 5 or 0 5 k in instantaneous eto ta vp and ws the mean variations in metric based daily et throughout the entire growing season were 4 15 3 75 0 01 0 15 0 13 and 0 50 0 29 respectively moreover when a 50 or 5 k error was in instantaneous eto ta vp and ws they can cause the mean variations of 66 16 30 05 0 12 0 02 2 41 0 57 and 7 64 4 53 in the almond daily et and 14 98 6 53 0 13 0 04 0 58 0 24 and 4 13 2 78 in the pistachio daily et 3 2 sensitivity analysis to land surface parameters comparing with meteorological variables except for instantaneous eto land surface parameters derived from landsat images had more impact on metric based daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees results showed that daily et estimates were most sensitive to rn followed by lst and dt while α zom and g had less impact on daily ets among the land surface parameters fig 4 the mean percentage changes in metric based daily et were 8 44 1 24 2 97 0 14 2 31 1 20 1 85 0 22 1 34 1 35 and 0 98 0 33 with an error of 5 or 0 5 k in rn lst dt α zom and g throughout the entire growing season on average an error of 5 in rn can result in relatively large increases in daily et i e a mean increase percentage of 9 31 1 56 0 43 0 07 mm day in the almond site and a mean variation of 7 56 0 93 0 45 0 06 mm day in the pistachio sites furthermore when the error in rn reached 50 the mean increase percentages in daily et were 93 11 18 91 and 75 59 9 80 corresponding to the increased daily et values of 4 28 0 83 mm day and 4 52 0 69 mm day fig 5 table 2 conversely a 0 5 k error in lst caused the decreased variations of 2 87 0 64 0 13 0 02 mm day and 3 07 0 89 0 18 0 05 mm day in daily et when there was a 5 k error in lst the mean variations were 28 69 6 96 and 30 66 9 04 leading to the decreases in daily et of 1 30 0 22 mm day and 1 79 0 45 mm day in the almond and pistachio sites fig 6 table 2 still a 5 error in dt also generated the decreased variations in daily et i e a mean decrease percentage of 3 15 1 37 0 14 0 05 mm day and 1 46 0 56 0 08 0 03 mm day respectively fig 7 table 2 in addition we also found that h estimates were directly proportional to dt and had the same sensitivity with dt on daily et in this study because aerodynamic resistance had no impact on daily et of both almond and pistachio trees fig s4 the metric based daily et estimates were relatively less sensitive to α zom and g than those of the aforementioned land surface parameters fig 4 results showed that the α zom and g can result in a slightly decrease in daily et when there was an error of 5 in them for example an error of 5 in α caused the mean decreases of 2 00 0 36 0 09 0 02 mm day and 1 69 0 34 0 10 0 02 mm day in the almond and pistachio sites fig s5 table 2 a 5 error in zom generated a 2 29 1 46 variation in daily et of almond trees and caused a relatively low variation of 0 38 0 12 in the pistachio sites fig s6 table 2 the daily et estimates were most insensitive to g among all the land surface parameters i e a mean variation in daily et over almond trees of 0 96 0 16 0 04 mm day and over pistachio trees of 0 98 0 36 0 06 0 01 mm day with a 5 error in g fig s7 table 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis to different study sizes results showed that the positions of selected pixels changed among the three study sizes however most of cold pixels were identified in the densely vegetated areas and hot pixels were selected on the dry and bare surface for each study size fig s8 the number of selected cold and hot pixels slightly increased as the size of study area expanded but the percentage of selected pixels in each study size decreased i e all selected pixels accounting for 0 50 in the image of size 1 and 0 28 in the image of size 3 in the almond study area the larger differences in lst of selected cold and hot pixels appeared in the pistachio study area between the three study sizes since it was a large area with the relatively complex land cover types however the almond study area was small and the land surface was relatively homogeneous with a few types of land cover which caused a relatively small change on the range of lst values the largest difference was the hot pixel lst on september 17 with a shift of 2 64 k between size 1 and size 3 of the pistachio sites whereas the differences of lst for cold pixels were minor i e a mean value of 0 61 k in the pistachio study area and 0 40 k in the almond study area between size 1 and size 3 table 3 in addition with the changes of study size the coefficients a and b also varied significantly for example the large differences in a and b were found on july 15 in the almond site and on may 12 in the pistachio sites between size 1 and size 3 the mean differences of a were 0 04 and 0 06 and the discrepancies of b were 11 68 k and 19 65 k the daily et estimates of both almond and pistachio trees in size 1 were slightly lower than those in size 2 and size 3 in this study fig 8 this was mainly related to h estimates decreasing in size 2 and size 3 because of changes of selected cold and hot pixels the largest contrast in the daily et estimates over the almond orchard was found on may 12 between size 1 and size 2 with a difference of 0 42 mm day and a percentage difference of 9 80 which corresponded to the largest difference in h estimates up to 27 43 w m2 the largest difference in pistachio orchard daily ets was observed on july 15 between size 1 and size 3 in the high s orchard with a difference of 0 47 mm day and a corresponding difference in h estimates of 26 18 w m2 however the smallest difference occurred in the control pistachio orchard between size 1 and size 2 with a mean difference in the daily ets of 0 07 0 08 mm day and the minor change in h estimates of 3 48 4 90 w m2 overall the relatively large difference in the daily et estimates over the almond orchard appeared between size 1 and size 2 throughout the entire growing season a mean difference was 0 33 0 08 mm day between size 1 and size 2 with a mean difference in h estimates of 22 78 4 30 w m2 and a mean difference between size 1 and size 3 was 0 24 0 06 mm day corresponding to a mean difference in h estimates of 16 76 4 27 w m2 however the difference in both daily et and h estimates between size 1 and size 2 was minor over three pistachio orchards and the large difference in the daily et estimates was found between size 1 and size 3 with a mean difference of 0 30 0 14 mm day and the corresponding mean difference in h estimates of 18 13 8 91 w m2 4 discussion 4 1 meteorological variables it is worth noting that instantaneous eto was a key variable in the metric model since it was used to internally calibrate to compute h and reference et fraction etof which is similar to the crop coefficient when errors varying from 50 to 50 were added to instantaneous eto h estimates decreased but etof increased thereby resulting in an increase in daily et of both almond and pistachio trees in the fig 3 the shape of the curves for almond trees was different from that for pistachio trees it showed that instantaneous eto had more impact on daily et estimates of almond trees than those of pistachio trees throughout the entire growing season on one hand compared to cimis station 15 in the pistachio study area cimis station 146 is closer to almond site thus eto as a ground reference could have a greater impact on daily et of almond trees on the other hand almond trees were tall and had a good growing condition which there was a careful management to ensure the sufficient water in roots no salt stress and homogeneous canopy structure similarly instantaneous eto had a larger influence on daily et of pistachio trees in the control orchard which had a relatively good growing condition among the three pistachio orchards in addition we found that the almond curves for july 15 and september 17 exhibited a discontinuity around 30 this could be related to the iterative process of h estimation under the same condition of the convergence it took 3 iterations to reach convergence when around 30 error was in instantaneous eto while others needed to take 7 10 iterations few iterations caused a fast fake convergence which resulted in a underestimation in h and overestimation in etof and daily et i e a low h value of 328 65 w m2 and a high etof value of 0 60 and a high et value of 2 73 mm day in the error of 30 comparing to 369 00 w m2 0 49 and 2 20 mm day in the error of 35 on september 17 therefore it should be also noted that errors in daily et may generate due to the fake convergence during the iteration in h estimation when there was a certain error in the reference eto by using the metric model wind speed ws was associated with the aerodynamic resistance and h estimates which had an indirectly impact on daily et estimates in the metric model when the error in ws varied from 50 to 50 it caused aerodynamic resistance decreasing but increased h estimates thereby reducing daily et estimates fig s3 it was noticing that relatively large variations in daily et were observed both in the almond and pistachio orchards when an error of 50 was introduced than that of an error of 50 in ws although the metric based daily et was not very sensitive to ws when ws had a 50 error there were 35 11 w m2 and 20 63 w m2 variations in h estimates as a result variations in daily et were 0 47 mm day and 0 30 mm day in the almond and pistachio orchards respectively however a 50 error in ws could only increase h estimates of 14 84 w m2 and 10 83 w m2 which caused the low changes of daily et values of 0 20 mm day in the almond site and 0 16 mm day in the pistachio site therefore we should pay more attention to the underestimation than the overestimation in ws 4 2 land surface parameters the rn represents the gain of surface energy from solar radiation and atmospheric longwave radiation which warms the earth s surface and provides the energy to drive weather and climate bisht et al 2005 bisht and bras 2010 2011 it had a significantly positive impact on daily et since the available energy for latent heat flux increased with the total energy increasing from 50 to 50 in fact rn had a close correlation with daily et and the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 96 n 676 in the almond orchard and 0 77 n 25200 in the pistachio orchards during the april september growing season so it is necessary to ensure that rn should be estimated accurately when using the metric model errors in lst were introduced after endmember selections to ensure that the selected endmembers had no influence on daily et estimates in the metric model thus errors in lst mainly had direct impact on outgoing longwave radiation and h estimates the daily et estimates decreased as errors were added to lst from 5 to 5 k fig 6 this was related to the increase in outgoing longwave radiation causing the decrease in rn and h estimates relating to the increasing dt momentum roughness length zom is a measure of roughness for the layer of air that interacts with the surface allen et al 2007a in the metric model zom is initially calculated as a function of lai for the agricultural row crops zom 0 018lai we estimated zom using a function of tree height for the almond and pistachio trees although errors in zom could cause variations in daily et estimates via the uncertainties in the estimations of friction velocity aerodynamic resistance and h the daily et estimates were relatively insensitive to zom especially for the ets of pistachio trees i e a 5 error resulting in a mean et variation of 0 02 0 01 mm day in this study however it is still noting that zom could be adjusted using the ground measurements of crop height and leaf area index for some tree crops such as olive orchards due to crop stress physiological and micrometeorological variations santos et al 2012 pôças et al 2014 further study is needed for its sensitivity on daily et of different tree crops in the future overall it should be noting that the metric based daily et was relatively sensitive to land surface parameters compared to weather variables except for reference eto the best way to minimize the uncertainties of metric based daily et of tree crops is to verify and calibrate each parameter based on the ground measurement the field measurements for all parameters are time consuming and laborious therefore when the metric model was applied to daily et of tree crops some sensitive variables could be selected for measurement and calibration for their needs in combination with our work in this study 4 3 different study size few studies focused on the influence of study size on daily et estimates long et al 2011 performed a sensitivity analysis to sebal based h estimates at the region scale and found that lst values of hot pixel increased and of cold pixel decreased with increasing domain size due to the increasing range of lst values then influencing h and le estimates actually for cold and hot pixel selection based et models the change in study size would impact the endmember selection whether it is the automated pixel selection method or the manual image interpretation method in the metric model the two extreme endmembers must be selected to establish a linear relationship between lst and dt within a study area however the relationship between lst and dt constructed on one study area cannot directly transfer to another study area any study area has its specific conditions and characteristics which may affect the selection of endmembers in this study we only analyzed the effect of the automated pixel selection method for metric model on daily et the impact of the manual image interpretation method on metric based daily et needs to be further studied since the accuracy and influence of this method mainly relies on the operators the metric based daily et estimates in size 1 were used as the reference values since the accuracies have been verified by he et al 2017 and jin et al 2018 the change of study size could impact on the selection of cold and hot pixels which changed the linear relationship between lst and dt coefficients a and b and played an important role in estimating h and daily et in metric model in general with the study size expanding lst values of selected cold and hot pixels could increase since the range of lst values could become large the increase in lst values of cold and hot pixels could reduce dt and h estimates thus leading to an increase in the estimation of daily et due to the principle of surface energy balance therefore a suitable study size needs to be considered to establish a reliable linear relationship between lst and dt which is conducive to accurately estimate h and daily et in the metric model also we must ensure that the cold and hot pixels meet the selected criteria and they are located on the right land surface i e cold pixels on well irrigated agricultural area and hot pixels on dry and bare soil area 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the sensitivity of metric based daily et estimates of almond and pistachio trees to weather variables and land surface parameters with the introduced errors up to 50 5 or 5 k 0 5 k we also analyzed the influence of different study sizes on daily et estimates throughout the entire growing season for the sensitivity to meteorological variables our results showed that instantaneous eto played an important role in determining metric based daily et estimates it had the biggest impact on daily et estimates compared to other variables i e a mean variation of 6 80 4 41 in the almond site and 1 50 0 94 in the pistachio site with a 5 error in instantaneous eto daily et estimates were not that sensitive to air temperature near surface vapor pressure and wind speed and the mean variations in daily ets varied from 0 01 to 0 76 with an introduced error of 0 5 k or 5 in those variables with regard to land surface parameters rn played the most important and positive role in metric based daily et estimation i e the mean increases of 9 31 1 56 and 7 56 0 93 in daily et of almond and pistachio trees with a 5 error in rn followed by lst and dt which were negative to daily et the α zom and g showed less impact on daily et with the mean variations of 0 38 2 29 in the two types of orchards for the influence of different study sizes on metric based daily et the change of study size had a greater influence on lst of selected hot pixel than that of selected cold pixel the largest difference on lst of selected hot pixel was 2 64 k between size 1 and size 3 in the pistachio sites large study sizes of size 2 and size 3 lead to a slightly overestimation in metric based daily et when compared with size 1 i e a large mean difference of 0 33 0 08 mm day between size 1 and size 2 in the almond site and of 0 30 0 14 mm day between size 1 and size 3 in the pistachio sites declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9401,cropping patterns are essential for the sustainable development of regional agriculture and land conservation to solve the complex system problems of the multidimensional coordination of water resources society economy environment and ecology and dynamics in the decision making of cropping pattern adjustment this paper proposes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for cropping patterns based on system dynamics the system association and dynamic evolution trends of the driving elements are simulated and coupled to the multidimensional multitarget planning model which can realize the multidimensional optimization and dynamic prediction of cropping patterns in different regions the proposed method is applied to empirical research in heilongjiang province the results showed that optimization of the cropping pattern contributed to an increase in the cooperative development of the system in 2016 2025 and 2030 by 24 14 42 36 and 51 36 respectively evolving from a state of barely cooperative to a state of high quality cooperative this indicates that the model helps to promote the sustainable use of cultivated land the optimization improved the crop diversity with a variety of food crops planted in most regions the optimization results of the spatial network consisting of 182 irrigation areas show that the resource utilization efficiency economic benefits environmental pollution situation and resource allocation fairness improved by approximately 20 in different partitions the model can reflect the dynamics balance conflicts of the multidimensional targets of cropping patterns and promote the sustainable use of cultivated land it can be used as a general model and is applicable to most areas where other cultivation occupies an important place graphical abstract ga1 keywords cropping pattern multidimensional coordination system dynamics model optimization model sustainability 1 introduction the cropping pattern is a basic condition for the development of the cropping industry and is very important to the sustainable development of regional agriculture adjusting and optimizing the pattern of agricultural cultivation is currently an important task in the agricultural development of china and it is necessary for decision makers to adjust and optimize the cropping pattern according to market demand he et al 2021 the optimization of cropping patterns involves multiple dimensions such as water resources society economy ecology and environment which is a complex project and requires multidimensional optimization ji et al 2021 ren et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 each dimension has a direct relationship with the cropping pattern for example by adjusting cropping patterns water use efficiency economic efficiency and the ecological environment can be improved garduño et al 2010 song et al 2014 he et al 2021 in addition there is a contradictory relationship between the various dimensions involved in the optimization of cropping patterns such as the contradiction between economic development and a beautiful ecological environment the shortage of water resources and the contradiction between social and economic development brenner and hartl 2021 to promote the sustainable development of agriculture it is necessary to consider the multidimensional coordination of water resources society the economy ecology and the environment in the process of cropping pattern optimization most studies on the optimization of existing cropping patterns focus on the growth of economic benefits for example singh et al 2021 studied the coordination of irrigation systems and cropping patterns to improve the yield and economic benefits of aloe vera gokavi et al 2021 studied the effects of different cropping patterns on coffee yield and economic benefits deng et al 2003 demonstrated the economic benefits and water resource utilization efficiency as the goal and established cropping patterns and fertilization for a dryland spring wheat growth yield model schweers 2012 studied the goal of economic benefits and environmental risks and optimized the pattern system of farmland cultivation in the erhai lake basin however research on cropping pattern optimization based on a comprehensive measurement of the overall coordination among water resources the economy society the environment and ecology is rare the multiple dimensions involved in cropping pattern optimization are composed of different objective functions while the driving elements of each dimension target change over time and are associated with the target driven elements of other dimensions for example the per capita grain output in the economic dimension is determined by the crop output in the economic dimension and the total population in the social dimension armindo et al 2019 the footprint of fossil energy involved in the ecological dimension is related to the amount of fertilizer pesticide agricultural film etc in the environmental dimension christodoulou and kourantidou 2011 however the driving factors of each dimension of the elements in the multidimensional optimization process of the cropping pattern are not static and the way the elements are combined and the differences in the combination will have an impact on the cropping pattern mao et al 2007 how to consider the dynamics and relevance of the driving elements of each dimensional goal in the process of the multidimensional optimization of a cropping pattern will help with the precise adjustment of the cropping pattern and the effective trade off of multidimensional goals a system dynamics sd method can solve complex system patterns handle multidimensional variables provide multiple feedback and address time varying problems and is an effective way to solve the above problems at present some scholars use an sd method to study agricultural cropping patterns from the analysis of the nonlinear and irreversible operating characteristics of the agricultural cropping pattern system li et al 2002 established a system dynamics model for the evolution of the agricultural cropping industry system faeid et al 2020 used an sd method to analyze the trend results of malaysian oil palm fruit production and proposed an appropriate cropping pattern strategy however the coupling of an sd method with the multidimensional optimization model of a cropping pattern has not been studied this coupling from the perspective of system theory can optimize and predict the cropping pattern sustainably which is of great significance to the sustainable use of agricultural land water resources therefore this paper establishes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics the model aims to maximize the synergistic development of the five dimensions of regional water resources society economy ecology and environment and simulates the systematic association and dynamic evolution law of each dimensional driving factor by using the system dynamics method on this basis the objective function of each dimension is established and the multidimensional optimal regulation of the cropping pattern of different crops in different regions is carried out through multiobjective nonlinear programming the established method is applied to empirical research in heilongjiang province decision making methods for regional agricultural cropping pattern planning and a theoretical reference for improving regional agricultural sustainable development are provided 2 multidimensional synergistic optimization method for a cropping pattern this paper proposes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics and includes three parts 1 the sd method 2 the multidimensional cooperative optimization model of a cropping pattern and 3 the computational process the modeling framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 sd approach this paper uses an sd approach to model and simulate the driving elements of each dimension in a multidimensional optimization model of the cropping pattern arif et al 2021 the sd method takes feedback control as the theoretical basis and observes the dynamic trend of the model system when the parameters and strategies are changed by studying the system composition the interaction of various parts in the system and dynamic simulation tests xu et al 2018 an sd model consists of three elements variables parameters and functional relationships al hawari et al 2020 the sd approach analyzes the pattern of an overall system based on the cause effect relationships of the basic elements and establishes a system flow diagram 2 1 1 sd method steps for complex real world problems sd is mainly based on the following six steps to analyze and solve a problem 1 comprehensive analysis of the system 2 system boundary clarification 3 causality analysis 4 system flow diagram drawing 5 model testing and policy design and 6 comprehensive results analysis through parameter regulation for program comparison and optimization decision making vugrin et al 2011 various factors are interrelated and restricted on the basis of grasping these qualitative interrelationships they are quantified simulated and simulated through the system flow diagram the system flow diagram is designed according to the different causal variable relationships between various factors in the system it can reflect the basic nature and function characteristics of each causal relationship within the entire system and achieve the main purpose of prediction and simulation through the quantification of the relationship in the flow diagram the variables in a system flow diagram include state variables flows auxiliary variables and constants zhang et al 2019 state variables are variables that describe the cumulative effects of a system flows are also known as state variables and are used to respond to temporal changes in stocks auxiliary variables are intermediate variables used to describe the process of information transfer and transformation between state variables and flows in the decision process constants are quantities that remain constant or change very little during the study period peng et al 2016 in this paper the water resource dimension variables such as irrigation quota effective irrigation area and water supply demand ratio are selected economic dimension variables such as grain yield and crop price population birth rate per capita productive area of cultivated land and other social dimension variables environmental dimension variables such as fertilizer consumption per unit area and fuel consumption per unit area cultivated land ecological productive area land yield factor crop calorific value and other ecological dimension variables the relationship between the internal variables of each dimension is close around the planting area and the variables affect and restrict each other moreover the variables of the five dimensions are interrelated and a system flow graph based on planting area is established 2 1 2 testing and evaluation of sd models after an sd model is established the validity of the model needs to be evaluated using an error test between the historical data and the simulated data to check the degree of similarity to judge the reliability and accuracy of the model simulation mohamed et al 2021 in this paper the root mean square error rmse method is used to evaluate the model where a lower rmse value indicates a higher model confidence indicating better model performance sabzi et al 2017 2 2 multidimensional synergistic optimization model for a cropping pattern based on the sd model the water footprint net economic benefit gini coefficient carbon footprint and ecological coordination index are used as the driving parameters of the objective function values for each dimension of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology and an objective function for each dimension is constructed based on this taking a system that comprehensively considers the cooperative development degree of the system and the coupling development index as the objective function a composite multidimensional coordinated control method based on the sd method is constructed to solve the optimal configuration model of the regional agricultural cropping pattern the model constraints include water supply water demand land use and food demand the decision variables are the area planted with different crops in different regions 2 2 1 objective function the degree of cooperative development can reflect the level of sustainable synergistic development in agriculture evaluate the degree

modeling method was applied to heilongjiang province the most northeastern part of china located between 43 26 53 33 n and 121 11 135 05 e heilongjiang province has 12 prefecture level cities and one region including many irrigation areas fig 2 the climate is dominated by a temperate continental monsoon climate the summer temperature is relatively high and the precipitation is sufficient the winter timespan is long severely cold and dry heilongjiang province has a vast area and superior cropping conditions and is suitable for the growth of crops it is an important agricultural production base in china corn soybeans rice potatoes and wheat are the main crops accounting for approximately 90 of all crops however there are a number of problems in the areas of water resources and the social economic ecological and environmental aspects of sustainable agricultural development in terms of water resources the amount of agricultural water consumption is large and shows a trend of increasing year by year in terms of society the number of people engaged in agriculture has gradually declined in terms of economic growth agricultural economic growth is weak and the structural adjustment of the agricultural economy is relatively slow in terms of ecology and environment agricultural nonpoint source pollution leads to the deterioration of river and lake water quality and water quality pollution affects the yield of crops and makes the ecological environment unbalanced therefore the sustainable development of agriculture faces a certain degree of challenges and it is very important to adjust the cropping pattern in an orderly manner 3 2 model data regarding the relevant parameters of the model meteorological data such as evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed come from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn data such as rainfall water demand and irrigation quota are from the 2007 2016 china water resources bulletin the utilization efficiencies of surface water and groundwater are 0 65 and 0 85 respectively data on population cropping costs yield per unit area and crop prices come from 2007 to 2016 china urban statistical yearbook china regional economic statistical yearbook and heilongjiang provincial statistical yearbook cultivated land yield factors crop calorific value per unit area ammonia nitrogen volatilization coefficient and other data come from 2007 to 2016 china environmental statistics yearbook and heilongjiang province ecological environment status bulletin among them the biodiversity coefficient is 12 and the conversion coefficients of chemical fertilizers pesticides agricultural film agricultural diesel and mechanical power are 23 6 100 48 82 42 7 and 3 6 mj kg respectively the output per unit area the amount of surface water irrigation the amount of fertilizer per unit area etc are processed using software such as matlab and ms office in this paper we take 2016 as the status quo year to optimize the cropping pattern for heilongjiang province in 2016 and plan the cropping pattern for heilongjiang province in 2025 and 2030 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 sd based evolution of the cropping pattern driving elements 4 1 1 construction of a multidimensional sd flow diagram for cropping patterns the cropping pattern optimization system involves five dimensional subsystems water resource economic social environmental and ecological subsystems the multidimensional system flow diagram of the cropping pattern is shown in fig 3 the system includes 68 variables of which the effective irrigated area of farmland population carbon emissions ecological footprint and food production value are state variables among them the population increase farmland area change etc are rate variables fertilizer use grain yield etc are auxiliary variables and the fertilizer conversion factor energy balance factor etc are constants 4 1 2 test of the sd model in this paper 2007 is chosen as the model starting time and 2007 2016 are the model test time and the actual situation respectively due to the relatively large number of parameters a representative indicator was selected for testing in the water resource social and environmental dimensions the maize irrigation quota in the water resource dimension fertilizer use per unit area in the environmental dimension and total population in the social dimension were selected as historical test indicators for historical testing the simulation values were compared with the historical values and the model was valid with an error within10 with the errors of the parameters in this paper all between 7 15 and 6 25 which met the model accuracy requirements werner et al 2002 the tests of the sd model are detailed in the supplementary material 4 1 3 model simulation in this paper the average values of the last 10 years are selected for the simulation of the parameters that do not change significantly with time such as the irrigation water use coefficient land balance factor and crop water demand for parameters that change significantly with time such as population fertilizer use and irrigated area simulations are conducted according to their time change trends taking the fertilizer use per unit area in qiqihar and the corn irrigation quota in harbin as examples the simulation was conducted and a fitting curve was drawn as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that the rmse 10 03 for the corn irrigation quota for the pesticide use per unit area rmse 7 85 for the population rmse 3 76 and for the fertilizer use per unit area the rmse 3 39 and the small error between the simulated and historical values indicates the good performance of the model based on the verified sd model this paper simulates the driving elements in the multidimensional control and optimization model of the cropping pattern and couples the simulated and predicted driving elements into the optimization model to optimize the cropping pattern adjustment plan in different time periods 4 2 cropping pattern optimization based on the simulation results of the sd model the multidimensional collaborative optimization model of the cropping pattern was solved fig 5 shows the results of the optimal adjustment program of the cropping pattern in 13 regions of heilongjiang province compared with the status quo 2016 cropping pattern the optimized total planted area is 12 8 less than the status quo situation the planting area of each crop was adjusted in all regions including increasing the area in jixi shuangyashan and daxinganling by 27 16 4 and 55 4 respectively and reducing the crop area in the rest of the region among them the rice planting area decreased the most with a reduction of 39 94 104 ha the reason is to protect the ecological environment and make more rational use of water resources the overall reduction in planting area is the result of the model weighing the multidimensional contradictions of water resources society the economy ecology and the environment compared with the actual situation optimizing the cropping pattern increased the net economic benefits by 40 45 the fairness of water resource distribution increased by 30 18 the environmental pollution decreased by 38 46 the water use efficiency increased by 25 08 and the ecological coordination index increased by 33 09 while the optimized total acreage was reduced the area planted for higher priced crops increased increasing crop output the more rational allocation of water resources has greatly improved crop yields reduced the amount of fertilizers pesticides agricultural films etc and not only reduced costs but also reduced pollution to the ecological environment thereby improving economic net benefits fairness in resource allocation water resource utilization efficiency environmental quality and the ecological coordination index in addition the optimized planting area increased the diversity of crops in the province with the exception of the daxinganling area where rice is not planted various food crops have been planted in all areas the coupling of the sd model and the multidimensional optimization model of the cropping pattern can produce a cropping pattern adjustment plan at different periods in the future as shown in fig 6 the optimized total planting area in the three time periods of 2016 2025 and 2030 shows a downward trend year by year the current and optimized planting areas are shown in table 1 the planting areas of rice and corn after optimization decreased by 22 36 34 12 and 26 11 35 34 respectively from the current status after optimization the planting areas of soybean tuber and wheat increased by 22 41 34 98 38 12 38 32 and 24 32 24 45 respectively although the area planted with corn and rice decreased after optimization the area planted with soybeans potatoes and wheat increased the planting of more expensive crops increased food production value and the legumes also had a good effect on improving the ecological environment this result once again shows that reducing the total planting area has a significant multidimensional synergistic impact on water resources society the economy ecology and the environment therefore it is necessary to discuss the multidimensional cooperative development of cropping patterns 4 3 multidimensional target value change and coordination according to the optimized planting area the multidimensional objective function value can be calculated and then the development index of the system in different time periods and different dimensions can be obtained as shown in fig 7 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized economic dimension development index is 0 67 0 78 and 0 81 respectively which is an increase of 37 82 67 05 from the current 0 49 in 2016 the higher optimization improvement in 2030 is due to the comparison of the sd model and the optimized model results in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized ecological dimension development index is 0 76 0 82 and 0 78 respectively which is an increase of 33 21 44 34 from the current value of 0 58 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized water resource dimension development index is 0 59 0 55 and 0 48 respectively which is a decrease of 17 71 32 92 from the current value of 0 72 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized social dimension development index is 0 52 0 49 and 0 31 respectively which is a decrease of 19 41 52 45 from the current 0 66 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized environmental dimension development index is 0 61 0 45 and 0 55 respectively a decrease of 18 73 53 65 from the current 0 76 in 2016 among them the development index of optimizing the five dimensions in 2030 is the best the development indices of the five dimensional optimization scenarios of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in 2030 reach the optimal state for each dimension the degree of cooperative development d is the criterion for dividing the level of synergistic development among the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology and the coupling development index is the criterion for dividing the degree of mutual coordination among the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in this paper the system cooperative development degree and coupling development index obtained from the model solution are analyzed according to the criteria in tables 2 and 3 and the results are shown in fig 8 in the process of cropping pattern optimization for 2016 the cooperative development degree of the five major subsystems of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology is 0 58 which is a barely coordinated state in 2016 the optimized cooperative development degree was 0 72 which is an intermediate state of coordination the optimized cooperative development degree in 2025 is 0 86 which is a well coordinated state and the optimized cooperative development degree in 2030 is 0 92 which is a high quality coordinated state therefore through the optimization of the cropping pattern the cooperative development of heilongjiang province s sustainable agricultural development system evolved from a barely coordinated state to a high quality coordinated state the increase in the degree of cooperative development requires that all dimensions coordinate and cooperate with each other under the premise of maintaining the internal cooperative development of their respective systems to form a benign coupling and interactive force and realize the sustainable and cooperative development of agriculture in multiple dimensions during the optimization process of the cropping pattern the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology constitute a complex system with a coupling development index of 0 64 which is in a stage of benign coupling in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized coupling development index is 0 8 0 89 and 0 91 respectively which are all in a high level coupling stage this result indicates that the dimensions of the cropping pattern optimization show good interactions and the overall function and comprehensive development level of the sustainable and cooperative development system of agriculture in heilongjiang province have reached a good state this shows that after optimization the high intensity coupling of sustainable and coordinated agricultural development in heilongjiang province is a high intensity coupling under the interconnection of various dimensions 4 4 spatial distribution characteristics of the cropping pattern to better understand the impact of the change in the cropping pattern across heilongjiang province on the water resource economic social ecological and environmental development and sustainable development of the province the optimized planting area and the corresponding multidimensional target values were downscaled to the 182 irrigation districts in the province according to an area ratio as shown in fig 9 the overall water resource social and environmental dimension development indices of the 182 irrigation districts after optimization in 2016 2025 and 2030 are 16 7 34 85 17 4 35 96 and 14 2 39 65 lower than the status quo in 2016 respectively the development indices of the economic and ecological dimensions are 20 35 40 25 and 18 32 35 36 higher than the status quo in 2016 respectively multidimensional development index of the optimized planted area in 182 irrigation districts in heilongjiang province among the wfp values the daxinganling area in northern heilongjiang province is significantly lower than the status quo and the heihe qiqihar and daqing areas in the west are optimized to be significantly lower than the status quo by more than 25 36 in 2025 and 2030 effectively improving the efficiency of water use the decrease in wfp is due to the increase in yield after optimization and the decrease in crop water requirements and fertilizer use resulting in a decrease in the blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint among the gini values for the daxinganling and heihe areas in northwestern heilongjiang province and the harbin and mudanjiang areas in the south the 2030 optimization significantly reduced the status quo by more than 26 59 effectively improving the fairness of land resource allocation the decrease in gini is due to an increase in the optimized population size which leads to a decrease in the gini coefficient at the social level among the cfp values for the daxinganling area in the north and the jixi and shuangyashan areas in the east the 2016 optimization significantly reduced the status quo and for the western heihe and suihua and southern mudanjiang and qitaihe areas the 2025 and 2030 optimization significantly reduced the status quo by more than 28 45 effectively reducing environmental pollution the reduction in cfp is due to the optimized reduction of fertilizer pesticide film and agro diesel use resulting in lower carbon emissions and thus a lower carbon footprint of the crop among the neb values for the western qiqihar and daqing and northern daxinganling areas the 2016 and 2025 optimization significantly increased the status quo and for the heihe yichun and suihua junction areas the 2030 optimization significantly improved the status quo by more than 24 36 effectively improving the province s economic benefits the increase in neb is due to the higher yield and lower cost of the optimized crop resulting in higher net economic benefits among the eeci values for the northwestern heihe and southern harbin areas the 2025 optimization rapidly grew the status quo and the province s 2030 optimization significantly grew the status quo by more than 27 65 effectively improving the ecological environment the increase in eeci is due to optimized crop yields per capita calorific value and population growth leading to an increase in the ecological coordination index it can be seen that in northwestern heilongjiang province and the northern daxinganling area optimization of the planting area in the five dimensions is optimal because these areas are rich in resources and real estate can be transformed into a large space making it easier to achieve a multidimensional sustainable and synergistic development for the cropping pattern 5 discussion this section compares the optimal results of the developed model with the status quo 2016 and related studies the optimal cropping pattern of 13 regions in heilongjiang province was adjusted by 12 8 less than the status quo the water use efficiency increased by 25 08 and the economic efficiency increased by 40 45 the results indicated that implementing cropping pattern planning can improve water use efficiency and net economic benefits such results have also been proven by pi et al 2021 who optimized the cropping pattern of hami xinjiang with a 20 58 increase in water use efficiency and a 25 67 increase in economic efficiency in addition the developed multidimensional collaborative model of cropping pattern optimization based on sd in this paper not only improves crop yield reduces the water footprint and improves economic efficiency but also improves the equity of land resources and reduces agricultural carbon emissions the degree of cooperative development of water resources economy society environment and ecology has increased by 0 14 from a state of barely coordinated to a state of intermediate coordination which is in line with the law of sustainable agricultural development song et al 2021 moreover through the sd based multidimensional collaborative optimization model future cropping pattern plans can also be obtained the degree of cooperative development in 2025 increased by 0 28 compared with the status quo 2016 reaching a good coordination state and the degree of cooperative development in 2030 increased by 0 34 reaching a high quality coordination state although the optimal planted area of rice and corn decreased from the status quo the planted area of soybeans potatoes and wheat increased by 34 98 38 32 and 24 45 respectively improving the net economic benefits by 40 5 the reduction in planting area has greatly reduced the water consumption of crops which has made the water footprint change more obvious reducing the water footprint by more than 17 17 such results of the water footprint trend based on crop pattern optimization were in accordance with the results of guo et al 2021 which optimized the cropping pattern of crops in inner mongolia the crop water footprint was reduced by 18 1 21 0 however under the premise of ensuring sustainable development this study optimizes the planting area to coordinately improve the efficiency of water resource utilization net economic benefits fairness of resource allocation ecological coordination index and environmental pollution quality therefore the combined analysis of the coupling development index and the cooperative development degree shows that the optimized coupling development index and the cooperative development degree increased from the status quo by 14 3 34 3 and 24 7 51 2 respectively showing a trend of year overyear growth of which 2030 will be optimized the comprehensive level of the optimized agricultural sustainable cooperative development system of heilongjiang province tended to be in a good development state 6 conclusion and future work this paper proposes a multidimensional collaborative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics this model simulates and optimizes the impact of cropping pattern adjustments on water resources society the economy the environment ecological multidimensional synergy and sustainable agricultural development from the perspective of system modeling dynamic multidimensional synergistic optimization of cropping patterns is realized and sustainable agriculture in heilongjiang province cooperative development is promoted the following specific contributions are made 1 an sd model is used to simulate and analyze the dynamic trend of multidimensional related elements of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in depth insights into the dynamic changes in each element and the correlation among multiple elements lay the foundation for the adjustment of the regional cropping pattern 2 based on the changing trends of the driving factors in each dimension an objective function for each dimension is constructed based on this a multidimensional coordinated adjustment and control optimization model of the regional agricultural cropping pattern is established to obtain the optimal adjustment plan and changing characteristics of the cropping pattern in different regions to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture this method was applied to evaluate the planting area of the main crops in heilongjiang province the following conclusions can be drawn from the research compared with the status quo from an optimization perspective it is recommended to reduce the total area to promote sustainable use the utilization of 213 94 104 ha of arable land can best promote the sustainable and cooperative development of agriculture the existing cropping pattern of corn rice soybean potato and wheat is changed from the current 215 82 104 ha 561 4 104 ha 245 62 104 ha 18 75 104 ha and 10 81 104 ha respectively to the optimized and adjusted 123 02 104 ha 344 47 104 ha 331 55 104 ha 25 91 104 ha and 13 49 104 ha this can increase the cooperative development of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology by 51 2 the result of optimization is that all areas are planted with various crops except that rice is not planted in the daxinganling area which promotes the diversity of crop cropping in the province different regions in heilongjiang province have different emphases in terms of the economy society ecology the environment and water resource utilization efficiency on the whole the multidimensional synergy effect of the northwestern and northern daxinganling mountains is the best and areas with larger planting areas have multiple dimensions the synergy is also high the method developed in this study can be applied to most areas where the cropping industry occupies an important position this paper optimized and planned cropping patterns by a multidimensional agricultural sustainable collaborative optimization modeling method based on sd to achieve the coordination of water resource use socioeconomic benefits and ecological environmental effects however as one of the key limiting factors of cropping pattern adjustment water availability is directly affected by the changing environment which makes it highly random in addition fluctuations in socioeconomic policy and changes in field activities also affect cropping patterns future research will focus on considering the impact of uncertainty on the multidimensional collaborative

9401,cropping patterns are essential for the sustainable development of regional agriculture and land conservation to solve the complex system problems of the multidimensional coordination of water resources society economy environment and ecology and dynamics in the decision making of cropping pattern adjustment this paper proposes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for cropping patterns based on system dynamics the system association and dynamic evolution trends of the driving elements are simulated and coupled to the multidimensional multitarget planning model which can realize the multidimensional optimization and dynamic prediction of cropping patterns in different regions the proposed method is applied to empirical research in heilongjiang province the results showed that optimization of the cropping pattern contributed to an increase in the cooperative development of the system in 2016 2025 and 2030 by 24 14 42 36 and 51 36 respectively evolving from a state of barely cooperative to a state of high quality cooperative this indicates that the model helps to promote the sustainable use of cultivated land the optimization improved the crop diversity with a variety of food crops planted in most regions the optimization results of the spatial network consisting of 182 irrigation areas show that the resource utilization efficiency economic benefits environmental pollution situation and resource allocation fairness improved by approximately 20 in different partitions the model can reflect the dynamics balance conflicts of the multidimensional targets of cropping patterns and promote the sustainable use of cultivated land it can be used as a general model and is applicable to most areas where other cultivation occupies an important place graphical abstract ga1 keywords cropping pattern multidimensional coordination system dynamics model optimization model sustainability 1 introduction the cropping pattern is a basic condition for the development of the cropping industry and is very important to the sustainable development of regional agriculture adjusting and optimizing the pattern of agricultural cultivation is currently an important task in the agricultural development of china and it is necessary for decision makers to adjust and optimize the cropping pattern according to market demand he et al 2021 the optimization of cropping patterns involves multiple dimensions such as water resources society economy ecology and environment which is a complex project and requires multidimensional optimization ji et al 2021 ren et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 each dimension has a direct relationship with the cropping pattern for example by adjusting cropping patterns water use efficiency economic efficiency and the ecological environment can be improved garduño et al 2010 song et al 2014 he et al 2021 in addition there is a contradictory relationship between the various dimensions involved in the optimization of cropping patterns such as the contradiction between economic development and a beautiful ecological environment the shortage of water resources and the contradiction between social and economic development brenner and hartl 2021 to promote the sustainable development of agriculture it is necessary to consider the multidimensional coordination of water resources society the economy ecology and the environment in the process of cropping pattern optimization most studies on the optimization of existing cropping patterns focus on the growth of economic benefits for example singh et al 2021 studied the coordination of irrigation systems and cropping patterns to improve the yield and economic benefits of aloe vera gokavi et al 2021 studied the effects of different cropping patterns on coffee yield and economic benefits deng et al 2003 demonstrated the economic benefits and water resource utilization efficiency as the goal and established cropping patterns and fertilization for a dryland spring wheat growth yield model schweers 2012 studied the goal of economic benefits and environmental risks and optimized the pattern system of farmland cultivation in the erhai lake basin however research on cropping pattern optimization based on a comprehensive measurement of the overall coordination among water resources the economy society the environment and ecology is rare the multiple dimensions involved in cropping pattern optimization are composed of different objective functions while the driving elements of each dimension target change over time and are associated with the target driven elements of other dimensions for example the per capita grain output in the economic dimension is determined by the crop output in the economic dimension and the total population in the social dimension armindo et al 2019 the footprint of fossil energy involved in the ecological dimension is related to the amount of fertilizer pesticide agricultural film etc in the environmental dimension christodoulou and kourantidou 2011 however the driving factors of each dimension of the elements in the multidimensional optimization process of the cropping pattern are not static and the way the elements are combined and the differences in the combination will have an impact on the cropping pattern mao et al 2007 how to consider the dynamics and relevance of the driving elements of each dimensional goal in the process of the multidimensional optimization of a cropping pattern will help with the precise adjustment of the cropping pattern and the effective trade off of multidimensional goals a system dynamics sd method can solve complex system patterns handle multidimensional variables provide multiple feedback and address time varying problems and is an effective way to solve the above problems at present some scholars use an sd method to study agricultural cropping patterns from the analysis of the nonlinear and irreversible operating characteristics of the agricultural cropping pattern system li et al 2002 established a system dynamics model for the evolution of the agricultural cropping industry system faeid et al 2020 used an sd method to analyze the trend results of malaysian oil palm fruit production and proposed an appropriate cropping pattern strategy however the coupling of an sd method with the multidimensional optimization model of a cropping pattern has not been studied this coupling from the perspective of system theory can optimize and predict the cropping pattern sustainably which is of great significance to the sustainable use of agricultural land water resources therefore this paper establishes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics the model aims to maximize the synergistic development of the five dimensions of regional water resources society economy ecology and environment and simulates the systematic association and dynamic evolution law of each dimensional driving factor by using the system dynamics method on this basis the objective function of each dimension is established and the multidimensional optimal regulation of the cropping pattern of different crops in different regions is carried out through multiobjective nonlinear programming the established method is applied to empirical research in heilongjiang province decision making methods for regional agricultural cropping pattern planning and a theoretical reference for improving regional agricultural sustainable development are provided 2 multidimensional synergistic optimization method for a cropping pattern this paper proposes a multidimensional cooperative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics and includes three parts 1 the sd method 2 the multidimensional cooperative optimization model of a cropping pattern and 3 the computational process the modeling framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 sd approach this paper uses an sd approach to model and simulate the driving elements of each dimension in a multidimensional optimization model of the cropping pattern arif et al 2021 the sd method takes feedback control as the theoretical basis and observes the dynamic trend of the model system when the parameters and strategies are changed by studying the system composition the interaction of various parts in the system and dynamic simulation tests xu et al 2018 an sd model consists of three elements variables parameters and functional relationships al hawari et al 2020 the sd approach analyzes the pattern of an overall system based on the cause effect relationships of the basic elements and establishes a system flow diagram 2 1 1 sd method steps for complex real world problems sd is mainly based on the following six steps to analyze and solve a problem 1 comprehensive analysis of the system 2 system boundary clarification 3 causality analysis 4 system flow diagram drawing 5 model testing and policy design and 6 comprehensive results analysis through parameter regulation for program comparison and optimization decision making vugrin et al 2011 various factors are interrelated and restricted on the basis of grasping these qualitative interrelationships they are quantified simulated and simulated through the system flow diagram the system flow diagram is designed according to the different causal variable relationships between various factors in the system it can reflect the basic nature and function characteristics of each causal relationship within the entire system and achieve the main purpose of prediction and simulation through the quantification of the relationship in the flow diagram the variables in a system flow diagram include state variables flows auxiliary variables and constants zhang et al 2019 state variables are variables that describe the cumulative effects of a system flows are also known as state variables and are used to respond to temporal changes in stocks auxiliary variables are intermediate variables used to describe the process of information transfer and transformation between state variables and flows in the decision process constants are quantities that remain constant or change very little during the study period peng et al 2016 in this paper the water resource dimension variables such as irrigation quota effective irrigation area and water supply demand ratio are selected economic dimension variables such as grain yield and crop price population birth rate per capita productive area of cultivated land and other social dimension variables environmental dimension variables such as fertilizer consumption per unit area and fuel consumption per unit area cultivated land ecological productive area land yield factor crop calorific value and other ecological dimension variables the relationship between the internal variables of each dimension is close around the planting area and the variables affect and restrict each other moreover the variables of the five dimensions are interrelated and a system flow graph based on planting area is established 2 1 2 testing and evaluation of sd models after an sd model is established the validity of the model needs to be evaluated using an error test between the historical data and the simulated data to check the degree of similarity to judge the reliability and accuracy of the model simulation mohamed et al 2021 in this paper the root mean square error rmse method is used to evaluate the model where a lower rmse value indicates a higher model confidence indicating better model performance sabzi et al 2017 2 2 multidimensional synergistic optimization model for a cropping pattern based on the sd model the water footprint net economic benefit gini coefficient carbon footprint and ecological coordination index are used as the driving parameters of the objective function values for each dimension of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology and an objective function for each dimension is constructed based on this taking a system that comprehensively considers the cooperative development degree of the system and the coupling development index as the objective function a composite multidimensional coordinated control method based on the sd method is constructed to solve the optimal configuration model of the regional agricultural cropping pattern the model constraints include water supply water demand land use and food demand the decision variables are the area planted with different crops in different regions 2 2 1 objective function the degree of cooperative development can reflect the level of sustainable synergistic development in agriculture evaluate the degree

water resource economic social economic and ecological dimensional development indices respectively the comprehensive development index can be obtained through the development index of the five dimensions of water resources economy society environment and ecology and the corresponding weight of each dimension with the following formula 3 t a r e s f r e s a e c o f e c o a s o c f s o c a e n v f e n v a e c o l f e c o l where a r e s a e c o a s o c a e n v and a e c o l represent the water resource economic social economic and ecological dimensional weights respectively the objective

evaluating the efficiency of agricultural water resources or their associated land resource use zhao et al 2014 li et al 2019 the crop wfp refers to the consumption and impact of water resources by decision makers throughout the crop growth process consists of three components the green wfp blue wfp and gray wfp therefore the target function of the water resource dimension is to minimize the

study analyzes the social dimension mainly in terms of land resource allocation the fairness of land resource allocation is an important aspect reflecting social stability which can ensure the balanced development of different regions the gini coefficient is an effective measure of the fairness of land resource allocation whose value ranges from 0 to 1 zhang et al 2010 the smaller the value of the gini coefficient is the more evenly arable land is distributed among regions therefore the objective function of the social dimension is to minimize the gini coefficient gini the expression is

analyzes the environmental dimension mainly in terms of the crop carbon footprint which is an important indicator to guide the sustainable development of farmland and can be defined as the estimation of carbon emissions caused by production practices during the life cycle of a crop solinas et al 2021 it can be divided into carbon emissions and carbon fixation carbon emissions include emissions from c o 2 n 2 o and c h 4 therefore the objective function of the environmental dimension is to minimize the carbon footprint cfp the expression is 10 f c f p e n v min c e c o 2 298 c e n 2 o 25 c e

crops with eeci values between 1 and 1 414 and an eeci 1 414 indicating a balance between ecological supply and demand li et al 2020 therefore the objective function of the ecological dimension is to

based multidimensional optimization model for the cropping pattern are as follows step 1 determine the boundaries of the sd system the basic units of the subsystem and the pattern of the feedback loop write equations and input the parameters into the sd model of sustainable agricultural development for simulation and test and evaluate the indicators of the simulation step 2 the parameters of the dryland irrigation quota food price birth rate carbon emissions and ecological carrying capacity in the water resource economic social environmental and ecological dimensions of the sd model are used as the driving elements of the objective functions of the corresponding dimensions for the multidimensional regulation of cropping patterns the sd model is coupled with the optimization model to

modeling method was applied to heilongjiang province the most northeastern part of china located between 43 26 53 33 n and 121 11 135 05 e heilongjiang province has 12 prefecture level cities and one region including many irrigation areas fig 2 the climate is dominated by a temperate continental monsoon climate the summer temperature is relatively high and the precipitation is sufficient the winter timespan is long severely cold and dry heilongjiang province has a vast area and superior cropping conditions and is suitable for the growth of crops it is an important agricultural production base in china corn soybeans rice potatoes and wheat are the main crops accounting for approximately 90 of all crops however there are a number of problems in the areas of water resources and the social economic ecological and environmental aspects of sustainable agricultural development in terms of water resources the amount of agricultural water consumption is large and shows a trend of increasing year by year in terms of society the number of people engaged in agriculture has gradually declined in terms of economic growth agricultural economic growth is weak and the structural adjustment of the agricultural economy is relatively slow in terms of ecology and environment agricultural nonpoint source pollution leads to the deterioration of river and lake water quality and water quality pollution affects the yield of crops and makes the ecological environment unbalanced therefore the sustainable development of agriculture faces a certain degree of challenges and it is very important to adjust the cropping pattern in an orderly manner 3 2 model data regarding the relevant parameters of the model meteorological data such as evapotranspiration temperature and wind speed come from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn data such as rainfall water demand and irrigation quota are from the 2007 2016 china water resources bulletin the utilization efficiencies of surface water and groundwater are 0 65 and 0 85 respectively data on population cropping costs yield per unit area and crop prices come from 2007 to 2016 china urban statistical yearbook china regional economic statistical yearbook and heilongjiang provincial statistical yearbook cultivated land yield factors crop calorific value per unit area ammonia nitrogen volatilization coefficient and other data come from 2007 to 2016 china environmental statistics yearbook and heilongjiang province ecological environment status bulletin among them the biodiversity coefficient is 12 and the conversion coefficients of chemical fertilizers pesticides agricultural film agricultural diesel and mechanical power are 23 6 100 48 82 42 7 and 3 6 mj kg respectively the output per unit area the amount of surface water irrigation the amount of fertilizer per unit area etc are processed using software such as matlab and ms office in this paper we take 2016 as the status quo year to optimize the cropping pattern for heilongjiang province in 2016 and plan the cropping pattern for heilongjiang province in 2025 and 2030 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 sd based evolution of the cropping pattern driving elements 4 1 1 construction of a multidimensional sd flow diagram for cropping patterns the cropping pattern optimization system involves five dimensional subsystems water resource economic social environmental and ecological subsystems the multidimensional system flow diagram of the cropping pattern is shown in fig 3 the system includes 68 variables of which the effective irrigated area of farmland population carbon emissions ecological footprint and food production value are state variables among them the population increase farmland area change etc are rate variables fertilizer use grain yield etc are auxiliary variables and the fertilizer conversion factor energy balance factor etc are constants 4 1 2 test of the sd model in this paper 2007 is chosen as the model starting time and 2007 2016 are the model test time and the actual situation respectively due to the relatively large number of parameters a representative indicator was selected for testing in the water resource social and environmental dimensions the maize irrigation quota in the water resource dimension fertilizer use per unit area in the environmental dimension and total population in the social dimension were selected as historical test indicators for historical testing the simulation values were compared with the historical values and the model was valid with an error within10 with the errors of the parameters in this paper all between 7 15 and 6 25 which met the model accuracy requirements werner et al 2002 the tests of the sd model are detailed in the supplementary material 4 1 3 model simulation in this paper the average values of the last 10 years are selected for the simulation of the parameters that do not change significantly with time such as the irrigation water use coefficient land balance factor and crop water demand for parameters that change significantly with time such as population fertilizer use and irrigated area simulations are conducted according to their time change trends taking the fertilizer use per unit area in qiqihar and the corn irrigation quota in harbin as examples the simulation was conducted and a fitting curve was drawn as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that the rmse 10 03 for the corn irrigation quota for the pesticide use per unit area rmse 7 85 for the population rmse 3 76 and for the fertilizer use per unit area the rmse 3 39 and the small error between the simulated and historical values indicates the good performance of the model based on the verified sd model this paper simulates the driving elements in the multidimensional control and optimization model of the cropping pattern and couples the simulated and predicted driving elements into the optimization model to optimize the cropping pattern adjustment plan in different time periods 4 2 cropping pattern optimization based on the simulation results of the sd model the multidimensional collaborative optimization model of the cropping pattern was solved fig 5 shows the results of the optimal adjustment program of the cropping pattern in 13 regions of heilongjiang province compared with the status quo 2016 cropping pattern the optimized total planted area is 12 8 less than the status quo situation the planting area of each crop was adjusted in all regions including increasing the area in jixi shuangyashan and daxinganling by 27 16 4 and 55 4 respectively and reducing the crop area in the rest of the region among them the rice planting area decreased the most with a reduction of 39 94 104 ha the reason is to protect the ecological environment and make more rational use of water resources the overall reduction in planting area is the result of the model weighing the multidimensional contradictions of water resources society the economy ecology and the environment compared with the actual situation optimizing the cropping pattern increased the net economic benefits by 40 45 the fairness of water resource distribution increased by 30 18 the environmental pollution decreased by 38 46 the water use efficiency increased by 25 08 and the ecological coordination index increased by 33 09 while the optimized total acreage was reduced the area planted for higher priced crops increased increasing crop output the more rational allocation of water resources has greatly improved crop yields reduced the amount of fertilizers pesticides agricultural films etc and not only reduced costs but also reduced pollution to the ecological environment thereby improving economic net benefits fairness in resource allocation water resource utilization efficiency environmental quality and the ecological coordination index in addition the optimized planting area increased the diversity of crops in the province with the exception of the daxinganling area where rice is not planted various food crops have been planted in all areas the coupling of the sd model and the multidimensional optimization model of the cropping pattern can produce a cropping pattern adjustment plan at different periods in the future as shown in fig 6 the optimized total planting area in the three time periods of 2016 2025 and 2030 shows a downward trend year by year the current and optimized planting areas are shown in table 1 the planting areas of rice and corn after optimization decreased by 22 36 34 12 and 26 11 35 34 respectively from the current status after optimization the planting areas of soybean tuber and wheat increased by 22 41 34 98 38 12 38 32 and 24 32 24 45 respectively although the area planted with corn and rice decreased after optimization the area planted with soybeans potatoes and wheat increased the planting of more expensive crops increased food production value and the legumes also had a good effect on improving the ecological environment this result once again shows that reducing the total planting area has a significant multidimensional synergistic impact on water resources society the economy ecology and the environment therefore it is necessary to discuss the multidimensional cooperative development of cropping patterns 4 3 multidimensional target value change and coordination according to the optimized planting area the multidimensional objective function value can be calculated and then the development index of the system in different time periods and different dimensions can be obtained as shown in fig 7 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized economic dimension development index is 0 67 0 78 and 0 81 respectively which is an increase of 37 82 67 05 from the current 0 49 in 2016 the higher optimization improvement in 2030 is due to the comparison of the sd model and the optimized model results in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized ecological dimension development index is 0 76 0 82 and 0 78 respectively which is an increase of 33 21 44 34 from the current value of 0 58 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized water resource dimension development index is 0 59 0 55 and 0 48 respectively which is a decrease of 17 71 32 92 from the current value of 0 72 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized social dimension development index is 0 52 0 49 and 0 31 respectively which is a decrease of 19 41 52 45 from the current 0 66 in 2016 in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized environmental dimension development index is 0 61 0 45 and 0 55 respectively a decrease of 18 73 53 65 from the current 0 76 in 2016 among them the development index of optimizing the five dimensions in 2030 is the best the development indices of the five dimensional optimization scenarios of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in 2030 reach the optimal state for each dimension the degree of cooperative development d is the criterion for dividing the level of synergistic development among the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology and the coupling development index is the criterion for dividing the degree of mutual coordination among the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in this paper the system cooperative development degree and coupling development index obtained from the model solution are analyzed according to the criteria in tables 2 and 3 and the results are shown in fig 8 in the process of cropping pattern optimization for 2016 the cooperative development degree of the five major subsystems of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology is 0 58 which is a barely coordinated state in 2016 the optimized cooperative development degree was 0 72 which is an intermediate state of coordination the optimized cooperative development degree in 2025 is 0 86 which is a well coordinated state and the optimized cooperative development degree in 2030 is 0 92 which is a high quality coordinated state therefore through the optimization of the cropping pattern the cooperative development of heilongjiang province s sustainable agricultural development system evolved from a barely coordinated state to a high quality coordinated state the increase in the degree of cooperative development requires that all dimensions coordinate and cooperate with each other under the premise of maintaining the internal cooperative development of their respective systems to form a benign coupling and interactive force and realize the sustainable and cooperative development of agriculture in multiple dimensions during the optimization process of the cropping pattern the five dimensions of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology constitute a complex system with a coupling development index of 0 64 which is in a stage of benign coupling in 2016 2025 and 2030 the optimized coupling development index is 0 8 0 89 and 0 91 respectively which are all in a high level coupling stage this result indicates that the dimensions of the cropping pattern optimization show good interactions and the overall function and comprehensive development level of the sustainable and cooperative development system of agriculture in heilongjiang province have reached a good state this shows that after optimization the high intensity coupling of sustainable and coordinated agricultural development in heilongjiang province is a high intensity coupling under the interconnection of various dimensions 4 4 spatial distribution characteristics of the cropping pattern to better understand the impact of the change in the cropping pattern across heilongjiang province on the water resource economic social ecological and environmental development and sustainable development of the province the optimized planting area and the corresponding multidimensional target values were downscaled to the 182 irrigation districts in the province according to an area ratio as shown in fig 9 the overall water resource social and environmental dimension development indices of the 182 irrigation districts after optimization in 2016 2025 and 2030 are 16 7 34 85 17 4 35 96 and 14 2 39 65 lower than the status quo in 2016 respectively the development indices of the economic and ecological dimensions are 20 35 40 25 and 18 32 35 36 higher than the status quo in 2016 respectively multidimensional development index of the optimized planted area in 182 irrigation districts in heilongjiang province among the wfp values the daxinganling area in northern heilongjiang province is significantly lower than the status quo and the heihe qiqihar and daqing areas in the west are optimized to be significantly lower than the status quo by more than 25 36 in 2025 and 2030 effectively improving the efficiency of water use the decrease in wfp is due to the increase in yield after optimization and the decrease in crop water requirements and fertilizer use resulting in a decrease in the blue water footprint green water footprint and gray water footprint among the gini values for the daxinganling and heihe areas in northwestern heilongjiang province and the harbin and mudanjiang areas in the south the 2030 optimization significantly reduced the status quo by more than 26 59 effectively improving the fairness of land resource allocation the decrease in gini is due to an increase in the optimized population size which leads to a decrease in the gini coefficient at the social level among the cfp values for the daxinganling area in the north and the jixi and shuangyashan areas in the east the 2016 optimization significantly reduced the status quo and for the western heihe and suihua and southern mudanjiang and qitaihe areas the 2025 and 2030 optimization significantly reduced the status quo by more than 28 45 effectively reducing environmental pollution the reduction in cfp is due to the optimized reduction of fertilizer pesticide film and agro diesel use resulting in lower carbon emissions and thus a lower carbon footprint of the crop among the neb values for the western qiqihar and daqing and northern daxinganling areas the 2016 and 2025 optimization significantly increased the status quo and for the heihe yichun and suihua junction areas the 2030 optimization significantly improved the status quo by more than 24 36 effectively improving the province s economic benefits the increase in neb is due to the higher yield and lower cost of the optimized crop resulting in higher net economic benefits among the eeci values for the northwestern heihe and southern harbin areas the 2025 optimization rapidly grew the status quo and the province s 2030 optimization significantly grew the status quo by more than 27 65 effectively improving the ecological environment the increase in eeci is due to optimized crop yields per capita calorific value and population growth leading to an increase in the ecological coordination index it can be seen that in northwestern heilongjiang province and the northern daxinganling area optimization of the planting area in the five dimensions is optimal because these areas are rich in resources and real estate can be transformed into a large space making it easier to achieve a multidimensional sustainable and synergistic development for the cropping pattern 5 discussion this section compares the optimal results of the developed model with the status quo 2016 and related studies the optimal cropping pattern of 13 regions in heilongjiang province was adjusted by 12 8 less than the status quo the water use efficiency increased by 25 08 and the economic efficiency increased by 40 45 the results indicated that implementing cropping pattern planning can improve water use efficiency and net economic benefits such results have also been proven by pi et al 2021 who optimized the cropping pattern of hami xinjiang with a 20 58 increase in water use efficiency and a 25 67 increase in economic efficiency in addition the developed multidimensional collaborative model of cropping pattern optimization based on sd in this paper not only improves crop yield reduces the water footprint and improves economic efficiency but also improves the equity of land resources and reduces agricultural carbon emissions the degree of cooperative development of water resources economy society environment and ecology has increased by 0 14 from a state of barely coordinated to a state of intermediate coordination which is in line with the law of sustainable agricultural development song et al 2021 moreover through the sd based multidimensional collaborative optimization model future cropping pattern plans can also be obtained the degree of cooperative development in 2025 increased by 0 28 compared with the status quo 2016 reaching a good coordination state and the degree of cooperative development in 2030 increased by 0 34 reaching a high quality coordination state although the optimal planted area of rice and corn decreased from the status quo the planted area of soybeans potatoes and wheat increased by 34 98 38 32 and 24 45 respectively improving the net economic benefits by 40 5 the reduction in planting area has greatly reduced the water consumption of crops which has made the water footprint change more obvious reducing the water footprint by more than 17 17 such results of the water footprint trend based on crop pattern optimization were in accordance with the results of guo et al 2021 which optimized the cropping pattern of crops in inner mongolia the crop water footprint was reduced by 18 1 21 0 however under the premise of ensuring sustainable development this study optimizes the planting area to coordinately improve the efficiency of water resource utilization net economic benefits fairness of resource allocation ecological coordination index and environmental pollution quality therefore the combined analysis of the coupling development index and the cooperative development degree shows that the optimized coupling development index and the cooperative development degree increased from the status quo by 14 3 34 3 and 24 7 51 2 respectively showing a trend of year overyear growth of which 2030 will be optimized the comprehensive level of the optimized agricultural sustainable cooperative development system of heilongjiang province tended to be in a good development state 6 conclusion and future work this paper proposes a multidimensional collaborative optimization modeling method for a cropping pattern based on system dynamics this model simulates and optimizes the impact of cropping pattern adjustments on water resources society the economy the environment ecological multidimensional synergy and sustainable agricultural development from the perspective of system modeling dynamic multidimensional synergistic optimization of cropping patterns is realized and sustainable agriculture in heilongjiang province cooperative development is promoted the following specific contributions are made 1 an sd model is used to simulate and analyze the dynamic trend of multidimensional related elements of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology in depth insights into the dynamic changes in each element and the correlation among multiple elements lay the foundation for the adjustment of the regional cropping pattern 2 based on the changing trends of the driving factors in each dimension an objective function for each dimension is constructed based on this a multidimensional coordinated adjustment and control optimization model of the regional agricultural cropping pattern is established to obtain the optimal adjustment plan and changing characteristics of the cropping pattern in different regions to promote the sustainable development of regional agriculture this method was applied to evaluate the planting area of the main crops in heilongjiang province the following conclusions can be drawn from the research compared with the status quo from an optimization perspective it is recommended to reduce the total area to promote sustainable use the utilization of 213 94 104 ha of arable land can best promote the sustainable and cooperative development of agriculture the existing cropping pattern of corn rice soybean potato and wheat is changed from the current 215 82 104 ha 561 4 104 ha 245 62 104 ha 18 75 104 ha and 10 81 104 ha respectively to the optimized and adjusted 123 02 104 ha 344 47 104 ha 331 55 104 ha 25 91 104 ha and 13 49 104 ha this can increase the cooperative development of water resources the economy society the environment and ecology by 51 2 the result of optimization is that all areas are planted with various crops except that rice is not planted in the daxinganling area which promotes the diversity of crop cropping in the province different regions in heilongjiang province have different emphases in terms of the economy society ecology the environment and water resource utilization efficiency on the whole the multidimensional synergy effect of the northwestern and northern daxinganling mountains is the best and areas with larger planting areas have multiple dimensions the synergy is also high the method developed in this study can be applied to most areas where the cropping industry occupies an important position this paper optimized and planned cropping patterns by a multidimensional agricultural sustainable collaborative optimization modeling method based on sd to achieve the coordination of water resource use socioeconomic benefits and ecological environmental effects however as one of the key limiting factors of cropping pattern adjustment water availability is directly affected by the changing environment which makes it highly random in addition fluctuations in socioeconomic policy and changes in field activities also affect cropping patterns future research will focus on considering the impact of uncertainty on the multidimensional collaborative

9402,there is scarce knowledge on what are the actual water requirements of persimmon trees diospyros kaki research on this topic is required to better adjust irrigation water supplies to the actual crop water needs this study aimed to determine the transpiration coefficients kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees and assess how transpiration and kp are influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions this was done over the course of three growing seasons by means of sap flow measurements calibrated with whole canopy gas exchange chambers irrigation was applied aiming to avoid water limiting conditions for trees this was verified by monitoring the trees water status across the growing seasons sap flow measurements were linearly and highly correlated p 0 001 with canopy transpiration ep obtained with the whole canopy chambers but either overestimated or underestimated it ep increased from april until june july in response to canopy development and increased midday canopy light interception there was a positive linear relationship between daily ep reference evapotranspiration eto and solar radiation however a non linear relationship was obtained between ep and vapor pressure deficit vpd a positive non linear relationship p 0 01 was observed between kp ep eto in non limited water conditions and vpd illustrating the low stomatal regulation that persimmon trees exhibit in response to air dryness kp varied over the growing seasons following the eto pattern although showing comparatively a slighter decrease during the last part of the growing season from june to september kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a midday photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted of 30 ranged from 0 45 to 0 56 a strong relationship was obtained between kp and percentage of midday intercepted par that can be used to estimate kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a range of ground canopy covers this information is useful for deriving specific water use models for persimmon trees to be implemented in decision support systems the monthly transpiration coefficients here provided will be useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling decisions in persimmon orchards and therefore irrigation water management keywords canopy gas exchange photosynthetically active radiation sap flow rojo brillante persimmon trees transpiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction persimmon diospyros kaki l f cultivation has traditionally been important in asia particularly in areas of korea and china where rainfall is often abundant and water availability is not a constraint for crop production in the last two decades however cultivation of persimmon trees has increased considerably in areas of the mediterranean basin to the point that in 2018 spain was ranked second among the persimmon producing countries of the world after china faostat 2018 one of the reasons for the current interest in the cultivation of persimmon trees in the mediterranean basin is the adoption of this crop as a profitable alternative for the cultivation of citrus trees which profitability is constantly threatened by market price fluctuations selection of new and highly productive cultivars like the cv rojo brillante has also contributed to the establishment of this crop in southeastern spain llácer and badenes 2009 the high productivity of persimmon rojo brillante trees compared to other varieties and the fact that the astringency of the fruit can be easily removed has recently made this cultivar attractive also to other persimmon producing countries such as australia oag 2017 unlike other persimmon growing areas the southeast of spain is a semiarid region where rainfall is scarce and water supplied with irrigation is crucial for achieving profitable yields that meet the quality standards while there has been extensive research on determining the water requirements of other fruit tree crops adapted to the mediterranean climatic conditions fereres et al 2012 rallo et al 2021 among others little is known about the water requirements of persimmon trees a widely adopted approach to estimate water requirements of crops for scheduling irrigation is the soil water balance model according to the methodology proposed by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao allen et al 1998 in the water balance method water consumption of crops namely crop evapotranspiration etc is estimated by multiplying the evapotranspiration of a reference crop eto which is obtained from meteorological data by a crop coefficient kc that varies with the specific characteristics of each crop and the rainfall frequency at the site at incomplete canopy cover in the case of persimmon trees there are no kc values reported in allen et al 1998 that could be used as a reference to estimate the water requirements of this crop to adjust irrigation accordingly recommended kc values have been only reported for persimmon triumph trees grafted onto diospyros virginiana in a study conducted in northern israel kanety et al 2014 however the water requirements of profitable varieties of interest such as the cultivar rojo brillante grafted onto diospyros lotus which is the main rootstock employed in the southeast of spain badenes et al 2015 has not yet been investigated methodologies such as the use of weighting lysimeters eddy covariance water or energy balance methods and sap flow measurements have been employed for the estimation of plant water consumption although useful for estimating the water use of crops all these methodologies present limitations ghiat et al 2021 nadezhdina et al 2007 in the study here presented transpiration of persimmon trees was estimated with sap flow sensors using the compensation heat pulse technique which was originally presented in swanson and whitfield 1981 this method was selected because it provides direct estimates of plant transpiration can be easily automated and allows recording data continuously for the whole growing season the heat pulse technique presents some uncertainties at different spatial levels it is based on some theoretical assumptions used to convert measured parameters to mass flow bleby et al 2004 smith and allen 1996 steppe et al 2010 furthermore this technique is subjected to varied sources of error such as probe misalignment and wound corrections among others forster 2017 as well as the azimuthal and radial variation in sap velocity usually observed in woody crops which generates errors at the time of integrating the velocity measured in each point of the trunk lópez bernal et al 2010 variability of the sap flow velocity in persimmon trees is unknown consequently sap flow techniques used for determining plant water use require local calibration in order to yield the real tree transpiration forster 2017 this is possible by comparing the flux calculated by sap flow probes with an alternative method to obtain reliable estimations of plant transpiration whole canopy gas exchange chambers provide estimates of plant transpiration without implying theoretical assumptions as those involved in the sap flow technique corelli grappadelli and magnanini 1993 although this method presents some inconveniences that prevent its use in the field for long periods it is a useful method to calibrate the sap flow measurements of individual trees on cloudless days ballester et al 2011 dragoni et al 2005 intrigliolo et al 2009 due to the cost of the equipment monitoring sap flow is only possible on a few trees variations in tree size crop load and other tree characteristics can affect tree transpiration consoli et al 2006 therefore caution should be taken when upscaling transpiration from individual trees to entire orchards in order to upscale results to the orchard scale remote sensing tools for instance could be useful to explore the relationship between tree canopy vigor characteristics and transpiration persimmon rojo brillante trees have been reported to be very sensitive to soil water deficit intrigliolo et al 2018 buesa et al 2013 observed that deficit irrigation did not reduce yield of persimmon rojo brillante trees in comparison to a treatment irrigated using a kc value close to 1 0 to ensure non limiting water conditions but significantly decrease fruit fresh weight and the economic return badal et al 2013 showed that timing of soil water deficit has a clear influence on fruit drop these authors recommended the implementation of deficit irrigation strategies late in spring to induce a moderate level of water stress in rojo brillante trees which was demonstrated to reduce fruit abscission and therefore increase the crop level of trees research on determining the actual water requirements of persimmon rojo brillante trees is required because it would enable growers to optimize water management of this crop but also to effectively design tailored deficit irrigation strategies aiming to increase the fruit crop level and yield badal et al 2013 or advance fruit ripening and harvest time intrigliolo et al 2018 because transpiration is the largest component of etc and evaporation rates can vary significantly among orchards depending on the soil management strategy followed accounting for the individual contribution of canopy transpiration to etc is crucial when studying the water requirements of a specific crop for a given environment the objectives of this study were to determine the transpiration coefficients of persimmon rojo brillante trees and assess how transpiration and the canopy evaporation component of kc is influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting monthly coefficients of transpiration for persimmon rojo brillante trees this work will contribute to increase the knowledge on persimmon water requirements which is essential for accurate irrigation scheduling and for making a sustainable use of the water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the sites the study was performed in two orchards planted with persimmon trees cv rojo brillante grafted onto diospyrus lotus for the 2010 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in 2010 measurements were conducted in a 0 52 ha commercial orchard located in manises valencia spain 39º 30 n 0º 30 w altitude 52 m of nine year old trees planted at a spacing of 5 5 m 4 0 m the soil at this orchard was calcareous of sandy loam to sandy clay loam texture with an effective depth of 0 8 m averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover of trees were 14 1 1 2 cm 9 1 2 1 m3 and 32 9 6 2 respectively the remaining two growing seasons the study was conducted in a 0 7 ha experimental orchard in liria valencia spain 39 º 42 n 0º 38 w elevation 300 m that was planted in 2009 in 2014 five year old trees sap flow measurements were conducted on trees with a spacing of 5 0 m 2 5 m and averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover of 8 7 0 2 cm 2 8 0 4 m3 and 14 8 2 5 respectively in 2015 sap flow was obtained from trees with a spacing of 5 0 m 3 5 m averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover were 10 1 0 6 cm 4 2 0 4 m3 and 16 2 1 8 at this site the soil calcareous fluvisol was of sandy loam texture with 32 by weight of stones and an effective depth of 0 8 m the climate in this area is typically mediterranean characterized by warm and dry summers mild winters and main rainfalls occurring during spring and autumn fig 1 illustrates monthly rainfall eto and average air temperatures tavg for the area where the study was conducted for 2010 2014 and 2015 july was the month with the highest eto 166 mm on average for the three years while the rainiest month differed from year to year may november and march in 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively annual eto ranged from 1055 mm in 2010 to 1197 mm in 2014 these values of annual eto were within the range of those registered in the area for the previous ten seasons eto 1067 mm annual rainfall in 2010 375 mm and 2015 422 mm were also close to the average annual rainfall for the previous ten years 401 mm in 2014 however annual rainfall was notably lower than in the other two years 275 mm at both sites trees were drip irrigated with two laterals per row and a total of eight non pressure compensating emitters of 4 l h 1 per tree azudrip compact azud alcantarilla murcia spain irrigation amounts applied were determined based on eto which was calculated according to allen et al 1998 with data measured in nearby meteorological stations and using presumably high monthly kc values that were chosen based on previous work badal et al 2013 buesa et al 2013 to make sure that water supplied to the trees was enough to meet their water requirements and prevent them from experiencing water stress this was corroborated by periodically monitoring the water status of trees across all seasons in 2010 kc values used from march to november were 0 19 0 45 0 56 0 71 0 90 0 96 1 01 0 84 and 0 52 in 2014 and 2015 kc was adjusted by the ground cover of trees according to the general formula relating tree water use and the canopy ground cover reported in fereres and goldhamer 1990 water flow meters were used to monitor irrigation inputs monthly data of eto rainfall and amount of irrigation water applied at each site and for each growing season is reported in table 1 2 2 sap flow measurements in each growing season the main trunk of four trees was instrumented with two sap flow gauges ias csic córdoba installed at approximately 0 20 m from the soil surface the method used to measure sap flow was a variant of the compensation heat pulse chp method that also uses the calibrated average gradient cag routine developed by testi and villalobos 2009 for low sap flow velocities each gauge was composed of two stainless steel probes provided with ultra thin thermocouples that measured temperature at 5 15 25 and 35 mm from the cambium located downstream 10 mm and upstream 5 mm of a linear heater the probes and heater were installed using a metallic guide with pre drilled holes and drilling bits of 2 0 mm external diameter heat pulse velocity values were corrected using an estimated wound size of 2 6 mm 2 0 mm 0 3 mm 2 according to barrett et al 1995 heat pulses of two seconds were applied every 15 min the temperature differences above below were measured during 10 s before the pulse to check the stability of the readings and assess the undisturbed gradient for the heat pulse method after the pulse differential temperature δt readings were averaged during 180 s the sap flow gauges were wired to a control box and a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc utah usa powered by a 12 v battery which was used to drive the pulses and store data every 15 min corrected heat pulse velocity vc was converted to sap flux density js cm h 1 according to becker and edwards 1999 using values of wood fm and water fl volumetric fractions of 0 51 and 0 41 respectively the volumetric fractions were obtained from wood samples of 5 mm diameter taken from 10 selected trees with a pressler type core sampler volumetric sap flux in the trunk was obtained by means of the weighted average method proposed by hatton et al 1990 in which the annular cross section of the tree is divided into n concentric annuli as many as the sensors placed at different depths so that the inner radius rk of annulus k occurs midway between sensors k and k 1 where k 1 n 1 numbered from the cambium the information from each k sensor is weighed by the proportion ρk of the total sapwood conducting area it represents ρ k r k 2 r k 1 2 a 2 b 2 1 where a is the radius at the cambium r0 a and b is the radius at the heartwood rn b 8 mm flux q was obtained as the weighted average of sap flux densities weighed by the area of sapwood associated with each sensor q k 1 n π r k 2 r k 1 2 j sap flow was obtained averaging data for the four trees monitored during each growing season daily sap flow values corresponded to a period of 24 h 2 3 canopy gas exchange custom design open chambers made of mylar plastic were used to measure the whole canopy gas exchange on 8 june 2010 22 october 2014 and 28 october 2015 and obtain transpiration of each individual tree equipped with sap flow gauges on clear sky conditions chambers were built in the laboratory to properly fit over the canopy of trees according to corelli grappadelli and magnanini 1993 the canopy chambers were sealed around the main trunk of trees and a constant airflow was forced to pass through them by means of a fan and pipe system for each chamber inlet airflow rates were monitored with an air velocity transmitter dwyer series 641 usa installed in a pipe at the entrance of the chamber and air temperature inside and outside the chambers was measured with type k thermocouples amidata s a madrid spain inlet and outlet water vapour was measured in each chamber with a co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7000 li cor biosciences lincoln usa a data logger cr1000 campbell scienctific inc was used to collect data from all sensors on a per minute basis the data acquisition system was capable to monitor the four trees sequentially measurements were taken in each chamber for three minutes with one minute buffer between chambers to allow the gas flow entering the gas analyzer to equilibrate in the new gas sample that is for a particular tree datalogger outputs were presented as three consecutive 1 min averages acquired every 16 min 4 trees 3 min collecting data 4 trees 1 min pause for the whole period of measurements whole plant transpiration ep mmol s 1 was calculated using the following equation e p u e h 2 o where δh2o is the difference in water vapour partial pressure between chamber outlet and inlet mbar and ue is the molar flow at the inlet mmol s 1 calculated as u e f 1 22 41 273 15 t p 1013 1000 60 where t is the air temperature ºk p the atmospheric pressure pa and f the volumetric flow at inlet l min 1 ep values obtained with the whole canopy chambers were plotted against sap flow measurements obtained for the same period data for periods when condensation was observed within the canopy chambers as it was the case in the 2015 growing season were excluded the relationship obtained was used to calibrate the sap flow measurements collected during the growing season the canopy evaporation component of kc kp was calculated as ep divided by eto 2 4 field determinations water status of trees equipped with sap flow gauges was monitored at 7 14 day intervals each growing season by measuring the stem water potential ψstem from may to november measurements were performed at solar noon with a scholander pressure chamber model 600 pressure chamber pms instrument company albany usa in two leaves per tree bagged in aluminium foil at least two hours before measurements were conducted tree canopy light interception was measured in 2010 and 2014 in six to eight cloudless days from march to september using an accupar linear photosynthetically active radiation par ceptometer decagon devices pullman wa usa percentage of light interception of each of the four sampled trees was determined at solar noon by taking measurements every 0 25 m within the canopy ground cover 2 5 statistical analysis the relationship between hourly ep and sap flow between daily ep and eto solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd and between kp and midday par and vpd was studied by linear regression analyses using the statistical software statgraphics centurion xvi 3 results the seasonal variation of ψstem for each growing season is illustrated in fig 2 maximum and minimum values of ψstem recorded in 2010 2014 and 2015 were 0 32 and 1 30 mpa 0 41 and 0 90 mpa and 0 38 and 0 70 mpa respectively values of ψstem below 1 10 mpa in persimmon rojo brillante trees are indicative of water stress badal et al 2010 this threshold was only surpassed in 2010 in one occasion on a date 27th of august when it was recorded the highest daily vpd of the growing season 3 83 kpa on this date ψstem in two of the four monitored trees reached more negative values than the threshold of 1 10 mpa the rest of the 2010 growing season and in 2014 and 2015 ψstem measurements were above 1 00 mpa the stem water potential measurements indicate that except for one day in 2010 trees did not experience water stress during the study and therefore water supply through irrigation was enough to meet their water requirements 3 1 transpiration ep comparison between ep obtained from the whole canopy gas exchange chambers and sap flow showed that these measurements were linearly and highly correlated r2 0 98 p 0 001 table 2 results showed there was a large variability among trees in the slope bo of the linear regression the slopes ranged from 0 73 to 1 13 in 2010 from 0 70 to 1 76 in 2014 and from 1 23 to 4 67 in 2015 sap flow probes underestimated bo 1 tree transpiration in half of the monitored trees and overestimated it in the other half table 2 the relationship obtained between transpiration and sap flow measurements on individual days was used to calibrate the continuous sap flow measurements conducted during each season the eto was higher in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons maximum eto of 7 3 and 8 0 mm respectively than in 2010 maximum eto of 6 3 mm when daily eto surpassed the 6 0 mm only on one occasion fig 3a 4 a and 5a assessment of ep across the growing seasons showed that in all cases transpiration notably varied following the eto pattern figs 3ab 4 ab and 5 ab ep was very low early in the season when canopy development started and it was not until mid april doy 106 that reached values higher than 1 mm day 1 since then ep increased progressively until july doy 182 212 when trees reached full canopy cover by the end of each growing season there was a progressive decline in ep which coincides with the decrease in eto and the typical canopy senescence of deciduous trees maximum daily ep values of 3 6 mm doy 239 3 2 mm doy 165 and 4 2 mm doy 188 were registered in 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively these maximum daily ep values corresponded with days of high vpd figs 3b 4b and 5b 3 2 relationships between daily ep and eto solar radiation and vpd fig 6 illustrates the relationships obtained between ep and eto solar radiation and vpd obtained from july to october when trees had reached full canopy development results show that ep was linearly and well correlated with daily eto and solar radiation the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the relationship between ep and eto ranged from 0 87 to 0 98 the relationship between ep and solar radiation yielded r2 values that ranged from 0 78 to 0 98 vpd was positively and well correlated r2 ranging from 0 72 to 0 82 with ep in this case however and contrary to that observed for eto and solar radiation data were best fitted by a polynomial curve daily vpd recorded for the period when trees had reached full canopy development ranged between 0 17 and 3 83 kpa with most days having values below 2 5 kpa fig 6 transpiration of persimmon rojo brillante trees peaked around vpd values of 2 5 kpa and did not significantly increase any further 3 3 transpiration coefficient kp ep eto daily kp increased progressively during spring in response to canopy development and increased percentage of midday intercepted par figs 3c 4c and 5c once trees reached full canopy size within each growing season kp remained stable until the end of the year when it started to decrease due to leaf senescence and fall maximum daily kp values for the 2010 2014 and 2015 growing seasons were 0 67 doy 244 0 61 doy 297 and 0 71 doy 261 respectively the monthly kp values obtained in each growing season are shown in table 3 the average kp for the months from july when trees reached full canopy development to october were 0 53 in 2010 0 40 in 2014 and 0 48 in 2015 the highest transpiration coefficients were obtained in 2010 when the monitored trees were 3 4 years older and had a higher canopy volume thus higher intercepted par and water requirements than trees monitored in 2014 and 2015 the lowest kp values were obtained in 2014 fig 7 shows the linear relationship obtained between daily kp and percentage of midday intercepted par when data for the 2010 and 2014 growing seasons were plotted together percentage of midday intercepted par was not measured in 2015 these parameters were significantly p 0 001 r2 0 84 and positively correlated midday intercepted par varied over the seasons between 4 6 and 30 1 these values of midday intercepted par corresponded with kp values of 0 02 and 0 53 respectively a positive significant p 0 01 and non linear relationship was found between kp and vpd within each growing season on cloud free days net radiation 250 w m 2 when trees had reached full canopy development fig 8 4 discussion the stem water potential measurements indicated that irrigation supplied to the trees during the study was enough to meet their water requirements preventing them from experiencing water stress which would have compromised the outcomes of the study 4 1 transpiration of persimmon rojo brillante trees the high correlation observed between ep transpiration measured with the whole canopy chambers and sap flow measurements at specific dates enabled determining canopy transpiration of persimmon trees for the three seasons high correlations between sap flow measurements and ep obtained with whole canopy gas exchange chambers have been reported for other crops such as citrus grapevines and apples ballester et al 2011 dragoni et al 2005 intrigliolo et al 2009 in all these studies sap flow measurements either overestimated or underestimated canopy transpiration of individual trees which was attributed to the large variability often found in azimuthal and radial sap velocity in woody crops fernández et al 2001 lópez bernal et al 2010 nadezhdina et al 2007 the fact that in our study sap flow measurements underestimated canopy transpiration in some trees and overestimated it in others the averaged mean square error ranged from 0 04 to 1 80 l h 1 would suggest there is a significant variation in sap flux in the xylem of persimmon trees this was supported by the large variation observed in the slope of the linear regression obtained from the relationship between sap flow and ep table 2 large variability has been reported also for citrus trees ballester et al 2011 and grapevines intrigliolo et al 2009 with slope values ranging from 1 35 to 4 09 and from 0 91 to 2 86 respectively overall these results highlight that sap flow measurements of persimmon trees must be calibrated with alternative methods when attempting to determine canopy transpiration unless a substantial number of probes is used per tree 4 2 influence of environmental factors and the atmospheric demand on transpiration fruit trees in orchards are in general well coupled with the atmosphere thus water consumption of trees is not only dependent on the radiation load but also on the vapour pressure deficit wind speed and canopy conductance regulations to the environmental and tree conditions jarvis 1985 the linear correlation observed between ep and eto at full canopy size illustrated in fig 6 is in contrast with the non linear relationship reported for orange trees ballester et al 2013 this difference could be due to the high stomatal regulation generally attributed to citrus trees in response to increased evaporative demanding conditions carr 2012 flore and lakso 1989 as opposed to that observed in persimmon trees the close relationship observed between ep and eto in the study here presented contrasts with the results obtained by kanety et al 2014 for persimmon trees cv triumph in northern israel in kanety et al 2014 ep and eto peaked at the same time in the season around july however eto declined sharply thereafter whereas ep showed a slightly and more gradual decrease despite eto having a similar pattern in northern israel than in the southeast of spain higher eto values were generally reported in the former for instance mean daily eto for august september and october in the present study was on average for the three years 4 6 3 4 and 2 2 mm respectively daily eto values reported in kanety et al 2014 for the same months were 5 3 4 5 and 3 3 mm the different patterns of water consumption observed in these studies could be due to the lower eto and air temperature values registered in fall in the southeast of spain compared to the north of israel nevertheless it could be also attributed to differences in seasonal vegetative growth patterns between the cultivars studied in each case triumph and rojo brillante a non linear relationship was observed between daily ep and vpd that could have different interpretations fig 6 one could be that leaf stomata responded to the high vpd reducing stomatal conductance and thus transpiration grossiord et al 2020 other interpretation could be that notwithstanding soil moisture was not a limiting factor in any growing season as indicated by the plant water status measurements the capacity of the root system to uptake water from the soil could have been not enough to meet the water requirements of trees on days with high water demand conditions vpd 2 5 kpa these interpretations are not exclusive and probably most times the two processes act together 4 3 transpiration coefficients the seasonal pattern of kp observed in our study differs from that reported in kanety et al 2014 in that kp considerably increased in the last part of the season in kanety et al 2014 while it slightly decreased in our study the main reason for the different patterns observed in kp between studies is the gradual and slight decrease in ep observed during the last part of the season in kanety et al 2014 as opposed to the relatively sharp decrease observed in the current study the ep increased progressively in relation to the eto in response to canopy development and increased percentage of midday intercepted par from the regression illustrated in fig 7 and if linearity holds for the range of data not explored it can be inferred that persimmon rojo brillante trees will have a kp of 1 0 at a percentage of intercepted par at midday of 55 similar results have been reported for apples kc 1 185 at 55 of intercepted par at midday in girona et al 2011 higher kp values were generally observed on days with a higher evaporative demand like it has been reported for dwarf royal empire apple trees in dragoni et al 2005 the contrary that is reductions in kp in response to high air dryness levels has been reported for crops such as grapevines intrigliolo et al 2009 citrus ballester et al 2013 oguntunde et al 2007 villalobos et al 2009 and olive trees moriana et al 2002 the positive correlation showed in fig 8 kp increasing with vpd would suggest that persimmon trees transpire comparatively more than grass under conditions of high evaporative demand this however cannot be directly related to the stomatal conductance because of the differences in canopy architecture and boundary layer properties around the leaves of grass and persimmon trees grass is short smooth and has a dense canopy where wind cannot easily enter through the leaves and carry the water vapour and heat away persimmon trees as opposed to grass have tall rough and sparse canopies well coupled with the atmosphere and therefore more exposed than grass to the effects of vpd it is important to note that soil evaporation was not measured in this study only canopy evaporation and thus kc of persimmon rojo brillante trees was not obtained for this dataset therefore soil evaporation would need to be accounted for when considering the use of the monthly kp values here presented for scheduling irrigation in persimmon trees soil evaporation varies over the growing season depending mainly on ground cover and rainfall as an indication of the contribution that soil evaporation may have on etc studies conducted on citrus orchards in the southeast of spain have reported values between 8 and 40 and 50 64 in dry and wet conditions rain events respectively castel et al 1987 villalobos et al 2009 values of soil evaporation of up to 30 have been reported for drip irrigated grapevines for the middle of the growing season lópez urrea et al 2020 5 conclusion this study determined monthly transpiration coefficients of persimmon rojo brillante trees which had not been previously reported in the literature it also assessed how transpiration is influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions water use of persimmon trees follows tightly the seasonal course of eto increasing as the canopy develops and decreasing in the last part of the growing season water consumption of persimmon trees in relation to eto transpiration coefficient kp increases with increased percentage of canopy light intercepted and remains quite stable at full canopy size in this study trees with midday intercepted par of 30 had monthly values of kp that ranged from 0 45 to 0 56 from june to september the strong relationship obtained between kp and percentage of midday intercepted par illustrated in fig 7 can be used to estimate kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a range of ground canopy covers this relationship indicates that water consumption of persimmon rojo brillante trees would match eto at a percentage of midday intercepted par of 55 these data could be then useful for deriving specific water use models for persimmon trees to be implemented in decision support systems the positive relationship observed between kp and vpd evidences the lower stomatal regulation that persimmon trees exhibit in comparison to other crops such as citrus this also suggests that persimmon rojo brillante trees might be very sensitive to soil water deficit the monthly transpiration coefficients here provided will be useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling decisions in persimmon orchards and therefore

9402,there is scarce knowledge on what are the actual water requirements of persimmon trees diospyros kaki research on this topic is required to better adjust irrigation water supplies to the actual crop water needs this study aimed to determine the transpiration coefficients kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees and assess how transpiration and kp are influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions this was done over the course of three growing seasons by means of sap flow measurements calibrated with whole canopy gas exchange chambers irrigation was applied aiming to avoid water limiting conditions for trees this was verified by monitoring the trees water status across the growing seasons sap flow measurements were linearly and highly correlated p 0 001 with canopy transpiration ep obtained with the whole canopy chambers but either overestimated or underestimated it ep increased from april until june july in response to canopy development and increased midday canopy light interception there was a positive linear relationship between daily ep reference evapotranspiration eto and solar radiation however a non linear relationship was obtained between ep and vapor pressure deficit vpd a positive non linear relationship p 0 01 was observed between kp ep eto in non limited water conditions and vpd illustrating the low stomatal regulation that persimmon trees exhibit in response to air dryness kp varied over the growing seasons following the eto pattern although showing comparatively a slighter decrease during the last part of the growing season from june to september kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a midday photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted of 30 ranged from 0 45 to 0 56 a strong relationship was obtained between kp and percentage of midday intercepted par that can be used to estimate kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a range of ground canopy covers this information is useful for deriving specific water use models for persimmon trees to be implemented in decision support systems the monthly transpiration coefficients here provided will be useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling decisions in persimmon orchards and therefore irrigation water management keywords canopy gas exchange photosynthetically active radiation sap flow rojo brillante persimmon trees transpiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction persimmon diospyros kaki l f cultivation has traditionally been important in asia particularly in areas of korea and china where rainfall is often abundant and water availability is not a constraint for crop production in the last two decades however cultivation of persimmon trees has increased considerably in areas of the mediterranean basin to the point that in 2018 spain was ranked second among the persimmon producing countries of the world after china faostat 2018 one of the reasons for the current interest in the cultivation of persimmon trees in the mediterranean basin is the adoption of this crop as a profitable alternative for the cultivation of citrus trees which profitability is constantly threatened by market price fluctuations selection of new and highly productive cultivars like the cv rojo brillante has also contributed to the establishment of this crop in southeastern spain llácer and badenes 2009 the high productivity of persimmon rojo brillante trees compared to other varieties and the fact that the astringency of the fruit can be easily removed has recently made this cultivar attractive also to other persimmon producing countries such as australia oag 2017 unlike other persimmon growing areas the southeast of spain is a semiarid region where rainfall is scarce and water supplied with irrigation is crucial for achieving profitable yields that meet the quality standards while there has been extensive research on determining the water requirements of other fruit tree crops adapted to the mediterranean climatic conditions fereres et al 2012 rallo et al 2021 among others little is known about the water requirements of persimmon trees a widely adopted approach to estimate water requirements of crops for scheduling irrigation is the soil water balance model according to the methodology proposed by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao allen et al 1998 in the water balance method water consumption of crops namely crop evapotranspiration etc is estimated by multiplying the evapotranspiration of a reference crop eto which is obtained from meteorological data by a crop coefficient kc that varies with the specific characteristics of each crop and the rainfall frequency at the site at incomplete canopy cover in the case of persimmon trees there are no kc values reported in allen et al 1998 that could be used as a reference to estimate the water requirements of this crop to adjust irrigation accordingly recommended kc values have been only reported for persimmon triumph trees grafted onto diospyros virginiana in a study conducted in northern israel kanety et al 2014 however the water requirements of profitable varieties of interest such as the cultivar rojo brillante grafted onto diospyros lotus which is the main rootstock employed in the southeast of spain badenes et al 2015 has not yet been investigated methodologies such as the use of weighting lysimeters eddy covariance water or energy balance methods and sap flow measurements have been employed for the estimation of plant water consumption although useful for estimating the water use of crops all these methodologies present limitations ghiat et al 2021 nadezhdina et al 2007 in the study here presented transpiration of persimmon trees was estimated with sap flow sensors using the compensation heat pulse technique which was originally presented in swanson and whitfield 1981 this method was selected because it provides direct estimates of plant transpiration can be easily automated and allows recording data continuously for the whole growing season the heat pulse technique presents some uncertainties at different spatial levels it is based on some theoretical assumptions used to convert measured parameters to mass flow bleby et al 2004 smith and allen 1996 steppe et al 2010 furthermore this technique is subjected to varied sources of error such as probe misalignment and wound corrections among others forster 2017 as well as the azimuthal and radial variation in sap velocity usually observed in woody crops which generates errors at the time of integrating the velocity measured in each point of the trunk lópez bernal et al 2010 variability of the sap flow velocity in persimmon trees is unknown consequently sap flow techniques used for determining plant water use require local calibration in order to yield the real tree transpiration forster 2017 this is possible by comparing the flux calculated by sap flow probes with an alternative method to obtain reliable estimations of plant transpiration whole canopy gas exchange chambers provide estimates of plant transpiration without implying theoretical assumptions as those involved in the sap flow technique corelli grappadelli and magnanini 1993 although this method presents some inconveniences that prevent its use in the field for long periods it is a useful method to calibrate the sap flow measurements of individual trees on cloudless days ballester et al 2011 dragoni et al 2005 intrigliolo et al 2009 due to the cost of the equipment monitoring sap flow is only possible on a few trees variations in tree size crop load and other tree characteristics can affect tree transpiration consoli et al 2006 therefore caution should be taken when upscaling transpiration from individual trees to entire orchards in order to upscale results to the orchard scale remote sensing tools for instance could be useful to explore the relationship between tree canopy vigor characteristics and transpiration persimmon rojo brillante trees have been reported to be very sensitive to soil water deficit intrigliolo et al 2018 buesa et al 2013 observed that deficit irrigation did not reduce yield of persimmon rojo brillante trees in comparison to a treatment irrigated using a kc value close to 1 0 to ensure non limiting water conditions but significantly decrease fruit fresh weight and the economic return badal et al 2013 showed that timing of soil water deficit has a clear influence on fruit drop these authors recommended the implementation of deficit irrigation strategies late in spring to induce a moderate level of water stress in rojo brillante trees which was demonstrated to reduce fruit abscission and therefore increase the crop level of trees research on determining the actual water requirements of persimmon rojo brillante trees is required because it would enable growers to optimize water management of this crop but also to effectively design tailored deficit irrigation strategies aiming to increase the fruit crop level and yield badal et al 2013 or advance fruit ripening and harvest time intrigliolo et al 2018 because transpiration is the largest component of etc and evaporation rates can vary significantly among orchards depending on the soil management strategy followed accounting for the individual contribution of canopy transpiration to etc is crucial when studying the water requirements of a specific crop for a given environment the objectives of this study were to determine the transpiration coefficients of persimmon rojo brillante trees and assess how transpiration and the canopy evaporation component of kc is influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting monthly coefficients of transpiration for persimmon rojo brillante trees this work will contribute to increase the knowledge on persimmon water requirements which is essential for accurate irrigation scheduling and for making a sustainable use of the water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the sites the study was performed in two orchards planted with persimmon trees cv rojo brillante grafted onto diospyrus lotus for the 2010 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in 2010 measurements were conducted in a 0 52 ha commercial orchard located in manises valencia spain 39º 30 n 0º 30 w altitude 52 m of nine year old trees planted at a spacing of 5 5 m 4 0 m the soil at this orchard was calcareous of sandy loam to sandy clay loam texture with an effective depth of 0 8 m averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover of trees were 14 1 1 2 cm 9 1 2 1 m3 and 32 9 6 2 respectively the remaining two growing seasons the study was conducted in a 0 7 ha experimental orchard in liria valencia spain 39 º 42 n 0º 38 w elevation 300 m that was planted in 2009 in 2014 five year old trees sap flow measurements were conducted on trees with a spacing of 5 0 m 2 5 m and averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover of 8 7 0 2 cm 2 8 0 4 m3 and 14 8 2 5 respectively in 2015 sap flow was obtained from trees with a spacing of 5 0 m 3 5 m averaged trunk diameter canopy volume and ground cover were 10 1 0 6 cm 4 2 0 4 m3 and 16 2 1 8 at this site the soil calcareous fluvisol was of sandy loam texture with 32 by weight of stones and an effective depth of 0 8 m the climate in this area is typically mediterranean characterized by warm and dry summers mild winters and main rainfalls occurring during spring and autumn fig 1 illustrates monthly rainfall eto and average air temperatures tavg for the area where the study was conducted for 2010 2014 and 2015 july was the month with the highest eto 166 mm on average for the three years while the rainiest month differed from year to year may november and march in 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively annual eto ranged from 1055 mm in 2010 to 1197 mm in 2014 these values of annual eto were within the range of those registered in the area for the previous ten seasons eto 1067 mm annual rainfall in 2010 375 mm and 2015 422 mm were also close to the average annual rainfall for the previous ten years 401 mm in 2014 however annual rainfall was notably lower than in the other two years 275 mm at both sites trees were drip irrigated with two laterals per row and a total of eight non pressure compensating emitters of 4 l h 1 per tree azudrip compact azud alcantarilla murcia spain irrigation amounts applied were determined based on eto which was calculated according to allen et al 1998 with data measured in nearby meteorological stations and using presumably high monthly kc values that were chosen based on previous work badal et al 2013 buesa et al 2013 to make sure that water supplied to the trees was enough to meet their water requirements and prevent them from experiencing water stress this was corroborated by periodically monitoring the water status of trees across all seasons in 2010 kc values used from march to november were 0 19 0 45 0 56 0 71 0 90 0 96 1 01 0 84 and 0 52 in 2014 and 2015 kc was adjusted by the ground cover of trees according to the general formula relating tree water use and the canopy ground cover reported in fereres and goldhamer 1990 water flow meters were used to monitor irrigation inputs monthly data of eto rainfall and amount of irrigation water applied at each site and for each growing season is reported in table 1 2 2 sap flow measurements in each growing season the main trunk of four trees was instrumented with two sap flow gauges ias csic córdoba installed at approximately 0 20 m from the soil surface the method used to measure sap flow was a variant of the compensation heat pulse chp method that also uses the calibrated average gradient cag routine developed by testi and villalobos 2009 for low sap flow velocities each gauge was composed of two stainless steel probes provided with ultra thin thermocouples that measured temperature at 5 15 25 and 35 mm from the cambium located downstream 10 mm and upstream 5 mm of a linear heater the probes and heater were installed using a metallic guide with pre drilled holes and drilling bits of 2 0 mm external diameter heat pulse velocity values were corrected using an estimated wound size of 2 6 mm 2 0 mm 0 3 mm 2 according to barrett et al 1995 heat pulses of two seconds were applied every 15 min the temperature differences above below were measured during 10 s before the pulse to check the stability of the readings and assess the undisturbed gradient for the heat pulse method after the pulse differential temperature δt readings were averaged during 180 s the sap flow gauges were wired to a control box and a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc utah usa powered by a 12 v battery which was used to drive the pulses and store data every 15 min corrected heat pulse velocity vc was converted to sap flux density js cm h 1 according to becker and edwards 1999 using values of wood fm and water fl volumetric fractions of 0 51 and 0 41 respectively the volumetric fractions were obtained from wood samples of 5 mm diameter taken from 10 selected trees with a pressler type core sampler volumetric sap flux in the trunk was obtained by means of the weighted average method proposed by hatton et al 1990 in which the annular cross section of the tree is divided into n concentric annuli as many as the sensors placed at different depths so that the inner radius rk of annulus k occurs midway between sensors k and k 1 where k 1 n 1 numbered from the cambium the information from each k sensor is weighed by the proportion ρk of the total sapwood conducting area it represents ρ k r k 2 r k 1 2 a 2 b 2 1 where a is the radius at the cambium r0 a and b is the radius at the heartwood rn b 8 mm flux q was obtained as the weighted average of sap flux densities weighed by the area of sapwood associated with each sensor q k 1 n π r k 2 r k 1 2 j sap flow was obtained averaging data for the four trees monitored during each growing season daily sap flow values corresponded to a period of 24 h 2 3 canopy gas exchange custom design open chambers made of mylar plastic were used to measure the whole canopy gas exchange on 8 june 2010 22 october 2014 and 28 october 2015 and obtain transpiration of each individual tree equipped with sap flow gauges on clear sky conditions chambers were built in the laboratory to properly fit over the canopy of trees according to corelli grappadelli and magnanini 1993 the canopy chambers were sealed around the main trunk of trees and a constant airflow was forced to pass through them by means of a fan and pipe system for each chamber inlet airflow rates were monitored with an air velocity transmitter dwyer series 641 usa installed in a pipe at the entrance of the chamber and air temperature inside and outside the chambers was measured with type k thermocouples amidata s a madrid spain inlet and outlet water vapour was measured in each chamber with a co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7000 li cor biosciences lincoln usa a data logger cr1000 campbell scienctific inc was used to collect data from all sensors on a per minute basis the data acquisition system was capable to monitor the four trees sequentially measurements were taken in each chamber for three minutes with one minute buffer between chambers to allow the gas flow entering the gas analyzer to equilibrate in the new gas sample that is for a particular tree datalogger outputs were presented as three consecutive 1 min averages acquired every 16 min 4 trees 3 min collecting data 4 trees 1 min pause for the whole period of measurements whole plant transpiration ep mmol s 1 was calculated using the following equation e p u e h 2 o where δh2o is the difference in water vapour partial pressure between chamber outlet and inlet mbar and ue is the molar flow at the inlet mmol s 1 calculated as u e f 1 22 41 273 15 t p 1013 1000 60 where t is the air temperature ºk p the atmospheric pressure pa and f the volumetric flow at inlet l min 1 ep values obtained with the whole canopy chambers were plotted against sap flow measurements obtained for the same period data for periods when condensation was observed within the canopy chambers as it was the case in the 2015 growing season were excluded the relationship obtained was used to calibrate the sap flow measurements collected during the growing season the canopy evaporation component of kc kp was calculated as ep divided by eto 2 4 field determinations water status of trees equipped with sap flow gauges was monitored at 7 14 day intervals each growing season by measuring the stem water potential ψstem from may to november measurements were performed at solar noon with a scholander pressure chamber model 600 pressure chamber pms instrument company albany usa in two leaves per tree bagged in aluminium foil at least two hours before measurements were conducted tree canopy light interception was measured in 2010 and 2014 in six to eight cloudless days from march to september using an accupar linear photosynthetically active radiation par ceptometer decagon devices pullman wa usa percentage of light interception of each of the four sampled trees was determined at solar noon by taking measurements every 0 25 m within the canopy ground cover 2 5 statistical analysis the relationship between hourly ep and sap flow between daily ep and eto solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd and between kp and midday par and vpd was studied by linear regression analyses using the statistical software statgraphics centurion xvi 3 results the seasonal variation of ψstem for each growing season is illustrated in fig 2 maximum and minimum values of ψstem recorded in 2010 2014 and 2015 were 0 32 and 1 30 mpa 0 41 and 0 90 mpa and 0 38 and 0 70 mpa respectively values of ψstem below 1 10 mpa in persimmon rojo brillante trees are indicative of water stress badal et al 2010 this threshold was only surpassed in 2010 in one occasion on a date 27th of august when it was recorded the highest daily vpd of the growing season 3 83 kpa on this date ψstem in two of the four monitored trees reached more negative values than the threshold of 1 10 mpa the rest of the 2010 growing season and in 2014 and 2015 ψstem measurements were above 1 00 mpa the stem water potential measurements indicate that except for one day in 2010 trees did not experience water stress during the study and therefore water supply through irrigation was enough to meet their water requirements 3 1 transpiration ep comparison between ep obtained from the whole canopy gas exchange chambers and sap flow showed that these measurements were linearly and highly correlated r2 0 98 p 0 001 table 2 results showed there was a large variability among trees in the slope bo of the linear regression the slopes ranged from 0 73 to 1 13 in 2010 from 0 70 to 1 76 in 2014 and from 1 23 to 4 67 in 2015 sap flow probes underestimated bo 1 tree transpiration in half of the monitored trees and overestimated it in the other half table 2 the relationship obtained between transpiration and sap flow measurements on individual days was used to calibrate the continuous sap flow measurements conducted during each season the eto was higher in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons maximum eto of 7 3 and 8 0 mm respectively than in 2010 maximum eto of 6 3 mm when daily eto surpassed the 6 0 mm only on one occasion fig 3a 4 a and 5a assessment of ep across the growing seasons showed that in all cases transpiration notably varied following the eto pattern figs 3ab 4 ab and 5 ab ep was very low early in the season when canopy development started and it was not until mid april doy 106 that reached values higher than 1 mm day 1 since then ep increased progressively until july doy 182 212 when trees reached full canopy cover by the end of each growing season there was a progressive decline in ep which coincides with the decrease in eto and the typical canopy senescence of deciduous trees maximum daily ep values of 3 6 mm doy 239 3 2 mm doy 165 and 4 2 mm doy 188 were registered in 2010 2014 and 2015 respectively these maximum daily ep values corresponded with days of high vpd figs 3b 4b and 5b 3 2 relationships between daily ep and eto solar radiation and vpd fig 6 illustrates the relationships obtained between ep and eto solar radiation and vpd obtained from july to october when trees had reached full canopy development results show that ep was linearly and well correlated with daily eto and solar radiation the coefficient of determination r2 obtained for the relationship between ep and eto ranged from 0 87 to 0 98 the relationship between ep and solar radiation yielded r2 values that ranged from 0 78 to 0 98 vpd was positively and well correlated r2 ranging from 0 72 to 0 82 with ep in this case however and contrary to that observed for eto and solar radiation data were best fitted by a polynomial curve daily vpd recorded for the period when trees had reached full canopy development ranged between 0 17 and 3 83 kpa with most days having values below 2 5 kpa fig 6 transpiration of persimmon rojo brillante trees peaked around vpd values of 2 5 kpa and did not significantly increase any further 3 3 transpiration coefficient kp ep eto daily kp increased progressively during spring in response to canopy development and increased percentage of midday intercepted par figs 3c 4c and 5c once trees reached full canopy size within each growing season kp remained stable until the end of the year when it started to decrease due to leaf senescence and fall maximum daily kp values for the 2010 2014 and 2015 growing seasons were 0 67 doy 244 0 61 doy 297 and 0 71 doy 261 respectively the monthly kp values obtained in each growing season are shown in table 3 the average kp for the months from july when trees reached full canopy development to october were 0 53 in 2010 0 40 in 2014 and 0 48 in 2015 the highest transpiration coefficients were obtained in 2010 when the monitored trees were 3 4 years older and had a higher canopy volume thus higher intercepted par and water requirements than trees monitored in 2014 and 2015 the lowest kp values were obtained in 2014 fig 7 shows the linear relationship obtained between daily kp and percentage of midday intercepted par when data for the 2010 and 2014 growing seasons were plotted together percentage of midday intercepted par was not measured in 2015 these parameters were significantly p 0 001 r2 0 84 and positively correlated midday intercepted par varied over the seasons between 4 6 and 30 1 these values of midday intercepted par corresponded with kp values of 0 02 and 0 53 respectively a positive significant p 0 01 and non linear relationship was found between kp and vpd within each growing season on cloud free days net radiation 250 w m 2 when trees had reached full canopy development fig 8 4 discussion the stem water potential measurements indicated that irrigation supplied to the trees during the study was enough to meet their water requirements preventing them from experiencing water stress which would have compromised the outcomes of the study 4 1 transpiration of persimmon rojo brillante trees the high correlation observed between ep transpiration measured with the whole canopy chambers and sap flow measurements at specific dates enabled determining canopy transpiration of persimmon trees for the three seasons high correlations between sap flow measurements and ep obtained with whole canopy gas exchange chambers have been reported for other crops such as citrus grapevines and apples ballester et al 2011 dragoni et al 2005 intrigliolo et al 2009 in all these studies sap flow measurements either overestimated or underestimated canopy transpiration of individual trees which was attributed to the large variability often found in azimuthal and radial sap velocity in woody crops fernández et al 2001 lópez bernal et al 2010 nadezhdina et al 2007 the fact that in our study sap flow measurements underestimated canopy transpiration in some trees and overestimated it in others the averaged mean square error ranged from 0 04 to 1 80 l h 1 would suggest there is a significant variation in sap flux in the xylem of persimmon trees this was supported by the large variation observed in the slope of the linear regression obtained from the relationship between sap flow and ep table 2 large variability has been reported also for citrus trees ballester et al 2011 and grapevines intrigliolo et al 2009 with slope values ranging from 1 35 to 4 09 and from 0 91 to 2 86 respectively overall these results highlight that sap flow measurements of persimmon trees must be calibrated with alternative methods when attempting to determine canopy transpiration unless a substantial number of probes is used per tree 4 2 influence of environmental factors and the atmospheric demand on transpiration fruit trees in orchards are in general well coupled with the atmosphere thus water consumption of trees is not only dependent on the radiation load but also on the vapour pressure deficit wind speed and canopy conductance regulations to the environmental and tree conditions jarvis 1985 the linear correlation observed between ep and eto at full canopy size illustrated in fig 6 is in contrast with the non linear relationship reported for orange trees ballester et al 2013 this difference could be due to the high stomatal regulation generally attributed to citrus trees in response to increased evaporative demanding conditions carr 2012 flore and lakso 1989 as opposed to that observed in persimmon trees the close relationship observed between ep and eto in the study here presented contrasts with the results obtained by kanety et al 2014 for persimmon trees cv triumph in northern israel in kanety et al 2014 ep and eto peaked at the same time in the season around july however eto declined sharply thereafter whereas ep showed a slightly and more gradual decrease despite eto having a similar pattern in northern israel than in the southeast of spain higher eto values were generally reported in the former for instance mean daily eto for august september and october in the present study was on average for the three years 4 6 3 4 and 2 2 mm respectively daily eto values reported in kanety et al 2014 for the same months were 5 3 4 5 and 3 3 mm the different patterns of water consumption observed in these studies could be due to the lower eto and air temperature values registered in fall in the southeast of spain compared to the north of israel nevertheless it could be also attributed to differences in seasonal vegetative growth patterns between the cultivars studied in each case triumph and rojo brillante a non linear relationship was observed between daily ep and vpd that could have different interpretations fig 6 one could be that leaf stomata responded to the high vpd reducing stomatal conductance and thus transpiration grossiord et al 2020 other interpretation could be that notwithstanding soil moisture was not a limiting factor in any growing season as indicated by the plant water status measurements the capacity of the root system to uptake water from the soil could have been not enough to meet the water requirements of trees on days with high water demand conditions vpd 2 5 kpa these interpretations are not exclusive and probably most times the two processes act together 4 3 transpiration coefficients the seasonal pattern of kp observed in our study differs from that reported in kanety et al 2014 in that kp considerably increased in the last part of the season in kanety et al 2014 while it slightly decreased in our study the main reason for the different patterns observed in kp between studies is the gradual and slight decrease in ep observed during the last part of the season in kanety et al 2014 as opposed to the relatively sharp decrease observed in the current study the ep increased progressively in relation to the eto in response to canopy development and increased percentage of midday intercepted par from the regression illustrated in fig 7 and if linearity holds for the range of data not explored it can be inferred that persimmon rojo brillante trees will have a kp of 1 0 at a percentage of intercepted par at midday of 55 similar results have been reported for apples kc 1 185 at 55 of intercepted par at midday in girona et al 2011 higher kp values were generally observed on days with a higher evaporative demand like it has been reported for dwarf royal empire apple trees in dragoni et al 2005 the contrary that is reductions in kp in response to high air dryness levels has been reported for crops such as grapevines intrigliolo et al 2009 citrus ballester et al 2013 oguntunde et al 2007 villalobos et al 2009 and olive trees moriana et al 2002 the positive correlation showed in fig 8 kp increasing with vpd would suggest that persimmon trees transpire comparatively more than grass under conditions of high evaporative demand this however cannot be directly related to the stomatal conductance because of the differences in canopy architecture and boundary layer properties around the leaves of grass and persimmon trees grass is short smooth and has a dense canopy where wind cannot easily enter through the leaves and carry the water vapour and heat away persimmon trees as opposed to grass have tall rough and sparse canopies well coupled with the atmosphere and therefore more exposed than grass to the effects of vpd it is important to note that soil evaporation was not measured in this study only canopy evaporation and thus kc of persimmon rojo brillante trees was not obtained for this dataset therefore soil evaporation would need to be accounted for when considering the use of the monthly kp values here presented for scheduling irrigation in persimmon trees soil evaporation varies over the growing season depending mainly on ground cover and rainfall as an indication of the contribution that soil evaporation may have on etc studies conducted on citrus orchards in the southeast of spain have reported values between 8 and 40 and 50 64 in dry and wet conditions rain events respectively castel et al 1987 villalobos et al 2009 values of soil evaporation of up to 30 have been reported for drip irrigated grapevines for the middle of the growing season lópez urrea et al 2020 5 conclusion this study determined monthly transpiration coefficients of persimmon rojo brillante trees which had not been previously reported in the literature it also assessed how transpiration is influenced by environmental factors and the atmospheric demand under mediterranean climatic conditions water use of persimmon trees follows tightly the seasonal course of eto increasing as the canopy develops and decreasing in the last part of the growing season water consumption of persimmon trees in relation to eto transpiration coefficient kp increases with increased percentage of canopy light intercepted and remains quite stable at full canopy size in this study trees with midday intercepted par of 30 had monthly values of kp that ranged from 0 45 to 0 56 from june to september the strong relationship obtained between kp and percentage of midday intercepted par illustrated in fig 7 can be used to estimate kp of persimmon rojo brillante trees with a range of ground canopy covers this relationship indicates that water consumption of persimmon rojo brillante trees would match eto at a percentage of midday intercepted par of 55 these data could be then useful for deriving specific water use models for persimmon trees to be implemented in decision support systems the positive relationship observed between kp and vpd evidences the lower stomatal regulation that persimmon trees exhibit in comparison to other crops such as citrus this also suggests that persimmon rojo brillante trees might be very sensitive to soil water deficit the monthly transpiration coefficients here provided will be useful for optimizing irrigation scheduling decisions in persimmon orchards and therefore

9403,this study investigates the tradeoff between agricultural economic losses and potential water quality regulations at the watershed level over time specifically we applied a stochastic dynamic mathematical programming approach to evaluate the impact of land use changes on agricultural economic losses under uncertain water quality regulations and crop yields we selected the little river experimental watershed in south georgia as a case study seven potential water pollution reduction trajectories for total phosphorus tp were developed the proposed model applied a chance constraint technique to allow some degree of uncertainty in meeting the water quality standards the result shows that agricultural profits decrease when uncertainties are considered at the watershed level the findings further show that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard expedited the land use transition from croplands to forestlands and magnified the share of forestlands highlighting the crucial role of forests in managing water pollution in the selected watershed the results also indicate that under a moderate pollution reduction scenario an economic loss of 232 ha yr is expected to achieve a 16 reduction in tp concentration in a more ambitious pollution mitigation scenario agricultural economic losses are expected to be 778 ha yr and may result in a 45 decrease in tp concentration the modeling approach developed in designing watersheds for integrated development dwid could easily feed into those policy deliberations which operate at the interface of economics and water related policies for ensuring sustainable management of watersheds worldwide keywords water quality land uses forestry stochastic dynamic optimization chance constraint data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural runoff is the primary source of water quality issues in the united states resulting in a situation where about 58 and 34 of rivers and streams in the united states are rated as poor due to high phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations respectively usepa 2020 considering the role of existing agricultural lands in water pollution the united states environmental protection agency usepa spends about 40 of clean water act grants to control nonpoint source pollution from working farms and ranches usepa 2014 on the contrary forestlands have been typically identified as crucial in improving water quality in the united states for example forested watersheds have consistently been shown to have lower nutrient yields with better aquatic biological conditions than non forested watersheds across the southern united states west 2002 although silvicultural activities may have some negative impacts on water quality due to changes in hydrological responses of watersheds reductions in dissolved oxygen content increases in the nutrient content of streams and effects on aquatic habitat and forested wetlands these effects are mostly context specific neary et al 2009 these adverse effects can also be controlled to a larger extent by implementing best management practices bmps and following other sustainability standards jackson 2012 in the united states the implementation rate of silviculture bmps is already at 91 and still increasing cristan et al 2018 georgia a state in the southern united states is facing significant challenges in maintaining water quality the georgia environmental protection division 2020 indicates that 57 7 and 40 8 of surveyed stream river and lakes reservoirs respectively did not meet the limits set for their designated uses between 2018 and 2019 fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of water bodies in georgia that do not meet their designated uses according to the georgia environmental protection division 2020 pollution from nonpoint sources is primarily responsible for water quality issues in georgia fig 1b almost 94 and 65 of water quality issues in rivers streams and lakes reservoirs were attributed to nonpoint pollution sources in georgia respectively environmental protection division 2020 among various nonpoint pollution sources agriculture is a crucial source affecting georgia s water quality this is especially true as farmers planted 1 3 million hectares of land in 2020 under various summer crops e g cotton peanut soybean etc and perennial crops e g hay pecan across the state covering 8 6 of the total land in the state usda nass 2019 improving water quality is vital to safeguard georgia s economy over time afforestation could be an effective way to ensure improvements in water quality several studies have analyzed the impact of afforestation on improving water quality across the southern united states tu 2011a applied geographically weighted regression to investigate the spatial relationship between land use and water quality and found that the percentage of forests is an indicator of good water quality gunter et al 2005 studied the effect of demographic and spatial factors on the probability of adopting land use regulations to improve water quality in georgia florida and louisiana using a logistic regression model and indicated reliance on forestry agriculture as a key component to determine the tendency of adopting local regulations in addition to the above regression based studies several studies have used various modeling approaches to assess the impact of land use change on water quality across the united states bhattarai et al 2008 isik et al 2013 pennington et al 2017 rabotyagov et al 2010 singh et al 2015 similarly several studies have used other modeling approaches to assess the impact of environmental regulations on water use boadu et al 2007 chen et al 2006 gillig et al 2001 and water quality gaddis et al 2014 relative to land use changes even though there is a relatively large body of existing literature regarding modeling the effect of land use change on water quality these studies are limited for several reasons first existing regression based studies are limited to providing insights into optimal rotation decisions and associated whole stem volumes over time second existing forest modeling literature especially in the southern united states is short on assessing the effect of economic and policy factors on water quality and forest management derived from longer term economic optimization models third very few studies kaim et al 2020 sunandar et al 2014 whittaker 2005 have considered hydrological and economic factors together to better capture the effect of physical land use changes on water quality and economy finally there is little discussion about how the uncertainty of meeting a water quality regulation affects land use changes it is crucial to assess the economic and environmental tradeoffs relative to possible water quality regulations in light of changing land use at a watershed level over space and time therefore we extended the original modeling framework of designing watersheds for integrated development dwid an integrated hydrological economic optimization based algorithm from bawa 2021 by incorporating chance constraints to capture the uncertainty of nutrient discharge at the watershed outlet specifically we first used the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate hydrological data we then developed a stochastic mathematical programming model for ascertaining the tradeoffs between profits and environmental regulations in light of changing land use spatially and temporally using data from the swat model can provide helpful information regarding hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads at the watershed level while simulating land use changes our study fills these critical gaps and advances the literature for improving water quality in georgia and beyond 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area 2 1 1 little river experimental watershed lrew the study area is the little river experimental watershed lrew in the headwaters area of the suwannee river basin located in the recharge area of the upper floridan aquifer which is one of the most productive aquifers in the world usgs 2016 the lrew is 334 km2 and overlays turner county tift county and worth county in georgia united states fig 2 the population in this region is growing and associated economic activities are expanding although agriculture and silviculture are the primary land uses there are 198 sub basins at the huc 12 watershed level usgs 2022 in this study and the period of analysis spans from 1997 to 2005 limited by the availability of experimental data in lrew the lrew primarily consists of low gradient streams with channel slopes ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 bosch and sheridan 2007 according to bosch et al 2020 the row crop area has increased from 31 to 36 between 1975 and 2014 in the study region but its maximum share reached 51 in 1985 on the other hand forest cover decreased from 49 to 43 in the same period in summary the lrew is an agricultural dominated area with a significant portion of forestlands based on the dominant categories identified by the national land cover database nlcd 2004 fig 2 and the relevance of the study the type of land use considered in this study includes bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as hardwood and softwood note that woody wetlands act more like riparian buffers so they are not considered part of the actively managed forestlands and are not included in our analysis land use classes considered in this study are for individual crops and were selected based on the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass datasets for agricultural land use in the swat model for more details refer to section 3 2 1 2 water quality regulation excess nutrients in a water body can deteriorate water quality by fostering algae blooms accelerating plant growth and lowering dissolved oxygen from decomposition usepa 2015 according to the usepa 2014 an acceptable range of total phosphorus tp for aggregate ecoregions for rivers and streams is 0 01 mg l to 0 08 mg l nevertheless the average tp concentration in the study area was 0 46 mg l from 1974 to 2014 bosch et al 2020 which is higher than the usepa s standard among different land use agricultural lands produce more tp than other land surfaces duffy et al 2020 yong and chen 2002 thus this study aims to develop a dynamic stochastic mathematical programming approach for exploring possible water pollution reduction trajectories to mitigate tp concentration among different land use while limiting potential landowners losses induced by compliance with water quality regulations the incorporation of stochasticity has significantly expanded the capability of the original dwid modeling framework 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 overview swat is a process based and semi distributed model that can simulate hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads arnold et al 2012 swat is one of the most broadly applied large scale watershed simulation models in total maximum daily load tmdl analyses and water resource planning its applications have included predicting the impact of land management practices on nutrient yields from agricultural land use in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods gassman et al 2007 shrestha et al 2019 we used arcswat 2012 interface to set up the model using the 30 m digital elevation model dem usda nrcs 2021 soil survey spatial tabular ssurgo 2 2 soils data and national land cover dataset nlcd 2004 daily precipitation and min max temperature data were obtained from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism for the swat model table 1 we followed van liew et al 2005 and chose the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using topographic information the swat model divided the watershed into 198 sub basins subsequently each sub basin was divided into hydrologic response units hrus with unique combinations of land use soil and slope arnold and fohrer 2005 three slope classes were used for hru classification 0 5 5 10 and above 10 the threshold of 20 10 and 5 for soil land use and the slope was applied to reduce the number of hrus total 1272 across 198 sub basins we obtained an estimate of management operations planting dates fertilizer application rate and type crops yield and harvesting dates for the lrew from an extension agronomist at the university of georgia and usda nass 1997 the swat setup and crop category were determined by land cover data from nlcd 2006 and cropland data layer cdl data from usda nass a 3 year peanut corn cotton rotation was applied in the model for all the peanut corn and cotton fields amounts of 134 and 65 kg n ha in the form of elemental nitrogen fertilizer were applied in corn and cotton fields respectively the amount of 50 kg p ha of phosphorus fertilizer as p2o5 was applied in both corn and cotton fields for hay land use urea 200 kg ha with two applications in may and june and elemental p 60 kg ha were applied we used the harvest only operation in swat that occurred twice a year a baseflow separation technique arnold et al 1995 was used to initialize the value of the baseflow recession constant alpha bf we made relative adjustments to alpha bf during the model calibration 2 2 2 calibration validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs platform abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 was used to calibrate and validate the model for streamflow tp and sediment at daily time step at the outlet of lrew the sufi 2 combines optimization with uncertainty analysis uncertainties in the parameters result in model output uncertainties quantified as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band between the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2007 the model was calibrated for the entire lrew the observed data from the usda ars gauging station at the main watershed outlet between 1997 and 2005 were used with a four year model initialization 1993 1996 followed by a five year calibration 1997 2001 and four years model validation 2002 2005 to evaluate the model performance we used two quantitative error statistics kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the percent bias pbias the kge contains three components correlation r present bias μ s μ o and variability ratio σ s σ o between the simulated s and observed o variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable respectively 1 kge 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 representing a relatively accurate model kge overcomes the disadvantage of nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 in underestimating peak flow prediction gupta et al 2009 pbias measures the average tendency of the predicted data to be larger or smaller than observed values it also measures over and underestimation of bias moriasi et al 2007 2 pbias i 1 n o i s i 1 n o i 100 the optimum value for pbias is 0 where values close to zero indicate better model prediction model overestimation is signified by pbias 0 and underestimation happens when pbias 0 moriasi et al 2015 in addition to these parameters we incorporate biophysical parameters for major crops in the lrew in our calibration process parameters controlling nutrients and sediment loads were selected based on the literature abbaspour et al 2007 moriasi et al 2012 parameters controlling streamflow and plant growth were calibrated first followed by sediment and phosphorus we used average annual usda nass crop yield observed data except for forest classes after the streamflow was calibrated crop parameters were adjusted to simulate crop yields table 2 forest growth was not calibrated in the model instead the forest parameters were borrowed from haas et al 2022 where they addressed loblolly pine pinus taeda l and slash pine pinus elliotti but the methodology applies to most forest species and can be applied widely in the southeastern region of the united states we then used observed nass data to simulate the crop yields in the study area the 2002 2003 period 2 years was used for tp and sediment loads 2 2 3 nutrient load assignment 2 2 3 1 contribution modeling swat routes flow and nutrient loadings using a routing scheme based on the channel network that connects the outlets of sub basins to the watershed s primary outlet as one would expect the sum of nutrient loadings leaving each sub basin will not be equal to the nutrient load at the watershed outlet due to the instream biochemical reactions to account for tp loss and transformations at each sub basin we used an approach that assesses tp load contributions from each sub basin over simulation periods at the watershed outlet see kalin and hantush 2009 noori et al 2016 saghafian and khosroshahi 2005 and as shown in fig 5 therefore after calibrating and validating the swat model we defined a virtual rain gauge for each sub basin in the watershed the rain gauges were switched off in successive series to find the contribution of each sub basin to the nutrient loads at the watershed outlet see fig 5 the software r v 4 0 2 with extension package swatplusr schüerz 2019 was employed as a part of this analysis by interacting with our swat project to help execute efficient simulation runs across all sub basins for tp 2 2 3 2 land use assumptions adjusted tp loadings calculated at the sub basin level were further broken down by land use the model framework considers six land uses bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as softwood and hardwood the default swat setup was used for forest management which assumes no fertilizer use no thinning and a maturity of 10 and 30 years for deciduous and evergreen forests respectively an additional land use category extra which is meant to capture barren land is also included the crop type in our analysis is therefore composed of a total of seven classes tp loadings for each crop in each sub basin were calculated as the weighted average of loadings weighted by swat reported crop yields at the hru level as an initial step daily tp loadings corresponding to each hru by crop type for each year were obtained from calibrated swat output values were summed over days to arrive at annual values corresponding to each hru computing the average across all years and hru for each crop then served as the basis for constructing relative weights among crop type the created crop coefficients were subsequently multiplied by the adjusted nutrient load recorded at each sub basin i to derive specific nutrient allocation by crop type land classified as extra was assumed to produce zero nutrient loadings fig 3 2 3 economic model 2 3 1 selected scenarios this study integrates total phosphorus tp data from a swat model and uses the midpoint of the usepa criteria 0 045 mg l as a water quality regulation goal then seven possible water pollution reduction scenarios were established to depict potential water quality improvement paths from the concentration 0 57 mg l to the usepa standard 0 045 mg l the scenarios of phosphorus concentration limits over the study period are described in table 3 and the corresponding water quality improvement paths are illustrated in fig 4 2 3 2 modeling land use decisions the stochastic dynamic optimization model developed here is used to investigate landowners responses to different water quality regulation scenarios over time the model assumes landowners to be risk neutral and to maximize the present value of a stream of expected future returns to the land z as shown in eq 3 3 max z σ j σ i σ t p j t y j i t h j i t σ j σ i σ t i j t h j i t σ j σ i σ t c j i t r x j i t r where the decision variables in this model are h j i t and x j i t r the former is hectares harvested for cropland j in sub basin i at the beginning of year t and the latter is hectares converted from cropland j to cropland r in sub basin i at the end of year t note that subscripts j and r have the same dimension length of six indicating bermuda hay corn cotton peanut hardwood and softwood respectively the decision variables are associated with the following price parameters p j t is a set of discounted annual real crop prices in us kg expressed in 1997 dollars for crop j in year t y j i t is an annual crop yield in kg ha for crop j in sub basin i in year t produced from the swat model i j t is a discounted crop production cost in us ha for cropland j in year t and c jitr is a discounted cost in us ha of changing land use from cropland j to cropland r in sub basin i in year t the above price terms were all discounted at 4 2 which is based on a range of 3 7 commonly applied in the social discounting of environmental investments li and pizer 2021 office of management and budget 1992 landowners maximize profits formulated in eq 3 subject to the following constraints eq 4 ensures the total allocated land for all crops l i t does not exceed the total available land a i t in each sub basin and year 4 j l j i t a i t i t in each sub basin and year harvested cropland h j i t must not exceed the total allocated land l j i t for each crop as expressed in eq 5 5 h j i t l j i t j i t eq 6 imposes a constraint in which hectares converted from cropland j to cropland r x j i t r must not exceed hectares harvested for each crop h j i t in each sub basin and year the land conversion is assumed to occur at the end of a given year t after harvest 6 r x j i t r h j i t j i t to ensure the total allocated land satisfies the land use balance in each sub basin and year eq 7 requires allocated cropland in a current year l j i t is equal to hectares harvested for crop j in the previous year h j i t 1 plus the net hectares converted from other crops to crop j in the previous year 7 j l j i t j h j i t 1 j r x j i t 1 r r j x j i t 1 r i t finally landowners land use decisions are restricted by the hypothetical water quality regulation constraint based on the water pollution criteria of the policy scenario being evaluated 8 j i μ jt h j i t δ t s t s where μ j i is mean of phosphorus concentration per hectare for crop j in sub basin i δ t s is the phosphorus concentration limit in mg liter in year t under criteria scenario s illustrated in fig 4 and table 3 eq 8 assumes that there is no probability specified for landowners to meet the required phosphorus concertation limit in each time step hereafter the model in eq 8 is referred to as the deterministic model the assumption that water quality targets will be met randomly however may be less informative hence following the related literature ellis 1987 jacobs et al 1997 wang et al 2015 a stochastic chance constraint for achieving the water quality criteria is developed using eq 9 9 pr j i μ jt h j i t δ t s α t s eq 9 ensures the likelihood of meeting the required phosphorus concentration in year t is realized at a minimum probability α reflecting a more informative aspect of probabilistic violations of water quality standards the α values used in this study are 90 95 and 99 following chance constraint water management references cardwell and ellis 1993 ellis 1987 fujiwara et al 1986 sethi et al 2006 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 eq 9 can be further converted into the following formula 10 j i μ jt h jit i φ 1 α j i σ jt h jit 2 δ t s where σ j i is variance of phosphorus concentration per hectare for crop j in sub basin i φ 1 is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable and φ 1 is the inverse function a detailed derivation of eq 10 from eq 9 can refer to jacobs et al 1997 and mathematical notation descriptions for the entire model are summarized in table 4 eq 10 is hereafter referred to as the stochastic model note that when α is 50 the stochastic model will turn to the deterministic one with the average phosphorus concentration 2 3 3 crop yield simulation to investigate how profits change under uncertain crop yields a simulation technique is used to develop stochastic crop yields the simulation procedure is described as follows step 1 calculate annual mean and variance for crop j in sub basin i μ j i and σ j i step 2 use μ j i and σ j i to construct a normal distribution for each crop type in each sub basin normal j i μ j i σ j i 2 step 3 draw a crop yield value from each normal distribution constructed from step 2 step 4 input the drawn yield values from step 3 into the objective function i e eq 3 solve the optimization problem and record the resulting outcome step 5 repeat step 2 to step 4 for 500 times and calculate the simulated mean and standard deviation note that simulation for stochastic models produced some infeasible results which were excluded when calculating the simulated mean and standard deviation for the simulation results 170 out of 3 500 7 scenarios 500 simulation repetitions were infeasible and or non optimal solutions which were excluded when calculating the simulated mean and standard deviation we summarized all uncertainty sources considered in this study as a 2 by 2 matrix as shown in table 5 2 3 4 data for parameters in the economic model there are two sets of parameters used in the stochastic dynamic optimization model economic and hydrological the economic parameters include annual crop prices in kg annual crop production costs in ha and land use conversion costs in ha the annual crop price data for corn cotton bermuda hay and peanut were retrieved from usda nass 2019 prices for hardwood and softwood were from tms 2019 and were annualized over 25 years crop production costs for annual crops used historical expected cost budgets for the study area from the university of georgia 2020 forest crop costs were calculated as the sum of average annual costs over a 25 years rotation including fertilizers herbicides machine planting mechanical site preparation and prescribed burning maggard and barlow 2016 land use conversion cost estimates were obtained from the university of georgia 2020 the costs of switching forest to agricultural lands are at least 4942 ha and 6177 ha for softwood pine and hardwoods respectively based on consultation with field experts the above costs include costs for excavator services to pull and pile stumps and clear the land of stumps conversion costs from bermuda hay to other agricultural croplands were estimated at 179 12 ha considering incurred costs for prepping lands with necessary fertilizer and herbicide application the hydrological parameters were from the swat model they were produced by the swat model consisting of crop yields surface runoff and phosphorus load the swat model was initially calibrated over five years 1997 2001 and validated over four years 2002 2005 at the outlet the model considers seven land use types bermuda hay corn cotton peanut forest classified as hardwood and softwood and barren land barren lands were assumed to produce zero tp loadings a summary of data sources is presented in table 6 3 results 3 1 swat modeling results 3 1 1 swat calibration and validation the calibration process for the lrew started with 36 hydrologic and biophysical parameters after 1000 simulations the most sensitive flow and biophysical parameters were identified and these are listed in table 7 in order of decreasing sensitivity the most sensitive parameters were effective hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium in the main channel ch k2 rte groundwater delay time gw delay gw the fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline dlai plant dat runoff curve number 2 cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol parameter values should be considered after calibration to avoid unrealistic simulations for instance the fitted values for sol awc in the swat model for crops and forest soil ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 which was comparable to the measured weighted average sol awc of 0 057 for the tifton soil series by hubbard 1985 cn2 for the main crops and forest evergreen and deciduous were reduced by 12 resulting in a better adjustment to streamflow predictions the model fit was deemed satisfactory for streamflow calibration and validation with a daily kge of 0 80 and 0 71 and pbias of 2 5 and 3 8 respectively the observed streamflow tp sediment loads the model best fit and the 95 ppu band for calibration and validation periods are shown in and after the model was calibrated for hydrology and biophysical parameters the narrow ranges for selected parameter values were fixed and the model was calibrated for sediment load at the watershed outlet using 14 parameters the swat model for tp sediment loads and streamflow are shown in table 8 for the calibration and validation periods fig 5 the most sensitive parameters for sediment load were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment re entrained in channel sediment routing spexp bsn a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be re entrained during channel sediment routing spcon bsn and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant the spexp and spcon are parameters used to calculate the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported from a reach the fitted value for spexp and spcon in our model was 1 210 and 0 001 respectively the daily kge was 0 43 and 0 57 for the calibration and validation period respectively with pbias of 2 5 for the calibration period and 0 2 for the validation periods table 8 the most sensitive tp parameters were residue decomposition coefficient rsdco bsn phosphorus enrichment ratio for loading with sediment erorgp hru and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant table 7 the fitted value for rsdco and erorgp was 0 07 and 2 58 respectively the daily kge for tp load was 0 63 with pbias of 0 4 for the calibration period and kge of 0 35 with pbias of 2 8 for the validation period the model performance for daily tp at the watershed outlet was evaluated as satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 the lower kge for the validation period was expected because the observation data for tp loads were sparse for that period compared with daily observations for streamflow 3 1 2 nutrient contribution since this study focuses on reducing tp concentration the swat model results are presented only fortp and sediment upon calibration and validation in swat tp loading linked to a given hru for each day for each year was summed across days to arrive at annual values before averaging across all years for each hru fig 6 a comparison of tp loadings by crop type is presented in fig 7 average annual tp loadings in fig 7 were the lowest for forest land cover softwood was associated with slightly higher loads estimated at 0 023 kg ha per year compared with 0 021 kg ha per year for hardwoods bermuda was reflective of the highest tp load out of the six crops at 0 396 kg ha per year a previous study reports that tp from pasture has the range of 0 14 4 90 kg ha yr which covers our annual average tp load reckhow et al 1980 similarly cotton shows a fairly large number of outliers in the upper range averaging 0 252 kg ha per year peanut and corn trail behind with estimated average annual loads of 0 081 and 0 072 kg ha respectively 3 2 economic modeling results 3 2 1 summary statistics for economic variables and parameters fig 8 presents an overview of the key variables parameters including crop yields y j i t revenues p j i t y j i t crop production costs i j t and sub basin level tp concentration used for calculating mean tp concentration μ jt fig 8a shows that hay and woody crops have a relatively higher mean yield and woody crops tend to have larger variability compared to other crops overall cotton and peanut are the most valuable crops among the study crops as shown in fig 8b nevertheless corn cotton hay and peanut are also relatively costly compared to woody crops 3 2 2 impact of water pollution reduction on profit changes profit estimates obtained from the deterministic and stochastic dynamic optimization models under seven water pollution reduction scenarios are presented in fig 9a in the deterministic model the total profit is estimated to be 1340 ha yr when the water quality standard remains constant over the study period scenario 0 however it declines from 1340 ha yr to 695 ha yr i e a 48 reduction when the water quality regulation switches from the no restriction scenario scenario 0 to the strictest scenario scenario 6 in the case of the stochastic model the results shown in fig 9a reveal the impact of the policy uncertainty on profits under three probabilistic scenarios i e 90 95 and 99 described in eqs 9 and10 these stochastic optimization results assume a 90 95 and 99 chance to meet the water quality standard respectively instead of the 50 assumed in the deterministic model overall the stochastic model results have a similar pattern as the deterministic results but have relatively lower profit estimates the estimated total profit with a 95 chance to meet the regulation under scenarios 0 and 6 are 1340 ha yr and 562 ha yr respectively for the comparison among different probabilistic scenarios the estimated profit using the 99 chance constraint is consistently lower than using 90 across the six non baseline scenarios the estimates with a 95 chance constraint are somewhere between the ones for 90 and 99 for instance under scenario 6 the profit estimates decrease from 587 ha yr to 521 ha yr when the required probability of meeting the policy standard increases from 90 to 99 this outcome implies that when the model requires a higher chance to fulfill the water quality standard the land use structure is forced to shift to crops with a lower profit but generate less pollution more detail about the associated land use change is presented in section 3 2 4 fig 9c and fig 9d present the associated tp changes under scenarios 1 and 6 respectively given each model type overall the results show that the concentration follows the water quality improvement path scenarios and natural fluctuation as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 7 respectively in addition average tp i e the average tp concentration over the study period has the lowest amount under scenario 6 and the highest amount when no policy is enforced scenario 0 for the comparison among the model types tp concentration in the stochastic model is consistently equal to or higher than in deterministic ones numerically speaking that is the consequence of adding a positive squared root in eq 10 hence the stochastic constraint results in a higher tp amount than the deterministic constraint i e eq 8 the implication of this outcome indicates that considering the uncertainty of the tp concentration leads to a higher average water pollution amount fig 9e moving from scenario 0 to scenario 6 the corresponding average tp concentration reduces by 39 under sp50 dy and reduces by 45 under sp95 dy in a moderate case moving from scenario 0 to scenario 4 the corresponding average tp concentration decreases by 11 and 16 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively the tradeoff between tp reduction and estimated profits changes for the deterministic yield models is shown in fig 9 f in summary the deterministic tp models have a higher profit and lower resulting tp concentration than the stochastic tp models among different policy scenarios stricter regulation scenarios result in lower profits and tp loads than loose regulation scenarios among different degrees of uncertainty i e sp90 sp95 sp99 the resulting tp loads are not necessarily lower as the constraint assurance level increases that is because the objective function of the optimization model is profit maximization instead of tp load minimization moreover the resulting tp loads are determined by the composition of a variety of land use rather being determined by the dominant land use type alone more details refer to section 3 2 4 note that scenarios 1 2 and 3 have similar estimated results so the corresponding lines and dots overlap 3 2 3 impact of regulation and crop yield uncertainties on profit changes the results obtained from the simulation process are shown in fig 9b the mean profit estimates under scenario 0 and scenario 6 estimated by the sp50 sy model are 1268 ha yr and 617 ha yr respectively both estimates are lower than the result with certain crop yields sp50 dy which are 1340 ha yr and 695 ha yr as presented in fig 9a this indicates uncertain crop yields result in a reduction in profits similarly the sp95 sy model result imposed a 95 chance constraint on water quality follows a similar pattern but produces overall lower profits the mean profit results estimated by the sp95 sy under scenario 0 and scenario 6 are 1268 ha yr and 483 ha yr respectively table 8 shows the equality tests for the means and variance of the aggregated profits between sp50 sy and sp95 sy across different scenarios the test result suggests that the mean profits are significantly different between sp50 sy and sp95 sy across scenarios 1 6 implying that the tp concentration and crop yield uncertainties result in lower mean profits nevertheless the variance is significantly different at the 95 confidence level only under scenario 6 in summary our results show that landowners profits are largely affected by land use water quality improvement processes and uncertainty of crop yields the results suggest that providing a more extended time period to tighten the water quality standard e g scenarios 1 3 can mitigate profit losses from rapidly switching from high profit but high pollutant croplands to forestlands however it results in higher average tp concentration on the other hand the adoption of more ambitious pollution mitigation e g scenario 6 leads to significantly lower aggregated profits and lower average tp concentration namely better water quality table 9 3 2 4 impact of water pollution reduction on land use changes to understand the underlying mechanism of the above profit changes land use changes over the study period are investigated figs 10 and 11 illustrate the dominant and second dominant land use type transition in each sub basin in both deterministic sp50 dy and stochastic sp90 dy sp95 dy sp99 dy dynamic optimization models under scenario 6 from year 0 1997 to year 8 2005 the initial land use type is dominated by corn and softwood and land use changes start in year 1 1998 deterministic model results upper panels in fig 10 show that most croplands are used for planting cotton and sometimes peanut since cotton and peanut are two most profitable crops when the water quality standard becomes stricter as time passes the share of the hardwood land increases as hardwood has the lowest tp concentration among all crops in some periods of time the share of peanut replaces cotton because peanut is one of the most profitable crops but produces relatively less tp as shown in fig 7 the lower panels in fig 10 show the stochastic dynamic optimization model results using the chance constraint equation eq 10 the resulting optimization model allows a specific chance e g 90 95 and 99 of achieving the water quality regulation standard a comparison of the deterministic and stochastic models reveals that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard facilitate the speed of the dominant land use type transition from croplands to forestlands and magnify the share of forestlands overall this outcome reflects the consequence of lower profits when uncertainties of meeting the policy standard are considered fig 11 shows the transitions for the second dominant land use type under different model types note that sub basins in white indicate that there is no second dominant land type the result shows that sub basins which have cotton or peanut two most profitable crops as the dominant land use before the water quality regulation comes into effect tend to not have the second dominant land use this outcome likely is the consequence of maximizing profits because the profit maximization objective leads to picking up the most profitable crop in the first place if the model picks some less profitable crops for some parts of sub basins the resulting profit won t be the maximum 4 discussion our study shows croplands can increase landowners profit while deteriorating the water quality this finding is aligned with previous studies investigating the relationship between water quality and agriculture in georgia united states bosch et al 2020 analyzed 41 years of water quality data from the little river experimental watershed in south georgia reporting that chloride cl concentration has increased steadily possibly due to increased fertilization in the selected watershed bawa and dwivedi 2019 found that agriculture was positively associated with increased groundwater pollutants in the suwanee river basin dalton and frick 2008 analyzed pesticide concentrations across 128 wells in southwest georgia between 1993 and 2005 and detected six compounds atrazine deethylatrazine metolachlor alachlor fluometuron and tebuthiuron in more than 20 of samples it was also found that pesticide concentrations increased in seven wells over the selected period of the study similarly other studies have also found that agriculture affects water quality in georgia duffy et al 2020 fisher et al 2000 yong and chen 2002 one of the most common practices to reduce nonpoint pollution from agriculture is to change existing croplands to forestlands although previous studies clarke et al 2015 rodgers et al 2010 indicate that forests may deteriorate the water quality for a short period at the stage of planting and harvesting this study covers a relatively longer duration it shows that forests play a crucial role in improving water quality over time the benefit of forestlands for improving water quality is supported by several other existing studies for example tu 2011b analyzed 43 watersheds spread across north georgia and found that the percentage of land under forest cover was inversely related to the level of pollutants found in the water of selected watersheds similar results were found in a southern appalachian mountain study the relationship between levels of forest cover and water quality was investigated and showed that a higher percentage of forest cover is associated with lower suspended sediment concentrations and sediment loads jackson et al 2017 improving water quality by forests is particularly effective when forest landowners properly implement silviculture bmps cristan et al 2016 specifically griffiths et al 2017 investigated the effect of forestry bmps for short rotation pine on water quality in the upper coastal plain of the southeastern united states and showed that watersheds with intensive forestry management effectively improve water quality over time rivenbark and jackson 2004 studied bmps applied in streamside management zones smzs in the georgia piedmont and indicated that reduction of bare ground better dispersal of road runoff the introduction of hydraulic resistance to likely flow paths and targeted extensions of smz width could prevent concentrated overland flow and associated sediment from reaching stream channels bmps in smzs also are a substantial ameliorating effect on sediment transport from concentrated overland flows on clearcut sites ward and jackson 2004 the role of forestry bmps on water quality becomes more critical as the implementation rate of forestry bmps in georgia has significantly risen historically and typically equals or exceeds 90 in recent years dwivedi et al 2018 one of the issues emerging from land use changes and bmp implementation is how to create a relevant monetary incentive to encourage the adoption of bmps and what the compensation amount for property owners would be the results of the dwid modeling approach developed and extended in this study help us to understand the potential compensation needed for landowners to convert croplands to forestlands for improving water quality over time specifically fig 9 shows that when scenario 0 switches to scenario 6 the corresponding profit drops from 1340 ha yr to 695 ha yr under sp50 dy and 562 ha yr under sp95 dy the associated pollution reduction is 39 and 45 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively the implication of this result indicates that the resulting differences of 645 ha yr 1340 ha yr 695 ha yr and 778 ha yr 1340 ha yr 562 ha yr between scenarios 0 and 6 under each model type can be viewed as proxies for willingness to pay of the agricultural sector to decrease tp concentrations by 39 and 45 similarly in a moderate case the profit reduces from 1340 ha yr to 1315 ha yr under sp50 dy and to 1108 ha yr under sp95 dy as scenario 0 changes to scenario 4 the corresponding pollution level decreases by 11 and 16 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively this result indicates that the willingness to pay to decrease tp concentrations by 11 and 16 from scenario 0 to scenario 4 are 25 ha yr and 232 ha yr under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively although the clean water act specifically exempts agriculture and silviculture the above compensation payment estimates made to agricultural landowners provide relevant insights to policymakers about the cost of improving water quality by encouraging and compensating some property owners for their voluntary participation in clean water act activities such as the implementation of bmps at the watershed scale 5 conclusion this study investigated the tradeoff between agricultural economic losses and potential water quality regulations at the watershed level over time specifically this study applied a stochastic dynamic mathematical programming method to investigate the relationship between land use changes and water quality while considering uncertainties of meeting the water quality regulation the result shows that without considering the uncertainty of meeting the water quality criteria the estimated profit is between 1340 ha yr and 695 ha yr during the study period varying by different water quality regulation scenarios however when considering the uncertainty of achieving the water quality standard the profit estimates ranged between 1340 ha yr and 562 ha yr i e a reduction of 55 relative to the deterministic baseline results this suggests that considering the uncertainty of satisfying the water quality criteria which is more informative provides more conservative profit estimates the positive relationship between losses and the degree of uncertainty is also aligned with zhou et al 2018 but this study provides further insights into the dynamic relationship between profits land use changes and water quality the result also indicates a higher profit when providing a more extended period to tighten the water quality standard furthermore the findings also show that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard facilitate the speed of the land use transition from croplands to forest lands and magnify the share of forestlands highlighting the crucial role of forests in improving water quality in georgia in addition this study also examined how the profit changes while having uncertain crop yields on top of the uncertainty of meeting the water quality regulation the result was derived from the simulation technique and showed that the estimated profit further down to 1268 ha yr 483 ha yr i e about 6 59 lower than the sp50 dy model varying by different policy trajectory scenarios similarly profit estimates are higher under policy trajectory scenarios with a more extended adaptation period to tighten the water quality standard namely the result indicates that providing a more extended period to tighten the water quality standard scenarios 1 3 can mitigate economic losses by rapidly switching from high profit but high pollutant croplands to forestlands this suggests that once policymakers determine the water quality standard giving landowners sufficient time to adopt the policy and adjusting land use can help landowners secure their profit while improving water quality our study demonstrated that taking the uncertainty of meeting the water quality regulations and the uncertainty of crop yields into account reflects a more informative optimization setting and produces a more conservative profit estimate our findings suggest the importance of setting future crop yield and policy expectations for landowners when landowners face lower yield variance i e fewer uncertainties their profit appears to be higher hence providing precise crop yield forecast information based on long term climate e g el niño decadal climate variation pattern prediction fan et al 2017 wang et al 2021 or promoting crop insurance could help landowners encounter fewer uncertainties and secure their profit further work is needed to identify the effect of climate change on land use change moreover this study assumes farmers make a decision as individually independent profit maximizers more information on how social networks affect the proposed land use model would help us to establish a greater degree of accuracy on related findings this study also used default swat assumptions for modeling forestlands located in the study area further work is needed to improve the assumptions for precisely defining the role of forestlands in improving the water quality relative to actual forest practices undertaken by forest landowners in the study area we hope that the insights developed in the study could feed into watershed level planning and management initiatives worldwide to strike a balance between economics and environmental quality to ensure

9403,this study investigates the tradeoff between agricultural economic losses and potential water quality regulations at the watershed level over time specifically we applied a stochastic dynamic mathematical programming approach to evaluate the impact of land use changes on agricultural economic losses under uncertain water quality regulations and crop yields we selected the little river experimental watershed in south georgia as a case study seven potential water pollution reduction trajectories for total phosphorus tp were developed the proposed model applied a chance constraint technique to allow some degree of uncertainty in meeting the water quality standards the result shows that agricultural profits decrease when uncertainties are considered at the watershed level the findings further show that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard expedited the land use transition from croplands to forestlands and magnified the share of forestlands highlighting the crucial role of forests in managing water pollution in the selected watershed the results also indicate that under a moderate pollution reduction scenario an economic loss of 232 ha yr is expected to achieve a 16 reduction in tp concentration in a more ambitious pollution mitigation scenario agricultural economic losses are expected to be 778 ha yr and may result in a 45 decrease in tp concentration the modeling approach developed in designing watersheds for integrated development dwid could easily feed into those policy deliberations which operate at the interface of economics and water related policies for ensuring sustainable management of watersheds worldwide keywords water quality land uses forestry stochastic dynamic optimization chance constraint data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural runoff is the primary source of water quality issues in the united states resulting in a situation where about 58 and 34 of rivers and streams in the united states are rated as poor due to high phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations respectively usepa 2020 considering the role of existing agricultural lands in water pollution the united states environmental protection agency usepa spends about 40 of clean water act grants to control nonpoint source pollution from working farms and ranches usepa 2014 on the contrary forestlands have been typically identified as crucial in improving water quality in the united states for example forested watersheds have consistently been shown to have lower nutrient yields with better aquatic biological conditions than non forested watersheds across the southern united states west 2002 although silvicultural activities may have some negative impacts on water quality due to changes in hydrological responses of watersheds reductions in dissolved oxygen content increases in the nutrient content of streams and effects on aquatic habitat and forested wetlands these effects are mostly context specific neary et al 2009 these adverse effects can also be controlled to a larger extent by implementing best management practices bmps and following other sustainability standards jackson 2012 in the united states the implementation rate of silviculture bmps is already at 91 and still increasing cristan et al 2018 georgia a state in the southern united states is facing significant challenges in maintaining water quality the georgia environmental protection division 2020 indicates that 57 7 and 40 8 of surveyed stream river and lakes reservoirs respectively did not meet the limits set for their designated uses between 2018 and 2019 fig 1a shows the spatial distribution of water bodies in georgia that do not meet their designated uses according to the georgia environmental protection division 2020 pollution from nonpoint sources is primarily responsible for water quality issues in georgia fig 1b almost 94 and 65 of water quality issues in rivers streams and lakes reservoirs were attributed to nonpoint pollution sources in georgia respectively environmental protection division 2020 among various nonpoint pollution sources agriculture is a crucial source affecting georgia s water quality this is especially true as farmers planted 1 3 million hectares of land in 2020 under various summer crops e g cotton peanut soybean etc and perennial crops e g hay pecan across the state covering 8 6 of the total land in the state usda nass 2019 improving water quality is vital to safeguard georgia s economy over time afforestation could be an effective way to ensure improvements in water quality several studies have analyzed the impact of afforestation on improving water quality across the southern united states tu 2011a applied geographically weighted regression to investigate the spatial relationship between land use and water quality and found that the percentage of forests is an indicator of good water quality gunter et al 2005 studied the effect of demographic and spatial factors on the probability of adopting land use regulations to improve water quality in georgia florida and louisiana using a logistic regression model and indicated reliance on forestry agriculture as a key component to determine the tendency of adopting local regulations in addition to the above regression based studies several studies have used various modeling approaches to assess the impact of land use change on water quality across the united states bhattarai et al 2008 isik et al 2013 pennington et al 2017 rabotyagov et al 2010 singh et al 2015 similarly several studies have used other modeling approaches to assess the impact of environmental regulations on water use boadu et al 2007 chen et al 2006 gillig et al 2001 and water quality gaddis et al 2014 relative to land use changes even though there is a relatively large body of existing literature regarding modeling the effect of land use change on water quality these studies are limited for several reasons first existing regression based studies are limited to providing insights into optimal rotation decisions and associated whole stem volumes over time second existing forest modeling literature especially in the southern united states is short on assessing the effect of economic and policy factors on water quality and forest management derived from longer term economic optimization models third very few studies kaim et al 2020 sunandar et al 2014 whittaker 2005 have considered hydrological and economic factors together to better capture the effect of physical land use changes on water quality and economy finally there is little discussion about how the uncertainty of meeting a water quality regulation affects land use changes it is crucial to assess the economic and environmental tradeoffs relative to possible water quality regulations in light of changing land use at a watershed level over space and time therefore we extended the original modeling framework of designing watersheds for integrated development dwid an integrated hydrological economic optimization based algorithm from bawa 2021 by incorporating chance constraints to capture the uncertainty of nutrient discharge at the watershed outlet specifically we first used the soil and water assessment tool swat to generate hydrological data we then developed a stochastic mathematical programming model for ascertaining the tradeoffs between profits and environmental regulations in light of changing land use spatially and temporally using data from the swat model can provide helpful information regarding hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads at the watershed level while simulating land use changes our study fills these critical gaps and advances the literature for improving water quality in georgia and beyond 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area 2 1 1 little river experimental watershed lrew the study area is the little river experimental watershed lrew in the headwaters area of the suwannee river basin located in the recharge area of the upper floridan aquifer which is one of the most productive aquifers in the world usgs 2016 the lrew is 334 km2 and overlays turner county tift county and worth county in georgia united states fig 2 the population in this region is growing and associated economic activities are expanding although agriculture and silviculture are the primary land uses there are 198 sub basins at the huc 12 watershed level usgs 2022 in this study and the period of analysis spans from 1997 to 2005 limited by the availability of experimental data in lrew the lrew primarily consists of low gradient streams with channel slopes ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 bosch and sheridan 2007 according to bosch et al 2020 the row crop area has increased from 31 to 36 between 1975 and 2014 in the study region but its maximum share reached 51 in 1985 on the other hand forest cover decreased from 49 to 43 in the same period in summary the lrew is an agricultural dominated area with a significant portion of forestlands based on the dominant categories identified by the national land cover database nlcd 2004 fig 2 and the relevance of the study the type of land use considered in this study includes bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as hardwood and softwood note that woody wetlands act more like riparian buffers so they are not considered part of the actively managed forestlands and are not included in our analysis land use classes considered in this study are for individual crops and were selected based on the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass datasets for agricultural land use in the swat model for more details refer to section 3 2 1 2 water quality regulation excess nutrients in a water body can deteriorate water quality by fostering algae blooms accelerating plant growth and lowering dissolved oxygen from decomposition usepa 2015 according to the usepa 2014 an acceptable range of total phosphorus tp for aggregate ecoregions for rivers and streams is 0 01 mg l to 0 08 mg l nevertheless the average tp concentration in the study area was 0 46 mg l from 1974 to 2014 bosch et al 2020 which is higher than the usepa s standard among different land use agricultural lands produce more tp than other land surfaces duffy et al 2020 yong and chen 2002 thus this study aims to develop a dynamic stochastic mathematical programming approach for exploring possible water pollution reduction trajectories to mitigate tp concentration among different land use while limiting potential landowners losses induced by compliance with water quality regulations the incorporation of stochasticity has significantly expanded the capability of the original dwid modeling framework 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 overview swat is a process based and semi distributed model that can simulate hydrology crop growth nutrients and sediment loads arnold et al 2012 swat is one of the most broadly applied large scale watershed simulation models in total maximum daily load tmdl analyses and water resource planning its applications have included predicting the impact of land management practices on nutrient yields from agricultural land use in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods gassman et al 2007 shrestha et al 2019 we used arcswat 2012 interface to set up the model using the 30 m digital elevation model dem usda nrcs 2021 soil survey spatial tabular ssurgo 2 2 soils data and national land cover dataset nlcd 2004 daily precipitation and min max temperature data were obtained from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism for the swat model table 1 we followed van liew et al 2005 and chose the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet using topographic information the swat model divided the watershed into 198 sub basins subsequently each sub basin was divided into hydrologic response units hrus with unique combinations of land use soil and slope arnold and fohrer 2005 three slope classes were used for hru classification 0 5 5 10 and above 10 the threshold of 20 10 and 5 for soil land use and the slope was applied to reduce the number of hrus total 1272 across 198 sub basins we obtained an estimate of management operations planting dates fertilizer application rate and type crops yield and harvesting dates for the lrew from an extension agronomist at the university of georgia and usda nass 1997 the swat setup and crop category were determined by land cover data from nlcd 2006 and cropland data layer cdl data from usda nass a 3 year peanut corn cotton rotation was applied in the model for all the peanut corn and cotton fields amounts of 134 and 65 kg n ha in the form of elemental nitrogen fertilizer were applied in corn and cotton fields respectively the amount of 50 kg p ha of phosphorus fertilizer as p2o5 was applied in both corn and cotton fields for hay land use urea 200 kg ha with two applications in may and june and elemental p 60 kg ha were applied we used the harvest only operation in swat that occurred twice a year a baseflow separation technique arnold et al 1995 was used to initialize the value of the baseflow recession constant alpha bf we made relative adjustments to alpha bf during the model calibration 2 2 2 calibration validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi version 2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty programs platform abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 was used to calibrate and validate the model for streamflow tp and sediment at daily time step at the outlet of lrew the sufi 2 combines optimization with uncertainty analysis uncertainties in the parameters result in model output uncertainties quantified as the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band between the 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of an output variable using latin hypercube sampling abbaspour et al 2007 the model was calibrated for the entire lrew the observed data from the usda ars gauging station at the main watershed outlet between 1997 and 2005 were used with a four year model initialization 1993 1996 followed by a five year calibration 1997 2001 and four years model validation 2002 2005 to evaluate the model performance we used two quantitative error statistics kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the percent bias pbias the kge contains three components correlation r present bias μ s μ o and variability ratio σ s σ o between the simulated s and observed o variable μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable respectively 1 kge 1 r 1 2 μ s μ o 1 2 σ s σ o 1 2 kge ranges from to 1 with a value closer to 1 representing a relatively accurate model kge overcomes the disadvantage of nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 in underestimating peak flow prediction gupta et al 2009 pbias measures the average tendency of the predicted data to be larger or smaller than observed values it also measures over and underestimation of bias moriasi et al 2007 2 pbias i 1 n o i s i 1 n o i 100 the optimum value for pbias is 0 where values close to zero indicate better model prediction model overestimation is signified by pbias 0 and underestimation happens when pbias 0 moriasi et al 2015 in addition to these parameters we incorporate biophysical parameters for major crops in the lrew in our calibration process parameters controlling nutrients and sediment loads were selected based on the literature abbaspour et al 2007 moriasi et al 2012 parameters controlling streamflow and plant growth were calibrated first followed by sediment and phosphorus we used average annual usda nass crop yield observed data except for forest classes after the streamflow was calibrated crop parameters were adjusted to simulate crop yields table 2 forest growth was not calibrated in the model instead the forest parameters were borrowed from haas et al 2022 where they addressed loblolly pine pinus taeda l and slash pine pinus elliotti but the methodology applies to most forest species and can be applied widely in the southeastern region of the united states we then used observed nass data to simulate the crop yields in the study area the 2002 2003 period 2 years was used for tp and sediment loads 2 2 3 nutrient load assignment 2 2 3 1 contribution modeling swat routes flow and nutrient loadings using a routing scheme based on the channel network that connects the outlets of sub basins to the watershed s primary outlet as one would expect the sum of nutrient loadings leaving each sub basin will not be equal to the nutrient load at the watershed outlet due to the instream biochemical reactions to account for tp loss and transformations at each sub basin we used an approach that assesses tp load contributions from each sub basin over simulation periods at the watershed outlet see kalin and hantush 2009 noori et al 2016 saghafian and khosroshahi 2005 and as shown in fig 5 therefore after calibrating and validating the swat model we defined a virtual rain gauge for each sub basin in the watershed the rain gauges were switched off in successive series to find the contribution of each sub basin to the nutrient loads at the watershed outlet see fig 5 the software r v 4 0 2 with extension package swatplusr schüerz 2019 was employed as a part of this analysis by interacting with our swat project to help execute efficient simulation runs across all sub basins for tp 2 2 3 2 land use assumptions adjusted tp loadings calculated at the sub basin level were further broken down by land use the model framework considers six land uses bermuda hay corn cotton peanut and forest classified as softwood and hardwood the default swat setup was used for forest management which assumes no fertilizer use no thinning and a maturity of 10 and 30 years for deciduous and evergreen forests respectively an additional land use category extra which is meant to capture barren land is also included the crop type in our analysis is therefore composed of a total of seven classes tp loadings for each crop in each sub basin were calculated as the weighted average of loadings weighted by swat reported crop yields at the hru level as an initial step daily tp loadings corresponding to each hru by crop type for each year were obtained from calibrated swat output values were summed over days to arrive at annual values corresponding to each hru computing the average across all years and hru for each crop then served as the basis for constructing relative weights among crop type the created crop coefficients were subsequently multiplied by the adjusted nutrient load recorded at each sub basin i to derive specific nutrient allocation by crop type land classified as extra was assumed to produce zero nutrient loadings fig 3 2 3 economic model 2 3 1 selected scenarios this study integrates total phosphorus tp data from a swat model and uses the midpoint of the usepa criteria 0 045 mg l as a water quality regulation goal then seven possible water pollution reduction scenarios were established to depict potential water quality improvement paths from the concentration 0 57 mg l to the usepa standard 0 045 mg l the scenarios of phosphorus concentration limits over the study period are described in table 3 and the corresponding water quality improvement paths are illustrated in fig 4 2 3 2 modeling land use decisions the stochastic dynamic optimization model developed here is used to investigate landowners responses to different water quality regulation scenarios over time the model assumes landowners to be risk neutral and to maximize the present value of a stream of expected future returns to the land z as shown in eq 3 3 max z σ j σ i σ t p j t y j i t h j i t σ j σ i σ t i j t h j i t σ j σ i σ t c j i t r x j i t r where the decision variables in this model are h j i t and x j i t r the former is hectares harvested for cropland j in sub basin i at the beginning of year t and the latter is hectares converted from cropland j to cropland r in sub basin i at the end of year t note that subscripts j and r have the same dimension length of six indicating bermuda hay corn cotton peanut hardwood and softwood respectively the decision variables are associated with the following price parameters p j t is a set of discounted annual real crop prices in us kg expressed in 1997 dollars for crop j in year t y j i t is an annual crop yield in kg ha for crop j in sub basin i in year t produced from the swat model i j t is a discounted crop production cost in us ha for cropland j in year t and c jitr is a discounted cost in us ha of changing land use from cropland j to cropland r in sub basin i in year t the above price terms were all discounted at 4 2 which is based on a range of 3 7 commonly applied in the social discounting of environmental investments li and pizer 2021 office of management and budget 1992 landowners maximize profits formulated in eq 3 subject to the following constraints eq 4 ensures the total allocated land for all crops l i t does not exceed the total available land a i t in each sub basin and year 4 j l j i t a i t i t in each sub basin and year harvested cropland h j i t must not exceed the total allocated land l j i t for each crop as expressed in eq 5 5 h j i t l j i t j i t eq 6 imposes a constraint in which hectares converted from cropland j to cropland r x j i t r must not exceed hectares harvested for each crop h j i t in each sub basin and year the land conversion is assumed to occur at the end of a given year t after harvest 6 r x j i t r h j i t j i t to ensure the total allocated land satisfies the land use balance in each sub basin and year eq 7 requires allocated cropland in a current year l j i t is equal to hectares harvested for crop j in the previous year h j i t 1 plus the net hectares converted from other crops to crop j in the previous year 7 j l j i t j h j i t 1 j r x j i t 1 r r j x j i t 1 r i t finally landowners land use decisions are restricted by the hypothetical water quality regulation constraint based on the water pollution criteria of the policy scenario being evaluated 8 j i μ jt h j i t δ t s t s where μ j i is mean of phosphorus concentration per hectare for crop j in sub basin i δ t s is the phosphorus concentration limit in mg liter in year t under criteria scenario s illustrated in fig 4 and table 3 eq 8 assumes that there is no probability specified for landowners to meet the required phosphorus concertation limit in each time step hereafter the model in eq 8 is referred to as the deterministic model the assumption that water quality targets will be met randomly however may be less informative hence following the related literature ellis 1987 jacobs et al 1997 wang et al 2015 a stochastic chance constraint for achieving the water quality criteria is developed using eq 9 9 pr j i μ jt h j i t δ t s α t s eq 9 ensures the likelihood of meeting the required phosphorus concentration in year t is realized at a minimum probability α reflecting a more informative aspect of probabilistic violations of water quality standards the α values used in this study are 90 95 and 99 following chance constraint water management references cardwell and ellis 1993 ellis 1987 fujiwara et al 1986 sethi et al 2006 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 eq 9 can be further converted into the following formula 10 j i μ jt h jit i φ 1 α j i σ jt h jit 2 δ t s where σ j i is variance of phosphorus concentration per hectare for crop j in sub basin i φ 1 is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable and φ 1 is the inverse function a detailed derivation of eq 10 from eq 9 can refer to jacobs et al 1997 and mathematical notation descriptions for the entire model are summarized in table 4 eq 10 is hereafter referred to as the stochastic model note that when α is 50 the stochastic model will turn to the deterministic one with the average phosphorus concentration 2 3 3 crop yield simulation to investigate how profits change under uncertain crop yields a simulation technique is used to develop stochastic crop yields the simulation procedure is described as follows step 1 calculate annual mean and variance for crop j in sub basin i μ j i and σ j i step 2 use μ j i and σ j i to construct a normal distribution for each crop type in each sub basin normal j i μ j i σ j i 2 step 3 draw a crop yield value from each normal distribution constructed from step 2 step 4 input the drawn yield values from step 3 into the objective function i e eq 3 solve the optimization problem and record the resulting outcome step 5 repeat step 2 to step 4 for 500 times and calculate the simulated mean and standard deviation note that simulation for stochastic models produced some infeasible results which were excluded when calculating the simulated mean and standard deviation for the simulation results 170 out of 3 500 7 scenarios 500 simulation repetitions were infeasible and or non optimal solutions which were excluded when calculating the simulated mean and standard deviation we summarized all uncertainty sources considered in this study as a 2 by 2 matrix as shown in table 5 2 3 4 data for parameters in the economic model there are two sets of parameters used in the stochastic dynamic optimization model economic and hydrological the economic parameters include annual crop prices in kg annual crop production costs in ha and land use conversion costs in ha the annual crop price data for corn cotton bermuda hay and peanut were retrieved from usda nass 2019 prices for hardwood and softwood were from tms 2019 and were annualized over 25 years crop production costs for annual crops used historical expected cost budgets for the study area from the university of georgia 2020 forest crop costs were calculated as the sum of average annual costs over a 25 years rotation including fertilizers herbicides machine planting mechanical site preparation and prescribed burning maggard and barlow 2016 land use conversion cost estimates were obtained from the university of georgia 2020 the costs of switching forest to agricultural lands are at least 4942 ha and 6177 ha for softwood pine and hardwoods respectively based on consultation with field experts the above costs include costs for excavator services to pull and pile stumps and clear the land of stumps conversion costs from bermuda hay to other agricultural croplands were estimated at 179 12 ha considering incurred costs for prepping lands with necessary fertilizer and herbicide application the hydrological parameters were from the swat model they were produced by the swat model consisting of crop yields surface runoff and phosphorus load the swat model was initially calibrated over five years 1997 2001 and validated over four years 2002 2005 at the outlet the model considers seven land use types bermuda hay corn cotton peanut forest classified as hardwood and softwood and barren land barren lands were assumed to produce zero tp loadings a summary of data sources is presented in table 6 3 results 3 1 swat modeling results 3 1 1 swat calibration and validation the calibration process for the lrew started with 36 hydrologic and biophysical parameters after 1000 simulations the most sensitive flow and biophysical parameters were identified and these are listed in table 7 in order of decreasing sensitivity the most sensitive parameters were effective hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium in the main channel ch k2 rte groundwater delay time gw delay gw the fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline dlai plant dat runoff curve number 2 cn2 mgt and available water capacity of the soil layer sol awc sol parameter values should be considered after calibration to avoid unrealistic simulations for instance the fitted values for sol awc in the swat model for crops and forest soil ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 which was comparable to the measured weighted average sol awc of 0 057 for the tifton soil series by hubbard 1985 cn2 for the main crops and forest evergreen and deciduous were reduced by 12 resulting in a better adjustment to streamflow predictions the model fit was deemed satisfactory for streamflow calibration and validation with a daily kge of 0 80 and 0 71 and pbias of 2 5 and 3 8 respectively the observed streamflow tp sediment loads the model best fit and the 95 ppu band for calibration and validation periods are shown in and after the model was calibrated for hydrology and biophysical parameters the narrow ranges for selected parameter values were fixed and the model was calibrated for sediment load at the watershed outlet using 14 parameters the swat model for tp sediment loads and streamflow are shown in table 8 for the calibration and validation periods fig 5 the most sensitive parameters for sediment load were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment re entrained in channel sediment routing spexp bsn a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be re entrained during channel sediment routing spcon bsn and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant the spexp and spcon are parameters used to calculate the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported from a reach the fitted value for spexp and spcon in our model was 1 210 and 0 001 respectively the daily kge was 0 43 and 0 57 for the calibration and validation period respectively with pbias of 2 5 for the calibration period and 0 2 for the validation periods table 8 the most sensitive tp parameters were residue decomposition coefficient rsdco bsn phosphorus enrichment ratio for loading with sediment erorgp hru and the cover factor for the effect of land cover on erosion usle c plant table 7 the fitted value for rsdco and erorgp was 0 07 and 2 58 respectively the daily kge for tp load was 0 63 with pbias of 0 4 for the calibration period and kge of 0 35 with pbias of 2 8 for the validation period the model performance for daily tp at the watershed outlet was evaluated as satisfactory with daily kge 0 35 and pbias 30 the lower kge for the validation period was expected because the observation data for tp loads were sparse for that period compared with daily observations for streamflow 3 1 2 nutrient contribution since this study focuses on reducing tp concentration the swat model results are presented only fortp and sediment upon calibration and validation in swat tp loading linked to a given hru for each day for each year was summed across days to arrive at annual values before averaging across all years for each hru fig 6 a comparison of tp loadings by crop type is presented in fig 7 average annual tp loadings in fig 7 were the lowest for forest land cover softwood was associated with slightly higher loads estimated at 0 023 kg ha per year compared with 0 021 kg ha per year for hardwoods bermuda was reflective of the highest tp load out of the six crops at 0 396 kg ha per year a previous study reports that tp from pasture has the range of 0 14 4 90 kg ha yr which covers our annual average tp load reckhow et al 1980 similarly cotton shows a fairly large number of outliers in the upper range averaging 0 252 kg ha per year peanut and corn trail behind with estimated average annual loads of 0 081 and 0 072 kg ha respectively 3 2 economic modeling results 3 2 1 summary statistics for economic variables and parameters fig 8 presents an overview of the key variables parameters including crop yields y j i t revenues p j i t y j i t crop production costs i j t and sub basin level tp concentration used for calculating mean tp concentration μ jt fig 8a shows that hay and woody crops have a relatively higher mean yield and woody crops tend to have larger variability compared to other crops overall cotton and peanut are the most valuable crops among the study crops as shown in fig 8b nevertheless corn cotton hay and peanut are also relatively costly compared to woody crops 3 2 2 impact of water pollution reduction on profit changes profit estimates obtained from the deterministic and stochastic dynamic optimization models under seven water pollution reduction scenarios are presented in fig 9a in the deterministic model the total profit is estimated to be 1340 ha yr when the water quality standard remains constant over the study period scenario 0 however it declines from 1340 ha yr to 695 ha yr i e a 48 reduction when the water quality regulation switches from the no restriction scenario scenario 0 to the strictest scenario scenario 6 in the case of the stochastic model the results shown in fig 9a reveal the impact of the policy uncertainty on profits under three probabilistic scenarios i e 90 95 and 99 described in eqs 9 and10 these stochastic optimization results assume a 90 95 and 99 chance to meet the water quality standard respectively instead of the 50 assumed in the deterministic model overall the stochastic model results have a similar pattern as the deterministic results but have relatively lower profit estimates the estimated total profit with a 95 chance to meet the regulation under scenarios 0 and 6 are 1340 ha yr and 562 ha yr respectively for the comparison among different probabilistic scenarios the estimated profit using the 99 chance constraint is consistently lower than using 90 across the six non baseline scenarios the estimates with a 95 chance constraint are somewhere between the ones for 90 and 99 for instance under scenario 6 the profit estimates decrease from 587 ha yr to 521 ha yr when the required probability of meeting the policy standard increases from 90 to 99 this outcome implies that when the model requires a higher chance to fulfill the water quality standard the land use structure is forced to shift to crops with a lower profit but generate less pollution more detail about the associated land use change is presented in section 3 2 4 fig 9c and fig 9d present the associated tp changes under scenarios 1 and 6 respectively given each model type overall the results show that the concentration follows the water quality improvement path scenarios and natural fluctuation as illustrated in fig 4 and fig 7 respectively in addition average tp i e the average tp concentration over the study period has the lowest amount under scenario 6 and the highest amount when no policy is enforced scenario 0 for the comparison among the model types tp concentration in the stochastic model is consistently equal to or higher than in deterministic ones numerically speaking that is the consequence of adding a positive squared root in eq 10 hence the stochastic constraint results in a higher tp amount than the deterministic constraint i e eq 8 the implication of this outcome indicates that considering the uncertainty of the tp concentration leads to a higher average water pollution amount fig 9e moving from scenario 0 to scenario 6 the corresponding average tp concentration reduces by 39 under sp50 dy and reduces by 45 under sp95 dy in a moderate case moving from scenario 0 to scenario 4 the corresponding average tp concentration decreases by 11 and 16 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively the tradeoff between tp reduction and estimated profits changes for the deterministic yield models is shown in fig 9 f in summary the deterministic tp models have a higher profit and lower resulting tp concentration than the stochastic tp models among different policy scenarios stricter regulation scenarios result in lower profits and tp loads than loose regulation scenarios among different degrees of uncertainty i e sp90 sp95 sp99 the resulting tp loads are not necessarily lower as the constraint assurance level increases that is because the objective function of the optimization model is profit maximization instead of tp load minimization moreover the resulting tp loads are determined by the composition of a variety of land use rather being determined by the dominant land use type alone more details refer to section 3 2 4 note that scenarios 1 2 and 3 have similar estimated results so the corresponding lines and dots overlap 3 2 3 impact of regulation and crop yield uncertainties on profit changes the results obtained from the simulation process are shown in fig 9b the mean profit estimates under scenario 0 and scenario 6 estimated by the sp50 sy model are 1268 ha yr and 617 ha yr respectively both estimates are lower than the result with certain crop yields sp50 dy which are 1340 ha yr and 695 ha yr as presented in fig 9a this indicates uncertain crop yields result in a reduction in profits similarly the sp95 sy model result imposed a 95 chance constraint on water quality follows a similar pattern but produces overall lower profits the mean profit results estimated by the sp95 sy under scenario 0 and scenario 6 are 1268 ha yr and 483 ha yr respectively table 8 shows the equality tests for the means and variance of the aggregated profits between sp50 sy and sp95 sy across different scenarios the test result suggests that the mean profits are significantly different between sp50 sy and sp95 sy across scenarios 1 6 implying that the tp concentration and crop yield uncertainties result in lower mean profits nevertheless the variance is significantly different at the 95 confidence level only under scenario 6 in summary our results show that landowners profits are largely affected by land use water quality improvement processes and uncertainty of crop yields the results suggest that providing a more extended time period to tighten the water quality standard e g scenarios 1 3 can mitigate profit losses from rapidly switching from high profit but high pollutant croplands to forestlands however it results in higher average tp concentration on the other hand the adoption of more ambitious pollution mitigation e g scenario 6 leads to significantly lower aggregated profits and lower average tp concentration namely better water quality table 9 3 2 4 impact of water pollution reduction on land use changes to understand the underlying mechanism of the above profit changes land use changes over the study period are investigated figs 10 and 11 illustrate the dominant and second dominant land use type transition in each sub basin in both deterministic sp50 dy and stochastic sp90 dy sp95 dy sp99 dy dynamic optimization models under scenario 6 from year 0 1997 to year 8 2005 the initial land use type is dominated by corn and softwood and land use changes start in year 1 1998 deterministic model results upper panels in fig 10 show that most croplands are used for planting cotton and sometimes peanut since cotton and peanut are two most profitable crops when the water quality standard becomes stricter as time passes the share of the hardwood land increases as hardwood has the lowest tp concentration among all crops in some periods of time the share of peanut replaces cotton because peanut is one of the most profitable crops but produces relatively less tp as shown in fig 7 the lower panels in fig 10 show the stochastic dynamic optimization model results using the chance constraint equation eq 10 the resulting optimization model allows a specific chance e g 90 95 and 99 of achieving the water quality regulation standard a comparison of the deterministic and stochastic models reveals that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard facilitate the speed of the dominant land use type transition from croplands to forestlands and magnify the share of forestlands overall this outcome reflects the consequence of lower profits when uncertainties of meeting the policy standard are considered fig 11 shows the transitions for the second dominant land use type under different model types note that sub basins in white indicate that there is no second dominant land type the result shows that sub basins which have cotton or peanut two most profitable crops as the dominant land use before the water quality regulation comes into effect tend to not have the second dominant land use this outcome likely is the consequence of maximizing profits because the profit maximization objective leads to picking up the most profitable crop in the first place if the model picks some less profitable crops for some parts of sub basins the resulting profit won t be the maximum 4 discussion our study shows croplands can increase landowners profit while deteriorating the water quality this finding is aligned with previous studies investigating the relationship between water quality and agriculture in georgia united states bosch et al 2020 analyzed 41 years of water quality data from the little river experimental watershed in south georgia reporting that chloride cl concentration has increased steadily possibly due to increased fertilization in the selected watershed bawa and dwivedi 2019 found that agriculture was positively associated with increased groundwater pollutants in the suwanee river basin dalton and frick 2008 analyzed pesticide concentrations across 128 wells in southwest georgia between 1993 and 2005 and detected six compounds atrazine deethylatrazine metolachlor alachlor fluometuron and tebuthiuron in more than 20 of samples it was also found that pesticide concentrations increased in seven wells over the selected period of the study similarly other studies have also found that agriculture affects water quality in georgia duffy et al 2020 fisher et al 2000 yong and chen 2002 one of the most common practices to reduce nonpoint pollution from agriculture is to change existing croplands to forestlands although previous studies clarke et al 2015 rodgers et al 2010 indicate that forests may deteriorate the water quality for a short period at the stage of planting and harvesting this study covers a relatively longer duration it shows that forests play a crucial role in improving water quality over time the benefit of forestlands for improving water quality is supported by several other existing studies for example tu 2011b analyzed 43 watersheds spread across north georgia and found that the percentage of land under forest cover was inversely related to the level of pollutants found in the water of selected watersheds similar results were found in a southern appalachian mountain study the relationship between levels of forest cover and water quality was investigated and showed that a higher percentage of forest cover is associated with lower suspended sediment concentrations and sediment loads jackson et al 2017 improving water quality by forests is particularly effective when forest landowners properly implement silviculture bmps cristan et al 2016 specifically griffiths et al 2017 investigated the effect of forestry bmps for short rotation pine on water quality in the upper coastal plain of the southeastern united states and showed that watersheds with intensive forestry management effectively improve water quality over time rivenbark and jackson 2004 studied bmps applied in streamside management zones smzs in the georgia piedmont and indicated that reduction of bare ground better dispersal of road runoff the introduction of hydraulic resistance to likely flow paths and targeted extensions of smz width could prevent concentrated overland flow and associated sediment from reaching stream channels bmps in smzs also are a substantial ameliorating effect on sediment transport from concentrated overland flows on clearcut sites ward and jackson 2004 the role of forestry bmps on water quality becomes more critical as the implementation rate of forestry bmps in georgia has significantly risen historically and typically equals or exceeds 90 in recent years dwivedi et al 2018 one of the issues emerging from land use changes and bmp implementation is how to create a relevant monetary incentive to encourage the adoption of bmps and what the compensation amount for property owners would be the results of the dwid modeling approach developed and extended in this study help us to understand the potential compensation needed for landowners to convert croplands to forestlands for improving water quality over time specifically fig 9 shows that when scenario 0 switches to scenario 6 the corresponding profit drops from 1340 ha yr to 695 ha yr under sp50 dy and 562 ha yr under sp95 dy the associated pollution reduction is 39 and 45 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively the implication of this result indicates that the resulting differences of 645 ha yr 1340 ha yr 695 ha yr and 778 ha yr 1340 ha yr 562 ha yr between scenarios 0 and 6 under each model type can be viewed as proxies for willingness to pay of the agricultural sector to decrease tp concentrations by 39 and 45 similarly in a moderate case the profit reduces from 1340 ha yr to 1315 ha yr under sp50 dy and to 1108 ha yr under sp95 dy as scenario 0 changes to scenario 4 the corresponding pollution level decreases by 11 and 16 under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively this result indicates that the willingness to pay to decrease tp concentrations by 11 and 16 from scenario 0 to scenario 4 are 25 ha yr and 232 ha yr under sp50 dy and sp95 dy respectively although the clean water act specifically exempts agriculture and silviculture the above compensation payment estimates made to agricultural landowners provide relevant insights to policymakers about the cost of improving water quality by encouraging and compensating some property owners for their voluntary participation in clean water act activities such as the implementation of bmps at the watershed scale 5 conclusion this study investigated the tradeoff between agricultural economic losses and potential water quality regulations at the watershed level over time specifically this study applied a stochastic dynamic mathematical programming method to investigate the relationship between land use changes and water quality while considering uncertainties of meeting the water quality regulation the result shows that without considering the uncertainty of meeting the water quality criteria the estimated profit is between 1340 ha yr and 695 ha yr during the study period varying by different water quality regulation scenarios however when considering the uncertainty of achieving the water quality standard the profit estimates ranged between 1340 ha yr and 562 ha yr i e a reduction of 55 relative to the deterministic baseline results this suggests that considering the uncertainty of satisfying the water quality criteria which is more informative provides more conservative profit estimates the positive relationship between losses and the degree of uncertainty is also aligned with zhou et al 2018 but this study provides further insights into the dynamic relationship between profits land use changes and water quality the result also indicates a higher profit when providing a more extended period to tighten the water quality standard furthermore the findings also show that uncertainties of meeting the water quality standard facilitate the speed of the land use transition from croplands to forest lands and magnify the share of forestlands highlighting the crucial role of forests in improving water quality in georgia in addition this study also examined how the profit changes while having uncertain crop yields on top of the uncertainty of meeting the water quality regulation the result was derived from the simulation technique and showed that the estimated profit further down to 1268 ha yr 483 ha yr i e about 6 59 lower than the sp50 dy model varying by different policy trajectory scenarios similarly profit estimates are higher under policy trajectory scenarios with a more extended adaptation period to tighten the water quality standard namely the result indicates that providing a more extended period to tighten the water quality standard scenarios 1 3 can mitigate economic losses by rapidly switching from high profit but high pollutant croplands to forestlands this suggests that once policymakers determine the water quality standard giving landowners sufficient time to adopt the policy and adjusting land use can help landowners secure their profit while improving water quality our study demonstrated that taking the uncertainty of meeting the water quality regulations and the uncertainty of crop yields into account reflects a more informative optimization setting and produces a more conservative profit estimate our findings suggest the importance of setting future crop yield and policy expectations for landowners when landowners face lower yield variance i e fewer uncertainties their profit appears to be higher hence providing precise crop yield forecast information based on long term climate e g el niño decadal climate variation pattern prediction fan et al 2017 wang et al 2021 or promoting crop insurance could help landowners encounter fewer uncertainties and secure their profit further work is needed to identify the effect of climate change on land use change moreover this study assumes farmers make a decision as individually independent profit maximizers more information on how social networks affect the proposed land use model would help us to establish a greater degree of accuracy on related findings this study also used default swat assumptions for modeling forestlands located in the study area further work is needed to improve the assumptions for precisely defining the role of forestlands in improving the water quality relative to actual forest practices undertaken by forest landowners in the study area we hope that the insights developed in the study could feed into watershed level planning and management initiatives worldwide to strike a balance between economics and environmental quality to ensure

9404,continuous applications of lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf to the field have achieved substantial improvements in soil physicochemical properties and crop yields in multiple regions throughout china however the effects of lbf on crop growth and water and fertilizer productivity in saline sodic farmlands were scarcely understood thus in this study a two year field experiment with six treatments including a control treatment without any organic fertilizer ck a treatment amended with 21 t ha 1sheep manure sm and four treatments amended with 1 5 lbf1 3 lbf2 4 5 lbf3 and 7 5 t ha 1 lbf4 lbf was conducted in 2019 and 2020 in the hetao irrigation district hid an area known for its saline sodic conditions located at the upper yellow river basin china the results showed that the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments improved plant height leaf area index and dry biomass by 8 76 7 cm 0 3 2 4 and 309 402 g plant 1 respectively in comparison with the ck treatment the root length root surface area and root volume in the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment was 18 3 99 7 m 464 6 2022 6 cm2 and 7 6 46 4 cm3 larger than that in the ck treatment respectively average yield water productivity partial nitrogen productivity and economical gain in the lbf treatments were up to 2 2 t ha 1 0 4 kg m 3 23 6 kg kg 1 and 6100 chinese yuan ha 1 respectively substantially higher than those of the ck treatment in addition compared with sm treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments also significantly improved sunflower growth and water and nitrogen productivity the results of structural equation model analysis and linear regression analysis showed that lbf2 and lbf3 treatments improved sunflower root growth mainly through improving absorption of soil nitrogen furthermore the root indices had a significant positive relation with the sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and economic profits showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf a comprehensive assessment of the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and cost versus economic suggested that an application rate of 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer is optimal for achieving a sustainable improvement of crop yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands keywords bioorganic fertilizer farmland reclamation lignite fertilizer saline sodic soil crop water use 1 introduction soil salinization has become one of the key constraints for the sustainable development of global agriculture around the world the total area of saline and sodic soil is approximately 397 and 434 million hectares respectively ghosh et al 2017 every year about 1 2 of arable land is lost due to serious soil salinization in many regions including asia africa north america and other regions daliakopoulos et al 2016 in saline sodic farmlands agricultural development was limited by soil salinization low soil fertility and organic matter and poor soil quality additionally the loss of agricultural land is accelerating due to salination and overuse of mineral fertilizer therefore ameliorative methods need to be taken to improve the crop productivity in saline sodic soil for sustainable crop production and regenerative agriculture in recent years the application of organic amendments is considered as a promising practice to improve soil structure hydrological functions organic matter microbial diversity and richness carbon budget and then crop production mahmood et al 2017 kalu et al 2021 many types of organic amendments including farmyard manure humic acid and raw lignite or its products were always applied to improve crop productivity amoah antwi et al 2020 however the different characteristics of those organic amendments such as raw materials and production conditions caused the different effects of organic amendments on crop growth moreover the soil types salinity conditions and crops also resulted in different impacts of organic amendments on soils and crops erktan et al 2020 farmyard manure fym is one of the most widely used organic amendments which is easily available and sustainable because it is derived from agricultural waste products without energy production processes siedt et al 2021 many studies have reported that applying fym can increase soil organic matter and improve crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity loper et al 2010 zhen et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 for example iqbal et al 2019 found that the application of poultry manure improved rice yield with high nitrogen use efficiency mahmood et al 2017 evaluated the influence of fym on maize yield and found that fym 15 t ha 1 increased soil organic carbon by 85 90 and improved maize yield by 52 77 in a lyallpur soil with a ph of 7 0 however gai et al 2018 had reported that the application of fym decreased the nitrogen use efficiency in fluvo aquic soil in addition wang et al 2021 was found that the water use efficiency of wheat was 5 9 improved by the application of fym but the maize water use efficiency was decreased by 6 10 in loam soil therefore the performance of fym on water and nitrogen use efficiency varies with soil types and crops moreover the above studies had reported the influence of fym on crop growth water and nitrogen productivity but most of those studies were conducted in neutral or acid soil there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis and understanding of if and how crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity are improved through the addition of fym in saline sodic soil lignite also named brown coal was usually used for power generation but its efficiency was very low akimbekov et al 2020 however lignite with physiochemistry properties such as extensive surface area complex porous structure rich humic substances and organic carbon is considered a good amendment for improving crop production especially for degraded lands akimbekov et al 2020 in addition the organic carbon in the lignite decomposed slowly and existed in soil for a long time which could increase soil organic matter for a long time therefore in recent years lignite received attention from researchers as a potential soil conditioner to improve crop growth and water and nitrogen use efficiency tsetsegmaa et al 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 studies have demonstrated that applying lignite or lignite fertilizer can improve soil organic matter in turn increasing nutrient holding and water retention ability as well as crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency dubey et al 2019 sun et al 2020 for instance saha et al 2017 2018 had reported that the application of lignite could delay the nitrogen release and improve nitrogen retention in the soil thus improving the nitrogen use efficiency of silver beet similarly schillem et al 2019 reported that the application of lignite improved wheat growth nitrogen and water use efficiency even at low application rates 5 t ha 1 although the application of lignite or lignite fertilizer has been demonstrated to improve crop and vegetable yields water use efficiency and nitrogen productivity almost all those studies were conducted in normal farmland and few were conducted in saline sodic farmland in fact sunflower is a widely planted crop in saline sodic farmland however to the best of our knowledge few researches on the impacts of lignite or lignite fertilizer on sunflower growth water and nitrogen productivity were conducted in saline sodic farmland besides the application rates of lignite or lignite fertilizer products were usually based on various recommendations by manufacturers little et al 2014 dyko et al 2015 tran et al 2015 in studies of nan et al 2016 schillem et al 2019 and akimbekov et al 2020 the optimal application rates of lignite or lignite fertilizer were 1 5 t ha 1 5 t ha 1 and 1 g kg 1 in a saline sodic farmland soil without crops in a medium sand soil with the growth of wheat in the greenhouse and in a sandy loam soil with potato growth in the greenhouse respectively therefore the optimal application rate varies with soil types and crops above all the influence of lignite or lignite fertilizer on sunflower growth water and nitrogen productivity and their optimal application rates need to be further explored in saline sodic farmland thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on sunflower growth yield and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands the experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district hid located in the upper yellow river basin china where crop growth was severely constrained by salinization in this study sheep manure sm and lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf were tested we hypothesized that the application of lbf and sm would have a positive impact on sunflower growth and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands the specific objectives of our research are 1 to assess the effects of lbf on sunflower growth 2 to study the impacts of lbf on sunflower yield water and nitrogen productivity and 3 to determine an effective application rate of lbf for crop yield total economic gains and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands 2 materials and methods

sodic farmland with poor physical and chemical properties in 2019 and 2020 the groundwater table depth ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 m and 0 99 1 7 m respectively meteorological information including rainfall air temperature wind speed at 2 m and relative humidity were measured once every half an hour by an automatic weather station hobo u30 usa that was placed at about 150 m from the experimental field the details of rainfall and air temperatures during the sunflower growth period are presented in fig s1 in the field experiment six treatments a control treatment without any organic fertilizer ck a treatment amended with 21 t ha 1 sheep manure and four other treatments amended by lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 1 5 lbf1 3 lbf2 4 5 lbf3 and 7 5 t ha 1 lbf4 respectively the application rate of 21 t ha 1 was recommended by local farmers and the rate of lignite bioorganic fertilizer was based on manufacturers recommended value of 3 t ha 1 each treatment had three replications all plots were arranged following a randomized block design in this study and each plot had an area of 126 m2 7 m 18 m the lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf is a novel biochemically processed lignite product it has been certified by the omri and eu as an organic fertilizer and soil conditioner provided by apaxfon bioscience and technologies ltd co apaxfon baotou inner mongolia china lbf is produced with lignite through a series of physicochemical and biochemical reactions based on analytical data from apaxfon it contains a portfolio of organic compounds ranging from large humic matter to small soluble organic acids the basic properties of lbf and sm are listed in table s1 the sunflower guaner no 1 which is the common crop planted in saline sodic farmlands was sowed on june 2nd and harvested on september 16th in 2019 it was sowed on june 5th and harvested on september 18th in 2020 the entire growth period of the sunflower was divided into four growth stages including seeding budding flowering and maturing stage the details regarding the growth stages of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 are listed in table s2 the wide narrow row alternate model with a wide row spacing of 100 cm and narrow row spacing of 40 cm was adopted in this study making the average row spacing of 70 cm plant spacing was about 50 cm with a plant density of approximately 28 500 plants ha 1 the narrow row was covered by a black plastic film with a width of 70 cm and a thickness of 0 008 mm sm and lbf were supplied as base fertilizer prior to seeding specifically the lbf and sm were spread evenly over the experimental plot and then the tillage method was adopted to mix lbf and sm with soil in 0 20 cm depth for chemical fertilizer 81 0 kg ha 1 n 90 3 kg ha 1 p 30 kg ha 1 k were applied before seeding and 25 2 kg ha 1 n 9 2 kg ha 1 p 5 0 kg ha 1 k was applied during the budding stage of sunflowers the sources for the chemical fertilizers were nh₄ ₂hpo₄ and k2o respectively in order to reduce the limitations of salinity and sodicity on crop emergence 1800 m3 ha 1 water from the yellow river was applied to the field before seeding there was no irrigation during the growing period of sunflowers after the implementation of the leaching irrigation the average ec and ph value was 0 38 ds m 1 and 9 7 respectively 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 water consumption and productivity the soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method li et al 2021 soil samples were collected using an auger every 10 cm for the 20 cm upper and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm in the middle of the plots every ten days during the sunflower growing season each treatment had three replications soil sample of each point was divided into two parts one was for measuring soil moisture and the other was for measuring soil nutrients the 0 100 cm soil layer was considered to calculate total water consumption of sunflower using the soil water balance method eq 1 the water use efficiency wue

determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china ak was determined by the ammonium acetate extraction flame photometry method ap was determined by the sodium bicarbonate extraction mo sb colorimetry method li et al 2021 2 2 3 plant growth of sunflower in this study main sunflower growth indexes including the leaf area index lai plant height cm and dry biomass g plant 1 were selected to represent sunflower growth conditions three plants in each plot were selected for measuring lai and plant height every 10 days in order to avoid the edge effects the three plants were chosen based on an even growth distribution and location in other words randomly selected from the middle area of the plot all the leaves of the sunflower plant were cut down and the length and width were measured by a ruler the leaf area index was calculated using eq 6 yang 2019 the plant height of sunflower was measured by tapeline after the measurement of lai and plant height the plants were cut down and put into the oven to de enzyme 105 for 30 min before being dried to a constant weight at 85 for measurement of dry biomass during the late maturing stage sunflowers from a 10 m2 area in each plot were

0 40 cm soil layer root samples in the 0 40 cm soil layer were taken in this study root samples within an area of 40 cm 40 cm around the root were dug out by a spade from 0 to 40 cm soil layers during each stage of the sunflower budding flowering and maturity all root samples were carefully washed and then scanned by a scanner epson perfection v700 the root length surface area and diameter of the

package in r language software the principal component analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the application of lbf and sm on soil quality using origin 2021 software structural equation modeling sem for evaluating the direct and indirect correlations between the soil nutrient and root growth was performed in amos v 21 0 software amos ibm usa 3 results 3 1 soil nutrients and sunflower growth the available nitrogen in the ck treatment was 5 7 69 1 kg ha 1 and 16 0 90 8 kg ha 1 higher than those in the sm and lbf treatments in 2019 and 2020 at the mature stage respectively fig 1 for available phosphorus at the mature stage the lbf2 to lbf4 treatments increased soil available phosphorus in 2019 and 2020 in comparison with the ck treatment respectively for available potassium there was little difference in available potassium among the lbf treatments and the ck treatment at the mature stage in 2019 and 2020 as shown in fig 2 the lbf3 treatment obtained the highest plant heights about 16 3 32 3 cm and 19 7 76 7 cm higher than the ck treatment across all sunflower growth stages in 2019 and 2020 respectively following the lbf3 treatment the lbf2 treatment had the second largest plant height plant heights between the sm and ck treatments were similar for lai fig 2c d the difference in lai between the sm and ck treatments was marginally noticeable while the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased lai by 0 4 2 1 and 0 7 2 4 in 2019 and 0 6 2 1 and 0 3 2 4 in 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment for dry biomass fig 2e f across all growth stages of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 the dry biomass of the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments was higher than those of the ck and sm treatments for example at the mature stage of sunflower compared with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased dry biomass by 334 7 and 340 3 g plant 1 in 2019 and 309 and 412 g plant 1 in 2020 respectively the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments markedly increased dry biomass by 181 8 and 187 4 g plant 1 in 2019 and 239 and 341 9 in 2020 g plant 1 respectively in comparison with the sm treatment as shown in fig 3 the highest root length was obtained in the lbf3 treatment across all sunflower growth stages in 2019 and 2020 with the sole exception of the budding stage during 2019 the root length in the lbf3 treatment was 39 2 66 0 and 99 7 m longer than the ck treatment during the budding flowering and mature stages of sunflowers in 2019 respectively those values were 22 2 68 4 and 70 5 m in 2020 respectively following the lbf3 treatment the lbf2 treatment had the second longest root length during the growing period of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 for the root surface area in comparison with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased the root surface area by 636 1 717 9 cm2 and 1031 5 1978 2 cm2 in 2019 and 671 1215 3 cm2 and 464 6 2022 6 cm2 in 2020 respectively the lbf2 and lbf3 significantly improved the root volume by 12 4 19 4 cm3 and 21 1 38 2 cm3 in 2019 and 10 6 24 1 cm3 and 7 6 46 3 cm3 in 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment there was no significant difference in the root volume between the sm and ck treatments above all the values of root growth indexes were the highest in the lbf3 treatment followed closely by the lbf2 treatment 3 2 yield partial nitrogen productivity water productivity and net profits as shown in table 1 compared with the ck treatment the lbf3 treatment increased the yield by 2 5 and 1 9 t ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively while the sm treatment only augmented the yield by 1 2 and 0 7 t ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in crop yield between the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment furthermore the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly improved the partial productivity of nitrogen by 19 and 23 6 kg kg 1 and 16 3 and 17 9 kg kg 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 1 also shows that compared with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments decreased sunflower water consumption by 114 5 and 273 9 mm and 95 8 and 223 5 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the wp of the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment were 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 higher than that of the ck treatment compared with the sm treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments also decreased water consumption and improved the wp in 2019 and 2020 it is worth noting that the difference in sunflower yield between the ck and lbf4 treatment was scarcely noticeable but water consumption in the lbf4 treatment was 475 4 and 123 1 mm lower than that in the ck treatment for net profits the lbf2 treatment obtained the highest net profits with a value of 19 9 and 17 9 thousand cny ha 1 respectively in 2019 and 2020 followed by the lbf3 treatment which was about 6 6 and 1 7 thousand cny ha 1 higher than the ck treatment in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment the sm treatment reduced the net profits by 3 3 and 6 8 thousand cny ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively negative returns lied in the lbf4 treatment implying that over application of lbf can create a loss or deficit for farmers 3 3 relationships among soil nutrients sunflower root growth and plant growth the sem was applied to evaluate the potential mechanism of soil nutrients on sunflower roots growth fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the path coefficient between available nitrogen and root surface area was 0 54 in addition root surface area had significant positive path coefficients with root volume and length moreover the standardized total effects of available nitrogen on root indices were all negative fig 4b d indicating that there was a negative relationship between available nitrogen and root indices a significant positive relationship between available phosphorus and root volume was found in the sem showing that available phosphorus had a significant positive influence on the root volume fig 4 also shows that soil available potassium had no significant influence on root growth to further investigate the impact of sunflower roots growth on sunflower plant growth the linear regression models were conducted and illustrated in fig s2 as shown in fig s2 all regression coefficients were significant at p 0 01 level indicating that root indices had significant influence on sunflower plant growth including plant height lai and dry biomass in addition the explained variance of dry biomass plant height and lai by root indices was 54 67 43 61 and 27 42 respectively indicating that root indices had more influence on dry biomass than on plant height and lai fig s3 shows that the root indices had significant impact on sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity for sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity the root indices explained over 50 of the variance of sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity indicating that the sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity were largely impacted by roots growth however the root indices only explained 8 16 of the variance of water productivity suggesting that root growth was not the main factor that impacted sunflower water productivity 3 4 relationships between application rate of lbf and yield np wp and pnp in this study the yield and partial productivity of nitrogen both showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf indicating that application of approximately 3 8 and 4 0 t ha 1 lbf would obtain the highest yield and partial productivities of nitrogen fig 5a and d respectively the economical returns of the addition of lbf were calculated using the cost benefit analysis method the results in fig 5b shows that the optimal application rate of lbf to saline sodic soil was 2 6 t ha 1 in which farmers could obtain 19 4 thousand cny ha 1 in this study the quadratic function was also used to fit the water productivity versus the addition of lbf and showed that the optimal application rate of lbf was 3 3 t ha 1 in which the water productivity improvement was the best 4 discussion 4 1 effects of lignite bioorganic fertilizer on sunflower growth in recent years some previous studies had explored the impacts of lignite or its commercial products on crop growth and yield chandrakant et al 2019 akimbekov et al 2020 however the impacts of lignite and its products on sunflower growth and yield in saline sodic farmland were rarely evaluated in this study we found that the application of lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 and 4 5 t ha 1 had a significantly positive influence on plant height leaf area index and dry biomass in saline sodic farmland fig 2 this result indicated that the lbf also could be used for improving crops growth in saline sodic farmland the reason for this result was probably that application of lbf with optimal rate could increase the growth of sunflower roots this explanation was proved by the results that the root length surface area and volume had a significant positive relation with sunflower plant height lai and dry biomass fig s2 however previous studies about the effects of lignite or its products on crop growth scarcely focused on crop root growth in this study the results confirmed that the root traits including root length surface area and volume were all promoted by the application of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 and 4 5 t ha 1 fig 2 there were two mechanisms for improved sunflower growth by amendment of lbf with optimal rate firstly the application of lbf with an optimal rate could improve soil physicochemical properties i e improving soil porosity and water stable aggregation increasing soil organic matter and decreasing salinity tsetsegmaa et al 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 application of lbf with optimal rate improved soil physicochemical properties because the lbf contains high organic matter which could increase soil water stable aggregation and soil cation exchange capacity shao 2006 the complex interpore structure of lbf also created pores between the lignite bio organic fertilizer particles and surrounding soil aggregations which could decrease soil bulk density and increase soil porosity structure li et al 2021 all those improved soil physicochemical properties will inevitably affect crop root growth tsetsegmaa et al 2018 secondly the nitrogen release rate is delayed by the application of lbf which could increase the nitrogen uptake of sunflower roots saha et al 2017 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 we found that soil available nitrogen content had a significant negative relation with sunflower root growth fig 4 the reason for the negative relationship between soil available nitrogen content and sunflower root growth was probably that the sunflower roots increased the absorption of soil available nitrogen which resulted in lower soil available nitrogen in the soil 4 2 effects of lignite bioorganic fertilizer on sunflower yield and water and nitrogen productivity studies had showed that the application of lbf had significant positive impacts on crop yield chandrakant et al 2019 in this study compared with the ck treatment application of lbf with proper rate significantly improved sunflower yield this result was similar to the result of akimbekov et al 2020 who found that the application of lignite based fertilizer improved potato yield by 66 4 however in the saline sodic farmland the influence of lbf on sunflower nitrogen productivity and water use efficiency was scarcely explored as expected in this study we found that the amendment of lbf with 3 0 4 5 t ha 1 significantly improved the partial productivity of nitrogen and water productivity in comparison with the ck treatment the reason for this result was probably that application of lbf improved the sunflower roots growth this explanation could be proved by the result in fig s3 in which the root length root surface area and root volume had a significant positive relation with sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity and those three root indices could explain 55 67 and 56 68 variance of yield and partial nitrogen productivity respectively it is worth noting that the root growth only explained 8 16 of the variance of water productivity this result showed that the water productivity was not mainly impacted by root growth in this study it is reasonable because the root growth might directly impact sunflower transpiration but soil evaporation was also impacted by soil properties in saline sodic farmlands therefore the influence of root growth on water productivity was lower than that on sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity furthermore in this study we found that the water consumption of sunflower in the lbf3 treatments were significantly lower than that in the ck treatment in 2019 and there was no significant difference of water consumption of sunflower among the ck and lbf treatments this result was reasonable because the total water consumption of sunflower was composed of evaporation and transpiration the application of lbf with proper rate could improve sunflower growth and thus increased transpiration of sunflower in comparison with the ck treatment in contrast it also could result in more reduction of evaporation than the ck treatment did through increasing plant height and lai fig 2 thus there is a trade off relation between sunflower transpiration and soil evaporation the ultimately impacts of lbf on water consumption of sunflower may vary with different weather condition it is worth noting that the difference in sunflower yield between the ck and lbf4 treatment was scarcely noticeable but water consumption in the lbf4 treatment was lower than that in the ck treatment a possible reason for this was that the lbf4 treatment increased soil salinity in comparison with the ck treatment which increased more accumulation of salinity on the soil surface that prevented soil evaporation moreover the sunflower was rainfed in this study this is similar to the study of zhen et al 2014 in fact irrigation is necessary for crop production in the study area due to the semiarid temperate continental climate with an annual rainfall of 160 mm however according to our previous studies most sunflower plants were heavily injured or died after irrigation during the growing season the reason was probably that in heavy saline sodic soils the salt accumulated on the soil surface was dissolved by irrigation water which caused serious salt stress in the root zone and this stress lasted for a long time due to the poor pore structure of saline sodic soils therefore no irrigation during the growing season has been widely adopted as common practice for sunflower growing in saline sodic soils in the study area the shallow ground water can provide enough water to meet the requirements of plant growth however to achieve high production irrigation is still required for sunflowers planted in non saline and slight saline sodic soils in this study area moreover in this study compared with ck treatment the sm treatment significantly improved the sunflower yield and nitrogen productivity table 1 however the performance of sm for improving sunflower yield and nitrogen productivity in the saline sodic farmland was more ineffective than that of lbf2 and lbf3 treatments we attributed the improved performance of lbf to large stable organic matter and soluble organic acids which improved soil quality and then improved absorption of soil nutrients nan et al 2016 pritchett et al 2011 it is necessary to note that the lbf4 did not have a positive impact on sunflower growth yield and nitrogen and water productivity in the saline sodic farmland the reason for this result was probably that the lbf contains higher electrical conductivity than soil table s1 when the lbf was overused it would increase soil salinity which suppressed the growth of sunflower li et al 2020 4 3 appropriate lignite bioorganic fertilizer addition strategy although it is often claimed that the application of lignite or its products could improve soil quality and thus increase crop growth and soil productivity the application rate of lignite or its products was always recommended by manufacturers in many studies little et al 2014 the appropriate application rate of those additions widely varied with crops and soils amoah antwi et al 2020 and to our knowledge few researchers studied the influence of lbf on sunflower growth in saline sodic soils in this study we found that partial nitrogen productivity economic returns and water productivity all showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf this is reasonable because inadequate application of lbf may have no significant influence on soil physicochemical properties while overuse of lbf may increase soil electrical conductivity amoah antwi et al 2020 the reason for improved partial fertilizer productivity yield economic returns and water productivity by application of lbf with the optimal rate was mentioned above nevertheless the higher ph and electrical conductivity of fertilizer itself could increase soil salinity and then decreased the partial productivity of nitrogen yield economic returns and water productivity when it was overused li et al 2021 in this study we further found that from the relationships between the application rate of lbf and partial nitrogen productivity yield economic returns and water productivity the optimal application rate of lbf was 4 0 3 8 2 6 and 3 3 t ha 1 respectively therefore comprehensively considering the partial productivity of nitrogen sunflower yield economic profits and water productivity the appropriate application rate of lbf to saline sodic soils was about 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 in this study in addition the lbf contains a rich humic substances organic carbon and complex pore structure which continuously affect soil physicochemical properties amoah antwi et al 2020 therefore the long term application of lbf may obtain more effective impacts on soil physicochemical properties and crop growth 5 conclusion in conclusion the sunflower root growth and plant growth indices including the root length root surface area root volume plant height leaf area index and dry biomass were significantly improved by the application of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 ultimately average yield water productivity partial nitrogen productivity and economical gain were improved by the application of lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 in comparison with the ck treatment although the addition of the farmyard manure improved sunflower growth the improvement of sunflower growth in the treatments with bioorganic fertilizer of 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 was more beneficial than those in the treatments with farmyard manure in addition the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and economic profits showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lignite bioorganic fertilizer based on the field data and a comprehensive assessment of the cost versus economic and water and nitrogen productivity an application rate of about 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer appears to be cost effective and achieves a sustainable improvement of crop yield economic

9404,continuous applications of lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf to the field have achieved substantial improvements in soil physicochemical properties and crop yields in multiple regions throughout china however the effects of lbf on crop growth and water and fertilizer productivity in saline sodic farmlands were scarcely understood thus in this study a two year field experiment with six treatments including a control treatment without any organic fertilizer ck a treatment amended with 21 t ha 1sheep manure sm and four treatments amended with 1 5 lbf1 3 lbf2 4 5 lbf3 and 7 5 t ha 1 lbf4 lbf was conducted in 2019 and 2020 in the hetao irrigation district hid an area known for its saline sodic conditions located at the upper yellow river basin china the results showed that the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments improved plant height leaf area index and dry biomass by 8 76 7 cm 0 3 2 4 and 309 402 g plant 1 respectively in comparison with the ck treatment the root length root surface area and root volume in the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment was 18 3 99 7 m 464 6 2022 6 cm2 and 7 6 46 4 cm3 larger than that in the ck treatment respectively average yield water productivity partial nitrogen productivity and economical gain in the lbf treatments were up to 2 2 t ha 1 0 4 kg m 3 23 6 kg kg 1 and 6100 chinese yuan ha 1 respectively substantially higher than those of the ck treatment in addition compared with sm treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments also significantly improved sunflower growth and water and nitrogen productivity the results of structural equation model analysis and linear regression analysis showed that lbf2 and lbf3 treatments improved sunflower root growth mainly through improving absorption of soil nitrogen furthermore the root indices had a significant positive relation with the sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and economic profits showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf a comprehensive assessment of the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and cost versus economic suggested that an application rate of 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer is optimal for achieving a sustainable improvement of crop yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands keywords bioorganic fertilizer farmland reclamation lignite fertilizer saline sodic soil crop water use 1 introduction soil salinization has become one of the key constraints for the sustainable development of global agriculture around the world the total area of saline and sodic soil is approximately 397 and 434 million hectares respectively ghosh et al 2017 every year about 1 2 of arable land is lost due to serious soil salinization in many regions including asia africa north america and other regions daliakopoulos et al 2016 in saline sodic farmlands agricultural development was limited by soil salinization low soil fertility and organic matter and poor soil quality additionally the loss of agricultural land is accelerating due to salination and overuse of mineral fertilizer therefore ameliorative methods need to be taken to improve the crop productivity in saline sodic soil for sustainable crop production and regenerative agriculture in recent years the application of organic amendments is considered as a promising practice to improve soil structure hydrological functions organic matter microbial diversity and richness carbon budget and then crop production mahmood et al 2017 kalu et al 2021 many types of organic amendments including farmyard manure humic acid and raw lignite or its products were always applied to improve crop productivity amoah antwi et al 2020 however the different characteristics of those organic amendments such as raw materials and production conditions caused the different effects of organic amendments on crop growth moreover the soil types salinity conditions and crops also resulted in different impacts of organic amendments on soils and crops erktan et al 2020 farmyard manure fym is one of the most widely used organic amendments which is easily available and sustainable because it is derived from agricultural waste products without energy production processes siedt et al 2021 many studies have reported that applying fym can increase soil organic matter and improve crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity loper et al 2010 zhen et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 for example iqbal et al 2019 found that the application of poultry manure improved rice yield with high nitrogen use efficiency mahmood et al 2017 evaluated the influence of fym on maize yield and found that fym 15 t ha 1 increased soil organic carbon by 85 90 and improved maize yield by 52 77 in a lyallpur soil with a ph of 7 0 however gai et al 2018 had reported that the application of fym decreased the nitrogen use efficiency in fluvo aquic soil in addition wang et al 2021 was found that the water use efficiency of wheat was 5 9 improved by the application of fym but the maize water use efficiency was decreased by 6 10 in loam soil therefore the performance of fym on water and nitrogen use efficiency varies with soil types and crops moreover the above studies had reported the influence of fym on crop growth water and nitrogen productivity but most of those studies were conducted in neutral or acid soil there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis and understanding of if and how crop yield and water and nitrogen productivity are improved through the addition of fym in saline sodic soil lignite also named brown coal was usually used for power generation but its efficiency was very low akimbekov et al 2020 however lignite with physiochemistry properties such as extensive surface area complex porous structure rich humic substances and organic carbon is considered a good amendment for improving crop production especially for degraded lands akimbekov et al 2020 in addition the organic carbon in the lignite decomposed slowly and existed in soil for a long time which could increase soil organic matter for a long time therefore in recent years lignite received attention from researchers as a potential soil conditioner to improve crop growth and water and nitrogen use efficiency tsetsegmaa et al 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 studies have demonstrated that applying lignite or lignite fertilizer can improve soil organic matter in turn increasing nutrient holding and water retention ability as well as crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency dubey et al 2019 sun et al 2020 for instance saha et al 2017 2018 had reported that the application of lignite could delay the nitrogen release and improve nitrogen retention in the soil thus improving the nitrogen use efficiency of silver beet similarly schillem et al 2019 reported that the application of lignite improved wheat growth nitrogen and water use efficiency even at low application rates 5 t ha 1 although the application of lignite or lignite fertilizer has been demonstrated to improve crop and vegetable yields water use efficiency and nitrogen productivity almost all those studies were conducted in normal farmland and few were conducted in saline sodic farmland in fact sunflower is a widely planted crop in saline sodic farmland however to the best of our knowledge few researches on the impacts of lignite or lignite fertilizer on sunflower growth water and nitrogen productivity were conducted in saline sodic farmland besides the application rates of lignite or lignite fertilizer products were usually based on various recommendations by manufacturers little et al 2014 dyko et al 2015 tran et al 2015 in studies of nan et al 2016 schillem et al 2019 and akimbekov et al 2020 the optimal application rates of lignite or lignite fertilizer were 1 5 t ha 1 5 t ha 1 and 1 g kg 1 in a saline sodic farmland soil without crops in a medium sand soil with the growth of wheat in the greenhouse and in a sandy loam soil with potato growth in the greenhouse respectively therefore the optimal application rate varies with soil types and crops above all the influence of lignite or lignite fertilizer on sunflower growth water and nitrogen productivity and their optimal application rates need to be further explored in saline sodic farmland thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different organic amendments on sunflower growth yield and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands the experiment was conducted in the hetao irrigation district hid located in the upper yellow river basin china where crop growth was severely constrained by salinization in this study sheep manure sm and lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf were tested we hypothesized that the application of lbf and sm would have a positive impact on sunflower growth and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands the specific objectives of our research are 1 to assess the effects of lbf on sunflower growth 2 to study the impacts of lbf on sunflower yield water and nitrogen productivity and 3 to determine an effective application rate of lbf for crop yield total economic gains and water and nitrogen productivity in saline sodic farmlands 2 materials and methods

free duration is approximately 130 d with a maximum frozen depth of 1 2 m li et al 2020a according to the international soil classification system the soil texture is silt loam in 0 60 cm soil depth and sandy loam in 60 100 cm soil depth basic physicochemical properties are summarized in table s1 as shown in table s1 the ph exchangeable sodium saturation percentage esp saturated electrical conductivity ece saturated sodium adsorption ratio sare and soil bulk density are 9 4 56 mmoles l 1 0 5 9 3 ds m 1 16 3 and 1 62 g cm 3 respectively in 0 20 cm indicating that the study area is saline sodic farmland with poor physical and chemical properties in 2019 and 2020 the groundwater table depth ranged from 1 3 to 2 6 m and 0 99 1 7 m respectively meteorological information including rainfall air temperature wind speed at 2 m and relative humidity were measured once every half an hour by an automatic weather station hobo u30 usa that was placed at about 150 m from the experimental field the details of rainfall and air temperatures during the sunflower growth period are presented in fig s1 in the field experiment six treatments a control treatment without any organic fertilizer ck a treatment amended with 21 t ha 1 sheep manure and four other treatments amended by lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 1 5 lbf1 3 lbf2 4 5 lbf3 and 7 5 t ha 1 lbf4 respectively the application rate of 21 t ha 1 was recommended by local farmers and the rate of lignite bioorganic fertilizer was based on manufacturers recommended value of 3 t ha 1 each treatment had three replications all plots were arranged following a randomized block design in this study and each plot had an area of 126 m2 7 m 18 m the lignite bioorganic fertilizer lbf is a novel biochemically processed lignite product it has been certified by the omri and eu as an organic fertilizer and soil conditioner provided by apaxfon bioscience and technologies ltd co apaxfon baotou inner mongolia china lbf is produced with lignite through a series of physicochemical and biochemical reactions based on analytical data from apaxfon it contains a portfolio of organic compounds ranging from large humic matter to small soluble organic acids the basic properties of lbf and sm are listed in table s1 the sunflower guaner no 1 which is the common crop planted in saline sodic farmlands was sowed on june 2nd and harvested on september 16th in 2019 it was sowed on june 5th and harvested on september 18th in 2020 the entire growth period of the sunflower was divided into four growth stages including seeding budding flowering and maturing stage the details regarding the growth stages of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 are listed in table s2 the wide narrow row alternate model with a wide row spacing of 100 cm and narrow row spacing of 40 cm was adopted in this study making the average row spacing of 70 cm plant spacing was about 50 cm with a plant density of approximately 28 500 plants ha 1 the narrow row was covered by a black plastic film with a width of 70 cm and a thickness of 0 008 mm sm and lbf were supplied as base fertilizer prior to seeding specifically the lbf and sm were spread evenly over the experimental plot and then the tillage method was adopted to mix lbf and sm with soil in 0 20 cm depth for chemical fertilizer 81 0 kg ha 1 n 90 3 kg ha 1 p 30 kg ha 1 k were applied before seeding and 25 2 kg ha 1 n 9 2 kg ha 1 p 5 0 kg ha 1 k was applied during the budding stage of sunflowers the sources for the chemical fertilizers were nh₄ ₂hpo₄ and k2o respectively in order to reduce the limitations of salinity and sodicity on crop emergence 1800 m3 ha 1 water from the yellow river was applied to the field before seeding there was no irrigation during the growing period of sunflowers after the implementation of the leaching irrigation the average ec and ph value was 0 38 ds m 1 and 9 7 respectively 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 water consumption and productivity the soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method li et al 2021 soil samples were collected using an auger every 10 cm for the 20 cm upper and every 20 cm from 20 to 100 cm in the middle of the plots every ten days during the sunflower growing season each treatment had three replications soil sample of each point was divided into two parts one was for measuring soil moisture and the other was for measuring soil nutrients the 0 100 cm soil layer was considered to calculate total water consumption of sunflower using the soil water balance method eq 1 the water use efficiency wue was calculated using eq 2 1 et p i δ s r f 2 wp y 10 e t where et is the total water consumption of sunflower mm p and r are the rainfall and runoff respectively mm s is the change of soil water storage in 0 100 cm soil depth mm f is the vertical soil water flux in the bottom boundary the negative value means deep percolation and the positive means capillary rise mm wp is the water productivity kg m 3 y is the sunflower yield kg ha 1 p during sunflower growth period in this study is 45 5 and 123 2 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively there was no heavy rainfall in the study area and each plot was surrounded by a 30 cm high ridge no runoff was observed during the experimental periods thus r 0 f is estimated using the following equations 3 f k θ ψ m z 2 ψ m z 1 δ z 1 4 k θ k s θ θ

study z1 and z 2 are the soil depth of 80 cm and 100 cm respectively 2 2 2 soil nutrient content during the initial and mature stage of sunflowers in 2019 and 2020 soil samples in 0 100 cm soil layer were selected to determine soil available nitrogen an available phosphorous ap and available potassium ak in 0 100 cm soil layer in this study the an was the sum of nh4 n and no3 n which was determined by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 3100 china ak was determined by the ammonium acetate extraction flame photometry method ap was determined by the sodium bicarbonate extraction mo sb colorimetry method li et al 2021 2 2 3 plant growth of sunflower in this study main sunflower growth indexes including the leaf area index lai plant height cm and dry biomass g plant 1 were selected to represent sunflower growth conditions three plants in each plot were selected for measuring lai and plant height every 10 days in order to avoid the edge effects the three plants were chosen based on an even growth distribution and location in other words randomly selected from the middle area of the plot all the leaves of the sunflower plant were cut down and the length and width were measured by a ruler the leaf area index was calculated using eq 6 yang 2019 the plant height of sunflower was measured by tapeline after the measurement of lai and plant height the plants were cut down and put into the oven to de enzyme 105 for 30 min before being dried to a constant weight at 85 for measurement of dry biomass during the late maturing stage sunflowers from a 10 m2 area in each plot were harvested to measure yield 6 lai 0 75 n w l a where lai is the sunflower leaf area index n is the plant density of sunflower plants ha 1 w and l are the width and length of leaf respectively m a is the area m2 2 2 4 root growth of sunflower the impacts of the application of lbf and sm on sunflower roots were also considered in this study since most of the sunflower roots were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer root samples in the 0 40 cm soil layer were taken in this study root samples within an area of 40 cm 40 cm around the root were dug out by a spade from 0 to 40 cm soil layers during each stage of the sunflower budding flowering and maturity all root samples were carefully washed and then scanned by a scanner epson perfection v700 the root length surface area and diameter of the sunflowers were calculated by winrhizopro software 2013e regent instruments 2013 2 2 5 partial nitrogen productivity and net profits the partial nitrogen productivity pnp was calculated based on the ratio of sunflower yield to supplied nitrogen the net economic profits of treatments with the application of lbf and sm were calculated using eq 7 7 np kay f 1 f 2 where k is the price of sunflower 8

package in r language software the principal component analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the application of lbf and sm on soil quality using origin 2021 software structural equation modeling sem for evaluating the direct and indirect correlations between the soil nutrient and root growth was performed in amos v 21 0 software amos ibm usa 3 results 3 1 soil nutrients and sunflower growth the available nitrogen in the ck treatment was 5 7 69 1 kg ha 1 and 16 0 90 8 kg ha 1 higher than those in the sm and lbf treatments in 2019 and 2020 at the mature stage respectively fig 1 for available phosphorus at the mature stage the lbf2 to lbf4 treatments increased soil available phosphorus in 2019 and 2020 in comparison with the ck treatment respectively for available potassium there was little difference in available potassium among the lbf treatments and the ck treatment at the mature stage in 2019 and 2020 as shown in fig 2 the lbf3 treatment obtained the highest plant heights about 16 3 32 3 cm and 19 7 76 7 cm higher than the ck treatment across all sunflower growth stages in 2019 and 2020 respectively following the lbf3 treatment the lbf2 treatment had the second largest plant height plant heights between the sm and ck treatments were similar for lai fig 2c d the difference in lai between the sm and ck treatments was marginally noticeable while the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased lai by 0 4 2 1 and 0 7 2 4 in 2019 and 0 6 2 1 and 0 3 2 4 in 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment for dry biomass fig 2e f across all growth stages of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 the dry biomass of the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments was higher than those of the ck and sm treatments for example at the mature stage of sunflower compared with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased dry biomass by 334 7 and 340 3 g plant 1 in 2019 and 309 and 412 g plant 1 in 2020 respectively the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments markedly increased dry biomass by 181 8 and 187 4 g plant 1 in 2019 and 239 and 341 9 in 2020 g plant 1 respectively in comparison with the sm treatment as shown in fig 3 the highest root length was obtained in the lbf3 treatment across all sunflower growth stages in 2019 and 2020 with the sole exception of the budding stage during 2019 the root length in the lbf3 treatment was 39 2 66 0 and 99 7 m longer than the ck treatment during the budding flowering and mature stages of sunflowers in 2019 respectively those values were 22 2 68 4 and 70 5 m in 2020 respectively following the lbf3 treatment the lbf2 treatment had the second longest root length during the growing period of sunflower in 2019 and 2020 for the root surface area in comparison with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly increased the root surface area by 636 1 717 9 cm2 and 1031 5 1978 2 cm2 in 2019 and 671 1215 3 cm2 and 464 6 2022 6 cm2 in 2020 respectively the lbf2 and lbf3 significantly improved the root volume by 12 4 19 4 cm3 and 21 1 38 2 cm3 in 2019 and 10 6 24 1 cm3 and 7 6 46 3 cm3 in 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment there was no significant difference in the root volume between the sm and ck treatments above all the values of root growth indexes were the highest in the lbf3 treatment followed closely by the lbf2 treatment 3 2 yield partial nitrogen productivity water productivity and net profits as shown in table 1 compared with the ck treatment the lbf3 treatment increased the yield by 2 5 and 1 9 t ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively while the sm treatment only augmented the yield by 1 2 and 0 7 t ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in crop yield between the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment furthermore the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments significantly improved the partial productivity of nitrogen by 19 and 23 6 kg kg 1 and 16 3 and 17 9 kg kg 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively table 1 also shows that compared with the ck treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments decreased sunflower water consumption by 114 5 and 273 9 mm and 95 8 and 223 5 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the wp of the lbf2 and lbf3 treatment were 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 higher than that of the ck treatment compared with the sm treatment the lbf2 and lbf3 treatments also decreased water consumption and improved the wp in 2019 and 2020 it is worth noting that the difference in sunflower yield between the ck and lbf4 treatment was scarcely noticeable but water consumption in the lbf4 treatment was 475 4 and 123 1 mm lower than that in the ck treatment for net profits the lbf2 treatment obtained the highest net profits with a value of 19 9 and 17 9 thousand cny ha 1 respectively in 2019 and 2020 followed by the lbf3 treatment which was about 6 6 and 1 7 thousand cny ha 1 higher than the ck treatment in 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the ck treatment the sm treatment reduced the net profits by 3 3 and 6 8 thousand cny ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively negative returns lied in the lbf4 treatment implying that over application of lbf can create a loss or deficit for farmers 3 3 relationships among soil nutrients sunflower root growth and plant growth the sem was applied to evaluate the potential mechanism of soil nutrients on sunflower roots growth fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the path coefficient between available nitrogen and root surface area was 0 54 in addition root surface area had significant positive path coefficients with root volume and length moreover the standardized total effects of available nitrogen on root indices were all negative fig 4b d indicating that there was a negative relationship between available nitrogen and root indices a significant positive relationship between available phosphorus and root volume was found in the sem showing that available phosphorus had a significant positive influence on the root volume fig 4 also shows that soil available potassium had no significant influence on root growth to further investigate the impact of sunflower roots growth on sunflower plant growth the linear regression models were conducted and illustrated in fig s2 as shown in fig s2 all regression coefficients were significant at p 0 01 level indicating that root indices had significant influence on sunflower plant growth including plant height lai and dry biomass in addition the explained variance of dry biomass plant height and lai by root indices was 54 67 43 61 and 27 42 respectively indicating that root indices had more influence on dry biomass than on plant height and lai fig s3 shows that the root indices had significant impact on sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity for sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity the root indices explained over 50 of the variance of sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity indicating that the sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity were largely impacted by roots growth however the root indices only explained 8 16 of the variance of water productivity suggesting that root growth was not the main factor that impacted sunflower water productivity 3 4 relationships between application rate of lbf and yield np wp and pnp in this study the yield and partial productivity of nitrogen both showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf indicating that application of approximately 3 8 and 4 0 t ha 1 lbf would obtain the highest yield and partial productivities of nitrogen fig 5a and d respectively the economical returns of the addition of lbf were calculated using the cost benefit analysis method the results in fig 5b shows that the optimal application rate of lbf to saline sodic soil was 2 6 t ha 1 in which farmers could obtain 19 4 thousand cny ha 1 in this study the quadratic function was also used to fit the water productivity versus the addition of lbf and showed that the optimal application rate of lbf was 3 3 t ha 1 in which the water productivity improvement was the best 4 discussion 4 1 effects of lignite bioorganic fertilizer on sunflower growth in recent years some previous studies had explored the impacts of lignite or its commercial products on crop growth and yield chandrakant et al 2019 akimbekov et al 2020 however the impacts of lignite and its products on sunflower growth and yield in saline sodic farmland were rarely evaluated in this study we found that the application of lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 and 4 5 t ha 1 had a significantly positive influence on plant height leaf area index and dry biomass in saline sodic farmland fig 2 this result indicated that the lbf also could be used for improving crops growth in saline sodic farmland the reason for this result was probably that application of lbf with optimal rate could increase the growth of sunflower roots this explanation was proved by the results that the root length surface area and volume had a significant positive relation with sunflower plant height lai and dry biomass fig s2 however previous studies about the effects of lignite or its products on crop growth scarcely focused on crop root growth in this study the results confirmed that the root traits including root length surface area and volume were all promoted by the application of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 and 4 5 t ha 1 fig 2 there were two mechanisms for improved sunflower growth by amendment of lbf with optimal rate firstly the application of lbf with an optimal rate could improve soil physicochemical properties i e improving soil porosity and water stable aggregation increasing soil organic matter and decreasing salinity tsetsegmaa et al 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 application of lbf with optimal rate improved soil physicochemical properties because the lbf contains high organic matter which could increase soil water stable aggregation and soil cation exchange capacity shao 2006 the complex interpore structure of lbf also created pores between the lignite bio organic fertilizer particles and surrounding soil aggregations which could decrease soil bulk density and increase soil porosity structure li et al 2021 all those improved soil physicochemical properties will inevitably affect crop root growth tsetsegmaa et al 2018 secondly the nitrogen release rate is delayed by the application of lbf which could increase the nitrogen uptake of sunflower roots saha et al 2017 2018 amoah antwi et al 2020 we found that soil available nitrogen content had a significant negative relation with sunflower root growth fig 4 the reason for the negative relationship between soil available nitrogen content and sunflower root growth was probably that the sunflower roots increased the absorption of soil available nitrogen which resulted in lower soil available nitrogen in the soil 4 2 effects of lignite bioorganic fertilizer on sunflower yield and water and nitrogen productivity studies had showed that the application of lbf had significant positive impacts on crop yield chandrakant et al 2019 in this study compared with the ck treatment application of lbf with proper rate significantly improved sunflower yield this result was similar to the result of akimbekov et al 2020 who found that the application of lignite based fertilizer improved potato yield by 66 4 however in the saline sodic farmland the influence of lbf on sunflower nitrogen productivity and water use efficiency was scarcely explored as expected in this study we found that the amendment of lbf with 3 0 4 5 t ha 1 significantly improved the partial productivity of nitrogen and water productivity in comparison with the ck treatment the reason for this result was probably that application of lbf improved the sunflower roots growth this explanation could be proved by the result in fig s3 in which the root length root surface area and root volume had a significant positive relation with sunflower yield water productivity and partial nitrogen productivity and those three root indices could explain 55 67 and 56 68 variance of yield and partial nitrogen productivity respectively it is worth noting that the root growth only explained 8 16 of the variance of water productivity this result showed that the water productivity was not mainly impacted by root growth in this study it is reasonable because the root growth might directly impact sunflower transpiration but soil evaporation was also impacted by soil properties in saline sodic farmlands therefore the influence of root growth on water productivity was lower than that on sunflower yield and partial nitrogen productivity furthermore in this study we found that the water consumption of sunflower in the lbf3 treatments were significantly lower than that in the ck treatment in 2019 and there was no significant difference of water consumption of sunflower among the ck and lbf treatments this result was reasonable because the total water consumption of sunflower was composed of evaporation and transpiration the application of lbf with proper rate could improve sunflower growth and thus increased transpiration of sunflower in comparison with the ck treatment in contrast it also could result in more reduction of evaporation than the ck treatment did through increasing plant height and lai fig 2 thus there is a trade off relation between sunflower transpiration and soil evaporation the ultimately impacts of lbf on water consumption of sunflower may vary with different weather condition it is worth noting that the difference in sunflower yield between the ck and lbf4 treatment was scarcely noticeable but water consumption in the lbf4 treatment was lower than that in the ck treatment a possible reason for this was that the lbf4 treatment increased soil salinity in comparison with the ck treatment which increased more accumulation of salinity on the soil surface that prevented soil evaporation moreover the sunflower was rainfed in this study this is similar to the study of zhen et al 2014 in fact irrigation is necessary for crop production in the study area due to the semiarid temperate continental climate with an annual rainfall of 160 mm however according to our previous studies most sunflower plants were heavily injured or died after irrigation during the growing season the reason was probably that in heavy saline sodic soils the salt accumulated on the soil surface was dissolved by irrigation water which caused serious salt stress in the root zone and this stress lasted for a long time due to the poor pore structure of saline sodic soils therefore no irrigation during the growing season has been widely adopted as common practice for sunflower growing in saline sodic soils in the study area the shallow ground water can provide enough water to meet the requirements of plant growth however to achieve high production irrigation is still required for sunflowers planted in non saline and slight saline sodic soils in this study area moreover in this study compared with ck treatment the sm treatment significantly improved the sunflower yield and nitrogen productivity table 1 however the performance of sm for improving sunflower yield and nitrogen productivity in the saline sodic farmland was more ineffective than that of lbf2 and lbf3 treatments we attributed the improved performance of lbf to large stable organic matter and soluble organic acids which improved soil quality and then improved absorption of soil nutrients nan et al 2016 pritchett et al 2011 it is necessary to note that the lbf4 did not have a positive impact on sunflower growth yield and nitrogen and water productivity in the saline sodic farmland the reason for this result was probably that the lbf contains higher electrical conductivity than soil table s1 when the lbf was overused it would increase soil salinity which suppressed the growth of sunflower li et al 2020 4 3 appropriate lignite bioorganic fertilizer addition strategy although it is often claimed that the application of lignite or its products could improve soil quality and thus increase crop growth and soil productivity the application rate of lignite or its products was always recommended by manufacturers in many studies little et al 2014 the appropriate application rate of those additions widely varied with crops and soils amoah antwi et al 2020 and to our knowledge few researchers studied the influence of lbf on sunflower growth in saline sodic soils in this study we found that partial nitrogen productivity economic returns and water productivity all showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lbf this is reasonable because inadequate application of lbf may have no significant influence on soil physicochemical properties while overuse of lbf may increase soil electrical conductivity amoah antwi et al 2020 the reason for improved partial fertilizer productivity yield economic returns and water productivity by application of lbf with the optimal rate was mentioned above nevertheless the higher ph and electrical conductivity of fertilizer itself could increase soil salinity and then decreased the partial productivity of nitrogen yield economic returns and water productivity when it was overused li et al 2021 in this study we further found that from the relationships between the application rate of lbf and partial nitrogen productivity yield economic returns and water productivity the optimal application rate of lbf was 4 0 3 8 2 6 and 3 3 t ha 1 respectively therefore comprehensively considering the partial productivity of nitrogen sunflower yield economic profits and water productivity the appropriate application rate of lbf to saline sodic soils was about 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 in this study in addition the lbf contains a rich humic substances organic carbon and complex pore structure which continuously affect soil physicochemical properties amoah antwi et al 2020 therefore the long term application of lbf may obtain more effective impacts on soil physicochemical properties and crop growth 5 conclusion in conclusion the sunflower root growth and plant growth indices including the root length root surface area root volume plant height leaf area index and dry biomass were significantly improved by the application of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 ultimately average yield water productivity partial nitrogen productivity and economical gain were improved by the application of lignite bioorganic fertilizer with 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 in comparison with the ck treatment although the addition of the farmyard manure improved sunflower growth the improvement of sunflower growth in the treatments with bioorganic fertilizer of 3 0 and 4 5 t ha 1 was more beneficial than those in the treatments with farmyard manure in addition the partial nitrogen productivity water productivity yield and economic profits showed a quadratic relationship with the application rate of lignite bioorganic fertilizer based on the field data and a comprehensive assessment of the cost versus economic and water and nitrogen productivity an application rate of about 3 0 4 0 t ha 1 of the lignite bioorganic fertilizer appears to be cost effective and achieves a sustainable improvement of crop yield economic
