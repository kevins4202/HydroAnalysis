16045,the substrate to inoculum ratio s i is a crucial factor that affects not only the stability of the anaerobic digestion ad of food waste fw but also the methanogenic capacity of the substrate this is of great significance for the start up of small scale batch reactors and the directional regulation of methanogenesi and organic acid production most studies have merely clarified the optimal s i ratio for methane production and revealed the basic composition of microbial communities however the mechanism of microbial interactions and the metabolic pathways behind the optimal s i ratio still remain unclear herein the effects of different s i ratios vs basis on the relationship of kinetic parameters microbial communities and metabolic pathways during the ad process of fw were holistically explored the results revealed that high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 were prone to irreversible acidification while low s i ratios 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were favorable for methanogenesis moreover a kinetic analysis demonstrated that the methane yield of s i 1 3 were the highest a bioinformatics analysis found that the diversity of bacteria and archaea of s i 1 3 were the most abundant and the enrichment of bacteroides and synergistetes could help to establish a syntrophic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogens which could aid in the fulfillment of a unique niche in the system in contrast to the findings with the other s i ratios the cooperation among microbes in s i 1 3 was more apparent notably the abundances of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the methanogenesis pathway under s i 1 3 were all the highest this knowledge will be helpful for revealing the influence mechanism of the ratio relationship between microorganisms and substrates on the biochemical metabolic process of anaerobic digestion thereby providing effective guidance for the directional regulation of fw batch anaerobic reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords food waste anaerobic digestion substrate to inoculum ratio microbial communities metabolic pathways 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely proven to be an economically efficient means for the disposal of organic waste such as food waste sludge and animal waste among others organic macromolecules are catabolized by anaerobic microorganisms to generate ch4 and co2 accompanied by a large number of value added chemicals such as volatile fatty acids vfas lactic acid la and ethanol lin et al 2018 a large amount of biogas slurry bs is typically produced during the process of ad of organic waste lu and xu 2021 found that approximately 0 20 to 0 47 tons of digestate is produced during the ad of fw per ton in which bs is the main part bs contains a variety of microorganisms and n and p elements and its ph value is typically stable between 7 0 and 8 0 thus this bs can be used as a suitable inoculum for the start up of anaerobic reactors kong et al 2016 found that when fw bs served as the inoculum the cumulative yield of ch4 could reach as high as 580 ml g vsadded which was higher than when sewage sludge was used as the inoculum zhou et al 2016 found that the maximum production of ch4 can reach 16 607 ml at ph 7 0 using bs from pig manure as inoculum as described above the bs produced by the ad of organic waste can be used as the inoculum for the start up of fw anaerobic reactors which can not only provide the key microorganisms for hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis but also recycle the waste s i is an important parameter affecting the stability of batch ad an s i ratio that is too high could cause toxicity destroy the syntropy between microbes and irreversibly acidify the reactor a lower s i ratio can prohibit the induction of enzymes required for ad and the maximum methane production cannot be achieved kong et al 2016 xing et al 2020 the identification of an optimal s i ratio in ad has been widely studied and has primarily focused on two subsequent perspectives the first was to determine the most suitable s i ratio for methanogenic efficiency by establishing a kinetic model xing et al 2020 reported that s i 0 07 is the most suitable ratio for the early start up operation of anaerobic reactors for the co digestion of fw and cow manure li et al 2018b found that the cumulative yield of methane can reach a maximum of 1075 ml g vs at s i 0 6 during the co digestion of fw and sludge the second was to elucidate the community structure under the optimal s i ratio using 16s rrna sequencing technology meng et al 2018 investigated the community composition of the optimal s i ratio for ch4 production s i 0 5 661 m3 t vs in the co digestion of pig urine and rice straw and found that the corresponding dominant microorganisms were clostridia methanosarcina and methanothermobacter ma et al 2019a reported that s i 2 3 was the most effective methanogenic ratio 209 1 ml g vsadded in a study of the co digestion of dairy manure and rapeseed straw and the predominant microorganisms in the community were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and methanosaeta it is thus apparent that the optimal s i ratio differs in different studies the nutrient composition of substrate and the physicochemical properties and microbial characteristics of inocula vary widely which could directly affect the results of studies to explore the s i ratio moreover different s i ratios can affect the key microorganisms and intermediate metabolites in ad resulting in variation in the functional metabolic pathways however the mechanism of microbial interactions and functional metabolism under the optimal s i ratio during the process of ad of fw still remain unclear key microorganisms can drive changes during the process parameters thus affecting the community composition and functional metabolism in ad wang et al 2018 a bioinformatics analysis can be applied to identify key microorganisms in complex communities and deduce the correlation between microbes for instance random forest analysis has been verified to be one of the exact tools in machine language to describe the systematic importance of each taxon long et al 2021 this type of analysis can be utilized to analyze and predict the key microorganisms in the anaerobic system based on the r language software and quantify the importance of each taxon to the anaerobic system therefore this analysis could reveal the relationship between key microorganisms and the performance of ad the relationship between microbes in the network can be constructed using a microbial correlation network analysis which can intuitively illustrate the interactions between microorganisms and thereby identify the key microorganisms that drive the changes in community composition and function zheng et al 2021 the prediction of metabolic pathways can predict the in depth metabolic functions owing to the perspective of expression of key functional genes tax4fun software can predict the spectrum of gene functions of the whole spectral system of bacteria and archaea based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathway database which helps to predict the functional metabolic pathways and the key enzymes of each group the tax4fun function prediction has been widely used in the studies of ad processes zheng et al 2021 compared the metabolic pathways of the co digestion of pig manure and corn stover under different c n based on tax4fun software ma et al 2021 also investigated the changes in the methanogenic functional genes during a study on the effects of magnetite on saline wastewater ad however although tax4fun software can be used to clarify the entire metabolic pathways in ad it still lacks the corresponding annotation on the key microbes in metabolic pathways using both random forest and microbial correlation networks can effectively remedy this defect thus helping to elucidate the differences in metabolic function and community structure at each s i ratio therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the ad performance of fw at different s i ratios and then comprehensively analyze the microbial interactions and whole metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio firstly the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis and methanogenesis under each s i ratio were analyzed and acidogenesis at the corresponding ratios was discussed afterwards the bacterial and archaeal community structure were analyzed using random forest and correlation network analyses finally comprehensive insights were used to reveal the functional metabolic pathways of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis under the optimal s i ratio the mutual corroboration of these results facilitates the selection of the optimal s i ratio thereby maximizing the synergistic actions between the substrate and the inoculated microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum to ensure the homogeneity of the substrate the fw used in this research was synthesized by selecting widely representative food ingredients based on the component analysis of our previous study chen et al 2021 the main ingredients were rice 35 lean meat 10 fat 20 fish 3 3 chicken 8 3 soybeans 6 7 celery 8 3 and cabbage 8 3 these ingredients were crushed to 1 2 mm using a food grinder and stored at 20 the bs was collected from the fw anaerobic tank xiang an east solid waste treatment plant xiamen china the hydraulic retention time of the ad tank was 30 days and the daily intake of fw was approximately 440 mÂ³ which is similar to the amount of bs that was discharged daily after the bs was discharged from the tank it entered the sewage treatment process of the plant table 1 shows the composition and characteristics of fw and bs 2 2 experiment design the s i ratio based on the volatile solid was established at 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 respectively the fw and bs were mixed at 500 g the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of the mixture was maintained at approximately 15 the blank without any substrate was only inoculated with inoculum all experiments were performed in triplicate the methane production at each s i ratio was calculated by subtracting the methane production of the blank which was normalized to the standard temperature and pressure stp conditions 273 15 k and 1 atm holliger et al 2016 khadka et al 2022 each anaerobic bottle was connected to a 2 l gas sampling bag through a latex tube nitrogen was introduced into each bottle for 5 min before the experiment and the air in the bottle was removed to ensure that its state was absolutely anaerobic after that the bottles were placed in a thermostat water bath vibrator sha ba china with a speed of 120 rpm and the temperature was established at 37 1 the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 in the initial stage and the ph of the material was adjusted with 5 0 m naoh and 2 0 m hcl the gas content was measured daily the digestion was deemed to be terminated when there was no significant difference in the production of methane a portion of the collected samples were stored at 4 to determine the physical and chemical properties and the other portion was frozen at 80 for the microbial community analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 physical and chemical analysis a cns element analyzer vario max germany was used to analyze the total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and carbon nitrogen ratio c n the measurements of oil and fat were determined using a sors extractor nai zfcdy 4z china the contents of starch and soluble proteins

quality apha 2005 the samples were dried to a constant weight in a 105 oven to measure the total solid ts the oven dried samples were further heated for 3 h at 550 to determine the volatile soild vs the ph was determined by a hashdo parameter portable water quality analyzer hq40d usa the detailed analytical methods for ch4 vfas and la are explained in the supplementary information all the samples were analyzed in triplicate 2 3 2 microbial community analysis samples were collected at the end of the batch experiment for dna extraction a microbiological analysis was used to explore the structure of microbial communities and reveal the key metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio this analysis was performed on the group with the highest acid production s i 4 1 and the three groups with relatively high methane production s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 each group was designated as t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively microbial dna was extracted using hipure soil dna kits magen guangzhou china after the dna had been extracted the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtcta at 3 the arch519f 5 cagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and arch915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 primers were used to amplify the archaeal 16s rrna v4 v5 region the purified amplification products were analyzed on an illumina platform novaseq 6000 gene denovo guangzhou china the bioinformatics analysis is shown in the supplementary information 2 3 3 kinetic analysis the kinetic models employed in this research were first order kinetic model and modified gompertz model and the detailed operations are shown in the supplementary information 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation standard deviation of technical triplicates data processing was conducted using microsoft excel 2019 statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance anova using spss 22 0 ad performance and microbial communities of different s i were compared using one way anova and multiple comparison between groups were performed using least significant difference lsd method all the results were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 origin 2021 and adobe illustrator cs5 was used to draw the graphics a kinetic analysis was performed in origin 2021 a random forest algorithm analysis was conducted in r programming language 3 4 1 a correlation network was performed using gephi 0 9 2 software the microbial analysis platform used was omicsmart platform https www omicsmart com 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of different s i ratios on ad performance to explore the influence of different s i ratios on the performance of ad the kinetics of hydrolysis and methanogenesis were analyzed and changes in the composition of vfas production of la and ph were discussed 3 1 1 kinetic models analysis the vs content of the low s i ratios 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 decreased by approximately 30 this reduction was greater than those of the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 p 0 05 fig 1 a this finding indicated that an appropriate increase in the proportion of inoculum helps to degrade fw a first order kinetic model was utilized to characterize the hydrolytic process under different s i ratios r2 0 82 table 2 the kd of s i 4 1 0 21 d 1 was higher than those of s i 3 1 0 16 d 1 and 2 1 0 19 d 1 li et al 2018a found that when the biomass concentration was 5 g vss l the kd of substrate concentration was 20 g vs l which was greater than at 10 and 15 g vs l moreover s i 4 1 contained more organic components which provided a substantial carbon source for lactic acid bacteria resulting in the continuous production of la and a gradual decrease in ph fig 2 b 2c wu et al 2016 found that when the ph was between 4 and 5 the fw will be degraded by lactic acid bacteria to generate a large amount of la thereby clearly increasing the hydrolysis rate it was clearly apparent that the kd of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 0 33 0 25 and 0 29 d 1 respectively was higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 and the kd of s i 1 2 was the largest relevant studies have shown that ph values between 6 5 and 7 5 were more suitable for the growth of defluviitoga which acts as the predominant hydrolytic bacterium hania et al 2012 in this case the ph was weakly acidic 6 6 7 4 at s i 1 2 fig 2f and defluviitoga was the most abundant fig 3 e during the whole ad process the cumulative methane production of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 was 601 83 1747 52 and 1624 73 ml respectively which was clearly higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 fig 1b this was primarily because the bs inoculum contained a large number of methanogens which could facilitate the conversion of h2 co2 and acetic acid to ch4 kong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 in addition lsd between group comparison showed that the cumulative production of ch4 in s i 1 3 was significantly higher than that in the other two groups p 0 05 the growth and metabolism of the methanogens were the most vigorous at this ratio section 3 3 however the production of methane was extremely low in the high s i ratios this discrepancy was owing to the longer process of hydrolysis and irreversible acidification at the high s i ratios which renders a change in hydrolysis and acidogenesis to become the limiting step in the process of methanogenesis making it difficult to increase the cumulative production ma et al 2019b fig 1c shows the variation in the daily yield of ch4 at different s i ratios the daily yield of ch4 at the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 all decreased when the rates of hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the system were greater than that of methanogenesis large numbers of vfas were found to accumulate fig 2c 2f leading to a decrease in the daily rate of methane production wang et al 2018 however the daily yield of methane at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 increased first and then decreased during the digestion process the methane yield of s i 1 2 reached its maximum on day 1 which was 27 21 ml g vs while the s i 1 3 and 1 4 reached a peak by day 2 which was 86 63 and 86 36 ml g vs respectively this was owing to the quick degradation of organic matter which did not cause acidification and provided a sufficient nutrient substrate and an appropriate environment for the methanogens to metabolize methane as the digestion progressed the available substrate was gradually reduced thus the yield of methane gradually declined the discrepancy in the daily yield of methane during different s i ratios was caused by the difference in the biodegradability of organic matter in fw and the bs that was inoculated ma et al 2019b a modified gompertz model was applied to fit the dynamic process of methanogenesis r2 0 98 table 2 the pm and rm of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were significantly higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 zhang et al 2017 showed that lower kd and rm values indicated that the system was inhibited by the accumulation of acid fig 2a 2b the lag phase Î» reflected the delayed response and subsequent adaptation of microorganisms to the constantly changing environment li et al 2018a the Î» of s i 1 2 was the shortest 0 11 d while the kd 0 33 d 1 at this ratio was the largest this indicated that the hydrolytic bacteria can quickly respond to the changing environment which enables the rapid start of methanogenesis mao et al 2017 in addition the Î» of s i 1 3 and 1 4 was slightly higher than those of the high s i ratios notably in contrast to previous studies with a lag phase of 0 5 to 20 0 d cho et al 2013 kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the Î» of each s i ratio in this study was relatively short which could be owing to the quicker production of methane and shorter digestion period xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the effective fermentation time tef is equal to the time taken for methane production to reach 90 t90 minus the Î» the tef of s i 1 3 and 1 4 was longer than that of the other groups table 2 a longer tef and shorter Î» revealed that the conversion of organic matter was more efficiently converted into methane and the production of methane was higher mao et al 2017 3 1 2 changes in the concentrations of vfas and la and the ph under different s i ratios fig 2 illustrates the variation of vfas la and ph under different s i ratios the vfa concentrations at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were higher than those of the other ratios before day 3 fig 2a which was consistent with the higher kd the concentrations of vfas at the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 significantly increased since day 3 p 0 05 a large amount of la could be converted into propionic acid by propionate dehydrogenase as the digestion of ad proceeded lee et al 2008 the concentration of propionic acid clearly increased at high s i ratios while that of la decreased dramatically fig 2c 2f compared with high s i ratios in the whole ad the acid concentrations at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were significantly lower thus the corresponding ph was more stable 6 68 7 62 li et al 2018a demonstrated that ph values between 6 5 and 8 2 are suitable for the growth and metabolism of methanogens the la concentrations at s i 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 were significantly higher than those at low s i ratios during the early stage p 0 05 fig 2b indicating that the synthesis of la was the dominant acidogenesis pathway at high s i ratios in contrast the accumulation of la results in a dramatic decrease in the ph 4 55 5 37 which leads to irreversible acidification and difficulty in smoothly transforming to methanogenesis an appropriate increase in ph aided the ability of lactic acid bacteria to synthesize la tang et al 2017 found that an appropriate increase from 4 to 5 in the ph aids in the stimulation in the production of la therefore from day 1 to day 2 the content of la increased as the ph increased the acetic acid concentrations at s i 1 3 and 1 4 were maximal on day 1 8 95 and 9 70 g cod l respectively which were clearly higher than that of the other groups fig 2c 2f indicating that anabolism of acetic acid was the primary metabolic pathway of acidogenesis in s i 1 3 and 1 4 at this time moreover the cumulative production of methane tended to increase significantly p 0 05 fig 2b furthermore although the concentrations of the acetic acid of s i 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 could reach 7 50 10 16 g cod l the cumulative methane production was significantly lower than that under the low s i ratios this could be because the sudden decrease in ph severely inhibited the process of the use of acetic acid by aceticlastic methanogens to produce methane in addition to s i 1 3 and 1 4 the concentration of propionic acid in other groups was extremely high li et al 2020 concluded that when the concentration of propionic acid exceeded 5 g cod l it strongly inhibited methanogenesis 3 2 microbial community structure analysis in this study a detailed community structure analysis was conducted on the s i 4 1 t1 with the greatest amount of production of vfas and la and three groups of s i 1 2 t2 s i 1 3 t3 and s i 1 4 t4 with relatively high yield of methane 3 2 1 composition and variation of the bacterial community to investigate the diversity of bacterial communities in the ad process between each group a statistical evaluation was performed using the sobs and shannon indices the sobs index is adopted to assess the abundance of communities while the shannon index is usually applied to characterize the diversity of communities the sobs index of t1 was 577 17 which was significantly lower than those of t2 t3 and t4 674 50 685 75 and 679 00 respectively fig 3a p 0 05 typically a more severe environment leads to simpler communities vasconcelos et al 2016 the ph of t1 was approximately 4 55 4 70 in the early stage even if there were more substrates it was not conducive to the metabolic growth of most anaerobic microorganisms ma et al 2019b the sobs index increased with the increase in inoculum interestingly this index reached its maximum at s i 1 3 and then decreased again at s i 1 4 which indicated that the s i 1 3 condition was the most suitable for the growth and reproduction of most bacteria the shannon index of t3 was also the highest among all of the groups 5 60 which demonstrated that the substrate in t3 can be rapidly degraded by more varied hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in comparison with t4 to provide more abundant available substrate for the metabolism of methanogens zheng et al 2021 also demonstrated that the bacterial communities with higher diversity and uniformity contribute to the more efficient methane production a non metric multidimensional scale nmds analysis can typically reflect the differences of communities between groups and its accuracy is usually evaluated by its stress value typically a stress value 0 1 indicates that the model is more reliable and it was 0 039 in this study the community distribution differed significantly between groups p 0 05 which demonstrated that the s i ratio could significantly affect the distribution between bacterial communities the influence of the s i ratio on the structure of bacterial community was caused by the interaction between microorganisms intermediate substrates and environmental factors the dominant bacteria at the phylum level primarily included firmicutes thermotogae bacteroidetes proteobacteria tenericutes synergistetes actinobacteria and others fig 3c all of these are known to dominate the processes of hydrolysis and acidogenesis in ad dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 wang et al 2018 the abundance of firmicutes in t1 was the highest 65 11 among all the groups p 0 05 amin et al 2021 revealed that firmicutes can produce spores to resist extreme environments and then become the dominant bacteria in the community in contrast the acidic environment caused a decrease in the community diversity of t1 whereas firmicutes adapted to it and became the predominant microbe as the proportion of inoculum increased t3 and t4 the abundances of hydrolytic and acidogenic dominant bacteria increased significantly primarily thermotogae bacteroidetes and synergistetes which can hydrolyze and transform organic matter yang et al 2021 interestingly the abundances of bacteroidetes and synergistetes reached their maximum at s i 1 3 which were 11 31 and 7 95 respectively relevant studies have shown that bacteroidetes and synergistetes can degrade glucose cellobiose and amino acids to vfas co2 and h2 respectively dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 si et al 2016 moreover the enrichment of bacteroidetes and synergistetes could provide potent support to the methane metabolism of methanogens in t3 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 t3 and t4 were both relatively high methanogenic groups to further investigate the difference in bacterial composition between the two groups and identify the critical microorganisms a random forest was utilized to perform an algorithm analysis on the community composition at the phylum level fig 3d moreover mean decrease gini mdg was introduced to evaluate the importance of the bacteria typically a larger gini indicates that the bacteria are more important to the system long et al 2021 the mdg of the phyla actinobacteria fusobacteria verrucomicrobia firmicutes and synergistetes were the top 5 in system which indicated that these bacteria played significant roles in the process of ad importantly in contrast to t4 all of these microorganisms were more abundant in t3 interestingly although the abundance of actinobacteria was only 0 24 its mdg was the highest among all the bacteria which showed that the less abundant microbe was also critical in determining the performance of ad nguyen et al 2019 reported that actinobacteria was responsible for the conversion of polysaccharides and proteins to acetic acid propionic acid and h2 which provided the substrates for methanogenesis the mdg of fusobacteria and verrucomicrobia were 2 31 and 2 23 respectively these bacteria were involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis and could degrade organic compounds to vfas ma et al 2019a qiu et al 2014 additionally firmicutes and synergistetes have been proven to provide powerful support for the stable operation of ad wang et al 2018 patil et al 2021 suggested that the bacteria assigned to these phyla helped to establish a syntrophic relationship with methanogens and targeted the conversion of various organic compounds such as glucose lignocellulose and proteins to acetic acid and h2 fig 3e shows the bacterial community composition at the genus level lactobacillus was the most abundant bacteria in t1 33 94 which was significantly higher than those of the other three groups p 0 05 lactobacillus could target the conversion of carbohydrates that are rich in t1 to la wang et al 2020 the t2 t3 and t4 community contained a large amount of defluviitoga which can degrade cellulose into acetic acid h2 and co2 hania et al 2012 the hydrolysis of cellulose plays an important role in the rate limiting step of the hydrolysis of organic matter therefore the kd of the low s i ratios was the highest the abundances of proteiniphilum and acetomicrobium were the highest in t3 and were affiliated with the bacteroidetes and synergistetes phyla these two genera can convert complex organic matter thus continuously providing substrates for the subsequent production of methane wang et al 2021a 3 2 2 composition and variation of the archaeal community compared with the bacterial community the community diversity and richness of the archaea were much lower fig 4 a the sobs and shannon indices of t3 and t4 were the highest and there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 however the methane production of t3 was significantly higher than that of t4 which was primarily owing to the sufficient levels of available substrate and the higher abundance of synergistetes in t3 fig 3a since synergistetes has been proven to be an electrochemically active bacterium that can participate in interspecies electron transfer iet and establish syntrophic metabolism with hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium and methanospirillum it thereby contributes to the stimulation of methane production yang et al 2021 the nmds analysis of the stress of archaea was 0 030 in this study fig 4b no significant difference was observed in the distribution of archaeal communities between t1 and t2 p 0 332 which may be due to the selection pressure from high concentrations vfa the similar microbial concentration and buffer system in t3 and t4 may account for the lack of difference in the distribution of archaeal communities between them p 0 961 meng et al 2018 therefore differences between the two methanogenic processes need to be further characterized from the metabolic pathways euryarchaeota was the dominant archaea at the phylum level of each group fig 5 c most methanogens that are members of euryarchaeota methanobacterium methanosarcina methanoculleus and methanospirillum were the dominant archaea at the genus level fig 4d and their relative abundance among each group 90 among them methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanospirillum are hydrogenotrophic methanogens and can only use h2 and co2 for methanogenesis methanosarcina can simultaneously utilize h2 and acetate for methane metabolism dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 the abundance of methanobacterium in t3 and t4 was 75 11 and 60 53 respectively which indicated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the primary methanogenesis pathway methanosarcina in t4 was the most abundant 20 86 which was higher than that in t3 wang et al 2021b found that methanosarcina is better suited for survival in a high acetic acid environment before day 2 the acetic acid content of t4 was significantly higher than that of other groups fig 2i in particular methanospirillum was the most abundant in t3 and was the highest at 8 45 jing et al 2017 revealed that methanospirillum can be involved in the direct interspecies electron transfer diet by the reduction of co2 in methane metabolism thus effectively enhancing the performance of ad this signified that the enrichment with methanospirillum in t3 enhanced the stimulation of methane production 3 2 3 analysis of microbial correlation network under different s i ratios when the p 0 05 between two microbes the relationship between microorganisms is presented in the network fig 5 lactobacillus was negatively correlated with most of the genera in this network which showed that there was a competitive relationship between lactobacillus and the most connected microbes proteiniphilum significantly positively correlated with fastidiosipila tepidanaerobacter aminobacterium and acetomicrobium which were all abundant in t3 table s1 this implied that they exhibited a cooperative relationship among them which can synergistically promote the decomposition of small molecular organic substances thereby providing sufficient nutrient substrates for the metabolism of methanogens in t3 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a as for the analysis of the correlation between bacteria and archaea syntrophomonas was positively related with methanosarcina syntrophomonas has been confirmed to be a type of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob that can quickly convert h2 and co2 into acetic acid and then further catalyze it to methane by aceticlastic methanogens such as methanosarcina kurade et al 2019 tepidanaerobacter is classified under the firmicutes which was related to 20 types of microorganisms in the network tsavkelova et al 2018 revealed that tepidanaerobacter was a saob which was closely related to most hydrotrophic methanogens tepidanaerobacter and methanospirillum positively correlated in this network and their abundances were the highest in t3 1 65 and 8 45 respectively this implied that tepidanaerobacter could convert acetic acid into h2 and co2 and facilitate the syntrophic acetate oxidation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway which aids in the production of methane in t3 acetomicrobium was the only genus that was positively related to methanobacterium in this network indicating that the presence of acetomicrobium could support the growth of methanobacterium overall in the high s i ratio t1 the stress resistant groups that primarily contain lactobacillus were significantly enriched to adapt to severe environments and the negative correlation between microorganisms was more apparent which was the vital driving factor to inhibit the production of methane in contrast the microorganisms in the low s i ratios particularly in t3 had more synergetic relationships with each other in particular these microorganisms were likely to implement a unique niche in the system and affect the shift of overall metabolic pathway to the syntrophic metabolism pathway which contributed to methanogenesis 3 3 analysis of the entire metabolic pathway in ad 3 3 1 prediction of metabolic functions under different s i ratios in the ad process the metabolic function of ad microbial communities under different s i ratios was predicted using tax4fun fig 6 metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular process was the four main metabolic pathways in each group fig 6a the primary secondary metabolic pathways in t3 which were 7 23 7 69 and 6 04 respectively were amino acid metabolism energy metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins these values were significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 fig 6a 6b these metabolic pathways were closely related to proteiniphilum acetomicrobium and methanobacterium wang et al 2020 this showed that the amino acid metabolism led by proteiniphilum provides a rich nutrient substrate for methanogens while cofactors and vitamins can promote the catalytic reaction of cell functional enzymes thereby accelerating the anaerobic reaction process fan et al 2020 in addition the cell motility in t3 was significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 jarrell and albers 2012 demonstrated that the high levels of motility in methanogens are due to possession of multiple flagellae town and dumonceaux 2016 demonstrated that some genes that encode methanogenesis were also closely related to cell motility this indicated that the metabolic activity of methanogens in t3 was relatively higher the abundances of translation 17 31 and cell growth and death 2 63 in t2 were the highest which was consistent with the previous maximum kd of s i 1 2 further analysis illustrated that the metabolism of methane in t3 was significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 fig 6c indicating that the activity of methanogenic archaea in t3 might be higher than those of other groups overall the results demonstrated that the pathway of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in t3 dominated the hydrolysis process providing sufficient available substrates for subsequent acidogenesis moreover the variation in ph was stable fig 2h vigorous energy metabolism provided a potent guarantee for the consumption of energy in t3 in addition active cofactors effectively promoted the transfer of electrons and groups in the enzymatic reactions thereby accelerating the ad process thus the coordination of different levels of metabolism convincingly facilitate the production of methane in t3 3 3 2 analysis of the key metabolic pathways under different s i ratios to clearly reflect the key metabolic pathways of the optimal s i ratio the functional metabolic analyses from hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of each group was identified using the combination of tax4fun and kegg metabolic pathways fig 7 the abundances of alpha glucosidase were the highest in t1 fig 7a which indicated that the conversion of starch to pyruvate were the major hydrolysis pathways the abundances of endoglucanase and protease were higher in t3 and t4 fig 7a which demonstrated that bacteria that can degrade protein and cellulose were more abundant zou et al 2020 clarified that the enrichment of bacteroidetes was specifically favorable to degrade protein and cellulose in particular bacteroidetes was more abundant in t3 and t4 fig 3 during acidogenesis pyruvate produced by glycolysis is reduced to la by lactate dehydrogenase and the la is then degraded to propionate by propionate coa transferase during ad zhou et al 2018 levels of l lactate d lactate dehydrogenase and propionate coa transferase were higher in t1 than in the other groups as shown in fig 2 la was the initial product of anaerobic digestion at high s i ratios which was faster than the generation of vfas and reached a peak by day 2 the relative abundance of l lactate d lactate dehydrogenase suggests that the la produced in each group may have been mainly l lactic acid t1 contained higher levels of glucose than the other groups and was rich in lactobacillus leading to the observed high la levels over time some of the la may be converted to propionic acid by propionate coa transferase in addition the contents of propionic acid of t1 and t2 were significantly higher than those of t3 and t4 p 0 05 fig 2 on the one hand the excessive accumulation of propionic acid can significantly inhibit the metabolic activity of methanogens alternatively the gibbs free energy required for the conversion of propionic acid to acetic acid and h2 was higher t 35 ph 7 1 atm ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 3h2 h Î´g0 76 1 kj mol li et al 2020 which was the slowest in the conversion of all of the vfas to acetic acid and h2 therefore the methane production of t1 and t2 were lower than those of t3 and t4 importantly pyruvate kinase and acetate kinase were responsible for the metabolic pathways of acetate production and it was observed that their levels in t1 and t2 were higher than those in t3 and t4 although the acetic acid contents of t3 and t4 in the early stage were higher than those of t1 and t2 a large amount of acetic acid was consumed by methanosarcina to generate ch4 while some accumulation occurred in t1 and t2 the key enzyme encoding genes related to methanogenesis in t3 and t4 were obviously higher than those in t1 and t2 fig 7c indicating that appropriately reducing the s i ratio can significantly facilitate the metabolic function of methanogens the abundance of formate dehydrogenase alpha subunit was significantly higher in t3 during acidogenesis than in the other groups p 0 05 fig 7b formate c acetyltransferase catalyzes the breakdown of pyruvate to formic acid whereas formate dehydrogenase promotes the decomposition of formic acid into h2 and co2 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2021b these reactions support the methane metabolism by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in t3 other key enzymes in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway include indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase alpha subunit and coenzyme f420 hydrogenase beta subunit which target the reduction of co2 to formyl methylene and methyl groups using h2 as electron donors methyl groups are further converted to ch3 s com methyl com under the action of tetrahydromethylopterin s methyltransferase subunit a and finally reduced to ch4 by the methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit fang et al 2015 guo et al 2015 in the aceticlastic pathway acetic acid is first converted to acetyl coenzyme a by a variety of enzymes such as acetyl coa synthetase acetyl coa synthetase was most abundant in t3 thus promoting the synthesis of acetyl coa zheng et al 2021 observed that higher levels of acetyl coa synthetase are associated with more aceticlastic methanogenesis subsequently acetyl coenzyme a is catalyzed by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex to generate methyl with fdox ferredoxin as an electron acceptor which is then converted to ch4 through tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and methyl coenzyme m reductase fang et al 2015 guo et al 2015 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a and methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit are the key enzymes shared by all the metabolic pathways of methanogenesis it is worth noting that the abundances of key enzyme encoding genes in both the hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis pathways were the highest in t3 this also directly confirmed that s i 1 3 was the most conducive to the production of methane 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the influence of s i ratios on the overall ad process and elucidated the microbial interactions and entire metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio the results suggest that the acid suppression phenomenon was problematic in high s i ratios while the low s i ratios were associated with the production of methane an additional kinetic analysis illustrated that s i 1 3 had the largest methane yield as the s i gradually decreased the abundance and diversity of bacteria and archaea increased in particular they were exceptionally high in s i 1 3 the enrichment of synergistetes and bacteroidetes in s i 1 3 which helped to establish a syntrophic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogens furthermore microbial cooperation was higher at s i 1 3 the abundances of all the key enzyme encoding genes in the methanogenesis pathway under s i 1 3 were the highest taken together this information

16045,the substrate to inoculum ratio s i is a crucial factor that affects not only the stability of the anaerobic digestion ad of food waste fw but also the methanogenic capacity of the substrate this is of great significance for the start up of small scale batch reactors and the directional regulation of methanogenesi and organic acid production most studies have merely clarified the optimal s i ratio for methane production and revealed the basic composition of microbial communities however the mechanism of microbial interactions and the metabolic pathways behind the optimal s i ratio still remain unclear herein the effects of different s i ratios vs basis on the relationship of kinetic parameters microbial communities and metabolic pathways during the ad process of fw were holistically explored the results revealed that high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 were prone to irreversible acidification while low s i ratios 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were favorable for methanogenesis moreover a kinetic analysis demonstrated that the methane yield of s i 1 3 were the highest a bioinformatics analysis found that the diversity of bacteria and archaea of s i 1 3 were the most abundant and the enrichment of bacteroides and synergistetes could help to establish a syntrophic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogens which could aid in the fulfillment of a unique niche in the system in contrast to the findings with the other s i ratios the cooperation among microbes in s i 1 3 was more apparent notably the abundances of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the methanogenesis pathway under s i 1 3 were all the highest this knowledge will be helpful for revealing the influence mechanism of the ratio relationship between microorganisms and substrates on the biochemical metabolic process of anaerobic digestion thereby providing effective guidance for the directional regulation of fw batch anaerobic reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords food waste anaerobic digestion substrate to inoculum ratio microbial communities metabolic pathways 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely proven to be an economically efficient means for the disposal of organic waste such as food waste sludge and animal waste among others organic macromolecules are catabolized by anaerobic microorganisms to generate ch4 and co2 accompanied by a large number of value added chemicals such as volatile fatty acids vfas lactic acid la and ethanol lin et al 2018 a large amount of biogas slurry bs is typically produced during the process of ad of organic waste lu and xu 2021 found that approximately 0 20 to 0 47 tons of digestate is produced during the ad of fw per ton in which bs is the main part bs contains a variety of microorganisms and n and p elements and its ph value is typically stable between 7 0 and 8 0 thus this bs can be used as a suitable inoculum for the start up of anaerobic reactors kong et al 2016 found that when fw bs served as the inoculum the cumulative yield of ch4 could reach as high as 580 ml g vsadded which was higher than when sewage sludge was used as the inoculum zhou et al 2016 found that the maximum production of ch4 can reach 16 607 ml at ph 7 0 using bs from pig manure as inoculum as described above the bs produced by the ad of organic waste can be used as the inoculum for the start up of fw anaerobic reactors which can not only provide the key microorganisms for hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis but also recycle the waste s i is an important parameter affecting the stability of batch ad an s i ratio that is too high could cause toxicity destroy the syntropy between microbes and irreversibly acidify the reactor a lower s i ratio can prohibit the induction of enzymes required for ad and the maximum methane production cannot be achieved kong et al 2016 xing et al 2020 the identification of an optimal s i ratio in ad has been widely studied and has primarily focused on two subsequent perspectives the first was to determine the most suitable s i ratio for methanogenic efficiency by establishing a kinetic model xing et al 2020 reported that s i 0 07 is the most suitable ratio for the early start up operation of anaerobic reactors for the co digestion of fw and cow manure li et al 2018b found that the cumulative yield of methane can reach a maximum of 1075 ml g vs at s i 0 6 during the co digestion of fw and sludge the second was to elucidate the community structure under the optimal s i ratio using 16s rrna sequencing technology meng et al 2018 investigated the community composition of the optimal s i ratio for ch4 production s i 0 5 661 m3 t vs in the co digestion of pig urine and rice straw and found that the corresponding dominant microorganisms were clostridia methanosarcina and methanothermobacter ma et al 2019a reported that s i 2 3 was the most effective methanogenic ratio 209 1 ml g vsadded in a study of the co digestion of dairy manure and rapeseed straw and the predominant microorganisms in the community were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and methanosaeta it is thus apparent that the optimal s i ratio differs in different studies the nutrient composition of substrate and the physicochemical properties and microbial characteristics of inocula vary widely which could directly affect the results of studies to explore the s i ratio moreover different s i ratios can affect the key microorganisms and intermediate metabolites in ad resulting in variation in the functional metabolic pathways however the mechanism of microbial interactions and functional metabolism under the optimal s i ratio during the process of ad of fw still remain unclear key microorganisms can drive changes during the process parameters thus affecting the community composition and functional metabolism in ad wang et al 2018 a bioinformatics analysis can be applied to identify key microorganisms in complex communities and deduce the correlation between microbes for instance random forest analysis has been verified to be one of the exact tools in machine language to describe the systematic importance of each taxon long et al 2021 this type of analysis can be utilized to analyze and predict the key microorganisms in the anaerobic system based on the r language software and quantify the importance of each taxon to the anaerobic system therefore this analysis could reveal the relationship between key microorganisms and the performance of ad the relationship between microbes in the network can be constructed using a microbial correlation network analysis which can intuitively illustrate the interactions between microorganisms and thereby identify the key microorganisms that drive the changes in community composition and function zheng et al 2021 the prediction of metabolic pathways can predict the in depth metabolic functions owing to the perspective of expression of key functional genes tax4fun software can predict the spectrum of gene functions of the whole spectral system of bacteria and archaea based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathway database which helps to predict the functional metabolic pathways and the key enzymes of each group the tax4fun function prediction has been widely used in the studies of ad processes zheng et al 2021 compared the metabolic pathways of the co digestion of pig manure and corn stover under different c n based on tax4fun software ma et al 2021 also investigated the changes in the methanogenic functional genes during a study on the effects of magnetite on saline wastewater ad however although tax4fun software can be used to clarify the entire metabolic pathways in ad it still lacks the corresponding annotation on the key microbes in metabolic pathways using both random forest and microbial correlation networks can effectively remedy this defect thus helping to elucidate the differences in metabolic function and community structure at each s i ratio therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the ad performance of fw at different s i ratios and then comprehensively analyze the microbial interactions and whole metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio firstly the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis and methanogenesis under each s i ratio were analyzed and acidogenesis at the corresponding ratios was discussed afterwards the bacterial and archaeal community structure were analyzed using random forest and correlation network analyses finally comprehensive insights were used to reveal the functional metabolic pathways of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis under the optimal s i ratio the mutual corroboration of these results facilitates the selection of the optimal s i ratio thereby maximizing the synergistic actions between the substrate and the inoculated microorganisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum to ensure the homogeneity of the substrate the fw used in this research was synthesized by selecting widely representative food ingredients based on the component analysis of our previous study chen et al 2021 the main ingredients were rice 35 lean meat 10 fat 20 fish 3 3 chicken 8 3 soybeans 6 7 celery 8 3 and cabbage 8 3 these ingredients were crushed to 1 2 mm using a food grinder and stored at 20 the bs was collected from the fw anaerobic tank xiang an east solid waste treatment plant xiamen china the hydraulic retention time of the ad tank was 30 days and the daily intake of fw was approximately 440 mÂ³ which is similar to the amount of bs that was discharged daily after the bs was discharged from the tank it entered the sewage treatment process of the plant table 1 shows the composition and characteristics of fw and bs 2 2 experiment design the s i ratio based on the volatile solid was established at 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 respectively the fw and bs were mixed at 500 g the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of the mixture was maintained at approximately 15 the blank without any substrate was only inoculated with inoculum all experiments were performed in triplicate the methane production at each s i ratio was calculated by subtracting the methane production of the blank which was normalized to the standard temperature and pressure stp conditions 273 15 k and 1 atm holliger et al 2016 khadka et al 2022 each anaerobic bottle was connected to a 2 l gas sampling bag through a latex tube nitrogen was introduced into each bottle for 5 min before the experiment and the air in the bottle was removed to ensure that its state was absolutely anaerobic after that the bottles were placed in a thermostat water bath vibrator sha ba china with a speed of 120 rpm and the temperature was established at 37 1 the ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 in the initial stage and the ph of the material was adjusted with 5 0 m naoh and 2 0 m hcl the gas content was measured daily the digestion was deemed to be terminated when there was no significant difference in the production of methane a portion of the collected samples were stored at 4 to determine the physical and chemical properties and the other portion was frozen at 80 for the microbial community analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 physical and chemical analysis a cns element analyzer vario max germany was used to analyze the total carbon tc total nitrogen tn and carbon nitrogen ratio c n the measurements of oil and fat were determined using a sors extractor nai zfcdy 4z china the contents of starch and soluble proteins were determined using a starch kit and coomassie bright blue protein kit yx w c400 and yx w c202 sinobestbio shanghai china the contents of scod and nh4 n were determined by an analysis of water quality apha 2005 the samples were dried to a constant weight in a 105 oven to measure the total solid ts the oven dried samples were further heated for 3 h at 550 to determine the volatile soild vs the ph was determined by a hashdo parameter portable water quality analyzer hq40d usa the detailed analytical methods for ch4 vfas and la are explained in the supplementary information all the samples were analyzed in triplicate 2 3 2 microbial community analysis samples were collected at the end of the batch experiment for dna extraction a microbiological analysis was used to explore the structure of microbial communities and reveal the key metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio this analysis was performed on the group with the highest acid production s i 4 1 and the three groups with relatively high methane production s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 each group was designated as t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively microbial dna was extracted using hipure soil dna kits magen guangzhou china after the dna had been extracted the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes was amplified using the primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtcta at 3 the arch519f 5 cagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and arch915r 5 gtgctcccccgccaattcct 3 primers were used to amplify the archaeal 16s rrna v4 v5 region the purified amplification products were analyzed on an illumina platform novaseq 6000 gene denovo guangzhou china the bioinformatics analysis is shown in the supplementary information 2 3 3 kinetic analysis the kinetic models employed in this research were first order kinetic model and modified gompertz model and the detailed operations are shown in the supplementary information 2 4 statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation standard deviation of technical triplicates data processing was conducted using microsoft excel 2019 statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance anova using spss 22 0 ad performance and microbial communities of different s i were compared using one way anova and multiple comparison between groups were performed using least significant difference lsd method all the results were considered to be statistically significant at p 0 05 origin 2021 and adobe illustrator cs5 was used to draw the graphics a kinetic analysis was performed in origin 2021 a random forest algorithm analysis was conducted in r programming language 3 4 1 a correlation network was performed using gephi 0 9 2 software the microbial analysis platform used was omicsmart platform https www omicsmart com 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of different s i ratios on ad performance to explore the influence of different s i ratios on the performance of ad the kinetics of hydrolysis and methanogenesis were analyzed and changes in the composition of vfas production of la and ph were discussed 3 1 1 kinetic models analysis the vs content of the low s i ratios 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 decreased by approximately 30 this reduction was greater than those of the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 p 0 05 fig 1 a this finding indicated that an appropriate increase in the proportion of inoculum helps to degrade fw a first order kinetic model was utilized to characterize the hydrolytic process under different s i ratios r2 0 82 table 2 the kd of s i 4 1 0 21 d 1 was higher than those of s i 3 1 0 16 d 1 and 2 1 0 19 d 1 li et al 2018a found that when the biomass concentration was 5 g vss l the kd of substrate concentration was 20 g vs l which was greater than at 10 and 15 g vs l moreover s i 4 1 contained more organic components which provided a substantial carbon source for lactic acid bacteria resulting in the continuous production of la and a gradual decrease in ph fig 2 b 2c wu et al 2016 found that when the ph was between 4 and 5 the fw will be degraded by lactic acid bacteria to generate a large amount of la thereby clearly increasing the hydrolysis rate it was clearly apparent that the kd of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 0 33 0 25 and 0 29 d 1 respectively was higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 and the kd of s i 1 2 was the largest relevant studies have shown that ph values between 6 5 and 7 5 were more suitable for the growth of defluviitoga which acts as the predominant hydrolytic bacterium hania et al 2012 in this case the ph was weakly acidic 6 6 7 4 at s i 1 2 fig 2f and defluviitoga was the most abundant fig 3 e during the whole ad process the cumulative methane production of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 was 601 83 1747 52 and 1624 73 ml respectively which was clearly higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 fig 1b this was primarily because the bs inoculum contained a large number of methanogens which could facilitate the conversion of h2 co2 and acetic acid to ch4 kong et al 2016 wang et al 2018 in addition lsd between group comparison showed that the cumulative production of ch4 in s i 1 3 was significantly higher than that in the other two groups p 0 05 the growth and metabolism of the methanogens were the most vigorous at this ratio section 3 3 however the production of methane was extremely low in the high s i ratios this discrepancy was owing to the longer process of hydrolysis and irreversible acidification at the high s i ratios which renders a change in hydrolysis and acidogenesis to become the limiting step in the process of methanogenesis making it difficult to increase the cumulative production ma et al 2019b fig 1c shows the variation in the daily yield of ch4 at different s i ratios the daily yield of ch4 at the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 all decreased when the rates of hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the system were greater than that of methanogenesis large numbers of vfas were found to accumulate fig 2c 2f leading to a decrease in the daily rate of methane production wang et al 2018 however the daily yield of methane at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 increased first and then decreased during the digestion process the methane yield of s i 1 2 reached its maximum on day 1 which was 27 21 ml g vs while the s i 1 3 and 1 4 reached a peak by day 2 which was 86 63 and 86 36 ml g vs respectively this was owing to the quick degradation of organic matter which did not cause acidification and provided a sufficient nutrient substrate and an appropriate environment for the methanogens to metabolize methane as the digestion progressed the available substrate was gradually reduced thus the yield of methane gradually declined the discrepancy in the daily yield of methane during different s i ratios was caused by the difference in the biodegradability of organic matter in fw and the bs that was inoculated ma et al 2019b a modified gompertz model was applied to fit the dynamic process of methanogenesis r2 0 98 table 2 the pm and rm of s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were significantly higher than those of the high s i ratios p 0 05 zhang et al 2017 showed that lower kd and rm values indicated that the system was inhibited by the accumulation of acid fig 2a 2b the lag phase Î» reflected the delayed response and subsequent adaptation of microorganisms to the constantly changing environment li et al 2018a the Î» of s i 1 2 was the shortest 0 11 d while the kd 0 33 d 1 at this ratio was the largest this indicated that the hydrolytic bacteria can quickly respond to the changing environment which enables the rapid start of methanogenesis mao et al 2017 in addition the Î» of s i 1 3 and 1 4 was slightly higher than those of the high s i ratios notably in contrast to previous studies with a lag phase of 0 5 to 20 0 d cho et al 2013 kong et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the Î» of each s i ratio in this study was relatively short which could be owing to the quicker production of methane and shorter digestion period xing et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the effective fermentation time tef is equal to the time taken for methane production to reach 90 t90 minus the Î» the tef of s i 1 3 and 1 4 was longer than that of the other groups table 2 a longer tef and shorter Î» revealed that the conversion of organic matter was more efficiently converted into methane and the production of methane was higher mao et al 2017 3 1 2 changes in the concentrations of vfas and la and the ph under different s i ratios fig 2 illustrates the variation of vfas la and ph under different s i ratios the vfa concentrations at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were higher than those of the other ratios before day 3 fig 2a which was consistent with the higher kd the concentrations of vfas at the high s i ratios 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 significantly increased since day 3 p 0 05 a large amount of la could be converted into propionic acid by propionate dehydrogenase as the digestion of ad proceeded lee et al 2008 the concentration of propionic acid clearly increased at high s i ratios while that of la decreased dramatically fig 2c 2f compared with high s i ratios in the whole ad the acid concentrations at s i 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 were significantly lower thus the corresponding ph was more stable 6 68 7 62 li et al 2018a demonstrated that ph values between 6 5 and 8 2 are suitable for the growth and metabolism of methanogens the la concentrations at s i 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 were significantly higher than those at low s i ratios during the early stage p 0 05 fig 2b indicating that the synthesis of la was the dominant acidogenesis pathway at high s i ratios in contrast the accumulation of la results in a dramatic decrease in the ph 4 55 5 37 which leads to irreversible acidification and difficulty in smoothly transforming to methanogenesis an appropriate increase in ph aided the ability of lactic acid bacteria to synthesize la tang et al 2017 found that an appropriate increase from 4 to 5 in the ph aids in the stimulation in the production of la therefore from day 1 to day 2 the content of la increased as the ph increased the acetic acid concentrations at s i 1 3 and 1 4 were maximal on day 1 8 95 and 9 70 g cod l respectively which were clearly higher than that of the other groups fig 2c 2f indicating that anabolism of acetic acid was the primary metabolic pathway of acidogenesis in s i 1 3 and 1 4 at this time moreover the cumulative production of methane tended to increase significantly p 0 05 fig 2b furthermore although the concentrations of the acetic acid of s i 4 1 3 1 2 1 and 1 1 could reach 7 50 10 16 g cod l the cumulative methane production was significantly lower than that under the low s i ratios this could be because the sudden decrease in ph severely inhibited the process of the use of acetic acid by aceticlastic methanogens to produce methane in addition to s i 1 3 and 1 4 the concentration of propionic acid in other groups was extremely high li et al 2020 concluded that when the concentration of propionic acid exceeded 5 g cod l it strongly inhibited methanogenesis 3 2 microbial community structure analysis in this study a detailed community structure analysis was conducted on the s i 4 1 t1 with the greatest amount of production of vfas and la and three groups of s i 1 2 t2 s i 1 3 t3 and s i 1 4 t4 with relatively high yield of methane 3 2 1 composition and variation of the bacterial community to investigate the diversity of bacterial communities in the ad process between each group a statistical evaluation was performed using the sobs and shannon indices the sobs index is adopted to assess the abundance of communities while the shannon index is usually applied to characterize the diversity of communities the sobs index of t1 was 577 17 which was significantly lower than those of t2 t3 and t4 674 50 685 75 and 679 00 respectively fig 3a p 0 05 typically a more severe environment leads to simpler communities vasconcelos et al 2016 the ph of t1 was approximately 4 55 4 70 in the early stage even if there were more substrates it was not conducive to the metabolic growth of most anaerobic microorganisms ma et al 2019b the sobs index increased with the increase in inoculum interestingly this index reached its maximum at s i 1 3 and then decreased again at s i 1 4 which indicated that the s i 1 3 condition was the most suitable for the growth and reproduction of most bacteria the shannon index of t3 was also the highest among all of the groups 5 60 which demonstrated that the substrate in t3 can be rapidly degraded by more varied hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria in comparison with t4 to provide more abundant available substrate for the metabolism of methanogens zheng et al 2021 also demonstrated that the bacterial communities with higher diversity and uniformity contribute to the more efficient methane production a non metric multidimensional scale nmds analysis can typically reflect the differences of communities between groups and its accuracy is usually evaluated by its stress value typically a stress value 0 1 indicates that the model is more reliable and it was 0 039 in this study the community distribution differed significantly between groups p 0 05 which demonstrated that the s i ratio could significantly affect the distribution between bacterial communities the influence of the s i ratio on the structure of bacterial community was caused by the interaction between microorganisms intermediate substrates and environmental factors the dominant bacteria at the phylum level primarily included firmicutes thermotogae bacteroidetes proteobacteria tenericutes synergistetes actinobacteria and others fig 3c all of these are known to dominate the processes of hydrolysis and acidogenesis in ad dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 wang et al 2018 the abundance of firmicutes in t1 was the highest 65 11 among all the groups p 0 05 amin et al 2021 revealed that firmicutes can produce spores to resist extreme environments and then become the dominant bacteria in the community in contrast the acidic environment caused a decrease in the community diversity of t1 whereas firmicutes adapted to it and became the predominant microbe as the proportion of inoculum increased t3 and t4 the abundances of hydrolytic and acidogenic dominant bacteria increased significantly primarily thermotogae bacteroidetes and synergistetes which can hydrolyze and transform organic matter yang et al 2021 interestingly the abundances of bacteroidetes and synergistetes reached their maximum at s i 1 3 which were 11 31 and 7 95 respectively relevant studies have shown that bacteroidetes and synergistetes can degrade glucose cellobiose and amino acids to vfas co2 and h2 respectively dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 si et al 2016 moreover the enrichment of bacteroidetes and synergistetes could provide potent support to the methane metabolism of methanogens in t3 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 t3 and t4 were both relatively high methanogenic groups to further investigate the difference in bacterial composition between the two groups and identify the critical microorganisms a random forest was utilized to perform an algorithm analysis on the community composition at the phylum level fig 3d moreover mean decrease gini mdg was introduced to evaluate the importance of the bacteria typically a larger gini indicates that the bacteria are more important to the system long et al 2021 the mdg of the phyla actinobacteria fusobacteria verrucomicrobia firmicutes and synergistetes were the top 5 in system which indicated that these bacteria played significant roles in the process of ad importantly in contrast to t4 all of these microorganisms were more abundant in t3 interestingly although the abundance of actinobacteria was only 0 24 its mdg was the highest among all the bacteria which showed that the less abundant microbe was also critical in determining the performance of ad nguyen et al 2019 reported that actinobacteria was responsible for the conversion of polysaccharides and proteins to acetic acid propionic acid and h2 which provided the substrates for methanogenesis the mdg of fusobacteria and verrucomicrobia were 2 31 and 2 23 respectively these bacteria were involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis and could degrade organic compounds to vfas ma et al 2019a qiu et al 2014 additionally firmicutes and synergistetes have been proven to provide powerful support for the stable operation of ad wang et al 2018 patil et al 2021 suggested that the bacteria assigned to these phyla helped to establish a syntrophic relationship with methanogens and targeted the conversion of various organic compounds such as glucose lignocellulose and proteins to acetic acid and h2 fig 3e shows the bacterial community composition at the genus level lactobacillus was the most abundant bacteria in t1 33 94 which was significantly higher than those of the other three groups p 0 05 lactobacillus could target the conversion of carbohydrates that are rich in t1 to la wang et al 2020 the t2 t3 and t4 community contained a large amount of defluviitoga which can degrade cellulose into acetic acid h2 and co2 hania et al 2012 the hydrolysis of cellulose plays an important role in the rate limiting step of the hydrolysis of organic matter therefore the kd of the low s i ratios was the highest the abundances of proteiniphilum and acetomicrobium were the highest in t3 and were affiliated with the bacteroidetes and synergistetes phyla these two genera can convert complex organic matter thus continuously providing substrates for the subsequent production of methane wang et al 2021a 3 2 2 composition and variation of the archaeal community compared with the bacterial community the community diversity and richness of the archaea were much lower fig 4 a the sobs and shannon indices of t3 and t4 were the highest and there was no significant difference between them p 0 05 however the methane production of t3 was significantly higher than that of t4 which was primarily owing to the sufficient levels of available substrate and the higher abundance of synergistetes in t3 fig 3a since synergistetes has been proven to be an electrochemically active bacterium that can participate in interspecies electron transfer iet and establish syntrophic metabolism with hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium and methanospirillum it thereby contributes to the stimulation of methane production yang et al 2021 the nmds analysis of the stress of archaea was 0 030 in this study fig 4b no significant difference was observed in the distribution of archaeal communities between t1 and t2 p 0 332 which may be due to the selection pressure from high concentrations vfa the similar microbial concentration and buffer system in t3 and t4 may account for the lack of difference in the distribution of archaeal communities between them p 0 961 meng et al 2018 therefore differences between the two methanogenic processes need to be further characterized from the metabolic pathways euryarchaeota was the dominant archaea at the phylum level of each group fig 5 c most methanogens that are members of euryarchaeota methanobacterium methanosarcina methanoculleus and methanospirillum were the dominant archaea at the genus level fig 4d and their relative abundance among each group 90 among them methanobacterium methanoculleus and methanospirillum are hydrogenotrophic methanogens and can only use h2 and co2 for methanogenesis methanosarcina can simultaneously utilize h2 and acetate for methane metabolism dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 the abundance of methanobacterium in t3 and t4 was 75 11 and 60 53 respectively which indicated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the primary methanogenesis pathway methanosarcina in t4 was the most abundant 20 86 which was higher than that in t3 wang et al 2021b found that methanosarcina is better suited for survival in a high acetic acid environment before day 2 the acetic acid content of t4 was significantly higher than that of other groups fig 2i in particular methanospirillum was the most abundant in t3 and was the highest at 8 45 jing et al 2017 revealed that methanospirillum can be involved in the direct interspecies electron transfer diet by the reduction of co2 in methane metabolism thus effectively enhancing the performance of ad this signified that the enrichment with methanospirillum in t3 enhanced the stimulation of methane production 3 2 3 analysis of microbial correlation network under different s i ratios when the p 0 05 between two microbes the relationship between microorganisms is presented in the network fig 5 lactobacillus was negatively correlated with most of the genera in this network which showed that there was a competitive relationship between lactobacillus and the most connected microbes proteiniphilum significantly positively correlated with fastidiosipila tepidanaerobacter aminobacterium and acetomicrobium which were all abundant in t3 table s1 this implied that they exhibited a cooperative relationship among them which can synergistically promote the decomposition of small molecular organic substances thereby providing sufficient nutrient substrates for the metabolism of methanogens in t3 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021a as for the analysis of the correlation between bacteria and archaea syntrophomonas was positively related with methanosarcina syntrophomonas has been confirmed to be a type of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob that can quickly convert h2 and co2 into acetic acid and then further catalyze it to methane by aceticlastic methanogens such as methanosarcina kurade et al 2019 tepidanaerobacter is classified under the firmicutes which was related to 20 types of microorganisms in the network tsavkelova et al 2018 revealed that tepidanaerobacter was a saob which was closely related to most hydrotrophic methanogens tepidanaerobacter and methanospirillum positively correlated in this network and their abundances were the highest in t3 1 65 and 8 45 respectively this implied that tepidanaerobacter could convert acetic acid into h2 and co2 and facilitate the syntrophic acetate oxidation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway which aids in the production of methane in t3 acetomicrobium was the only genus that was positively related to methanobacterium in this network indicating that the presence of acetomicrobium could support the growth of methanobacterium overall in the high s i ratio t1 the stress resistant groups that primarily contain lactobacillus were significantly enriched to adapt to severe environments and the negative correlation between microorganisms was more apparent which was the vital driving factor to inhibit the production of methane in contrast the microorganisms in the low s i ratios particularly in t3 had more synergetic relationships with each other in particular these microorganisms were likely to implement a unique niche in the system and affect the shift of overall metabolic pathway to the syntrophic metabolism pathway which contributed to methanogenesis 3 3 analysis of the entire metabolic pathway in ad 3 3 1 prediction of metabolic functions under different s i ratios in the ad process the metabolic function of ad microbial communities under different s i ratios was predicted using tax4fun fig 6 metabolism genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular process was the four main metabolic pathways in each group fig 6a the primary secondary metabolic pathways in t3 which were 7 23 7 69 and 6 04 respectively were amino acid metabolism energy metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins these values were significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 fig 6a 6b these metabolic pathways were closely related to proteiniphilum acetomicrobium and methanobacterium wang et al 2020 this showed that the amino acid metabolism led by proteiniphilum provides a rich nutrient substrate for methanogens while cofactors and vitamins can promote the catalytic reaction of cell functional enzymes thereby accelerating the anaerobic reaction process fan et al 2020 in addition the cell motility in t3 was significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 jarrell and albers 2012 demonstrated that the high levels of motility in methanogens are due to possession of multiple flagellae town and dumonceaux 2016 demonstrated that some genes that encode methanogenesis were also closely related to cell motility this indicated that the metabolic activity of methanogens in t3 was relatively higher the abundances of translation 17 31 and cell growth and death 2 63 in t2 were the highest which was consistent with the previous maximum kd of s i 1 2 further analysis illustrated that the metabolism of methane in t3 was significantly higher than those of the other groups p 0 05 fig 6c indicating that the activity of methanogenic archaea in t3 might be higher than those of other groups overall the results demonstrated that the pathway of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in t3 dominated the hydrolysis process providing sufficient available substrates for subsequent acidogenesis moreover the variation in ph was stable fig 2h vigorous energy metabolism provided a potent guarantee for the consumption of energy in t3 in addition active cofactors effectively promoted the transfer of electrons and groups in the enzymatic reactions thereby accelerating the ad process thus the coordination of different levels of metabolism convincingly facilitate the production of methane in t3 3 3 2 analysis of the key metabolic pathways under different s i ratios to clearly reflect the key metabolic pathways of the optimal s i ratio the functional metabolic analyses from hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis of each group was identified using the combination of tax4fun and kegg metabolic pathways fig 7 the abundances of alpha glucosidase were the highest in t1 fig 7a which indicated that the conversion of starch to pyruvate were the major hydrolysis pathways the abundances of endoglucanase and protease were higher in t3 and t4 fig 7a which demonstrated that bacteria that can degrade protein and cellulose were more abundant zou et al 2020 clarified that the enrichment of bacteroidetes was specifically favorable to degrade protein and cellulose in particular bacteroidetes was more abundant in t3 and t4 fig 3 during acidogenesis pyruvate produced by glycolysis is reduced to la by lactate dehydrogenase and the la is then degraded to propionate by propionate coa transferase during ad zhou et al 2018 levels of l lactate d lactate dehydrogenase and propionate coa transferase were higher in t1 than in the other groups as shown in fig 2 la was the initial product of anaerobic digestion at high s i ratios which was faster than the generation of vfas and reached a peak by day 2 the relative abundance of l lactate d lactate dehydrogenase suggests that the la produced in each group may have been mainly l lactic acid t1 contained higher levels of glucose than the other groups and was rich in lactobacillus leading to the observed high la levels over time some of the la may be converted to propionic acid by propionate coa transferase in addition the contents of propionic acid of t1 and t2 were significantly higher than those of t3 and t4 p 0 05 fig 2 on the one hand the excessive accumulation of propionic acid can significantly inhibit the metabolic activity of methanogens alternatively the gibbs free energy required for the conversion of propionic acid to acetic acid and h2 was higher t 35 ph 7 1 atm ch3ch2coo 3h2o ch3coo hco3 3h2 h Î´g0 76 1 kj mol li et al 2020 which was the slowest in the conversion of all of the vfas to acetic acid and h2 therefore the methane production of t1 and t2 were lower than those of t3 and t4 importantly pyruvate kinase and acetate kinase were responsible for the metabolic pathways of acetate production and it was observed that their levels in t1 and t2 were higher than those in t3 and t4 although the acetic acid contents of t3 and t4 in the early stage were higher than those of t1 and t2 a large amount of acetic acid was consumed by methanosarcina to generate ch4 while some accumulation occurred in t1 and t2 the key enzyme encoding genes related to methanogenesis in t3 and t4 were obviously higher than those in t1 and t2 fig 7c indicating that appropriately reducing the s i ratio can significantly facilitate the metabolic function of methanogens the abundance of formate dehydrogenase alpha subunit was significantly higher in t3 during acidogenesis than in the other groups p 0 05 fig 7b formate c acetyltransferase catalyzes the breakdown of pyruvate to formic acid whereas formate dehydrogenase promotes the decomposition of formic acid into h2 and co2 guo et al 2015 wang et al 2021b these reactions support the methane metabolism by hydrogenotrophic methanogens in t3 other key enzymes in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway include indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase alpha subunit and coenzyme f420 hydrogenase beta subunit which target the reduction of co2 to formyl methylene and methyl groups using h2 as electron donors methyl groups are further converted to ch3 s com methyl com under the action of tetrahydromethylopterin s methyltransferase subunit a and finally reduced to ch4 by the methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit fang et al 2015 guo et al 2015 in the aceticlastic pathway acetic acid is first converted to acetyl coenzyme a by a variety of enzymes such as acetyl coa synthetase acetyl coa synthetase was most abundant in t3 thus promoting the synthesis of acetyl coa zheng et al 2021 observed that higher levels of acetyl coa synthetase are associated with more aceticlastic methanogenesis subsequently acetyl coenzyme a is catalyzed by the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase complex to generate methyl with fdox ferredoxin as an electron acceptor which is then converted to ch4 through tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase and methyl coenzyme m reductase fang et al 2015 guo et al 2015 tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a and methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit are the key enzymes shared by all the metabolic pathways of methanogenesis it is worth noting that the abundances of key enzyme encoding genes in both the hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis pathways were the highest in t3 this also directly confirmed that s i 1 3 was the most conducive to the production of methane 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the influence of s i ratios on the overall ad process and elucidated the microbial interactions and entire metabolic pathways under the optimal s i ratio the results suggest that the acid suppression phenomenon was problematic in high s i ratios while the low s i ratios were associated with the production of methane an additional kinetic analysis illustrated that s i 1 3 had the largest methane yield as the s i gradually decreased the abundance and diversity of bacteria and archaea increased in particular they were exceptionally high in s i 1 3 the enrichment of synergistetes and bacteroidetes in s i 1 3 which helped to establish a syntrophic relationship with hydrogenotrophic methanogens furthermore microbial cooperation was higher at s i 1 3 the abundances of all the key enzyme encoding genes in the methanogenesis pathway under s i 1 3 were the highest taken together this information

16046,presence of microplastics mps in wastewater has posed a huge ecosystem risk constructed wetlands cws can effectively intercept mps while with mps accumulation the response of cws performance is still unclear in order to evaluate those effects we conducted a 370 day experiment using cw microcosms fed with different levels 0 10 100 and 1000 Î¼g l of polystyrene ps mps diameter 50 100 Î¼m results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was increased by 3 9 24 7 during the first 60 days and then decreased by 7 1 41 3 with mps accumulating but no obvious change in cod and tp removal was observed from further analysis mps accumulation changed the biofilm composition toc content increased from 41 4 to 52 7 substrate porosity electrical resistivity increased by 1 2 2 4 folds and oxygen mass transfer k l a o 2 increased from 3 5 to 18 6 moreover the microbial dynamics presented a higher abundance of nitrifiers nitrospira and nitrosomonas during the 60 day experiment and a lower abundance in the last days while denitrifiers thauera thiobacillus and anaerolinea had a high relative abundance throughout the experiment being consistent with the variation of nitrification and denitrification rates finally structural equation model analysis proved that due to the changes of substrate characteristics and microbial compositions and activities the obvious decrease in nitrification efficiency was a direct reason for the decline of nitrogen removal during 370 day mps accumulation overall our study first prove that mps accumulation can cause a series of changes in physicochemical and microbial characteristics of substrate and ultimately affect the nitrogen transforming process in cws although our conclusions were based on the lab scale cws being different from the real wetlands we hope that the conclusions can provide the effective regulatory strategies to guide the control of mps in the actual wetlands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetlands nitrogen removal microplastics substrate characteristic microbial composition activity 1 introduction during the last several years micro sized plastics mps 0 1 Î¼m diameter 5 mm as an emerging particle pollutant have attracted much attention hartmann et al 2019 mps include primary plastic particles i e originally produced in numerous personal care and cosmetic products and secondary plastic debris resulting from the degradation or fragmentation of larger plastics jambeck et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 as previous studies reported the abundance of mps has likewise escalated rapidly in the environment such as in the ocean ranging from 8 to 9200 items m3 cai et al 2018 song et al 2014 in rivers from 0 03 to 1265 items l xiong et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 in lakes from 1 19 to 12 61 items l su et al 2016 and in soil from 465 to 13000 items kg dry soil buks and kaupenjohann 2020 recently wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a main source contributing more than 400 items l of mps were focused frequently simon et al 2018 mps are directly rinsed down municipal sewage with household wastewater and rain runoff and end up at the wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2019 the abundance of mps in raw sewage approximately varied from 60 to 1200 Î¼g l simon et al 2018 and above 90 of mps could be strained efficiently by wwtps entering the sludge murphy et al 2016 therefore whether it is effluent or sludge discharging has the possibility of mps entering the environment again and wastewater treatment process that can effectively trap mps without the secondary discharging risk need to be found constructed wetland cw is an alternative facility for wastewater treatment with the advantage of being low cost and easy to operate and maintain wu et al 2015 moreover cws have an excellent capacity to hold up the particle pollutants because of the presence of abundant biofilms and rhizosphere and absence of sludge discharging previous studies have reported that above 90 of metal oxide nanoparticles are trapped in cws huang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 and recent studies also reported that approximately 97 of nano sized plastics ma et al 2021 and 88 98 of total mps could be removed by cws wang et al 2021 2020 the trapped mps will not migrate or even flow out in cw system due to the increase of infiltration volume and concentration o connor et al 2019 therefore cw is an effective barrier against mps entering into the ecological environment as we known cw has a huge biofilm system including substrate and rhizosphere biofilms donlan 2002 healthy biofilm structure and microbial physiological activities are of great significance to stable wetland processes mu et al 2020 generally under 370 day adaptation and hydraulic disturbance the thickness of biofilms is maintained at a constant range and the efficiency of mass transfer from outside to inside of the biofilm remains stable wasche et al 2002 a typical example is that oxygen concentration in biofilms gradually decreases from outside to inside forming a good aerobic anoxic anaerobic model while nitrogenous contaminations i e nh4 n no3 n and no2 n can be transformed layer by layer in biofilms to ensure the thorough nitrogen removal therefore a healthy biofilm system has normal oxygen uptake and respiration capacities to ensure stable physiological activities of functional microorganisms currently it has been reported that the accumulation of mps can provide a good habitat for the growth of microorganisms and form a strong biofilm system with a different microbiota structure li et al 2021 however our previous study had confirmed that nano sized plastics nps diameter 100 nm had serious impacts on biofilm systems due to interference with microbial metabolism and plant activities yang et al 2020 different from nps the particle size of mps is much larger than that of individual cell and then the action mode and impact of mps with biofilm system should be significantly different from those of nps yet which was unknown in cws in addition mps accumulates in the substrate voids of cw and detailed knowhow of influence on the biofilm structure and physicochemical characteristics as well as treatment performance is still rarely reported these gaps need to be further revealed in detail which is also of great significance for deeply understanding the impact of plastic particles on the treatment performance of cws driven by these gaps we herein utilized subsurface flow ssf cws planted with cattail to a investigate the efficiency of mps removal and the variation of treatment performance in cws b discriminate the variation of substrate characteristics c analyse the change of biofilm structure and microbial composition and activity and d identify the key causes of performance change under the 60 and 370 day accumulation of mps finally our results indicated whether cws could effectively treat wastewater containing mps for a long time and how the inside system and treatment efficiency responded to mps accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mps suspension and synthetic wastewater in this study polystyrene ps parental columns length 2 3 mm diameter 1 mm were purchased from beisile co ltd tianjin china the preparation of qualified mps was achieved by grinding and sieving and their surface morphology and element distribution were observed using a ccd microscope camera leica dfc 365 fx buffalo grove germany and a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f plus jsm japan and the images are shown in fig s1 of supporting information si synthetic wastewater with different level mps was prepared according to our previous study yang et al 2020 having the following characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod 200 5 mg l tn 30 0 5 mg l nh4 n 20 0 5 mg l total phosphorus tp 5 0 5 mg l and no3 n and no2 n 1 5 mg l the preparation details of mps and synthetic wastewater is provided in text s1 2 2 experimental wetlands set up and operation given that lab scale cw microcosms can more conveniently and effectively find the problems in time handle the experiment condition and improve the result accuracy the twelve ssf cw microcosms 4 sets 3 replicates were constructed with a bulk volume of 0 045 m3 length 0 3 m width 0 3 m height 0 5 m and pore volume 10 l all cw microcosms were in a greenhouse fig s2 and was worked in batch mode hydraulic retention time is 5 days four groups were set as 0 10 100 and 1000 Î¼g l of mps according to our previous study yang et al 2020 and all groups were performed in triplicate all cw microcosms were filled with gravel diameter 8 10 mm porosity 0 4 and cattails typha latifolia were planted in all cw microcosms at the beginning of the 4 month biofilm preincubation synthetic wastewater was added into cw microcosms as a batch model at the start of each batch and were gravity drained within 1 h prior to the next batch the whole experiment lasted 370 days 74 batches each batch lasted for 5 days to ensure the accuracy of results calculating the effluent concentration the water levels at the beginning and end of each batch were recorded to avoid the deviation caused by evaporation detailed methods of set up and operations are provided in text s2 2 3 sample collection and analytical methods 2 3 1 assays for nutrient removal ps mps quantity in effluent during the formal exposure experiment water samples were collected at the end of each batch specially in the typical batches water samples were taken from each cw microcosm and each batch at 0 1 2 4 7 12 24 30 38 48 72 96 and 120 h it was noted that the vertical gradients in the water chemistry were not observed in the preliminary experiment and our previous experiments with the same microcosm chen et al 2014 therefore water samples at a depth of only 20 cm were sampled and stored in a serum bottle and then used to determine the nutrient concentrations cod tp tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n within 1 h of using the standard methods outlined in apha 2017 in order to quantify the number of ps mps retained in cws one litter of effluent was collected with a glass bottle at the end of the last batch in each stage then all the samples were filtered dried separated centrifuged filtrated and stained finally the stained mps on the filters were observed and counted by a fluorescence microscope olympus bx 60 fluorescence microscope japan simon et al 2018 the detailed procedures are provided in text s3 2 3 2 assays for nitrification denitrification and respiration rates nitrification and denitrification rates were assessed according to dong and reddy 2012 and thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 respectively with little modification nitrification rate was expressed using the slope of the first order function of total no2 n and no3 n concentrations in solution and time denitrification rate was detected using isotope labeling technology and were calculated by 29n2 and 30n2 content in the gaseous product 15n pairing technique specially basal respiration starvation treatment representing basal microbial activities and substrate induced respiration with glucose addition representing potential microbial activities in cws were detected by quantifying the released co2 su et al 2019a detailed methods about nitrification denitrification and respiration rates are provided in text s4 2 3 3 observation and quantification of biofilms in cws in order to characterize the morphology of biofilm more vividly the extracellular polymeric substance fluorescence in situ staining eps fiss was conducted at the end of 370 day experiment briefly substrate samples distinguishing gravel and mps from substrate were washed with phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 2 and soaked in sodium bicarbonate nahco3 solution ensuring the amino group without protonation fluoresce isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin con a calcofluor white and nile red solutions were used to stain proteins Î± polysaccharide Î² polysaccharide and lipids respectively the eps of biofilm was extracted through formaldehyde sodium hydroxide naoh according to liu and fang 2002 the detailed parameters and processes of total protein and organic carbon analysis are shown in text s5 2 3 4 assays for microorganism community structure the impacts of mps accumulation on microbiota structure were analysed by characterizing the relative abundance of key microorganisms briefly 20 g of substrate samples mixed gravel and mps were collected from three depths 10 25 and 45 cm in control and high level cw microcosms and mixed together then they were stored at 20 c until dna extraction using a fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions finally the microbial abundance was calculated from the copy numbers of the 16s rrna gene according to previous literature yang et al 2020 the details of the extension procedure and the diversity assays are given in text s6 2 4 assays for the operating condition of cws 2 4 1 calculation of oxygen mass transfer and oxygen uptake rates dissolved oxygen do concentrations were detected at the 25 cm depth of wetland microcosms to calculate the kla o2 oxygen uptake rate our depends on kla o2 which reciprocally represents the time from c0 to cs tyroller et al 2010 hence kla o2 in this study was negative and herein the absolute value of kla o2 k l a o 2 indicated the time from cs to co in our study we stipulated the synthetic influent was in oxygen saturated condition before pouring into cws detailed calculation process of our is provided in text s7 2 4 2 detection of the electronic resistivity generally the electronic resistivity er is the resistance value per unit distance of the wetland substrate which can reflect the porosity of wetland system with a negative correlation liu et al 2018 in order to accurately measure the er of wetland microcosms a standard laboratory procedure was applied following liu et al 2018 and kalinski and kelly 1993 with a little modification briefly one of multimeter electrodes was fixed on one side of cw microcosm and the other electrode as a moving electrode was used to test the electrical resistance between the two electrodes of different widths in cws finally the er was calculated using the resistance values and distances between electrodes the schematic diagram is shown in fig s3 2 5 statistical analysis all data assays were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as the mean standard deviation analysis of variance one way anova was used to examine the significance of the results followed by the lsd post hoc test and p 0 05 was statistically significant spss v 22 0 ibm the structure equation model was used to identify the key causes affecting nitrogen removing transformation in cws exposing to mps amos 21 0 ibm 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance of cws in this study the treatment performance of cws varied with mps accumulation especially nh4 n removal according to the nh4 n removal characteristics the whole experiment was divided into two stages the day 0 60 batch 1 12 and day 60 370 batch 13 74 in detail as shown in fig 1 a and s3a during day 0 60 the control groups 81 4 3 4 were inferior to mps treatment groups average 85 2 6 0 and during day 60 370 the control groups 79 9 5 0 were gradually superior to mps treatment groups average 51 6 19 4 especially mps 100 and mps 1000 groups for other nitrogenous parameters in these two stages tn removal efficiency resembled the trend of nh4 n concentrations and no obvious difference had been observed in mps accumulation while at the end of 370 day experiment 100 and 1000 mg l of mps treatment significantly weakened tn removal fig 1b and s3c and the minor amounts of no3 n and no2 n were detected in effluent removal efficiencies 85 during 370 day experiment fig s3b in addition tp removal efficiency of all cws remained 55 8 8 2 approximately 2 mg l in effluent fig 1c and s5a in all groups and the cod removal efficiency kept approximately 85 5 1 7 in the whole experiment fig 1d and s5b in general the 370 day accumulation of mps has a significant impact on nitrogen removal of cws and has a slight interference on tp and cod removals given that the nitrogen removal kinetics the batch 12 day 55 60 and batch 74 day 365 370 were regarded as the typical batches representing the two stages and revealing the impact mechanism by analysing the responses of substrate characteristics and microbial community and activities respectively 3 2 variation of substrate characteristic 3 2 1 retaining efficiency of mps by detecting and calculating the abundance of mps in substrate at the end of 60 and 370 day experiments the results showed that the cw system could effectively intercept mps 98 5 99 6 for 60 day exposure and 96 7 98 1 for 370 day exposure table 1 in addition the interception capacity of cws to mps at the end of 370 day accumulation was slightly lower than that of the 60 day accumulation which underlined that 370 day accumulation of mps in cws may decrease the interception capacity of substrate biofilm to mps themselves and even other contaminations our research results are also consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2020 and ma et al 2021 who demonstrated that the mps retention capacities averaged 88 and over 97 in horizontal ssf cws and vertical flow cws vfcws respectively however little is known about why the retention capacity of cws changed and the response mechanisms of treatment performance to mps during the 370 day accumulation i e at least one year 3 2 2 changes of biofilm structure and substrate porosity in this study eps fiss method was used to characterize the morphology of biofilms on the surface of gravel and mps as shown in fig 2 a in the control group the total proteins polysaccharides and lipids in biofilms showed a strong fluorescence intensity but sparse distribution and on the whole the thickness of biofilms was equally distributed on gravel without obvious vacancy and accumulation fig 2a such results indicated that the biofilms grew well on gravel and simultaneously implied that detachment may occur when they accumulated to a certain thickness for ensuring the biomass for 370 day operation of cws domozych and domozych 2008 fig 2b shows the fluorescence spectrum of biofilms components covering the mps surface in which protein and Î± polysaccharides were sparsely distributed while Î² polysaccharides and lipids were very dense and the overall biofilm morphology was thick generally the total protein and total organic carbon in extracellular polymers accounted for 90 of the biofilm mass in which protein e g alanine and cysteine hydrophobic groups with positive charges reduced microbial cell surface charges donlan 2002 in contrast mps usually presented a negative charge mao et al 2018 and could electrically neutralize with the positive charge on the biofilm which finally resulted in disintegration and sparse distribution of proteins on the surface of mps as shown in table 2 the total protein content had a significant decrease in the medium high concentration treatments which implied that automatic self renewal ability of biofilms could decline in addition Î² polysaccharides generally have a bridge effect and can form a grid skeleton between microbe microbe and microbe substrate to maintain the structural stability of a biofilm system seviour et al 2009 pervious study has reported that the surface of aged plastic generally had the oh and cooh groups chen et al 2021 while exposing to the strong oxide stimulation microorganisms might protect themselves by secreting a few of eps containing the Î² polysaccharide therefore in our study a large amount of Î² polysaccharide was distributed on the surface of mps and the content of total organic carbon increased significantly which might result from the aging of mps and be also a key reason for forming the thick and dense biofilm table 2 overall mps can be regarded as a super matrix of biofilms that enhanced the capability of trapping mps and become a great hidden danger by decreasing porosity in cws as shown in fig 3 the detection of electrical resistivity er in cws was detected in the 60 and 370 day experiments the results indicated that for 60 day operation the 30 50 cm depth of cws represented the higher er values 1 6 kÏ and the upper part of cws had lower values ranging from 1 0 1 6 kÏ fig 3a and 4 b further analysis showed that at the same height the er of cws treated by 1000 Î¼g l mps were significantly higher by 0 7 3 4 folds than that in the control group fig 3a and 4b after 370 day operation the er of cws had an obvious increase compared with the cws in 60 day experiment er in all treatment systems significantly increased by 1 2 2 4 folds in each depth and especially in 1000 Î¼g l group er averaged 4 1 kÏ and was 2 3 folds higher than that of the control group 1 8 kÏ for 370 day accumulation fig 3c and 4d generally the substrate porosity is negatively correlated with the er in wetland systems liu et al 2018 and the accumulation of mps indeed resulted in the increase of er and the obvious decline of substrate porosity for the 370 day mps accumulation in cws the decrease in substrate porosity may directly affect the ability of oxygen mass transfer which formed a key factor for the change of nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 3 change of oxygen mass transfer generally the porosity of cws determines the ability of oxygen mass transfer zhao et al 2009 which can be reflected by the oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla o2 as shown in table 3 after the 60 day experiment k l a o 2 in all cws had no obvious difference and a minor upward trend was still observed as the depth and concentration increased around 0 75 0 78 h 1 while at the end of 370 day experiment the values of k l a o 2 with the increase of depths and concentration raised by 1 0 15 4 and 3 5 18 6 respectively table 3 in details k l a o 2 at the middle and lower of depths 25 and 45 cm of cws in the high level groups was significantly increased to 0 85 0 90 among which the 25 cm depth was 9 0 higher than the control group and the 45 cm depth was 15 higher the k l a o 2 in top part of cws was lower than that at the bottom and the low level cws were lower than the high level treatment cws the main reason could be the upper gravel is more suitable for oxygenation from atmosphere and plant root so k l a o 2 in the upper part was lower than that of the bottom part kadlec and wallace 2009 at the same height of cw microcosms k l a o 2 in the high level groups was significantly higher than that of the low level groups which was consistent with the er and could result from the large increase in biomass of biofilms shariati et al 2013 because the specific surface area of mps was larger than that of gravels biofilms were easier to form and grow on the surface of mps fig 2 which further reduced the substrate porosity in cws hua et al 2013 zhao et al 2009 similar conclusion has been reported by zhao et al 2009 who found that organic particle accumulation within the substrate pores certainly caused biofilm growth in abundance and consequent reduction in effective porosity of cws overall these results indicated that the 60 day accumulation of mps in cws had no significant effects on the oxygen mass transfer while with the 370 day accumulation significant increase of oxygen mass transfer could cause the cw system entering the anaerobic state rapidly which turned out to be a key factor for the changes of nitrogen removal performance 3 3 variation of microbial activities 3 3 1 change of respiration rate to further determine the effects of mps accumulation on the health of biofilm system the microbial respiration activity of biofilm was investigated in cws munoz leoz et al 2011 results showed that in 100 and 1000 Î¼g l treatment groups mps accumulation remarkably accelerated the basal respiration rates throughout the whole experiment and the substrate induced respiration rates at the end of 370 day operation p 0 05 on the other hand no significant differences were observed between the control and 10 Î¼g l groups p 0 05 under 60 day operation regardless of the basal and substrate induced respiration fig 4a such results indicated that high level accumulation of mps posed positive impacts on microbial activities in cws which also implied that other basal microbial metabolism activities might be enhanced such as nitrification or denitrification processes su et al 2019b 3 3 2 changes of nitrification and denitrification rates nitrification and denitrification processes are vital nitrogen transforming processes after 60 and 370 day experiments nitrification rates in 100 and 1000 Î¼g l mp treatments increased by 10 5 15 8 and decreased by 10 9 13 1 compared with the control group fig 4b denitrification rate had no remarkable variation and was 1 9 10 0 higher than that of the control group at the end of the experiment fig 4b for nitrification or denitrification rates in 10 Î¼g l ps mps treatment no obvious differences were detected compared to the control group these results explain that the operating condition of cws was beneficial to nitrification exposed to high level mps in the 60 day accumulation and to denitrification with prolonged exposure time 3 3 3 change of oxygen uptake rate generally oxygen uptake and consumption including aerobic respiration nitrification sulphide oxidation etc in cws are far more rapid than the transfer from air to water and the release from plant root pedescoll et al 2011 therefore rapid oxygen uptake rate our a key parameter reflecting the degree of oxygen consumption will cause the cw microcosms turn into anoxic or even anaerobic earlier maltais landry et al 2009 in our study due to the accumulation of mps our had a slight increase after 60 day operation but no significant differences p 0 05 within the four treatment systems at the end of the experiment our in high level groups had an obvious increase in details as shown in fig 4c compared with the 60 day experiment approximately 14 2 and 21 6 of increase in our were detected in the 100 Î¼g l and 1000 Î¼g l treatment groups for 370 day accumulation while they were 12 6 and 20 8 higher than that in control group respectively generally do concentration is required to be over 2 5 mg l for successful completion of nitrification process and lower than 0 5 mg l for denitrification gerardi 2002 yoo et al 1999 our reflects the activity and biomass of microorganisms in the biofilm of cws huang et al 1985 pappenreiter et al 2019 in our study our in the high level treatment groups was significantly higher than that in the low concentration and control groups and in 370 day operation it was higher than that after 60 days fig 4c such results implied that large size and prolonged accumulation of mps could accelerate our in cws perhaps resulting from the increase of biomass in biofilms the rapid our caused a shortage of do for nitrifiers and was beneficial to the denitrifiers gerardi 2002 which was possibly an important reason for the low high rates of nitrification denitrification respectively 3 4 microbiota composition presence of mps provided a more adequate growth site for biofilm growth a previous study with similar conclusions showed that cws equipped with thinner substrates had better biofilm growth and excellent performance due to increase in the abundance of functional microbes ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 the total abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers accounted for 4 4 and 15 7 of the total abundance in the control group respectively while in mps 1000 groups they were 4 9 and 20 0 at the end of experiment respectively elaborately compared with the control group the most dominant nitrifier genera nitrospira and nitrosomonas increased by 3 1 4 0 folds and denitrifier thauera thiobacillus and zoogloea increased by 0 3 12 9 folds in mps 1000 group at the end of the 60 day experiment fig 5a for the 370 day experiment the relative abundance of nitrifier nitrospira and nitrosomonas in mps 1000 group significantly declined by 20 1 61 7 while the denitrifiers thauera thiobacillus and zoogloea significantly increased by 14 3 51 3 compared with the 60 day experiment fig 5b these results indicated that the mps accumulation changed the functional microbiota composition and was beneficial to nitrifiers in 60 day accumulation and to denitrifiers in both 60 and 370 days as we speculated mps with the large specific surface area and negative charges mao et al 2018 could be regarded as a stable substrate like the gravel preferentially adsorbing substances with positive charges i e nh4 in our study it was likely that the abundant nh4 20 mg l in the simulated sewage was absorbed on the surface of mps making it more conducive to the nitrifier growth in the biofilm and possibly contributing to increase in nitrifier abundance for 60 day exposure in cws however with the acceleration of oxygen mass transfer capacity table 3 the anaerobic environment inhibited the growth activity of nitrifiers gerardi 2002 yoo et al 1999 resulting in a decrease in their abundance for a 370 day exposure in addition qin et al 2020 and seeley et al 2020 also found that different kinds of mps obviously promoted nitrification and denitrification by increasing the abundance and activities of nitrogen transforming microorgainsms in addition to the key nitrogen removing microorganisms there are also common phosphorus accumulating organisms paos such as accumulibacter however it is worth noting that the highest abundance of paos in cws is only 0 04 due to the low abundance the variation of their contribution to p removal on account of the fluctuation of pao community was relatively weak in the whole experiment in addition the oxygen concentration was high at the beginning of each batch and with the decrease of oxygen concentration p concentration was released again therefore the overall p removal efficiency of cws basically remains stable in the whole experiment overall because of a large specific surface area and decline in our biofilm could grow well on mps and microbiota structure will be inevitably altered negative positive to nitrifiers under short 370 day and positive to denitrifiers in any terms 3 5 comprehending the relationship between mps accumulation and nitrogen removal to deeply identify the key factors affecting nitrogen removal in cws the structural equation model was established to sort the impact path of mps accumulation on nitrogen removal efficiency fig 6 among the vital parameters of eps in biofilms total protein and total organic carbon total organic carbon had the most significant effects on electrical resistivity er estimated weighting 0 21 p 0 05 and total protein had no significant effects on er indicating that total organic carbon content might be an important factor for the decline in porosity of substrate in cws for 370 day mps accumulation fig 6 both oxygen uptake rate our and respiration rate rr had an obvious positive correlation with er in the control group 0 24 and 0 35 respectively while this correlation was higher in mps treatment group 0 34 and 0 49 respectively nitrification and denitrification rates likewise reflected nitrogen removing microbial activity displaying a significant correlation with our and rr in the control group and higher in the mps treatment groups respectively notably our was positively correlated with nitrification rate and negatively correlated with denitrification rate in the control group while both were inverse in the mps group and had higher estimated weightage 0 96 and 0 53 fig 6b such results indicated that 370 day mps accumulation accelerated the our which is a vital factor for seriously inhibiting the nitrification efficiency 0 96 p 0 01 furthermore both our 0 53 p 0 05 and rr 0 84 p 0 05 in the mps group were more closely correlated with denitrification rate compared with the control group indicating that mps accumulation had a potential benefit for denitrification efficiency finally in terms of the performance nitrification and denitrification rates were significantly correlated with rtn in the control group 0 73 and 0 67 respectively and this correlation between nitrification rate and rtn obviously increased in the mps treatment group 0 95 but no significant correlation existed with the denitrification rate 0 07 fig 6b this result suggested that a decline in nitrification efficiency was the key factor for the decrease of nitrogen removal efficiency with the 370 day mps accumulation overall structural equation modelling analysis indicated that under the intervention of mps accumulation the increase in total organic carbon content resulted in the shift of biofilm composition and the increase of er in substrate which suggested that the substrate characteristics had been changed in cws furthermore the change of substrate characteristic influenced oxygen mass transfer ability which further caused the variation of our and rr finally our acceleration affected the nitrifier community structure and decreased nitrification rate obviously decreasing the nitrogen removal efficiency of cws 3 6 environmental implications although the negative effects of mps have been reported frequently the effective control strategies have rarely been proposed our study demonstrated that the cw system had an excellent interception capacity of mps over 95 while due to changes of substrate characteristics and microbial activities the 370 day accumulation of mps led to the decrease of nitrogen removal efficiency but had no obvious effects on cod and tp removal compared with the lab scale cws because the area scale hydraulic condition and substrate characteristics of the actual cw system are significantly different we speculate that a series of effects caused by mps accumulation might not appear in the actual cws such also provides an ideal control strategy to mps using the wetland system however there is still a technological gap in how to use the actual cws to effectively control the spread of mps facing the technology barrier of managing and controlling the environmental risk of plastic debris or particle pollutants we proposed a suit of control strategy of mps according to the conclusion of this study as well as the characteristics and advantages of cw system the details are as follows 1 for the mainstream of big rivers without eutrophication interference the riparian horizontal subsurface cws with landscape function can be built to intercept mps entering the receiving water 2 for phosphorus sensitive receiving water a single stage vertical subsurface cw system can be built on the shore to intercept mps 3 for nitrogen sensitive receiving water a multi stage cw system can be used to intercept mps where the front wetlands with landscape function can intercept mps and the back wetland for nitrogen removal in summary this study can provide an engineering control strategy and an effective management reference for mps removal in sewage or rain runoff 4 conclusions in our study mps 100 and mps 1000 treatments were significantly deteriorated in nitrogen removal due to the decline in nitrifying efficiency whereas mps 10 had no obvious interference from further analysis cw could effectively intercept mps more than 95 contained in wastewater and mps presence increased the total organic carbon of substrate biofilms especially in mps 100 and mps 1000 it was raised by 41 4 and 52 7 respectively which further made biofilms denser fig 2a5 and 3b5 decreased substrate porosity fig 3b and 4d and accelerated oxygen mass transfer rate fig 4c in terms of microbes mps accumulation increased the relative abundance of majority of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in biofilms fig 5 excessive oxygen consumption led to insufficient oxygen for nitrifiers and excellent anaerobic condition for denitrifiers causing the decrease of nitrification rates and increase of denitrification rates finally low nitrification efficiency caused the weakening of nitrogen removal whereas cod and tp removal had no significate fluctuations overall our study was the first to assess the impacts of mps on substrate characteristics and microbial activities in cws during 1 year accumulation although our cw microcosm is significantly different from the actual cw it still can be referred as a new insight for revealing the impacts of plastic pollutants on nitrogen cycling in wastewater treatment

16046,presence of microplastics mps in wastewater has posed a huge ecosystem risk constructed wetlands cws can effectively intercept mps while with mps accumulation the response of cws performance is still unclear in order to evaluate those effects we conducted a 370 day experiment using cw microcosms fed with different levels 0 10 100 and 1000 Î¼g l of polystyrene ps mps diameter 50 100 Î¼m results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was increased by 3 9 24 7 during the first 60 days and then decreased by 7 1 41 3 with mps accumulating but no obvious change in cod and tp removal was observed from further analysis mps accumulation changed the biofilm composition toc content increased from 41 4 to 52 7 substrate porosity electrical resistivity increased by 1 2 2 4 folds and oxygen mass transfer k l a o 2 increased from 3 5 to 18 6 moreover the microbial dynamics presented a higher abundance of nitrifiers nitrospira and nitrosomonas during the 60 day experiment and a lower abundance in the last days while denitrifiers thauera thiobacillus and anaerolinea had a high relative abundance throughout the experiment being consistent with the variation of nitrification and denitrification rates finally structural equation model analysis proved that due to the changes of substrate characteristics and microbial compositions and activities the obvious decrease in nitrification efficiency was a direct reason for the decline of nitrogen removal during 370 day mps accumulation overall our study first prove that mps accumulation can cause a series of changes in physicochemical and microbial characteristics of substrate and ultimately affect the nitrogen transforming process in cws although our conclusions were based on the lab scale cws being different from the real wetlands we hope that the conclusions can provide the effective regulatory strategies to guide the control of mps in the actual wetlands graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetlands nitrogen removal microplastics substrate characteristic microbial composition activity 1 introduction during the last several years micro sized plastics mps 0 1 Î¼m diameter 5 mm as an emerging particle pollutant have attracted much attention hartmann et al 2019 mps include primary plastic particles i e originally produced in numerous personal care and cosmetic products and secondary plastic debris resulting from the degradation or fragmentation of larger plastics jambeck et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 as previous studies reported the abundance of mps has likewise escalated rapidly in the environment such as in the ocean ranging from 8 to 9200 items m3 cai et al 2018 song et al 2014 in rivers from 0 03 to 1265 items l xiong et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 in lakes from 1 19 to 12 61 items l su et al 2016 and in soil from 465 to 13000 items kg dry soil buks and kaupenjohann 2020 recently wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a main source contributing more than 400 items l of mps were focused frequently simon et al 2018 mps are directly rinsed down municipal sewage with household wastewater and rain runoff and end up at the wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2019 the abundance of mps in raw sewage approximately varied from 60 to 1200 Î¼g l simon et al 2018 and above 90 of mps could be strained efficiently by wwtps entering the sludge murphy et al 2016 therefore whether it is effluent or sludge discharging has the possibility of mps entering the environment again and wastewater treatment process that can effectively trap mps without the secondary discharging risk need to be found constructed wetland cw is an alternative facility for wastewater treatment with the advantage of being low cost and easy to operate and maintain wu et al 2015 moreover cws have an excellent capacity to hold up the particle pollutants because of the presence of abundant biofilms and rhizosphere and absence of sludge discharging previous studies have reported that above 90 of metal oxide nanoparticles are trapped in cws huang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 and recent studies also reported that approximately 97 of nano sized plastics ma et al 2021 and 88 98 of total mps could be removed by cws wang et al 2021 2020 the trapped mps will not migrate or even flow out in cw system due to the increase of infiltration volume and concentration o connor et al 2019 therefore cw is an effective barrier against mps entering into the ecological environment as we known cw has a huge biofilm system including substrate and rhizosphere biofilms donlan 2002 healthy biofilm structure and microbial physiological activities are of great significance to stable wetland processes mu et al 2020 generally under 370 day adaptation and hydraulic disturbance the thickness of biofilms is maintained at a constant range and the efficiency of mass transfer from outside to inside of the biofilm remains stable wasche et al 2002 a typical example is that oxygen concentration in biofilms gradually decreases from outside to inside forming a good aerobic anoxic anaerobic model while nitrogenous contaminations i e nh4 n no3 n and no2 n can be transformed layer by layer in biofilms to ensure the thorough nitrogen removal therefore a healthy biofilm system has normal oxygen uptake and respiration capacities to ensure stable physiological activities of functional microorganisms currently it has been reported that the accumulation of mps can provide a good habitat for the growth of microorganisms and form a strong biofilm system with a different microbiota structure li et al 2021 however our previous study had confirmed that nano sized plastics nps diameter 100 nm had serious impacts on biofilm systems due to interference with microbial metabolism and plant activities yang et al 2020 different from nps the particle size of mps is much larger than that of individual cell and then the action mode and impact of mps with biofilm system should be significantly different from those of nps yet which was unknown in cws in addition mps accumulates in the substrate voids of cw and detailed knowhow of influence on the biofilm structure and physicochemical characteristics as well as treatment performance is still rarely reported these gaps need to be further revealed in detail which is also of great significance for deeply understanding the impact of plastic particles on the treatment performance of cws driven by these gaps we herein utilized subsurface flow ssf cws planted with cattail to a investigate the efficiency of mps removal and the variation of treatment performance in cws b discriminate the variation of substrate characteristics c analyse the change of biofilm structure and microbial composition and activity and d identify the key causes of performance change under the 60 and 370 day accumulation of mps finally our results indicated whether cws could effectively treat wastewater containing mps for a long time and how the inside system and treatment efficiency responded to mps accumulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mps suspension and synthetic wastewater in this study polystyrene ps parental columns length 2 3 mm diameter 1 mm were purchased from beisile co ltd tianjin china the preparation of qualified mps was achieved by grinding and sieving and their surface morphology and element distribution were observed using a ccd microscope camera leica dfc 365 fx buffalo grove germany and a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f plus jsm japan and the images are shown in fig s1 of supporting

up and operation given that lab scale cw microcosms can more conveniently and effectively find the problems in time handle the experiment condition and improve the result accuracy the twelve ssf cw microcosms 4 sets 3 replicates were constructed with a bulk volume of 0 045 m3 length 0 3 m width 0 3 m height 0 5 m and pore volume 10 l all cw microcosms were in a greenhouse fig s2 and was worked in batch mode hydraulic retention time is 5 days four groups were set as 0 10 100 and 1000 Î¼g l of mps according to our previous study yang et al 2020 and all groups were performed in triplicate all cw microcosms were filled with gravel diameter 8 10 mm porosity 0 4 and cattails typha latifolia were planted in all cw microcosms at the beginning of the 4 month biofilm preincubation synthetic wastewater was added into cw microcosms as a batch model at the start of each batch and were gravity drained within 1 h prior to the next batch the whole experiment lasted 370 days 74 batches each batch lasted for 5 days to ensure the accuracy of results calculating the effluent concentration the water levels at the beginning and end of each batch were recorded to avoid the deviation caused by evaporation detailed methods of set up and operations are provided in text s2 2 3 sample collection and analytical methods 2 3 1 assays for nutrient removal ps mps quantity in effluent during the formal exposure experiment water samples were collected at the end of each batch specially in the typical batches water samples were taken from each cw microcosm and each batch at 0 1 2 4 7 12 24 30 38 48 72 96 and 120 h it was noted that the vertical gradients in the water chemistry were not observed in the preliminary experiment and our previous experiments with the same microcosm chen et al 2014 therefore water samples at a depth of only 20 cm were sampled and stored in a serum bottle and then used to determine the nutrient concentrations cod tp tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n within 1 h of using the standard methods outlined in apha 2017 in order to quantify the number of ps mps retained in cws one litter of effluent was collected with a glass bottle at the end of the last batch in each stage then all the samples were filtered dried separated centrifuged filtrated and stained finally the stained mps on the filters were observed and counted by a fluorescence microscope olympus bx 60 fluorescence microscope japan simon et al 2018 the detailed procedures are provided in text s3 2 3 2 assays for nitrification denitrification and respiration rates nitrification and denitrification rates were assessed according to dong and reddy 2012 and thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 respectively with little modification nitrification rate was expressed using the slope of the first order function of total no2 n and no3 n concentrations in solution and time denitrification rate was detected using isotope labeling technology and were calculated by 29n2 and 30n2 content in the gaseous product 15n pairing technique specially basal respiration starvation treatment representing basal microbial activities and substrate induced respiration with glucose addition representing potential microbial activities in cws were detected by quantifying the released co2 su et al 2019a detailed methods about nitrification denitrification and respiration rates are provided in text s4 2 3 3 observation and quantification of biofilms in cws in order to characterize the morphology of biofilm more vividly the extracellular polymeric substance fluorescence in situ staining eps fiss was conducted at the end of 370 day experiment briefly substrate samples distinguishing gravel and mps from substrate were washed with phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 2 and soaked in sodium bicarbonate nahco3 solution ensuring the amino group without protonation fluoresce isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin con a calcofluor white and nile red solutions were used to stain proteins Î± polysaccharide Î² polysaccharide and lipids respectively the eps of biofilm was extracted through formaldehyde sodium hydroxide naoh according to liu and fang 2002 the detailed parameters and processes of total protein and organic carbon analysis are shown in text s5 2 3 4 assays for microorganism community structure the impacts of mps accumulation on microbiota structure were analysed by characterizing the relative abundance of key microorganisms briefly 20 g of substrate samples mixed gravel and mps were collected from three depths 10 25 and 45 cm in control and high level cw microcosms and mixed together then they were stored at 20 c until dna extraction using a fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s instructions finally the microbial abundance was calculated from the copy numbers of the 16s rrna gene according to previous literature yang et al 2020 the details of the extension procedure and the diversity assays are given in text s6 2 4 assays for the operating condition of cws 2 4 1 calculation of oxygen mass transfer and oxygen uptake rates dissolved oxygen do concentrations were detected at the 25 cm depth of wetland microcosms to calculate the kla o2 oxygen uptake rate our depends on kla o2 which reciprocally represents the time from c0 to cs tyroller et al 2010 hence kla o2 in this study was negative and herein the absolute value of kla o2 k l a o 2 indicated the time from cs to co in our study we stipulated the synthetic influent was in oxygen saturated condition before pouring into cws detailed calculation process of our is provided in text s7 2 4 2 detection of the electronic resistivity generally the electronic resistivity er is the resistance value per unit distance of the wetland substrate which can reflect the porosity of wetland system with a negative correlation liu et al 2018 in order to accurately measure the er of wetland microcosms a standard laboratory procedure was applied following liu et al 2018 and kalinski and kelly 1993 with a little modification briefly one of multimeter electrodes was fixed on one side of cw microcosm and the other electrode as a moving electrode was used to test the electrical resistance between the two electrodes of different widths in cws finally the er was calculated using the resistance values and distances between electrodes the schematic diagram is shown in fig s3 2 5 statistical analysis all data assays were conducted in triplicate and the results are presented as the mean standard deviation analysis of variance one way anova was used to examine the significance of the results followed by the lsd post hoc test and p 0 05 was statistically significant spss v 22 0 ibm the structure equation model was used to identify the key causes affecting nitrogen removing transformation in cws exposing to mps amos 21 0 ibm 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance of cws in this study the treatment performance of cws varied with mps accumulation especially nh4 n removal according to the nh4 n removal characteristics the whole experiment was divided into two stages the day 0 60 batch 1 12 and day 60 370 batch 13 74 in detail as shown in fig 1 a and s3a during day 0 60 the control groups 81 4 3 4 were inferior to mps treatment groups average 85 2 6 0 and during day 60 370 the control groups 79 9 5 0 were gradually superior to mps treatment groups average 51 6 19 4 especially mps 100 and mps 1000 groups for other nitrogenous parameters in these two stages tn removal efficiency resembled the trend of nh4 n concentrations and no obvious difference had been observed in mps accumulation while at the end of 370 day experiment 100 and 1000 mg l of mps treatment significantly weakened tn removal fig 1b and s3c and the minor amounts of no3 n and no2 n were detected in effluent removal efficiencies 85 during 370 day experiment fig s3b in addition tp removal efficiency of all cws remained 55 8 8 2 approximately 2 mg l in effluent fig 1c and s5a in all groups and the cod removal efficiency kept approximately 85 5 1 7 in the whole experiment fig 1d and s5b in general the 370 day accumulation of mps has a significant impact on nitrogen removal of cws and has a slight interference on tp and cod removals given that the nitrogen removal kinetics the batch 12 day 55 60 and batch 74 day 365 370 were regarded as the typical batches representing the two stages and revealing the impact mechanism by analysing the responses of substrate characteristics and microbial community and activities respectively 3 2 variation of substrate characteristic 3 2 1 retaining efficiency of mps by detecting and calculating the abundance of mps in substrate at the end of 60 and 370 day experiments the results showed that the cw system could effectively intercept mps 98 5 99 6 for 60 day exposure and 96 7 98 1 for 370 day exposure table 1 in addition the interception capacity of cws to mps at the end of 370 day accumulation was slightly lower than that of the 60 day accumulation which underlined that 370 day accumulation of mps in cws may decrease the interception capacity of substrate biofilm to mps themselves and even other contaminations our research results are also consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2020 and ma et al 2021 who demonstrated that the mps retention capacities averaged 88 and over 97 in horizontal ssf cws and vertical flow cws vfcws respectively however little is known about why the retention capacity of cws changed and the response mechanisms of treatment performance to mps during the 370 day accumulation i e at least one year 3 2 2 changes of biofilm structure and substrate porosity in this study eps fiss method was used to characterize the morphology of biofilms on the surface of gravel and mps as shown in fig 2 a in the control group the total proteins polysaccharides and lipids in biofilms showed a strong fluorescence intensity but sparse distribution and on the whole the thickness of biofilms was equally distributed on gravel without obvious vacancy and accumulation fig 2a such results indicated that the biofilms grew well on gravel and simultaneously implied that detachment may occur when they accumulated to a certain thickness for ensuring the biomass for 370 day operation of cws domozych and domozych 2008 fig 2b shows the fluorescence spectrum of biofilms components covering the mps surface in which protein and Î± polysaccharides were sparsely distributed while Î² polysaccharides and lipids were very dense and the overall biofilm morphology was thick generally the total protein and total organic carbon in extracellular polymers accounted for 90 of the biofilm mass in which protein e g alanine and cysteine hydrophobic groups with positive charges reduced microbial cell surface charges donlan 2002 in contrast mps usually presented a negative charge mao et al 2018 and could electrically neutralize with the positive charge on the biofilm which finally resulted in disintegration and sparse distribution of proteins on the surface of mps as shown in table 2 the total protein content had a significant decrease in the medium high concentration treatments which implied that automatic self renewal ability of biofilms could decline in addition Î² polysaccharides generally have a bridge effect and can form a grid skeleton between microbe microbe and microbe substrate to maintain the structural stability of a biofilm system seviour et al 2009 pervious study has reported that the surface of aged plastic generally had the oh and cooh groups chen et al 2021 while exposing to the strong oxide stimulation microorganisms might protect themselves by secreting a few of eps containing the Î² polysaccharide therefore in our study a large amount of Î² polysaccharide was distributed on the surface of mps and the content of total organic carbon increased significantly which might result from the aging of mps and be also a key reason for forming the thick and dense biofilm table 2 overall mps can be regarded as a super matrix of biofilms that enhanced the capability of trapping mps and become a great hidden danger by decreasing porosity in cws as shown in fig 3 the detection of electrical resistivity er in cws was detected in the 60 and 370 day experiments the results indicated that for 60 day operation the 30 50 cm depth of cws represented the higher er values 1 6 kÏ and the upper part of cws had lower values ranging from 1 0 1 6 kÏ fig 3a and 4 b further analysis showed that at the same height the er of cws treated by 1000 Î¼g l mps were significantly higher by 0 7 3 4 folds than that in the control group fig 3a and 4b after 370 day operation the er of cws had an obvious increase compared with the cws in 60 day experiment er in all treatment systems significantly increased by 1 2 2 4 folds in each depth and especially in 1000 Î¼g l group er averaged 4 1 kÏ and was 2 3 folds higher than that of the control group 1 8 kÏ for 370 day accumulation fig 3c and 4d generally the substrate porosity is negatively correlated with the er in wetland systems liu et al 2018 and the accumulation of mps indeed resulted in the increase of er and the obvious decline of substrate porosity for the 370 day mps accumulation in cws the decrease in substrate porosity may directly affect the ability of oxygen mass transfer which formed a key factor for the change of nitrogen removal efficiency 3 2 3 change of oxygen mass transfer generally the porosity of cws determines the ability of oxygen mass transfer zhao et al 2009 which can be reflected by the oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla o2 as shown in table 3 after the 60 day experiment k l a o 2 in all cws had no obvious difference and a minor upward trend was still observed as the depth and concentration increased around 0 75 0 78 h 1 while at the end of 370 day experiment the values of k l a o 2 with the increase of depths and concentration raised by 1 0 15 4 and 3 5 18 6 respectively table 3 in details k l a o 2 at the middle and lower of depths 25 and 45 cm of cws in the high level groups was significantly increased to 0 85 0 90 among which the 25 cm depth was 9 0 higher than the control group and the 45 cm depth was 15 higher the k l a o 2 in top part of cws was lower than that at the bottom and the low level cws were lower than the high level treatment cws the main reason could be the upper gravel is more suitable for oxygenation from atmosphere and plant root so k l a o 2 in the upper part was lower than that of the bottom part kadlec and wallace 2009 at the same height of cw microcosms k l a o 2 in the high level groups was significantly higher than that of the low level groups which was consistent with the er and could result from the large increase in biomass of biofilms shariati et al 2013 because the specific surface area of mps was larger than that of gravels biofilms were easier to form and grow on the surface of mps fig 2 which further reduced the substrate porosity in cws hua et al 2013 zhao et al 2009 similar conclusion has been reported by zhao et al 2009 who found that organic particle accumulation within the substrate pores certainly caused biofilm growth in abundance and consequent reduction in effective porosity of cws overall these results indicated that the 60 day accumulation of mps in cws had no significant effects on the oxygen mass transfer while with the 370 day accumulation significant increase of oxygen mass transfer could cause the cw system entering the anaerobic state rapidly which turned out to be a key factor for the changes of nitrogen removal performance 3 3 variation of microbial activities 3 3 1 change of respiration rate to further determine the effects of mps accumulation on the health of biofilm system the microbial respiration activity of biofilm was investigated in cws munoz leoz et al 2011 results showed that in 100 and 1000 Î¼g l treatment groups mps accumulation remarkably accelerated the basal respiration rates throughout the whole experiment and the substrate induced respiration rates at the end of 370 day operation p 0 05 on the other hand no significant differences were observed between the control and 10 Î¼g l groups p 0 05 under 60 day operation regardless of the basal and substrate induced respiration fig 4a such results indicated that high level accumulation of mps posed positive impacts on microbial activities in cws which also implied that other basal microbial metabolism activities might be enhanced such as nitrification or denitrification processes su et al 2019b 3 3 2 changes of nitrification and denitrification rates nitrification and denitrification processes are vital nitrogen transforming processes after 60 and 370 day experiments nitrification rates in 100 and 1000 Î¼g l mp treatments increased by 10 5 15 8 and decreased by 10 9 13 1 compared with the control group fig 4b denitrification rate had no remarkable variation and was 1 9 10 0 higher than that of the control group at the end of the experiment fig 4b for nitrification or denitrification rates in 10 Î¼g l ps mps treatment no obvious differences were detected compared to the control group these results explain that the operating condition of cws was beneficial to nitrification exposed to high level mps in the 60 day accumulation and to denitrification with prolonged exposure time 3 3 3 change of oxygen uptake rate generally oxygen uptake and consumption including aerobic respiration nitrification sulphide oxidation etc in cws are far more rapid than the transfer from air to water and the release from plant root pedescoll et al 2011 therefore rapid oxygen uptake rate our a key parameter reflecting the degree of oxygen consumption will cause the cw microcosms turn into anoxic or even anaerobic earlier maltais landry et al 2009 in our study due to the accumulation of mps our had a slight increase after 60 day operation but no significant differences p 0 05 within the four treatment systems at the end of the experiment our in high level groups had an obvious increase in details as shown in fig 4c compared with the 60 day experiment approximately 14 2 and 21 6 of increase in our were detected in the 100 Î¼g l and 1000 Î¼g l treatment groups for 370 day accumulation while they were 12 6 and 20 8 higher than that in control group respectively generally do concentration is required to be over 2 5 mg l for successful completion of nitrification process and lower than 0 5 mg l for denitrification gerardi 2002 yoo et al 1999 our reflects the activity and biomass of microorganisms in the biofilm of cws huang et al 1985 pappenreiter et al 2019 in our study our in the high level treatment groups was significantly higher than that in the low concentration and control groups and in 370 day operation it was higher than that after 60 days fig 4c such results implied that large size and prolonged accumulation of mps could accelerate our in cws perhaps resulting from the increase of biomass in biofilms the rapid our caused a shortage of do for nitrifiers and was beneficial to the denitrifiers gerardi 2002 which was possibly an important reason for the low high rates of nitrification denitrification respectively 3 4 microbiota composition presence of mps provided a more adequate growth site for biofilm growth a previous study with similar conclusions showed that cws equipped with thinner substrates had better biofilm growth and excellent performance due to increase in the abundance of functional microbes ding et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 the total abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers accounted for 4 4 and 15 7 of the total abundance in the control group respectively while in mps 1000 groups they were 4 9 and 20 0 at the end of experiment respectively elaborately compared with the control group the most dominant nitrifier genera nitrospira and nitrosomonas increased by 3 1 4 0 folds and denitrifier thauera thiobacillus and zoogloea increased by 0 3 12 9 folds in mps 1000 group at the end of the 60 day experiment fig 5a for the 370 day experiment the relative abundance of nitrifier nitrospira and nitrosomonas in mps 1000 group significantly declined by 20 1 61 7 while the denitrifiers thauera thiobacillus and zoogloea significantly increased by 14 3 51 3 compared with the 60 day experiment fig 5b these results indicated that the mps accumulation changed the functional microbiota composition and was beneficial to nitrifiers in 60 day accumulation and to denitrifiers in both 60 and 370 days as we speculated mps with the large specific surface area and negative charges mao et al 2018 could be regarded as a stable substrate like the gravel preferentially adsorbing substances with positive charges i e nh4 in our study it was likely that the abundant nh4 20 mg l in the simulated sewage was absorbed on the surface of mps making it more conducive to the nitrifier growth in the biofilm and possibly contributing to increase in nitrifier abundance for 60 day exposure in cws however with the acceleration of oxygen mass transfer capacity table 3 the anaerobic environment inhibited the growth activity of nitrifiers gerardi 2002 yoo et al 1999 resulting in a decrease in their abundance for a 370 day exposure in addition qin et al 2020 and seeley et al 2020 also found that different kinds of mps obviously promoted nitrification and denitrification by increasing the abundance and activities of nitrogen transforming microorgainsms in addition to the key nitrogen removing microorganisms there are also common phosphorus accumulating organisms paos such as accumulibacter however it is worth noting that the highest abundance of paos in cws is only 0 04 due to the low abundance the variation of their contribution to p removal on account of the fluctuation of pao community was relatively weak in the whole experiment in addition the oxygen concentration was high at the beginning of each batch and with the decrease of oxygen concentration p concentration was released again therefore the overall p removal efficiency of cws basically remains stable in the whole experiment overall because of a large specific surface area and decline in our biofilm could grow well on mps and microbiota structure will be inevitably altered negative positive to nitrifiers under short 370 day and positive to denitrifiers in any terms 3 5 comprehending the relationship between mps accumulation and nitrogen removal to deeply identify the key factors affecting nitrogen removal in cws the structural equation model was established to sort the impact path of mps accumulation on nitrogen removal efficiency fig 6 among the vital parameters of eps in biofilms total protein and total organic carbon total organic carbon had the most significant effects on electrical resistivity er estimated weighting 0 21 p 0 05 and total protein had no significant effects on er indicating that total organic carbon content might be an important factor for the decline in porosity of substrate in cws for 370 day mps accumulation fig 6 both oxygen uptake rate our and respiration rate rr had an obvious positive correlation with er in the control group 0 24 and 0 35 respectively while this correlation was higher in mps treatment group 0 34 and 0 49 respectively nitrification and denitrification rates likewise reflected nitrogen removing microbial activity displaying a significant correlation with our and rr in the control group and higher in the mps treatment groups respectively notably our was positively correlated with nitrification rate and negatively correlated with denitrification rate in the control group while both were inverse in the mps group and had higher estimated weightage 0 96 and 0 53 fig 6b such results indicated that 370 day mps accumulation accelerated the our which is a vital factor for seriously inhibiting the nitrification efficiency 0 96 p 0 01 furthermore both our 0 53 p 0 05 and rr 0 84 p 0 05 in the mps group were more closely correlated with denitrification rate compared with the control group indicating that mps accumulation had a potential benefit for denitrification efficiency finally in terms of the performance nitrification and denitrification rates were significantly correlated with rtn in the control group 0 73 and 0 67 respectively and this correlation between nitrification rate and rtn obviously increased in the mps treatment group 0 95 but no significant correlation existed with the denitrification rate 0 07 fig 6b this result suggested that a decline in nitrification efficiency was the key factor for the decrease of nitrogen removal efficiency with the 370 day mps accumulation overall structural equation modelling analysis indicated that under the intervention of mps accumulation the increase in total organic carbon content resulted in the shift of biofilm composition and the increase of er in substrate which suggested that the substrate characteristics had been changed in cws furthermore the change of substrate characteristic influenced oxygen mass transfer ability which further caused the variation of our and rr finally our acceleration affected the nitrifier community structure and decreased nitrification rate obviously decreasing the nitrogen removal efficiency of cws 3 6 environmental implications although the negative effects of mps have been reported frequently the effective control strategies have rarely been proposed our study demonstrated that the cw system had an excellent interception capacity of mps over 95 while due to changes of substrate characteristics and microbial activities the 370 day accumulation of mps led to the decrease of nitrogen removal efficiency but had no obvious effects on cod and tp removal compared with the lab scale cws because the area scale hydraulic condition and substrate characteristics of the actual cw system are significantly different we speculate that a series of effects caused by mps accumulation might not appear in the actual cws such also provides an ideal control strategy to mps using the wetland system however there is still a technological gap in how to use the actual cws to effectively control the spread of mps facing the technology barrier of managing and controlling the environmental risk of plastic debris or particle pollutants we proposed a suit of control strategy of mps according to the conclusion of this study as well as the characteristics and advantages of cw system the details are as follows 1 for the mainstream of big rivers without eutrophication interference the riparian horizontal subsurface cws with landscape function can be built to intercept mps entering the receiving water 2 for phosphorus sensitive receiving water a single stage vertical subsurface cw system can be built on the shore to intercept mps 3 for nitrogen sensitive receiving water a multi stage cw system can be used to intercept mps where the front wetlands with landscape function can intercept mps and the back wetland for nitrogen removal in summary this study can provide an engineering control strategy and an effective management reference for mps removal in sewage or rain runoff 4 conclusions in our study mps 100 and mps 1000 treatments were significantly deteriorated in nitrogen removal due to the decline in nitrifying efficiency whereas mps 10 had no obvious interference from further analysis cw could effectively intercept mps more than 95 contained in wastewater and mps presence increased the total organic carbon of substrate biofilms especially in mps 100 and mps 1000 it was raised by 41 4 and 52 7 respectively which further made biofilms denser fig 2a5 and 3b5 decreased substrate porosity fig 3b and 4d and accelerated oxygen mass transfer rate fig 4c in terms of microbes mps accumulation increased the relative abundance of majority of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in biofilms fig 5 excessive oxygen consumption led to insufficient oxygen for nitrifiers and excellent anaerobic condition for denitrifiers causing the decrease of nitrification rates and increase of denitrification rates finally low nitrification efficiency caused the weakening of nitrogen removal whereas cod and tp removal had no significate fluctuations overall our study was the first to assess the impacts of mps on substrate characteristics and microbial activities in cws during 1 year accumulation although our cw microcosm is significantly different from the actual cw it still can be referred as a new insight for revealing the impacts of plastic pollutants on nitrogen cycling in wastewater treatment

16047,free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 has been demonstrated to have broad biocidal effects on a range of microorganisms which has direct implications for wastewater management however the biocidal mechanisms still remain largely unknown this study aims to test the hypothesis that fna will induce cell lysis via cell membrane perforations and consequently cause cell death via proteolysis through the use of two model organisms namely escherichia coli k12 and pseudomonas putida kt2440 a combination of analytical techniques that included viability assays atomic force microscopy afm protein abundance assays and proteomic analysis using quadruple orbitrap mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the extent of cell death and possible cell lysis mechanisms fna treatment at 6 09 mg l for 24 h conditions typically applied in applications induced 36 4 2 and 91 3 5 cell death lysis of e coli and p putida respectively afm showed that the lysis of cells was observed via perforations in the cell membrane cells also appeared to shrink and become flat following fna treatment by introducing a reactive nitrogen species rns scavenger to act as a treatment control we further revealed that it was the nitrosative decomposition species of fna such as no that caused the cell lysis through the destruction of protein macromolecules found in the cell membrane proteolysis subsequently the rns went on to cause the destruction of protein macromolecules within the cells the death of these model organisms e coli and p putida following exposure to fna treatment provides insights into the use of fna as an antimicrobial agent in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords free nitrous acid fna biocidal cell lysis reactive nitrogen species rns protein sequencing

bca bicinchoninic acid bsa bovine serum album 1 introduction as one of the commonly used wastewater treatment systems the activated sludge process relies on the suspended growth of microbes to simultaneously remove nutrients and convert organic carbon to carbon dioxide the activated sludge process usually produces excessive wasted sludge which has a reduced degradability due to the presence of difficult to degrade microbial cells in practice excessive sludge production could lead to large treatment costs accounting for up to 60 of the overall cost of wastewater treatment davis and hall 1997 additionally microbial development frequently leads to the development of biofilms while biofilms can have advantageous roles in some environments they can also be detrimental for example biofouling of membrane and corrosion of expensive sewer infrastructure jiang et al 2010 thus it is critical for the wastewater industry to develop efficient solutions to increase sludge biodegradability and control undesirable biofilm growth recently free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 is emerging as a potentially green and economical antimicrobial agent with fewer concerns of developing bacteria resistance zhou et al 2011 duan et al 2020 lu and guo 2021 fna has been found to have vast biocidal impacts on a range of microorganisms at ppm levels i e at mg n l which has led to its prospective use in a range of applications for wastewater treatment pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2013a these include the long term reduction of sulfate reducing and methanogenic activities of anaerobic sewer biofilms at 0 2 0 3 mg n l fna jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2013 this is significant because it greatly reduces the production of sulfide considerably slowing down sewer corrosion jiang et al 2013 in another application fna at 2 mg n l has been shown to cause the lysis of cells in activated sludge thus improving the biodegradability of sludge and enhancing the methane production during its anaerobic digestion wang et al 2013a however there are limited studies to reveal underlying mechanisms for the biocidal effects of fna in a previous study we established that fna interacted with and consequently broke down model molecular components in the cell envelope both in the cell wall and the cell membrane chislett et al 2020 these components were all integral in either the structure rigidity porosity or strength of the microbial cell envelope we also observed that fna broke down representative extracellular polymeric substances eps eps establish the function and structural integrity of biofilms these organic components found in eps and the cell envelope form intracellular and extracellular protective barriers to protect microbial cells from environmental stressors and were found to be broken down into smaller more readily biodegradable fractions thus hypothetically the breakdown of eps would leave cells more vulnerable to antimicrobial action while the breakdown of cell envelope materials would induce cell lysis however there is no fundamental evidence to support any sort of mechanisms of cell lysis by fna by using intact bacterial cells the objective of this study is to investigate the extent of cell lysis by fna using model organisms escherichia coli k 12 and pseudomonas putida kt 2440 and to reveal underlying mechanisms for fna induced cell lysis in this study we hypothesise that the microbial cell inactivation and cell lysis by fna observed in previous studies was caused by damage perforations in the cell envelope due to nitrosative stress on structural components in the cell envelope nitrosative stress is thought to cause various damage to enzymes cellular membranes and cell walls o leary and solberg 1976 this damage is believed to be caused by reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no produced through the decomposition of fna however there is no direct evidence to support this in order to achieve the aim a variety of molecular and analytical techniques were employed to measure the effect of fna on cell viability and integrity including viability assays atomic force microscopy afm a protein abundance assay and protein sequencing using quadruple orbitrap mass spectrometry for the first time we were able to quench the rns from the fna treatment experiment to investigate the biocidal effect of fna with and without these nitrosative species the outcomes presented in this study will expand our understanding of the biocidal impacts of fna previously observed in activated sludge and anaerobic sewer biofilms this study has implications for the optimization of anaerobic digestion practices in addition to biofilm control in sewer networks and microbial management in wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 fna treatment of e coli k 12 and p putida kt 2440 e coli k 12 and p putida kt 2440 were selected because relevant strains belonging to e coli and p putida are ubiquitously detected in various engineered water systems e g wastewater treatment plants bacterial cells were prepared for experiments in luria base lb broth solution details of inoculation and culturing of the organisms can be found in sections 1 1 1 3 of the materials and methods section in the supplementary information si lu et al 2020a when the cultures were in the early log phase of growth 11 h after inoculation an optical density reading was taken and the od600nm of the cultures was adjusted to 0 2 after the incubation period a nitrite stock solution was added to the culture to achieve a nitrite concentration of 250 mg n l with ph subsequently adjusted to 5 0 table 1 the fna concentration was calculated to be 6 09 mg n l using the formula s n o 2 n k a 10 p h with the ka value determined as a function of temperature t c 25 c in this study with the formula k a e 2300 273 t this fna level was selected based on our previous studies which showed that fna at this level breaks down structural organic molecules in cell walls and cell membranes chislett et al 2020 lyses cells gao et al 2015 and enhances the digestibility of activated sludge zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the ph was monitored during the entire experiment and was observed to stay at 5 0 0 3 the treatment time was 24 hr which was previously reported to be adequate to break down organic molecules in cell walls and cell membranes chislett et al 2020 causing significant cell lysis zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the control cultures no fna treatment were added with the same volume of phosphate buffered solution pbs which helped to maintain a neutral ph of 7 0 rather than 5 0 was chosen for the control because the experiments aimed to evaluate the effects of fna rather than nitrite experiments were conducted in triplicate for all conditions an additional treatment condition was introduced to investigate the potential role of rns in cell lysis table 1 an rns scavenger c ptio was added during fna treatment to scavenge remove rns that could potentially cause cell lysis through nitrosative stress the no scavenger c ptio was supplied lyophilised freeze dried and 0 14 g was reconstituted in 100 Î¼l 0 1 ml dmf to produce a stock solution of 4 mm the stock solution was then diluted 10 times with 0 9 ml milli q water to produce a final concentration of 400 Î¼m this was prepared in triplicate as c ptio reacts in a 1 1 ratio with nitrite the volume of the stock solution added to the cultures was adjusted to match the fna concentration the scavenger was added at the same time as fna after the fna treatment a series of assays was conducted to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the cell lysis caused by fna including viability assays cell membrane permeability testing afm imaging and proteomic analysis the detailed methods of each assay are described in the following sections 2 2 viability assays and cell membrane permeability testing the biocidal effects of fna on e coli and p putida were investigated by staining with baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa the live dead cell percentage of the cultures was then dual stained with propidium iodide pi final concentration 30 Î¼m and syto 9 final concentration 5 Î¼m and incubated in a dark at room temperature for 30 min lu et al 2020b to investigate the effect of fna on cell membrane permeability with and without the addition of a scavenger the cell membrane permeability percentage of the cultures was stained with pi only final concentration 30 Î¼m and then incubated in the dark for 30 min lu et al 2018 the fluorescence for both tests was quantified by applying 500 Î¼l 106 cfu ml of the stained samples to a cytoflex flow cytometer bd biosciences usa with 488 nm excitation while emissions were measured above 630 nm for red pi fluorescence and at 520 nm for green syto 9 fluorescence heat treated 1 h at 80 c cells were used as controls for intact and damaged cells respectively 2 3 atomic force microscopy atomic force microscopy afm imaging was employed after the fna treatment described in 2 1 the control and fna treated suspensions were harvested in the early log phase and an optical density reading was taken and adjusted to od600nm of 0 2 the control and treated suspensions of 200 Î¼l were then incubated for 10 min with 1 ml milli q water each treatment was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet re suspended in 200 Î¼l of milli q water in a procedure that was repeated three times to remove excess salt which was found to introduce afm imaging artifacts finally 10 Î¼l of the washed cell suspension was dried on mica discs with direct 10 min of vacuum drying in a harrick pdc001 thermo fisher scientific usa enclosure all samples were imaged in amplitude modulated ac mode in air using an mfp 3d afm oxford instruments asylum research usa placed on an antivibration table herzan usa and enclosed in an acoustic isolation chamber tmc usa silicon cantilever probes ha nc nt mdt russia were employed to raster scan typically a 10 10 Î¼m sample area 512 512 px at 0 3 hz scan rate and setpoints bellow 200 mv to avoid sample damage 2 4 proteomic analysis 2 4 1 protein abundance assay batch tests were performed on the control and fna treated using the pierce bca protein assay kit to quantify the amount of soluble protein present in the cell suspensions with and without fna treatment following the fna treatment described in sections 2 1 the bicinchoninic acid bca assay was performed using the pierce bca protein assay kit to quantify the amount of soluble protein present in the cell suspensions with and without fna treatment the bca assay is a biochemical assay for determining the total concentration of protein in a solution 0 5 Î¼g ml 1 1 5 mg ml the total protein concentration was exhibited by a colour change of the sample solution from green to purple in proportion to protein concentration which was then measured using a spectrophotometer at 562 nm a detailed procedure on how to prepare the bovine serum album bsa standard curve is presented in section 1 4 of the materials and methods section in the si the bca protein assay standard curve is shown in figure s1 in the si 2 4 2 protein sequencing protein sequencing assays were performed after the fna treatment described in sections 2 1 using the q exactive hf x hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer to track the response of the cell against fna and to identify which protein had been damaged or regulated following fna exposure for peptide preparations the s trap micro spin column digestion protocol was used to lyse reduce alkalize trypsin digest and elute the protein present in the samples as described previously by grobbler et al grobbler et al 2015 the peptide preparations were then transferred to the mass spectrometer qualitative protein databases were created by information dependant analysis while quantitative protein determination was based on swath ms grobbler et al 2015 using biological triplicate samples database and software analyses and settings are described in section 2 5 of the materials and methods section of the si zhang et al 2022 astringency cut off of false discovery rate q value less than 0 01 was used to identify the proteins with significant different expression levels 2 4 3 statistical analysis and data availability all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate the proteomic data was expressed as mean standard deviation sd independent t tests were performed p values less than 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant the mass spectrometry proteomic data are accessible publicly and have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium via the pride partner repository 3 results 3 1 fna can cause cell lysis and increase cell membrane permeability fig 1 a illustrates that following 24 hr fna exposure at 6 09 mg n l the live cell percentage of both e coli and p putida was significantly decreased compared to the control p 0 01 p putida is particularly sensitive to fna at 6 09 mg n l with 91 3 5 of cells being stained as dead following the exposure p 0 001 e coli is also shown to undergo cell lysis following fna treatment with 36 4 2 of cells stained as dead p 0 01 this demonstrates that at ppm levels fna causes cell lysis and permanent loss of biological activity interestingly with the addition of the rns scavenger the percentage of live and dead cells for both e coli and p putida is similar to that of the control no treatment p 0 05 suggesting the role of rns on cell inactivation in order to investigate whether rns are able to penetrate the cell membrane of e coli and p putida cells a cell membrane permeability test was conducted with and without the rns scavenger with 24 hr 6 09 mg n l fna treatment the results suggest that cell membrane permeation is greatly reduced with the addition of an rns scavenger fig 1b this is particularly the case for p putida whereby the percentage of cell membrane permeation was reduced from 24 5 1 1 following 24 hr 6 09 mg n l fna treatment to 3 3 0 3 with the addition of an rns scavenger p 0 01 fig 1b e coli cells also sustained cell membrane permeation with 15 0 3 cell membrane permeation observed in the fna treated sample compared to 1 57 0 3 of cells without any treatment p 0 01 the addition of rns scavenger significantly reduced cell membrane permeation to 2 7 0 3 when compared to the fna treated sample p 0 01 the results from the membrane permeability test indicate that rns produced from the decomposition of fna are capable of damaging the cell membrane 3 2 fna can cause cell lysis via perforations in the cell membrane cell morphology and fine structure changes upon exposure to fna were visualized using afm without any treatment e coli cells have a very distinct full and consistent cell morphology fig 2 a and b in contrast after 24 h of fna treatment cell surfaces exhibit a very rough texture fig 2 c d when compared to the smooth texture of control cells fig 2a b the fna treated cells appear shrivelled and empty in the height channel image fig 2d the rough surface could be due to the presence of intracellular organic components that have leaked from the cell there are also a large number of cell membrane perforations following fna treatment a close up 5 5 Î¼m version of fig 2 is shown in figure s2 to reveal even finer details the control p putida cells without any fna treatment like in the case of control e coli appear to maintain their shape and membrane integrity fig 3 a b after 24 h of fna treatment the shape of individual cells is barely identifiable fna has completely lysed the cells and the remaining matter is a mix of fragmented membranes small organelles and organic nano wire like material fig 3c a zoomed in 5 5 Î¼m version of fig 3 is shown in figure s3 to reveal an even higher resolution perspective on the cells the major difference between the e coli and p putida post fna treatment is the extent of destruction e coli cells appear to become rougher while p putida cells become barely identifiable 3 3 proteomic analysis 3 3 1 protein abundance assay in order to quantify the soluble protein abundance the bca assay standard curve figure s1 was established to calculate the concentration of soluble proteins present in the treated and untreated samples fig 4 illustrates that the levels of soluble protein were significantly higher in the fna treated suspensions for both e coli and p putida p 0 01 the concentration of soluble protein Î¼g ml 1 in the fna treated e coli suspension was 36 times higher than in the control suspension the concentration of soluble protein Î¼g ml 1 in the fna treated p putida suspension was 54 times higher than in the control suspension the protein abundance results shown in fig 4 are supported by the afm images figs 2 and 3 which also showed intracellular organelles surrounding the cellular debris following fna treatment for both e coli and p putida to gain a further understanding of how fna affects protein regulation in the cell pellet protein sequencing was conducted in the control and fna treated cell pellets 3 3 2 protein sequencing protein sequencing was carried out to investigate how fna affected overall protein regulation in the cell pellet fig 5 demonstrates the number of proteins that increased a fold change 1 compared to control decreased a fold change 1 but 0 175 or destroyed a fold change of 0 175 in the cell pellet following fna treatment of e coli and p putida in the case of e coli the abundance of 238 proteins increased following exposure to fna while 420 decreased and 102 destroyed for p putida 154 proteins increased following exposure to fna while 96 decreased and 73 destroyed in fact the abundances of a few protein materials have been upregulated under the exposure to fna a number of these increased proteins correspond to oxidative nitrosative stress responses in e coli and p putida fig 6 nitrosative stress through the production of rns is a natural consequence of aerobic metabolism bacteria have developed complex reformed gene regulatory responses to nitrosative and oxidative stress for example e coli and p putida have several major regulator proteins e g uspa and crp both encoding response to ros stress activated during nitrosative stress ohno et al 2003 in this study we found an increased fold change of 100 for the uspa protein in e coli fig 6c in addition our results showed an increased fold change of 50 for the upregulation of the crp protein in e coli fig 6c which is consistent with previous findings that the crp regulators in several bacterial species are involved in nitric oxide no oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance basak and jiang 2012 molina quiroz et al 2018 other proteins presented in our results that have been reported in the literature to be activated by nitrosative stress include ahpc jin and jeang 1999 and uspf nachin et al 2005 fig 6c and tpx atack et al 2008 rpmf nakayashiki and mori 2013 sodb bakshi et al 2006 fig 6d the upregulated stress proteins presented in figs 6c and d mostly correspond to proteins associated with nitrosative stress resistance for both microorganisms the number of proteins that was either decreased or destroyed following fna treatment was greater than the number of proteins that were increased following fna treatment therefore fna is not only lysing cells but also breaking down the protein within the lysed cells fna can cause a complete destruction of intracellular protein in e coli and p putida which was previously illustrated in fig 5 in order to explain why the number of proteins has been destroyed following fna exposure in fig 5 an investigation into the function and structural traits of the proteins with the lowest abundance ratio 0 175 was conducted fig 7 provides the name and description of each destroyed protein from e coli fig 7a and p putida fig 7b there is also a column indicating the fold change from 0 08 red to 0 175 green in heat map format the protein with the lowest fold change corresponding to the red region on the heat map had the greatest difference between a high abundance in the control sample and a low abundance in the fna treated sample therefore these proteins for example ilvh and panb in e coli and rplx and sdac in p putida were considered the most damaged and vulnerable to the effects of fna in each microorganism the e coli and p putida cell pellet proteins that were considered destroyed fold change 0 175 shared a few common molecular functions and biological processes the common functions included electron transfer metal ion binding translation rna binding and cell membrane formation protein specifically rna binding translation proteins such as cyob and rplf were destroyed in e coli and p putida respectively therefore fna seems to target proteins based on their structure and corresponding molecular functions there are also a number of proteins destroyed by fna treatment that have unique functions for each species particularly for p putida which is more sensitive to the effects of fna for example ribosomal proteins e g rpls rpll rpmb rpmf rplq rply rpsb and rpsp involved in the translational process are commonly destroyed by fna in p putida fig 7b there are also some unique proteins destroyed in e coli for example metal ion binding electron transfer proteins e g ipda cyob pura and nusg the metal ion binding electron transfer proteins make up a large amount of the total number of proteins destroyed by fna in e coli 4 discussion 4 1 antimicrobial mechanisms this study reveals that fna treatment causes microbial cell death in e coli and p putida this was seen by the increase in the number of dead cells and cell membrane permeability for both organisms in the viability assay following 24 hr fna treatment at 6 09 mg n l fig 1 afm imaging also revealed substantial damage to the cell morphology fig 2 and 3 which led to an increase in soluble protein leaking from within the cell to the surrounding matrix fig 4 the protein abundance assays support the conclusion that fna causes damage to the cell membranes enabling critical intracellular materials to leak out into the surrounding matrix fig 4 and 8 a however after the addition of an rns scavenger to the fna treatment condition there was no significant increase in cell killing or cell membrane permeability when compared to the control condition p 0 05 fig 1 at a molecular level we found that some proteins associated with nitrosative stress resistance have been upregulated following fna exposure fig 3 therefore it can be concluded that rns are playing a major role in causing cell lysis and cell membrane permeability rns are characterized as free radicals due to the presence of a lone electron on the nitrogen atom which makes them highly reactive compounds fna is a weak acid and is unstable at low ph it decomposes in solution to form reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no chen et al 2019 the no2 radical further undergoes hydrolysis through reactive nitrogen intermediates rnis including dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 to yield nitric hno3 and nitrous acid hno2 venault et al 1997 these nitrosative derivatives have damaging effects on organic molecules via for example reacting with sulfhydryl groups thus inactivating proteins or causing nitrosative damage to lipids or dna gao et al 2016b protein nitration and nitrosylation by nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no have also been observed in previous studies thus altering protein structures stability and biological activity hnizdova et al 2009 a possible mechanism for the biocidal effects of fna at the molecular level is proposed fig 8 as illustrated in fig 8a rns derived from fna targets cell envelope materials leading to their breakdown as demonstrated at a molecular level in our previous study chislett et al 2020 as a result of damage to the cell envelope afm revealed perforations in the cell membrane this type of damage leads to cell lysis and allows for intracellular organic components to leak out of the cell a phenomenon also observed by afm figs 2 and 3 for both e coli and p putida fna derived rns consequently reacts with and destroys intracellular proteins fig 7 fig 8b further provides an illustration of the hypothesised reaction mechanisms to demonstrate why particular protein materials are targeted and vulnerable to the fna derived rns and nitrosative stress we found that the proteins that are most vulnerable for both organisms share similar molecular functions and biological processes mainly including 1 cell membrane proteins 2 proteins involved in electron transfer and metal ion binding and 3 proteins involved in dna and rna synthesis fig 8b these proteins are vulnerable to fna derived rns due to their structural characteristics cell outer membrane proteins outlined in process 1 fig 8b are susceptible to the effects of rns partly due to their location on the outside of the cell but also because they contain several bonds that can be cleaved by rns including ether ester and peptide bonds bruce and prasad 2008 cohen and schneider 1941 hnizdova et al 2009 olah and olah 1965 wu et al 2018 this study found that peptidoglycan a cell membrane protein in p putida was destroyed by fna fig 7 our previous work also found that a selection of representative cell envelope molecules including peptidoglycan were broken down by fna through cleavage of those mentioned structural bonds chislett et al 2020 these bonds provide structural support to the membrane molecules therefore the cleavage of these bonds leads to the breakdown of these large macromolecules into smaller molecules eventually causing perforations in the cell membrane metal ion binding proteins outlined in process 2 fig 8b have redox active metal ions within the protein and previous studies have identified that these proteins are particularly targeted by radicals because the charge creates a funnelling multi hit effect near the binding site radicals can act by causing breaks in the polymeric backbone of a macromolecule by abstracting a hydrogen or by addition to a double bond walling 1982 if the metal binding site is important for function and activity or for spatial orientation or conformation the funnelling effect will cause marked amplification of the biological damage chevion et al 1999 examples of metal ion binding proteins that were found to be destroyed by fna include panb and ipda in e coli fig 7a another example of a protein with a metal binding structure is the ribosomal protein which was also found to be destroyed by fna in p putida in this study fig 7 other examples of ribosomal protein destroyed in p putida include rpls rpll rplq rply rpsb and rpsp fig 7b several studies have found that ribosomal proteins are particularly sensitive to rns due to the presence of the redox active metal sites found in the ribosomal protein structure which make the protein a target due to the reactivity of both the charged metal sites and the rns brandes et al 2007 shcherbik and pestov 2019 wang et al 2014 in addition rns such as onoo can cause protein damage through the oxidation of protein thiols zaki et al 2005 both onoo and no2 can mediate lipid peroxidation rubbo et al 1994 and oxidize proteins non specifically ischiropoulos and al mehdi 1995 recent studies indicate that rna such as messenger rna mrna rrna and translational rna trna are very vulnerable to nitrosative damage as outlined in process 3 fig 8b the recent studies found that nitrosative damage alters the structure of rrna mrna trna zaher and yan 2019 nitrosative modification to rna results in the disturbance of multiple steps of the translational process and impairment of protein synthesis which can cause misfolded or mistranslated protein and consequently proteolysis extensive proteolysis leads to cell deterioration or even cell death kong and lin 2010 zaher and yan 2019 damage to rrna affects important functional sites of the ribosome while damage to mrna can affect the speed and accuracy of translation zaher and yan 2019 the modifications to the rna structure by free radicals also affect the binding of proteins for example rna associated proteins rpmc in e coli rna binding protein and rplt rna binding translation protein in p putida were destroyed by fna in this study fig 7 the results from the protein sequencing conducted in this study conclude that radical induced nitrosative damage is a leading cause of protein destruction and that e coli and p putida have several major regulator proteins activated during nitrosative stress collectively this study for the first time provides insights into the mechanism of fna induced cell lysis as critical proteins are targeted due to their structure the results conclude that rns formed from the decomposition of fna can cause cell lysis via perforations in the cell membrane and the destruction of intracellular protein 4 2 implications for wastewater treatment nitrite has been used as an antimicrobial agent for a long time for example nitrite has been used in food preservatives to prevent the growth of food spoilage bacteria pierson and smoot 1982 fna has been applied to wastewater treatment recently to treat sludge or biofilm to accomplish several purposes although previous studies hypothesised that the antimicrobial mechanisms of fna were multi targeted at ppb levels and related to nitrosative stress there was a lack of information to elucidate the fna induced cell lysis mechanisms through a mechanistic approach it was found that fna and its nitrosative derivatives lead to cell membrane perforation via the breakdown of cell membrane molecules intracellular proteolysis and consequently cell lysis microbial control has implications for improved sludge degradability since sludge flocs are made up of microbial cells in an extracellular matrix in a suspended aggregate collectively the findings attained in this work advance our knowledge of why fna treatment could improve sludge reduction or lead to a loss and slow recovery of biological activity in biofilms while this study demonstrated that fna at 6 09 mg n l can cause significant cell lysis p 0 01 the fna levels required may be different in different applications the specific dosage should be optimized according to the application scenarios and the microorganisms involved for example this study revealed that e coli is more resistant to fna toxicity than p putida the results from this study can therefore be used to guide optimization of anaerobic digestion processes alongside biofilm management in sewer networks and microbial control in wastewater treatment processes 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn fna at 6 09 mg l is biocidal causing bacterial cells to lyse different bacteria may have different levels of tolerance to fna for example fna treatment of cells at 6 09 mg l for 24 h kills 36 4 2 of e coli cells and 91 3 5 of p putida cells rns produced from the decomposition of fna is directly responsible for cell lysis rns caused the lysis of cells through the destruction of protein macromolecules found in the cell membrane proteolysis thus causing perforations in the cell membrane and leakage of intracellular proteins rns further causes the destruction of protein macromolecules within the cell providing an explanation as to why afm showed cell flattening after fna exposure declaration of

16047,free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 has been demonstrated to have broad biocidal effects on a range of microorganisms which has direct implications for wastewater management however the biocidal mechanisms still remain largely unknown this study aims to test the hypothesis that fna will induce cell lysis via cell membrane perforations and consequently cause cell death via proteolysis through the use of two model organisms namely escherichia coli k12 and pseudomonas putida kt2440 a combination of analytical techniques that included viability assays atomic force microscopy afm protein abundance assays and proteomic analysis using quadruple orbitrap mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the extent of cell death and possible cell lysis mechanisms fna treatment at 6 09 mg l for 24 h conditions typically applied in applications induced 36 4 2 and 91 3 5 cell death lysis of e coli and p putida respectively afm showed that the lysis of cells was observed via perforations in the cell membrane cells also appeared to shrink and become flat following fna treatment by introducing a reactive nitrogen species rns scavenger to act as a treatment control we further revealed that it was the nitrosative decomposition species of fna such as no that caused the cell lysis through the destruction of protein macromolecules found in the cell membrane proteolysis subsequently the rns went on to cause the destruction of protein macromolecules within the cells the death of these model organisms e coli and p putida following exposure to fna treatment provides insights into the use of fna as an antimicrobial agent in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords free nitrous acid fna biocidal cell lysis reactive nitrogen species rns protein sequencing

bca bicinchoninic acid bsa bovine serum album 1 introduction as one of the commonly used wastewater treatment systems the activated sludge process relies on the suspended growth of microbes to simultaneously remove nutrients and convert organic carbon to carbon dioxide the activated sludge process usually produces excessive wasted sludge which has a reduced degradability due to the presence of difficult to degrade microbial cells in practice excessive sludge production could lead to large treatment costs accounting for up to 60 of the overall cost of wastewater treatment davis and hall 1997 additionally microbial development frequently leads to the development of biofilms while biofilms can have advantageous roles in some environments they can also be detrimental for example biofouling of membrane and corrosion of expensive sewer infrastructure jiang et al 2010 thus it is critical for the wastewater industry to develop efficient solutions to increase sludge biodegradability and control undesirable biofilm growth recently free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite hno2 is emerging as a potentially green and economical antimicrobial agent with fewer concerns of developing bacteria resistance zhou et al 2011 duan et al 2020 lu and guo 2021 fna has been found to have vast biocidal impacts on a range of microorganisms at ppm levels i e at mg n l which has led to its prospective use in a range of applications for wastewater treatment pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2013a these include the long term reduction of sulfate reducing and methanogenic activities of anaerobic sewer biofilms at 0 2 0 3 mg n l fna jiang et al 2011b jiang et al 2013 this is significant because it greatly reduces the production of sulfide considerably slowing down sewer corrosion jiang et al 2013 in another application fna at 2 mg n l has been shown to cause the lysis of cells in activated sludge thus improving the biodegradability of sludge and enhancing the methane production during its anaerobic digestion wang et al 2013a however there are limited studies to reveal underlying mechanisms for the biocidal effects of fna in a previous study we established that fna interacted with and consequently broke down model molecular components in the cell envelope both in the cell wall and the cell membrane chislett et al 2020 these components were all integral in either the structure rigidity porosity or strength of the microbial cell envelope we also observed that fna broke down representative extracellular polymeric substances eps eps establish the function and structural integrity of biofilms these organic components found in eps and the cell envelope form intracellular and extracellular protective barriers to protect microbial cells from environmental stressors and were found to be broken down into smaller more readily biodegradable fractions thus hypothetically the breakdown of eps would leave cells more vulnerable to antimicrobial action while the breakdown of cell envelope materials would induce cell lysis however there is no fundamental evidence to support any sort of mechanisms of cell lysis by fna by using intact bacterial cells the objective of this study is to investigate the extent of cell lysis by fna using model organisms escherichia coli k 12 and pseudomonas putida kt 2440 and to reveal underlying mechanisms for fna induced cell lysis in this study we hypothesise that the microbial cell inactivation and cell lysis by fna observed in previous studies was caused by damage perforations in the cell envelope due to nitrosative stress on structural components in the cell envelope nitrosative stress is thought to cause various damage to enzymes cellular membranes and cell walls o leary and solberg 1976 this damage is believed to be caused by reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no produced through the decomposition of fna however there is no direct evidence to support this in order to achieve the aim a variety of molecular and analytical techniques were employed to measure the effect of fna on cell viability and integrity including viability assays atomic force microscopy afm a protein abundance assay and protein sequencing using quadruple orbitrap mass spectrometry for the first time we were able to quench the rns from the fna treatment experiment to investigate the biocidal effect of fna with and without these nitrosative species the outcomes presented in this study will expand our understanding of the biocidal impacts of fna previously observed in activated sludge and anaerobic sewer biofilms this study has implications for the optimization of anaerobic digestion practices in addition to biofilm control in sewer networks and microbial management in wastewater treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 fna treatment of e coli k 12 and p putida kt 2440 e coli k 12 and p putida kt 2440 were selected because relevant strains belonging to e coli and p putida are ubiquitously detected in various engineered water systems e g wastewater treatment plants bacterial cells were prepared for experiments in luria base lb broth solution details of inoculation and culturing of the organisms can be found in sections 1 1 1 3 of the materials and methods section in the supplementary information si lu et al 2020a when the cultures were in the early log phase of growth 11 h after inoculation an optical density reading was taken and the od600nm of the cultures was adjusted to 0 2 after the incubation period a nitrite stock solution was added to the culture to achieve a nitrite concentration of 250 mg n l with ph subsequently adjusted to 5 0 table 1 the fna concentration was calculated to be 6 09 mg n l using the formula s n o 2 n k a 10 p h with the ka value determined as a function of temperature t c 25 c in this study with the formula k a e 2300 273 t this fna level was selected based on our previous studies which showed that fna at this level breaks down structural organic molecules in cell walls and cell membranes chislett et al 2020 lyses cells gao et al 2015 and enhances the digestibility of activated sludge zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the ph was monitored during the entire experiment and was observed to stay at 5 0 0 3 the treatment time was 24 hr which was previously reported to be adequate to break down organic molecules in cell walls and cell membranes chislett et al 2020 causing significant cell lysis zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the control cultures no fna treatment were added with the same volume of phosphate buffered solution pbs which helped to maintain a neutral ph of 7 0 rather than 5 0 was chosen for the control because the experiments aimed to evaluate the effects of fna rather than nitrite experiments were conducted in triplicate for all conditions an additional treatment condition was introduced to investigate the potential role of rns in cell lysis table 1 an rns scavenger c ptio was added during fna treatment to scavenge remove rns that could potentially cause cell lysis through nitrosative stress the no scavenger c ptio was supplied lyophilised freeze dried and 0 14 g was reconstituted in 100 Î¼l 0 1 ml dmf to produce a stock solution of 4 mm the stock solution was then diluted 10 times with 0 9 ml milli q water to produce a final concentration of 400 Î¼m this was prepared in triplicate as c ptio reacts in a 1 1 ratio with nitrite the volume of the stock solution added to the cultures was adjusted to match the fna concentration the scavenger was added at the same time as fna after the fna treatment a series of assays was conducted to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the cell lysis caused by fna including viability assays cell membrane permeability testing afm imaging and proteomic analysis the detailed methods of each assay are described in the following sections 2 2 viability assays and cell membrane permeability testing the biocidal effects of fna on e coli and p putida were investigated by staining with baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa the live dead cell percentage of the cultures was then dual stained with propidium iodide pi final concentration 30 Î¼m and syto 9 final concentration 5 Î¼m and incubated in a dark at room temperature for 30 min lu et al 2020b to investigate the effect of fna on cell membrane permeability with and without the addition of a scavenger the cell membrane permeability percentage of the cultures was stained with pi only final concentration 30 Î¼m and then incubated in the dark for 30 min lu et al 2018 the fluorescence for both tests was quantified by applying 500 Î¼l 106 cfu ml of the stained samples to a cytoflex flow cytometer bd biosciences usa with 488 nm excitation while emissions were measured above 630 nm for red pi fluorescence and at 520 nm for green syto 9 fluorescence heat treated 1 h at 80 c cells were used as controls for intact and damaged cells respectively 2 3 atomic force microscopy atomic force microscopy afm imaging was employed after the fna treatment described in 2 1 the control and fna treated suspensions were harvested in the early log phase and an optical density reading was taken and adjusted to od600nm of 0 2 the control and treated suspensions of 200 Î¼l were then incubated for 10 min with 1 ml milli q water each treatment was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet re suspended in 200 Î¼l of milli q water in a procedure that was repeated three times to remove excess salt which was found to introduce afm imaging artifacts finally 10 Î¼l of the washed cell suspension was dried on mica discs with direct 10 min of vacuum drying in a harrick pdc001 thermo fisher scientific usa enclosure all samples were imaged in amplitude modulated ac mode in air using an mfp 3d afm oxford instruments asylum research usa placed on an antivibration table herzan usa and enclosed in an acoustic isolation chamber tmc usa silicon cantilever probes ha nc nt mdt russia were employed to raster scan typically a 10 10 Î¼m sample area 512 512 px at 0 3 hz scan rate and setpoints bellow 200 mv to avoid sample damage 2 4 proteomic analysis 2 4 1 protein abundance assay batch tests were performed on the control and fna treated using the pierce bca protein assay kit to quantify the amount of soluble protein present in the cell suspensions with and without fna treatment following the fna treatment described in sections 2 1 the bicinchoninic acid bca assay was performed using the pierce bca protein assay kit to quantify the amount of soluble protein present in the cell suspensions with and without fna treatment the bca assay is a biochemical assay for determining the total concentration of protein in a solution 0 5 Î¼g ml 1 1 5 mg ml the total protein concentration was exhibited by a colour change of the sample solution from green to purple in proportion to protein concentration which was then measured using a spectrophotometer at 562 nm a detailed procedure on how to prepare the bovine serum album bsa standard curve is presented in section 1 4 of the materials and methods section in the si the bca protein assay standard curve is shown in figure s1 in the si 2 4 2 protein sequencing protein sequencing assays were performed after the fna treatment described in sections 2 1 using the q exactive hf x hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer to track the response of the cell against fna and to identify which protein had been damaged or regulated following fna exposure for peptide preparations the s trap micro spin column digestion protocol was used to lyse reduce alkalize trypsin digest and elute the protein present in the samples as described previously by grobbler et al grobbler et al 2015 the peptide preparations were then transferred to the mass spectrometer qualitative protein databases were created by information dependant analysis while quantitative protein determination was based on swath ms grobbler et al 2015 using biological triplicate samples database and software analyses and settings are described in section 2 5 of the materials and methods section of the si zhang et al 2022 astringency cut off of false discovery rate q value less than 0 01 was used to identify the proteins with significant different expression levels 2 4 3 statistical analysis and data availability all experiments were conducted in biological triplicate the proteomic data was expressed as mean standard deviation sd independent t tests were performed p values less than 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant the mass spectrometry proteomic data are accessible publicly and have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium via the pride partner repository 3 results 3 1 fna can cause cell lysis and increase cell membrane permeability fig 1 a illustrates that following 24 hr fna exposure at 6 09 mg n l the live cell percentage of both e coli and p putida was significantly decreased compared to the control p 0 01 p putida is particularly sensitive to fna at 6 09 mg n l with 91 3 5 of cells being stained as dead following the exposure p 0 001 e coli is also shown to undergo cell lysis following fna treatment with 36 4 2 of cells stained as dead p 0 01 this demonstrates that at ppm levels fna causes cell lysis and permanent loss of biological activity interestingly with the addition of the rns scavenger the percentage of live and dead cells for both e coli and p putida is similar to that of the control no treatment p 0 05 suggesting the role of rns on cell inactivation in order to investigate whether rns are able to penetrate the cell membrane of e coli and p putida cells a cell membrane permeability test was conducted with and without the rns scavenger with 24 hr 6 09 mg n l fna treatment the results suggest that cell membrane permeation is greatly reduced with the addition of an rns scavenger fig 1b this is particularly the case for p putida whereby the percentage of cell membrane permeation was reduced from 24 5 1 1 following 24 hr 6 09 mg n l fna treatment to 3 3 0 3 with the addition of an rns scavenger p 0 01 fig 1b e coli cells also sustained cell membrane permeation with 15 0 3 cell membrane permeation observed in the fna treated sample compared to 1 57 0 3 of cells without any treatment p 0 01 the addition of rns scavenger significantly reduced cell membrane permeation to 2 7 0 3 when compared to the fna treated sample p 0 01 the results from the membrane permeability test indicate that rns produced from the decomposition of fna are capable of damaging the cell membrane 3 2 fna can cause cell lysis via perforations in the cell membrane cell morphology and fine structure changes upon exposure to fna were visualized using afm without any treatment e coli cells have a very distinct full and consistent cell morphology fig 2 a and b in contrast after 24 h of fna treatment cell surfaces exhibit a very rough texture fig 2 c d when compared to the smooth texture of control cells fig 2a b the fna treated cells appear shrivelled and empty in the height channel image fig 2d the rough surface could be due to the presence of intracellular organic components that have leaked from the cell there are also a large number of cell membrane perforations following fna treatment a close up 5 5 Î¼m version of fig 2 is shown in figure s2 to reveal even finer details the control p putida cells without any fna treatment like in the case of control e coli appear to maintain their shape and membrane integrity fig 3 a b after 24 h of fna treatment the shape of individual cells is barely identifiable fna has completely lysed the cells and the remaining matter is a mix of fragmented membranes small organelles and organic nano wire like material fig 3c a zoomed in 5 5 Î¼m version of fig 3 is shown in figure s3 to reveal an even higher resolution perspective on the cells the major difference between the e coli and p putida post fna treatment is the extent of destruction e coli cells appear to become rougher while p putida cells become barely identifiable 3 3 proteomic analysis 3 3 1 protein abundance assay in order to quantify the soluble protein abundance the bca assay standard curve figure s1 was established to calculate the concentration of soluble proteins present in the treated and untreated samples fig 4 illustrates that the levels of soluble protein were significantly higher in the fna treated suspensions for both e coli and p putida p 0 01 the concentration of soluble protein Î¼g ml 1 in the fna treated e coli suspension was 36 times higher than in the control suspension the concentration of soluble protein Î¼g ml 1 in the fna treated p putida suspension was 54 times higher than in the control suspension the protein abundance results shown in fig 4 are supported by the afm images figs 2 and 3 which also showed intracellular organelles surrounding the cellular debris following fna treatment for both e coli and p putida to gain a further understanding of how fna affects protein regulation in the cell pellet protein sequencing was conducted in the control and fna treated cell pellets 3 3 2 protein sequencing protein sequencing was carried out to investigate how fna affected overall protein regulation in the cell pellet fig 5 demonstrates the number of proteins that increased a fold change 1 compared to control decreased a fold change 1 but 0 175 or destroyed a fold change of 0 175 in the cell pellet following fna treatment of e coli and p putida in the case of e coli the abundance of 238 proteins increased following exposure to fna while 420 decreased and 102 destroyed for p putida 154 proteins increased following exposure to fna while 96 decreased and 73 destroyed in fact the abundances of a few protein materials have been upregulated under the exposure to fna a number of these increased proteins correspond to oxidative nitrosative stress responses in e coli and p putida fig 6 nitrosative stress through the production of rns is a natural consequence of aerobic metabolism bacteria have developed complex reformed gene regulatory responses to nitrosative and oxidative stress for example e coli and p putida have several major regulator proteins e g uspa and crp both encoding response to ros stress activated during nitrosative stress ohno et al 2003 in this study we found an increased fold change of 100 for the uspa protein in e coli fig 6c in addition our results showed an increased fold change of 50 for the upregulation of the crp protein in e coli fig 6c which is consistent with previous findings that the crp regulators in several bacterial species are involved in nitric oxide no oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance basak and jiang 2012 molina quiroz et al 2018 other proteins presented in our results that have been reported in the literature to be activated by nitrosative stress include ahpc jin and jeang 1999 and uspf nachin et al 2005 fig 6c and tpx atack et al 2008 rpmf nakayashiki and mori 2013 sodb bakshi et al 2006 fig 6d the upregulated stress proteins presented in figs 6c and d mostly correspond to proteins associated with nitrosative stress resistance for both microorganisms the number of proteins that was either decreased or destroyed following fna treatment was greater than the number of proteins that were increased following fna treatment therefore fna is not only lysing cells but also breaking down the protein within the lysed cells fna can cause a complete destruction of intracellular protein in e coli and p putida which was previously illustrated in fig 5 in order to explain why the number of proteins has been destroyed following fna exposure in fig 5 an investigation into the function and structural traits of the proteins with the lowest abundance ratio 0 175 was conducted fig 7 provides the name and description of each destroyed protein from e coli fig 7a and p putida fig 7b there is also a column indicating the fold change from 0 08 red to 0 175 green in heat map format the protein with the lowest fold change corresponding to the red region on the heat map had the greatest difference between a high abundance in the control sample and a low abundance in the fna treated sample therefore these proteins for example ilvh and panb in e coli and rplx and sdac in p putida were considered the most damaged and vulnerable to the effects of fna in each microorganism the e coli and p putida cell pellet proteins that were considered destroyed fold change 0 175 shared a few common molecular functions and biological processes the common functions included electron transfer metal ion binding translation rna binding and cell membrane formation protein specifically rna binding translation proteins such as cyob and rplf were destroyed in e coli and p putida respectively therefore fna seems to target proteins based on their structure and corresponding molecular functions there are also a number of proteins destroyed by fna treatment that have unique functions for each species particularly for p putida which is more sensitive to the effects of fna for example ribosomal proteins e g rpls rpll rpmb rpmf rplq rply rpsb and rpsp involved in the translational process are commonly destroyed by fna in p putida fig 7b there are also some unique proteins destroyed in e coli for example metal ion binding electron transfer proteins e g ipda cyob pura and nusg the metal ion binding electron transfer proteins make up a large amount of the total number of proteins destroyed by fna in e coli 4 discussion 4 1 antimicrobial mechanisms this study reveals that fna treatment causes microbial cell death in e coli and p putida this was seen by the increase in the number of dead cells and cell membrane permeability for both organisms in the viability assay following 24 hr fna treatment at 6 09 mg n l fig 1 afm imaging also revealed substantial damage to the cell morphology fig 2 and 3 which led to an increase in soluble protein leaking from within the cell to the surrounding matrix fig 4 the protein abundance assays support the conclusion that fna causes damage to the cell membranes enabling critical intracellular materials to leak out into the surrounding matrix fig 4 and 8 a however after the addition of an rns scavenger to the fna treatment condition there was no significant increase in cell killing or cell membrane permeability when compared to the control condition p 0 05 fig 1 at a molecular level we found that some proteins associated with nitrosative stress resistance have been upregulated following fna exposure fig 3 therefore it can be concluded that rns are playing a major role in causing cell lysis and cell membrane permeability rns are characterized as free radicals due to the presence of a lone electron on the nitrogen atom which makes them highly reactive compounds fna is a weak acid and is unstable at low ph it decomposes in solution to form reactive nitrogen species rns including nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no chen et al 2019 the no2 radical further undergoes hydrolysis through reactive nitrogen intermediates rnis including dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and dinitrogen tetroxide n2o4 to yield nitric hno3 and nitrous acid hno2 venault et al 1997 these nitrosative derivatives have damaging effects on organic molecules via for example reacting with sulfhydryl groups thus inactivating proteins or causing nitrosative damage to lipids or dna gao et al 2016b protein nitration and nitrosylation by nitrogen dioxide no2 and nitric oxide no have also been observed in previous studies thus altering protein structures stability and biological activity hnizdova et al 2009 a possible mechanism for the biocidal effects of fna at the molecular level is proposed fig 8 as illustrated in fig 8a rns derived from fna targets cell envelope materials leading to their breakdown as demonstrated at a molecular level in our previous study chislett et al 2020 as a result of damage to the cell envelope afm revealed perforations in the cell membrane this type of damage leads to cell lysis and allows for intracellular organic components to leak out of the cell a phenomenon also observed by afm figs 2 and 3 for both e coli and p putida fna derived rns consequently reacts with and destroys intracellular proteins fig 7 fig 8b further provides an illustration of the hypothesised reaction mechanisms to demonstrate why particular protein materials are targeted and vulnerable to the fna derived rns and nitrosative stress we found that the proteins that are most vulnerable for both organisms share similar molecular functions and biological processes mainly including 1 cell membrane proteins 2 proteins involved in electron transfer and metal ion binding and 3 proteins involved in dna and rna synthesis fig 8b these proteins are vulnerable to fna derived rns due to their structural characteristics cell outer membrane proteins outlined in process 1 fig 8b are susceptible to the effects of rns partly due to their location on the outside of the cell but also because they contain several bonds that can be cleaved by rns including ether ester and peptide bonds bruce and prasad 2008 cohen and schneider 1941 hnizdova et al 2009 olah and olah 1965 wu et al 2018 this study found that peptidoglycan a cell membrane protein in p putida was destroyed by fna fig 7 our previous work also found that a selection of representative cell envelope molecules including peptidoglycan were broken down by fna through cleavage of those mentioned structural bonds chislett et al 2020 these bonds provide structural support to the membrane molecules therefore the cleavage of these bonds leads to the breakdown of these large macromolecules into smaller molecules eventually causing perforations in the cell membrane metal ion binding proteins outlined in process 2 fig 8b have redox active metal ions within the protein and previous studies have identified that these proteins are particularly targeted by radicals because the charge creates a funnelling multi hit effect near the binding site radicals can act by causing breaks in the polymeric backbone of a macromolecule by abstracting a hydrogen or by addition to a double bond walling 1982 if the metal binding site is important for function and activity or for spatial orientation or conformation the funnelling effect will cause marked amplification of the biological damage chevion et al 1999 examples of metal ion binding proteins that were found to be destroyed by fna include panb and ipda in e coli fig 7a another example of a protein with a metal binding structure is the ribosomal protein which was also found to be destroyed by fna in p putida in this study fig 7 other examples of ribosomal protein destroyed in p putida include rpls rpll rplq rply rpsb and rpsp fig 7b several studies have found that ribosomal proteins are particularly sensitive to rns due to the presence of the redox active metal sites found in the ribosomal protein structure which make the protein a target due to the reactivity of both the charged metal sites and the rns brandes et al 2007 shcherbik and pestov 2019 wang et al 2014 in addition rns such as onoo can cause protein damage through the oxidation of protein thiols zaki et al 2005 both onoo and no2 can mediate lipid peroxidation rubbo et al 1994 and oxidize proteins non specifically ischiropoulos and al mehdi 1995 recent studies indicate that rna such as messenger rna mrna rrna and translational rna trna are very vulnerable to nitrosative damage as outlined in process 3 fig 8b the recent studies found that nitrosative damage alters the structure of rrna mrna trna zaher and yan 2019 nitrosative modification to rna results in the disturbance of multiple steps of the translational process and impairment of protein synthesis which can cause misfolded or mistranslated protein and consequently proteolysis extensive proteolysis leads to cell deterioration or even cell death kong and lin 2010 zaher and yan 2019 damage to rrna affects important functional sites of the ribosome while damage to mrna can affect the speed and accuracy of translation zaher and yan 2019 the modifications to the rna structure by free radicals also affect the binding of proteins for example rna associated proteins rpmc in e coli rna binding protein and rplt rna binding translation protein in p putida were destroyed by fna in this study fig 7 the results from the protein sequencing conducted in this study conclude that radical induced nitrosative damage is a leading cause of protein destruction and that e coli and p putida have several major regulator proteins activated during nitrosative stress collectively this study for the first time provides insights into the mechanism of fna induced cell lysis as critical proteins are targeted due to their structure the results conclude that rns formed from the decomposition of fna can cause cell lysis via perforations in the cell membrane and the destruction of intracellular protein 4 2 implications for wastewater treatment nitrite has been used as an antimicrobial agent for a long time for example nitrite has been used in food preservatives to prevent the growth of food spoilage bacteria pierson and smoot 1982 fna has been applied to wastewater treatment recently to treat sludge or biofilm to accomplish several purposes although previous studies hypothesised that the antimicrobial mechanisms of fna were multi targeted at ppb levels and related to nitrosative stress there was a lack of information to elucidate the fna induced cell lysis mechanisms through a mechanistic approach it was found that fna and its nitrosative derivatives lead to cell membrane perforation via the breakdown of cell membrane molecules intracellular proteolysis and consequently cell lysis microbial control has implications for improved sludge degradability since sludge flocs are made up of microbial cells in an extracellular matrix in a suspended aggregate collectively the findings attained in this work advance our knowledge of why fna treatment could improve sludge reduction or lead to a loss and slow recovery of biological activity in biofilms while this study demonstrated that fna at 6 09 mg n l can cause significant cell lysis p 0 01 the fna levels required may be different in different applications the specific dosage should be optimized according to the application scenarios and the microorganisms involved for example this study revealed that e coli is more resistant to fna toxicity than p putida the results from this study can therefore be used to guide optimization of anaerobic digestion processes alongside biofilm management in sewer networks and microbial control in wastewater treatment processes 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn fna at 6 09 mg l is biocidal causing bacterial cells to lyse different bacteria may have different levels of tolerance to fna for example fna treatment of cells at 6 09 mg l for 24 h kills 36 4 2 of e coli cells and 91 3 5 of p putida cells rns produced from the decomposition of fna is directly responsible for cell lysis rns caused the lysis of cells through the destruction of protein macromolecules found in the cell membrane proteolysis thus causing perforations in the cell membrane and leakage of intracellular proteins rns further causes the destruction of protein macromolecules within the cell providing an explanation as to why afm showed cell flattening after fna exposure declaration of

16048,aromatic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps have received particular attention in recent years due to their high toxicity however most relevant researches at present focused merely on halo monocyclic dbps while halo polycyclic dbps were scarcely explored in this study a new group of halo bicyclic dbps termed as halonaphthoquinones hnqs was systematically studied by coupling with vacuum centrifugal concentrator a spe uplc ms ms method with high accuracy and sensitivity was developed to detect five semi volatile hnqs in drinking water which achieved the detection limits in the range of 0 05 0 24 ng l five hnqs were identified using this method with 100 detection frequency at concentrations up to 136 7 ng l in drinking water originated from seven water treatment plants the cytotoxicity of the five tested hnqs in cho k1 cells ic50 from 3 17 to 13 18 Î¼m was comparable to the most toxic known carbonaceous dbp in drinking water iodoacetic acid ic50 2 95 Î¼m meanwhile the cytotoxicity of five tested hnqs were also higher than 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone ic50 21 73 Î¼m which is hundreds to thousands of times more toxic than regulated dbps indicating the significant toxicity risk of hnq dbps to the best of our knowledge this study presents the first analytical method for analysis of hnq dbps and the first set of data on the occurrence and cytotoxicity of hnq dbps in drinking water these findings are meaningful for probing deeply into the presence of varied halo polycyclic dbps in the aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts halonaphoquinones uplc ms ms polycyclic drinking water cytotoxicity 1 introduction as one of the greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century disinfection significantly prevents the outbreak of waterborne diseases and provides safe drinking water to humans li and mitch 2018 nevertheless disinfection byproducts dbps unavoidably form when the disinfectants react with natural organic matter nom bromide and iodide etc in source water up to now over 700 dbps have been identified in disinfected drinking water at concentrations ranged from ng l to Î¼g l level richardson and kimura 2020 epidemiology studies have demonstrated a consistent association of long term exposure to drinking water dbps with an increased risk of bladder cancer cantor et al 2010 li and mitch 2018 despite the tremendous efforts being devoted to conducting systematic quantitative comparative toxicological analyses of approximately 100 dbps han et al 2021a wagner and plewa 2017 it remains in vain to pinpoint the specific dbps responsible for the epidemiological risks of drinking water considering that more than 50 of the total organic halogen tox in drinking water are still unknown accurate identification of main drivers of adverse health effects that derived from dbps is of great significance hua and reckhow 2007 krasner et al 2006 halogenated aromatic dbps have received considerable attention in recent years such as the successive discovery of halophenols halohydroxy benzoic acids and halohydroxybenzaldehydes in drinking waters jiang et al 2020 pan et al 2016 pan and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019 zhai and zhang 2011 these newly identified aromatic halo dbps have been observed to induce higher cytotoxicity than those common known aliphatic halo dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 indicating that aromatic halo dbps are more likely to be the toxicity drivers among dbp mixture in chlorinated drinking water in addition halogenated quinone dbps such as halobenzoquinones and haloquinone chloroimides were found to be hundred to thousand times more toxic than regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids qin et al 2010 xu et al 2021 however most of the relevant researches at present focused merely on halo monocyclic dbps we propose that halo polycyclic dbps may be the potential dbps of high occurrence and toxicity in drinking water hence halonaphthoquinones hnqs are selected as the target analytes in this study to test our hypothesis hnqs are highly probable to occur as dbps in drinking water typical nom such as humic acids contains an abundance of polycyclic structures schulten and schnitzer 1993 in addition some polycyclic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were widely detected in source water at the concentrations of 10 to 106 ng l mojiri et al 2019 xu et al 2018 naphthalene the dominant low molecular weight pah existed in different types of waters like lake water 50 25 6525 ng l drinking water 13 1 139 000 ng l and seawater 75 9 7800 ng l meng et al 2019 mojiri et al 2019 it was reported to undergo oxidation to form naphthoquinone which is likely to transform further to hnqs during chlorination kumagai et al 2012 the high molecular weight pahs such as pyrene and perylene can also react with chlorine and degrade to naphthalene wu et al 2019 indicating that most pahs may act as potential precursors of hnqs to determine whether hnqs are present in drinking water a sensitive analytical method is necessary despite the lack of a method designated for analyzing hnq dbps thus far the analytical method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones pahqs provides a constructive reference to this study gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms was commonly used to quantify pahqs in recent years due to its excellent sensitivity and good separation ability galmiche et al 2021 qiao et al 2014 toriba et al 2016 however due to the high polarity and low vapor pressure pahqs may decompose and lead to poor recovery and reproducibility during gc ms analysis cho et al 2004 toriba et al 2016 thus an additional derivatization step is usually required before gc ms analysis bandowe and wilcke 2010 eiguren fernandez et al 2008 to reduce the error prone sample pretreatment steps before instrumental analysis liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was successfully applied to analyze pahqs without derivatization delhomme et al 2008 which is considered as the candidate detection method for hnqs analysis hnqs are also recognized to be toxicologically important it is worth mentioning that there was a significant association between prostate cancer risk and exposure to the 2 3 dichloro naphthoquinone dcnq log kow 2 65 band et al 2011 also the polycyclic structure increases the octanol water partition coefficients of hnqs hence elevating the bioaccumulation and persistence properties of hnq dbps in organisms and the environment nowadays a toxicological database containing more than 100 quantitatively analyzed dbps has been developed based on in vitro cytotoxicity in chinese hamster ovary cho cell assay wagner and plewa 2017 therefore determining the cytotoxicity of hnqs in cho k1 cells and compare the cytotoxicity data with the database may act as a useful approach to assess the comparative toxicity and health risk of hnq dbps in drinking water to the best of our knowledge hnqs have not been reported as dbps in real drinking water thus the primary objectives of this study include 1 to establish a sensitive and accurate analytical method for the qualification and quantification of hnq dbps 2 to investigate the occurrence and concentration of hnqs in disinfected drinking water and 3 to determine the cytotoxicity of hnqs on cho k1 cells the results of this study will provide methodological reference and scientific basis to understand and evaluate the potential health risks of hnq dbps in drinking water which can be meaningful for probing deeper into varied halo polycyclic dbps and evaluate the significance of each species in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chlorinated brominated and iodinated hnqs were the chosen analytes in this study fig s1 the number and substitution position of halogens on hnqs were selected based on a preliminary prediction of the formation probability according to the frontier molecular orbital theory the higher the ehomo value of the atom the easier the atom to be attacked by electrophiles like x x represents cl br i karelson et al 1996 fig s2 showed the ehomo values for each carbon atom of nq and mcnq fig s2 indicating that the c2 and c3 positions of nqs labeled in red are the most probable sites prone for chlorine substitution to take place thus five hnqs were selected as the target analytes including 2 chloro 1 4 naphthoquinone mcnq 2 bromo 1 4 naphthoquinone mbnq 2 3 dichloro naphthoquinone dcnq 2 3 dibromo 1 4 naphthoquinone dbnq and 2 idodine naphthoquinone minq the details of chemicals and materials are listed in text s1 2 2 sample pretreatment there is limited information regarding the presence and concentration of hnqs in water based on the previous studies of cl pahs hnqs are highly suspected to present at ng l concentrations in drinking water qiao et al 2014 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 therefore a solid phase extraction spe method is necessary to pre concentrate these compounds from water prior to uplc ms ms analysis three types of spe cartridges were compared as candidate sorbents and the sample ph before spe and volume of the eluent were carefully optimized the optimization process and the optimized spe method were described in detail in text s2 the pretreatment method for the analysis of pahs in water samples is described in text s3 2 3 selection of quenching agents this experiment was performed according to a previous study gong et al 2016 and the experimental details is described in text s4 briefly four quenching agents including na2so3 na2s2o3 ascorbic acid and nh4cl were tested as the candidate quenching agents for hnq analysis after screening out a suitable quenching agent contact time was further tested to ensure that quenching agent will not affect hnqs under different contact time samples were prepared in triplicate and an independent t test was conducted for analyzing the statistical difference between groups 2 4 simulated chlorination two pahqs 1 4 naphthoquinone and 9 10 anthraquinone and four pahs naphthalene anthracene phenanthrene and benzoanthracene were chlorinated in this study the simulated water samples were prepared with ultrapure water containing 1 mg l of nabr as br and 200 Î¼g l of ki as i six potential precursors at a concentration of 0 007 mmol l were chlorinated by dosing 5 0 mg l naocl as cl2 0 07 mmol l under the experimental conditions of 20 c and ph 7 for 12 hours in darkness sufficient ascorbic acid was added at once to quench the residual chlorine the condition of chlorination and the composition of simulated water samples were similar to the real situation in water treatment plant hu et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 the formation of five hnqs in the chlorination of naphthalene under different temperatures and varied bromide and iodide concentrations were further investigated more details on the experimental conditions are summarized in table s2 and each set of samples were prepared in triplicate moreover one set of ultrapure water samples containing 0 007 mmol l mcnq were boiled after chlorination to evaluate the effect of boiling 2 5 collection of water samples source water influent before final chlorination and finished water were collected between october and november 2021 from seven water treatment plants wtps in zhejiang province china water samples were collected using 4 l amber glass bottles without headspace basic parameters and information of water samples are summarized in table s3 ascorbic acid of 0 070 mmol l was added to the finished water samples immediately after sample collection to quench residual chlorine another finished water sample was collected without the addition of ascorbic acid for studying the variation of concentration of hnqs in boiling water the samples were transported to the laboratory with ice packs and stored at 4 c prior to pretreatment the finished water samples without addition of ascorbic acid were boiled and filtered by 0 45 Î¼m membranes when the temperature returned to room temperature 2 6 instrumental analysis the separation and quantification of hnqs was performed using a waters ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled with an ab sciex qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer the multiple reaction monitoring mrm method in negative mode was adopted to quantify and confirm the analytes based on matching retention times rts and peak areas of ion pairs a beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm i d 1 7 Î¼m waters ireland was used for chromatographic separation at a temperature of 40 c the mobile phase was composed of water solvent a and methanol solvent b the optimized gradient elution program and the ms parameters for hnqs were shown in text s5 the optimized compound dependent parameters for 5 hnqs are summarized in table s4 the quantification of pahs was performed using an agilent 7890b 5977b gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and the details are shown in text s3 br was quantified using ion chromatograph aquion thermo usa 2 7 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity of hnqs naphthoquinone nq 2 6 dichloro benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq and 1 chloronaphthalene 1 clnap was tested on cho k1 cells wagner and plewa 2017 in brief the cho k1 cells 3000 cells 100 Î¼l were incubated with each pollutant at known concentration in the 96 well plate at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 in order to obtain the ic50 the concentration at which the cell viability was inhibited to 50 of total cells of each analyte different concentration gradients were set up for each tested compound and each concentration had tested in three runs with 18 replicates in total 0 5 dmso v v was added to each test solution to improve the solubility of hnqs in f 12k culture medium negative control was consisted of f 12k medium containing 0 5 dmso which was simultaneously tested 10 Î¼l of cck 8 was added in each well after 72 h incubation and then the cells were cultured for another 1 hour the absorbance of each well at 450 nm wavelength was determined by a microplate reader infinite m200 pro tecan switzerland a one way analysis of variance anova tests was conducted to determine whether pollutants induced significant levels of cell death if a significant f value of p 0 05 was obtained a holm sidak multiple comparison was further performed with the power 1 Î² 0 8 at Î± 0 05 to determine the lowest cytotoxic concentrations based on the significance of the difference between the experiment groups and the negative control 2 8 quality assurance and data analysis the travel blank samples consisted of ultrapure water were simultaneously analyzed with field water samples an analysis blank sample composed of 70 methanol and 30 water was injected into the uplc ms ms instrument between every three samples an external standard calibration curve of mixed hnqs was established every time before sample analysis ascorbic acid was chlorinated to make sure no hnqs were produced by ascorbic acid the ic50 values of different pollutants were calculated and statistically analyzed using the graphpad prism 9 software the energy of both the highest unoccupied molecular orbital ehumo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo was calculated using the mopac software enthalpy Î´h and gibbs free energy Î´g were computed using the gaussian software at the b3lyp 6 31g level the calculation of method detection limit mdl method quantification limit mql recovery matrix effects and t value are described in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of uplc ms ms method for five hnqs hnqs were observed to be difficult to be ionized under esi ionization mode and also be difficult to be fragment in ms ms analysis in our study fig s3 and similar phenomena was reported for pahqs due to their stable structures galmiche et al 2021 fortunately after a series of careful trials we find that hnqs in the mixed solvent of water and methanol can be ionized and fragmented in negative esi mode at high ionization temperature with the assistance of formic acid halobenzoquinones which possess similar structures with hnqs but having mono quinone ring were prone to be reduced to halohydroquinones and accept electron to form m h 2e huang et al 2013 the polycyclic structure makes hnqs relatively weaker electron acceptor with lower electron affinity compared with halobenzoquinones hence hnqs are inclined to accept one electron to form m rather than m h 2e almost no other product ions except halogen ion were observed in the ms ms spectra of hnqs on this basis m x x represents cl br i were chosen to be the ion pairs to quantify the five hnqs in mrm analysis and related optimizations were carried out to strengthen the sensitivity of hnqs analysis ion source temperature was reported to be a factor that significantly affects the mrm intensity of hbqs huang et al 2013 fig s4a showed that the mrm intensity of hnqs sharply increased when the source temperature rose and reached the highest when the source temperature increased to 700 c apart from ion source temperature the composition of mobile phase and sample solution including the types of organic solvents the ratio of organic solvent to water and the ratio of formic acid all affected the mrm intensities of hnqs with the increase of formic acid in the tested solution the intensities of hnqs first increased and then decreased with 0 25 formic acid being the optimal value fig s4b nonetheless the addition of formic acid in mobile phase decreased the ms intensities of the hnqs which may be due to that the addition of formic acid suppressed the ionization of hnqs in negative esi mode thus 0 25 formic acid was only included in the samples subjected to uplc ms ms to stabilize the hnqs but was not added into the mobile phases acetonitrile and methanol were tested as candidate organic mobile phase fig s4c presented the comparison of mobile phase ratio between acetonitrile water 70 30 and methanol water 70 30 towards the intensity of hnqs it is obvious that five hnqs had higher intensities in methanol water than in acetonitrile water in addition we also tested the influence of methanol ratio in water samples on the intensities of hnqs when the ratio of methanol increased up to 70 the signal reached the highest and remained nearly unchanged when the ratio increased further fig s4d based on the results above the ion source temperature to detect hnqs was set at 650 c considering the instrument stability methanol water ratio of 70 30 and 0 25 formic acid were chosen to be the optimal composition of the tested hnqs solution after optimizations the peak areas of multiple mrm transitions were measured using uplc esi ms ms and were normalized against the highest transition of individual hnqs fig s5 the retention time and standard curve of each hnq are also displayed in fig s5 3 2 optimization of pretreatment for five hnqs the pretreatment of water samples was optimized step by step to obtain satisfactory recoveries of hnqs three types of spe cartridges oasis hlb oasis max and oasis wax were first examined for their performance on enriching hnqs fig 1 a the recoveries of five tested hnqs using oasis hlb cartridges reached 82 5 99 2 which were much higher than using oasis max and oasis wax cartridges below 40 however after the application of optimized spe cartridge the recoveries dramatically declined to 17 8 62 3 when nitrogen evaporator was used to concentrate the analytes it is primarily due to the semi volatile property of hnqs to co evaporate easily with the solvent under nitrogen stream lau et al 2021 to solve this problem several instruments including vacuum centrifugal concentrator vcc and rotary evaporator were examined for concentration of samples the vcc showed acceptable recoveries 70 25 92 35 fig 1b which may be because vcc concentrated samples at low temperature and low pressure which largely reduced the evaporation of the analytes thereafter spe coupled with vcc was employed in the following optimization of the ph of water samples and the eluent volume the ph would affect the stability of the target compounds in aqueous solution thus selecting a suitable ph before pretreatment was necessary the ph of the water samples from 1 to 10 were evaluated fig 1c the recoveries of hnqs gradually increased with increasing ph from 1 to 5 then declined until ph 10 interestingly the recoveries of the five hnqs abruptly dropped to almost zero from ph 8 to 9 which indicated that degradation or transformation of hnqs occurred at basic condition the same phenomenon was observed on halobenzoquinones in the study by qin et al 2010 and wang et al speculated that the displacement of halogen by hydroxyl group caused the transformation of halobenzoquinone to hydroxyl halobenzoquinones in alkaline environment wang et al 2014 therefore the optimized ph of 5 was selected for hnqs analysis as illustrated in fig 1c methanol was used as eluent due to its good performance as the higher intensity of hnqs in ms than acetonitrile and the optimal volume of methanol was assessed higher recoveries of hnqs were achieved when the volume increased from 3 to 6 ml and remained nearly unchanged when the eluent volume increased to 9 ml fig 1d consequently 6 ml methanol was adequate to obtain satisfactory recoveries 70 for all the compounds finally an optimized spe vcc uplc ms ms analytical method for hnqs was developed and the mdl mql recovery and matrix effect were calculated based on the equations listed in text s6 the mdls for hnqs of this method ranged in 0 05 0 24 ng l while the mqls ranged in 0 18 0 75 ng l with the precisions of analytical method ranged in 2 9 7 6 the accuracy and stability of this method were evaluated at three different concentrations 1 10 and 100 ng l all of which achieved acceptable and stable recoveries in the range of 75 88 table 1 this new analytical method for hnqs was proved to be sensitive and accurate 3 3 selection of quenching agent the addition of a suitable quenching agent in water samples is necessary to quench residual chlorine and prevent further formation or decomposition of dbps four common quenching agents sodium sulfite sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride were assessed for hnqs analysis in this study fig 2 and an independent t test was conducted to evaluate the significance of the difference between samples with or without quenching agent table s5 results showed that hnqs were undetectable in samples quenched by sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate while the concentrations of mcnq and dcnq in the samples quenched with ammonium chloride was remarkably higher than the non quenched samples it was indicated that sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate might cause the decomposition of hnqs whereas the addition of ammonium chloride might increase the intensity of cl nqs in the uplc ms ms analysis when sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate both the weakly alkaline quenching agents were added with the stoichiometric amounts equivalent to 5 mg l cl2 into the water the ph exceeded 9 leading to the decomposition of hnqs which was consistent with the results in fig 1c ascorbic acid did not show any significant effect on the concentrations of hnqs therefore it was chosen as an ideal quenching agent for hnqs analysis contact times 2 12 and 24 h between hnqs and ascorbic acid were examined and a set of non quenched samples were simultaneously prepared and tested for comparison fig s6 a t test indicated that there was no statistical differences among non quenched samples at 12 and 24 h contact time with that at 2 h table s6 indicating the hnqs were stable in water within 24 h similarly there was also no significant difference among quenched samples at varied contact time table s7 suggesting the hnqs were also stable in the presence of ascorbic acid in 24 h no significant difference between quenched and non quenched samples at a specific contact time according to the t test table s8 indicating that the addition of ascorbic acid will not interfere the existence and analysis of hnqs thus ascorbic acid is recognized as an ideal chlorine quencher for the analysis of hnqs in drinking water 3 4 formation of hnqs after chlorination of polycyclic aromatic compounds to explore the possibility of generating hnqs from pahqs during chlorination the gibbs free energy Î´g values of the reactions from naphthoquinone to 2 chloro 1 4 naphthoquinone and subsequently to 2 3 dichloro 1 4 naphthoquinone in the proposed pathway were calculated as shown in fig s7 the calculated Î´g values at 20 c were 108 09 and 98 85 kj mol 1 indicating that theoretically the proposed reaction was able to occur spontaneously based on this result naphthoquinone and its parent pah compound naphthalene were chlorinated fig 3 a and c in addition considering that ring cleavage would occur for high ring pahs during chlorination to form low ring pahs anthraquinone anthracene phenanthrene and benzoanthracene were chlorinated under the same condition fig 3b d e and f both the number of benzene rings and their concentration in real water were considered when choosing these compounds liu et al 2021 all three monohalogenated hnqs mono hnqs were detected in simulated chlorination samples except for benzoanthracene while the two di hnqs only can be detected in chlorinated samples of the two tested pahqs but not in those of the tested pahs for the two pahq precursors mbnq showed the highest production 3 09 nmol l in naphthoquinone and 0 21 nmol l in anthraquinone and the concentrations of minq dcnq and dbnq were generally much lower than mcnq and mbnq unlike chlorinated pahq samples mcnq showed the highest formation rather than mbnq in chlorinated pah samples anthracene produced more mono hnqs than its isomer phenanthrene the molar formation potential of six precursors to five hnqs were 2 7 10 3 naphthoquinone 2 6 10 4 anthraquinone 1 5 10 5 naphthalene 4 0 10 6 anthracene 3 0 10 6 phenanthrene and 2 0 10 6 benzoanthracene the much higher formation potentials of quinone compounds than those of pahs indicated that the quinone structure was the active unit to form hnqs in addition the molar formation of hnqs gradually decreased with the increase of benzene ring numbers of pah precursors the relatively lower yields of minq dcnq and dbnq suggested the difficult formation of these three hnqs in the real disinfected system while mcnq and mbnq may be the dominant hnq dbps to better examine the formation of hnqs under different conditions bromide concentration iodide concentration and temperature 0 007 mmol l naphthalene was chlorinated with 5 mg l naocl as cl2 at 20 c and ph 7 for 12 hours fig s8 meanwhile a set of control samples containing 0 007 mmol l naphthalene 5 mg l naocl as cl2 1 mg l of nabr as br and 200 Î¼g l of ki as i was prepared cks in fig s8 the formation of mbnq under different bromide concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l and without the addition of iodide is presented in fig s8a the concentration of mbnq increased slightly from 0 to 0 87 ng l when the bromide concentration increased from 0 to 2 mg l but dbnq was undetectable through comparing the sample of 1 mg l bromide with the control sample the decreased formation of mbnq with the presence of 0 2 mg l iodide might be due to the competition between hoi and hobr to react with the precursor han et al 2021b fig s8b showed the formation of minq under different iodide concentrations 0 50 100 200 and 500 Î¼g l and without the addition of bromide indicating the increase in minq concentrations from 0 to 9 81 ng l when the iodide concentration gradually raised from 0 to 500 Î¼g l which was similarly observed in the formation of 2 6 diiodobenzoquinone hu et al 2020 there is no significant difference between the sample of 200 Î¼g l iodide with the control samples indicating that the presence of bromide has little influence on the formation of minq the formation of hnqs at varied temperatures 20 30 and 40 c was also evaluated fig s8c when the temperature rose from 20 c to 40 c the concentrations of the three mono hnqs especially mcnq increased demonstrating that higher temperature increased the formation of hnqs nonetheless two di hnqs were still undetectable previous studies showed that boiling will affect the types and increase the concentrations of some certain dbps such as haloacetic acid and halophenols leuesque et al 2006 pan et al 2014 therefore the ultrapure water and the ultrapure water spiked with 0 007 mmol l mcnq were boiled after chlorinating for 12 h to test the concentration of hnqs and the result is shown in fig s8d the five hnqs were undetectable in ultrapure water before and after boiling indicating that there were no precursors of hnqs in the ultrapure water the concentration of mcnq decreased in the spiked samples while the concentration of dcnq increased from 5 42 to 18 76 ng l 0 024 to 0 082 nmol l after boiling the molar conversion efficiency was 0 8 implying that high temperature would promote the conversion from mcnq to dcnq 3 5 identification of hnqs in drinking water after the simulated chlorination in the laboratory real water samples collected from seven wtps were analyzed to determine the occurrence of hnqs in drinking water table s3 summarized the basic information of the water samples notably residual chlorine in the seven finished water samples were in the range of 0 48 1 01 mg l and br was detected in all the seven wtps ranging in 5 66 86 63 Î¼g l five hnqs including mcnq mbnq minq dcnq and dbnq were analyzed in drinking water and the existence of hnqs in water samples was confirmed if the ion pairs retention time and isotope abundance were identical with the chemical standards fig 4 shows the typical mrm chromatograms of five hnqs in the ultrapure water source water finished water and finished water after boiling hnqs were clearly detected in finished waters but non existent in both ultrapure and source water confirming that hnqs were new dbps formed during disinfection owing to the interference of matrix effect the error of retention time within 0 1 min was accepted in this study the standard addition method text s7 was applied to quantify the concentration of hnqs due to the lack of isotopically labeled standards wang et al 2013 fig 5 a presents that the concentrations of hnqs in drinking water ranged between nd 136 7 ng l table 2 which were at comparable level with other emerging dbps wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 three mono hnqs were identified at 100 occurrence frequency in which mcnq showed the highest concentration 136 7 8 3 ng l in contrast two di hnqs were detected in four and five finished water samples out of the seven water treatment plants meanwhile the concentrations of most di hnqs were below the method quantification limits indicating that di hnqs were hardly formed under the common disinfected environment which was consistent with the results in fig 3 taking into account the asian custom of drinking boiled water and the transformation of mcnq to dcnq after boiling in aforementioned laboratory experiment the concentrations of hnqs in boiled drinking water samples were subsequently revealed and are shown in fig 5b five hnqs were identified in boiled water at 100 occurrence frequency and the concentrations of di hnqs increased in all boiled drinking water samples further supporting that boiling promoted the formation of di hnqs in drinking water in addition the concentration of mono hnqs increased in some water samples as well implying that precursors existing in these drinking water samples further converted to hnqs during boiling pahs were confirmed to be the precursors of hnqs in simulated chlorination experiments fig 3 therefore the 16 priority pahs were monitored in the source water water before chlorination and water after chlorination collected from the seven wtps the total pahs concentration of source water water before chlorination and water after chlorination in seven wtps were 53 54 96 72 28 22 144 38 and 35 53 140 51 ng l respectively fig s9 for plants 1 3 the pahs were reduced after the water treatment while the pahs substantially increased during the water treatment processes in plants 4 7 what these four plants had in common was the involvement of biological pretreatment in water treatment processes a potential explanation to the increasing pahs is the desorption of pahs from microorganisms and devices in this study the concentrations of hnqs were much higher than those expected based on molar yields from pah precursors suggesting pahs were not the main precursors of hnqs in water samples 3 6 cytotoxicity of hnqs after understanding the occurrence and concentration of hnq dbps in drinking water the cytotoxicity of five hnq dbps 1 4 naphthoquinone nq 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone 2 6 dcbq and monochloronaphthalene 1 clnap in cho k1 cells was examined the cytotoxicity concentration response curves of the five hnqs are presented in fig 6 and table s9 s11 present the statistical analysis of the cytotoxicity data five hnq dbps showed significantly high toxicity with mean ic50 values of 3 17 mcnq 6 23 mbnq 4 41 minq 13 78 dcnq and 4 27 Î¼m dbnq respectively table s9 by comparing the cytotoxic index cti values the statistical rank order from the most toxic compound was mcnq dbnq minq mbnq dcnq tables s9 and s12 where the hnqs separated by were significantly different while the one separated by was not compared to the higher toxicity of dbnq than dcnq mcnq demonstrated higher toxicity than both mbnq and minq which was uncommon compared with previous study li et al 2016 a preliminary speculation was that naphthoquinone as the main body of hnq structure was the main contributor to the toxicity of hnqs while the substitution of halogen only showed secondary impact to verify this hypothesis the cytotoxicity of nq on cho k1 cell was tested fig s10 and table s9 the ic50 values of nq was 1 08 Î¼m indicating that nq was more toxic compared to the five hnqs which proved the hypothesis we proposed the cytotoxicity of 1 clnap and 2 6 dcbq was simultaneously evaluated for comparison purpose figs s11 and s12 the 1 clnap was chosen to represent the cytotoxicity of naphthalene as the high volatility of naphthalene may lead to inaccurate cytotoxicity result while 2 6 dcbq was selected as it is a highly toxic dbp possessing similar structure with hnqs the cytotoxicity of hnqs was significantly higher than both 1 clnap ic50 276 67 Î¼m and 2 6 dcbq ic50 21 73 Î¼m table s9 and the statistical rank order from the most toxic compound was mcnq dbnq minq mbnq dcnq 2 6 dcbq 1 clnap having known the cytotoxicity of hnq dbps and their concentrations in real drinking water the individual toxic potency weighted concentrations of each hnq and the calculated additive toxicity cat index of hnqs in seven wtps were also computed table s13 the details are shown in text s8 briefly the highest cat values of five hnqs in seven wtps were 2 52 10 4 which was much higher than the cat values of four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 cat 8 42 10 6 lau et al 2020 indicating the significant health risk of hnq dbps in addition although the cytotoxicity of 1 4 naphthoquinone was higher than hnqs it was hardly detected in water samples nascimento et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and may transform to hnqs during chlorination in contrast mcnq which is the most abundant hnq in drinking water exhibits comparable cytotoxicity with the most toxic known carbonaceous dbp iodoacetic acid ic50 2 95 Î¼m in drinking water wagner and plewa 2017 indicating the significant risk and urgency of researching hnq dbps in drinking water 4 conclusions and implications in the current study a comprehensive analysis was conducted on hnq dbps five hnqs were identified as new dbps in drinking water by using a sensitive and accurate analytical method based on cytotoxicity assessment hnqs were more toxic than most of known dbps and the cytotoxicity of mcnq was comparable to the most toxic carbonaceous dbp iodoacetic acid therefore although hnqs were found only at ng l level in drinking water their consequential health threat should not be neglected polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pahs and pahqs were the precursors but not the only precursors of hnqs in the environment hence the potentials and mechanisms of forming hnqs during disinfection is undoubtedly a research topic worth to be further studied besides many other types of pahqs are present in the water environment yet an insightful investigation on the production of new halogenated pahq dbps during disinfection process is still limited the analytical finding of this study provided scientific support that carbonaceous dbps particularly halo polycyclic dbps still need to be closely monitored and their occurrence in drinking water should be prevented declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16048,aromatic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps have received particular attention in recent years due to their high toxicity however most relevant researches at present focused merely on halo monocyclic dbps while halo polycyclic dbps were scarcely explored in this study a new group of halo bicyclic dbps termed as halonaphthoquinones hnqs was systematically studied by coupling with vacuum centrifugal concentrator a spe uplc ms ms method with high accuracy and sensitivity was developed to detect five semi volatile hnqs in drinking water which achieved the detection limits in the range of 0 05 0 24 ng l five hnqs were identified using this method with 100 detection frequency at concentrations up to 136 7 ng l in drinking water originated from seven water treatment plants the cytotoxicity of the five tested hnqs in cho k1 cells ic50 from 3 17 to 13 18 Î¼m was comparable to the most toxic known carbonaceous dbp in drinking water iodoacetic acid ic50 2 95 Î¼m meanwhile the cytotoxicity of five tested hnqs were also higher than 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone ic50 21 73 Î¼m which is hundreds to thousands of times more toxic than regulated dbps indicating the significant toxicity risk of hnq dbps to the best of our knowledge this study presents the first analytical method for analysis of hnq dbps and the first set of data on the occurrence and cytotoxicity of hnq dbps in drinking water these findings are meaningful for probing deeply into the presence of varied halo polycyclic dbps in the aqueous environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts halonaphoquinones uplc ms ms polycyclic drinking water cytotoxicity 1 introduction as one of the greatest achievements in public health in the 20th century disinfection significantly prevents the outbreak of waterborne diseases and provides safe drinking water to humans li and mitch 2018 nevertheless disinfection byproducts dbps unavoidably form when the disinfectants react with natural organic matter nom bromide and iodide etc in source water up to now over 700 dbps have been identified in disinfected drinking water at concentrations ranged from ng l to Î¼g l level richardson and kimura 2020 epidemiology studies have demonstrated a consistent association of long term exposure to drinking water dbps with an increased risk of bladder cancer cantor et al 2010 li and mitch 2018 despite the tremendous efforts being devoted to conducting systematic quantitative comparative toxicological analyses of approximately 100 dbps han et al 2021a wagner and plewa 2017 it remains in vain to pinpoint the specific dbps responsible for the epidemiological risks of drinking water considering that more than 50 of the total organic halogen tox in drinking water are still unknown accurate identification of main drivers of adverse health effects that derived from dbps is of great significance hua and reckhow 2007 krasner et al 2006 halogenated aromatic dbps have received considerable attention in recent years such as the successive discovery of halophenols halohydroxy benzoic acids and halohydroxybenzaldehydes in drinking waters jiang et al 2020 pan et al 2016 pan and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019 zhai and zhang 2011 these newly identified aromatic halo dbps have been observed to induce higher cytotoxicity than those common known aliphatic halo dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 indicating that aromatic halo dbps are more likely to be the toxicity drivers among dbp mixture in chlorinated drinking water in addition halogenated quinone dbps such as halobenzoquinones and haloquinone chloroimides were found to be hundred to thousand times more toxic than regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids qin et al 2010 xu et al 2021 however most of the relevant researches at present focused merely on halo monocyclic dbps we propose that halo polycyclic dbps may be the potential dbps of high occurrence and toxicity in drinking water hence halonaphthoquinones hnqs are selected as the target analytes in this study to test our hypothesis hnqs are highly probable to occur as dbps in drinking water typical nom such as humic acids contains an abundance of polycyclic structures schulten and schnitzer 1993 in addition some polycyclic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were widely detected in source water at the concentrations of 10 to 106 ng l mojiri et al 2019 xu et al 2018 naphthalene the dominant low molecular weight pah existed in different types of waters like lake water 50 25 6525 ng l drinking water 13 1 139 000 ng l and seawater 75 9 7800 ng l meng et al 2019 mojiri et al 2019 it was reported to undergo oxidation to form naphthoquinone which is likely to transform further to hnqs during chlorination kumagai et al 2012 the high molecular weight pahs such as pyrene and perylene can also react with chlorine and degrade to naphthalene wu et al 2019 indicating that most pahs may act as potential precursors of hnqs to determine whether hnqs are present in drinking water a sensitive analytical method is necessary despite the lack of a method designated for analyzing hnq dbps thus far the analytical method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones pahqs provides a constructive reference to this study gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms was commonly used to quantify pahqs in recent years due to its excellent sensitivity and good separation ability galmiche et al 2021 qiao et al 2014 toriba et al 2016 however due to the high polarity and low vapor pressure pahqs may decompose and lead to poor recovery and reproducibility during gc ms analysis cho et al 2004 toriba et al 2016 thus an additional derivatization step is usually required before gc ms analysis bandowe and wilcke 2010 eiguren fernandez et al 2008 to reduce the error prone sample pretreatment steps before instrumental analysis liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was successfully applied to analyze pahqs without derivatization delhomme et al 2008 which is considered as the candidate detection method for hnqs analysis hnqs are also recognized to be toxicologically important it is worth mentioning that there was a significant association between prostate cancer risk and exposure to the 2 3 dichloro naphthoquinone dcnq log kow 2 65 band et al 2011 also the polycyclic structure increases the octanol water partition coefficients of hnqs hence elevating the bioaccumulation and persistence properties of hnq dbps in organisms and the environment nowadays a toxicological database containing more than 100 quantitatively analyzed dbps has been developed based on in vitro cytotoxicity in chinese hamster ovary cho cell assay wagner and plewa 2017 therefore determining the cytotoxicity of hnqs in cho k1 cells and compare the cytotoxicity data with the database may act as a useful approach to assess the comparative toxicity and health risk of hnq dbps in drinking water to the best of our knowledge hnqs have not been reported as dbps in real drinking water thus the primary objectives of this study include 1 to establish a sensitive and accurate analytical method for the qualification and quantification of hnq dbps 2 to investigate the occurrence and concentration of hnqs in disinfected drinking water and 3 to determine the cytotoxicity of hnqs on cho k1 cells the results of this study will provide methodological reference and scientific basis to understand and evaluate the potential health risks of hnq dbps in drinking water which can be meaningful for probing deeper into varied halo polycyclic dbps and evaluate the significance of each species in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chlorinated brominated and iodinated hnqs were the chosen analytes in this study fig s1 the number and substitution position of halogens on hnqs were selected based on a preliminary prediction of the formation probability according to the frontier molecular orbital theory the higher the ehomo value of the atom the easier the atom to be attacked by electrophiles like x x represents cl br i karelson et al 1996 fig s2 showed the ehomo values for each carbon atom of nq and mcnq fig s2 indicating that the c2 and c3 positions of nqs labeled in red are the most probable sites prone for chlorine substitution to take place thus five hnqs were selected as the target analytes including 2 chloro 1 4 naphthoquinone mcnq 2 bromo 1 4 naphthoquinone mbnq 2 3 dichloro naphthoquinone dcnq 2 3 dibromo 1 4 naphthoquinone dbnq and 2 idodine naphthoquinone minq the details of chemicals and materials are listed in text s1 2 2 sample pretreatment there is limited information regarding the presence and concentration of hnqs in water based on the previous studies of cl pahs hnqs are highly suspected to present at ng l concentrations in drinking water qiao et al 2014 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2018 therefore a solid phase extraction spe method is necessary to pre concentrate these compounds from water prior to uplc ms ms analysis three types of spe cartridges were compared as candidate sorbents and the sample ph before spe and volume of the eluent were carefully optimized the optimization process and the optimized spe method were described in detail in text s2 the pretreatment method for the analysis of pahs in water samples is described in text s3 2 3 selection of quenching agents this experiment was performed according to a previous study gong et al 2016 and the experimental details is described in text s4 briefly four quenching agents including na2so3 na2s2o3 ascorbic acid and nh4cl were tested as the candidate quenching agents for hnq analysis after screening out a suitable quenching agent contact time was further tested to ensure that quenching agent will not affect hnqs under different contact time samples were prepared in triplicate and an independent t test was conducted for analyzing the statistical difference between groups 2 4 simulated chlorination two pahqs 1 4 naphthoquinone and 9 10 anthraquinone and four pahs naphthalene anthracene phenanthrene and benzoanthracene were chlorinated in this study the simulated water samples were prepared with ultrapure water containing 1 mg l of nabr as br and 200 Î¼g l of ki as i six potential precursors at a concentration of 0 007 mmol l were chlorinated by dosing 5 0 mg l naocl as cl2 0 07 mmol l under the experimental conditions of 20 c and ph 7 for 12 hours in darkness sufficient ascorbic acid was added at once to quench the residual chlorine the condition of chlorination and the composition of simulated water samples were similar to the real situation in water treatment plant hu et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 the formation of five hnqs in the chlorination of naphthalene under different temperatures and varied bromide and iodide concentrations were further investigated more details on the experimental conditions are summarized in table s2 and each set of samples were prepared in triplicate moreover one set of ultrapure water samples containing 0 007 mmol l mcnq were boiled after chlorination to evaluate the effect of boiling 2 5 collection of water samples source water influent before final chlorination and finished water were collected between october and november 2021 from seven water treatment plants wtps in zhejiang province china water samples were collected using 4 l amber glass bottles without headspace basic parameters and information of water samples are summarized in table s3 ascorbic acid of 0 070 mmol l was added to the finished water samples immediately after sample collection to quench residual chlorine another finished water sample was collected without the addition of ascorbic acid for studying the variation of concentration of hnqs in boiling water the samples were transported to the laboratory with ice packs and stored at 4 c prior to pretreatment the finished water samples without addition of ascorbic acid were boiled and filtered by 0 45 Î¼m membranes when the temperature returned to room temperature 2 6 instrumental analysis the separation and quantification of hnqs was performed using a waters ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc coupled with an ab sciex qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer the multiple reaction monitoring mrm method in negative mode was adopted to quantify and confirm the analytes based on matching retention times rts and peak areas of ion pairs a beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm i d 1 7 Î¼m waters ireland was used for chromatographic separation at a temperature of 40 c the mobile phase was composed of water solvent a and methanol solvent b the optimized gradient elution program and the ms parameters for hnqs were shown in text s5 the optimized compound dependent parameters for 5 hnqs are summarized in table s4 the quantification of pahs was performed using an agilent 7890b 5977b gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and the details are shown in text s3 br was quantified using ion chromatograph aquion thermo usa 2 7 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity of hnqs naphthoquinone nq 2 6 dichloro benzoquinone 2 6 dcbq and 1 chloronaphthalene 1 clnap was tested on cho k1 cells wagner and plewa 2017 in brief the cho k1 cells 3000 cells 100 Î¼l were incubated with each pollutant at known concentration in the 96 well plate at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 in order to obtain the ic50 the concentration at which the cell viability was inhibited to 50 of total cells of each analyte different concentration gradients were set up for each tested compound and each concentration had tested in three runs with 18 replicates in total 0 5 dmso v v was added to each test solution to improve the solubility of hnqs in f 12k culture medium negative control was consisted of f 12k medium containing 0 5 dmso which was simultaneously tested 10 Î¼l of cck 8 was added in each well after 72 h incubation and then the cells were cultured for another 1 hour the absorbance of each well at 450 nm wavelength was determined by a microplate reader infinite m200 pro tecan switzerland a one way analysis of variance anova tests was conducted to determine whether pollutants induced significant levels of cell death if a significant f value of p 0 05 was obtained a holm sidak multiple comparison was further performed with the power 1 Î² 0 8 at Î± 0 05 to determine the lowest cytotoxic concentrations based on the significance of the difference between the experiment groups and the negative control 2 8 quality assurance and data analysis the travel blank samples consisted of ultrapure water were simultaneously analyzed with field water samples an analysis blank sample composed of 70 methanol and 30 water was injected into the uplc ms ms instrument between every three samples an external standard calibration curve of mixed hnqs was established every time before sample analysis ascorbic acid was chlorinated to make sure no hnqs were produced by ascorbic acid the ic50 values of different pollutants were calculated and statistically analyzed using the graphpad prism 9 software the energy of both the highest unoccupied molecular orbital ehumo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital elumo was calculated using the mopac software enthalpy Î´h and gibbs free energy Î´g were computed using the gaussian software at the b3lyp 6 31g level the calculation of method detection limit mdl method quantification limit mql recovery matrix effects and t value are described in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of uplc ms ms method for five hnqs hnqs were observed to be difficult to be ionized under esi ionization mode and also be difficult to be fragment in ms ms analysis in our study fig s3 and similar phenomena was reported for pahqs due to their stable structures galmiche et al 2021 fortunately after a series of careful trials we find that hnqs in the mixed solvent of water and methanol can be ionized and fragmented in negative esi mode at high ionization temperature with the assistance of formic acid halobenzoquinones which possess similar structures with hnqs but having mono quinone ring were prone to be reduced to halohydroquinones and accept electron to form m h 2e huang et al 2013 the polycyclic structure makes hnqs relatively weaker electron acceptor with lower electron affinity compared with halobenzoquinones hence hnqs are inclined to accept one electron to form m rather than m h 2e almost no other product ions except halogen ion were observed in the ms ms spectra of hnqs on this basis m x x represents cl br i were chosen to be the ion pairs to quantify the five hnqs in mrm analysis and related optimizations were carried out to strengthen the sensitivity of hnqs analysis ion source temperature was reported to be a factor that significantly affects the mrm intensity of hbqs huang et al 2013 fig s4a showed that the mrm intensity of hnqs sharply increased when the source temperature rose and reached the highest when the source temperature increased to 700 c apart from ion source temperature the composition of mobile phase and sample solution including the types of organic solvents the ratio of organic solvent to water and the ratio of formic acid all affected the mrm intensities of hnqs with the increase of formic acid in the tested solution the intensities of hnqs first increased and then decreased with 0 25 formic acid being the optimal value fig s4b nonetheless the addition of formic acid in mobile phase decreased the ms intensities of the hnqs which may be due to that the addition of formic acid suppressed the ionization of hnqs in negative esi mode thus 0 25 formic acid was only included in the samples subjected to uplc ms ms to stabilize the hnqs but was not added into the mobile phases acetonitrile and methanol were tested as candidate organic mobile phase fig s4c presented the comparison of mobile phase ratio between acetonitrile water 70 30 and methanol water 70 30 towards the intensity of hnqs it is obvious that five hnqs had higher intensities in methanol water than in acetonitrile water in addition we also tested the influence of methanol ratio in water samples on the intensities of hnqs when the ratio of methanol increased up to 70 the signal reached the highest and remained nearly unchanged when the ratio increased further fig s4d based on the results above the ion source temperature to detect hnqs was set at 650 c considering the instrument stability methanol water ratio of 70 30 and 0 25 formic acid were chosen to be the optimal composition of the tested hnqs solution after optimizations the peak areas of multiple mrm transitions were measured using uplc esi ms ms and were normalized against the highest transition of individual hnqs fig s5 the retention time and standard curve of each hnq are also displayed in fig s5 3 2 optimization of pretreatment for five hnqs the pretreatment of water samples was optimized step by step to obtain satisfactory recoveries of hnqs three types of spe cartridges oasis hlb oasis max and oasis wax were first examined for their performance on enriching hnqs fig 1 a the recoveries of five tested hnqs using oasis hlb cartridges reached 82 5 99 2 which were much higher than using oasis max and oasis wax cartridges below 40 however after the application of optimized spe cartridge the recoveries dramatically declined to 17 8 62 3 when nitrogen evaporator was used to concentrate the analytes it is primarily due to the semi volatile property of hnqs to co evaporate easily with the solvent under nitrogen stream lau et al 2021 to solve this problem several instruments including vacuum centrifugal concentrator vcc and rotary evaporator were examined for concentration of samples the vcc showed acceptable recoveries 70 25 92 35 fig 1b which may be because vcc concentrated samples at low temperature and low pressure which largely reduced the evaporation of the analytes thereafter spe coupled with vcc was employed in the following optimization of the ph of water samples and the eluent volume the ph would affect the stability of the target compounds in aqueous solution thus selecting a suitable ph before pretreatment was necessary the ph of the water samples from 1 to 10 were evaluated fig 1c the recoveries of hnqs gradually increased with increasing ph from 1 to 5 then declined until ph 10 interestingly the recoveries of the five hnqs abruptly dropped to almost zero from ph 8 to 9 which indicated that degradation or transformation of hnqs occurred at basic condition the same phenomenon was observed on halobenzoquinones in the study by qin et al 2010 and wang et al speculated that the displacement of halogen by hydroxyl group caused the transformation of halobenzoquinone to hydroxyl halobenzoquinones in alkaline environment wang et al 2014 therefore the optimized ph of 5 was selected for hnqs analysis as illustrated in fig 1c methanol was used as eluent due to its good performance as the higher intensity of hnqs in ms than acetonitrile and the optimal volume of methanol was assessed higher recoveries of hnqs were achieved when the volume increased from 3 to 6 ml and remained nearly unchanged when the eluent volume increased to 9 ml fig 1d consequently 6 ml methanol was adequate to obtain satisfactory recoveries 70 for all the compounds finally an optimized spe vcc uplc ms ms analytical method for hnqs was developed and the mdl mql recovery and matrix effect were calculated based on the equations listed in text s6 the mdls for hnqs of this method ranged in 0 05 0 24 ng l while the mqls ranged in 0 18 0 75 ng l with the precisions of analytical method ranged in 2 9 7 6 the accuracy and stability of this method were evaluated at three different concentrations 1 10 and 100 ng l all of which achieved acceptable and stable recoveries in the range of 75 88 table 1 this new analytical method for hnqs was proved to be sensitive and accurate 3 3 selection of quenching agent the addition of a suitable quenching agent in water samples is necessary to quench residual chlorine and prevent further formation or decomposition of dbps four common quenching agents sodium sulfite sodium thiosulfate ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride were assessed for hnqs analysis in this study fig 2 and an independent t test was conducted to evaluate the significance of the difference between samples with or without quenching agent table s5 results showed that hnqs were undetectable in samples quenched by sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate while the concentrations of mcnq and dcnq in the samples quenched with ammonium chloride was remarkably higher than the non quenched samples it was indicated that sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate might cause the decomposition of hnqs whereas the addition of ammonium chloride might increase the intensity of cl nqs in the uplc ms ms analysis when sodium sulfite and sodium thiosulfate both the weakly alkaline quenching agents were added with the stoichiometric amounts equivalent to 5 mg l cl2 into the water the ph exceeded 9 leading to the decomposition of hnqs which was consistent with the results in fig 1c ascorbic acid did not show any significant effect on the concentrations of hnqs therefore it was chosen as an ideal quenching agent for hnqs analysis contact times 2 12 and 24 h between hnqs and ascorbic acid were examined and a set of non quenched samples were simultaneously prepared and tested for comparison fig s6 a t test indicated that there was no statistical differences among non quenched samples at 12 and 24 h contact time with that at 2 h table s6 indicating the hnqs were stable in water within 24 h similarly there was also no significant difference among quenched samples at varied contact time table s7 suggesting the hnqs were also stable in the presence of ascorbic acid in 24 h no significant difference between quenched and non quenched samples at a specific contact time according to the t test table s8 indicating that the addition of ascorbic acid will not interfere the existence and analysis of hnqs thus ascorbic acid is recognized as an ideal chlorine quencher for the analysis of hnqs in drinking water 3 4 formation of hnqs after chlorination of polycyclic aromatic compounds to explore the possibility of generating hnqs from pahqs during chlorination the gibbs free energy Î´g values of the reactions from naphthoquinone to 2 chloro 1 4 naphthoquinone and subsequently to 2 3 dichloro 1 4 naphthoquinone in the proposed pathway were calculated as shown in fig s7 the calculated Î´g values at 20 c were 108 09 and 98 85 kj mol 1 indicating that theoretically the proposed reaction was able to occur spontaneously based on this result naphthoquinone and its parent pah compound naphthalene were chlorinated fig 3 a and c in addition considering that ring cleavage would occur for high ring pahs during chlorination to form low ring pahs anthraquinone anthracene phenanthrene and benzoanthracene were chlorinated under the same condition fig 3b d e and f both the number of benzene rings and their concentration in real water were considered when choosing these compounds liu et al 2021 all three monohalogenated hnqs mono hnqs were detected in simulated chlorination samples except for benzoanthracene while the two di hnqs only can be detected in chlorinated samples of the two tested pahqs but not in those of the tested pahs for the two pahq precursors mbnq showed the highest production 3 09 nmol l in naphthoquinone and 0 21 nmol l in anthraquinone and the concentrations of minq dcnq and dbnq were generally much lower than mcnq and mbnq unlike chlorinated pahq samples mcnq showed the highest formation rather than mbnq in chlorinated pah samples anthracene produced more mono hnqs than its isomer phenanthrene the molar formation potential of six precursors to five hnqs were 2 7 10 3 naphthoquinone 2 6 10 4 anthraquinone 1 5 10 5 naphthalene 4 0 10 6 anthracene 3 0 10 6 phenanthrene and 2 0 10 6 benzoanthracene the much higher formation potentials of quinone compounds than those of pahs indicated that the quinone structure was the active unit to form hnqs in addition the molar formation of hnqs gradually decreased with the increase of benzene ring numbers of pah precursors the relatively lower yields of minq dcnq and dbnq suggested the difficult formation of these three hnqs in the real disinfected system while mcnq and mbnq may be the dominant hnq dbps to better examine the formation of hnqs under different conditions bromide concentration iodide concentration and temperature 0 007 mmol l naphthalene was chlorinated with 5 mg l naocl as cl2 at 20 c and ph 7 for 12 hours fig s8 meanwhile a set of control samples containing 0 007 mmol l naphthalene 5 mg l naocl as cl2 1 mg l of nabr as br and 200 Î¼g l of ki as i was prepared cks in fig s8 the formation of mbnq under different bromide concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l and without the addition of iodide is presented in fig s8a the concentration of mbnq increased slightly from 0 to 0 87 ng l when the bromide concentration increased from 0 to 2 mg l but dbnq was undetectable through comparing the sample of 1 mg l bromide with the control sample the decreased formation of mbnq with the presence of 0 2 mg l iodide might be due to the competition between hoi and hobr to react with the precursor han et al 2021b fig s8b showed the formation of minq under different iodide concentrations 0 50 100 200 and 500 Î¼g l and without the addition of bromide indicating the increase in minq concentrations from 0 to 9 81 ng l when the iodide concentration gradually raised from 0 to 500 Î¼g l which was similarly observed in the formation of 2 6 diiodobenzoquinone hu et al 2020 there is no significant difference between the sample of 200 Î¼g l iodide with the control samples indicating that the presence of bromide has little influence on the formation of minq the formation of hnqs at varied temperatures 20 30 and 40 c was also evaluated fig s8c when the temperature rose from 20 c to 40 c the concentrations of the three mono hnqs especially mcnq increased demonstrating that higher temperature increased the formation of hnqs nonetheless two di hnqs were still undetectable previous studies showed that boiling will affect the types and increase the concentrations of some certain dbps such as haloacetic acid and halophenols leuesque et al 2006 pan et al 2014 therefore the ultrapure water and the ultrapure water spiked with 0 007 mmol l mcnq were boiled after chlorinating for 12 h to test the concentration of hnqs and the result is shown in fig s8d the five hnqs were undetectable in ultrapure water before and after boiling indicating that there were no precursors of hnqs in the ultrapure water the concentration of mcnq decreased in the spiked samples while the concentration of dcnq increased from 5 42 to 18 76 ng l 0 024 to 0 082 nmol l after boiling the molar conversion efficiency was 0 8 implying that high temperature would promote the conversion from mcnq to dcnq 3 5 identification of hnqs in drinking water after the simulated chlorination in the laboratory real water samples collected from seven wtps were analyzed to determine the occurrence of hnqs in drinking water table s3 summarized the basic information of the water samples notably residual chlorine in the seven finished water samples were in the range of 0 48 1 01 mg l and br was detected in all the seven wtps ranging in 5 66 86 63 Î¼g l five hnqs including mcnq mbnq minq dcnq and dbnq were analyzed in drinking water and the existence of hnqs in water samples was confirmed if the ion pairs retention time and isotope abundance were identical with the chemical standards fig 4 shows the typical mrm chromatograms of five hnqs in the ultrapure water source water finished water and finished water after boiling hnqs were clearly detected in finished waters but non existent in both ultrapure and source water confirming that hnqs were new dbps formed during disinfection owing to the interference of matrix effect the error of retention time within 0 1 min was accepted in this study the standard addition method text s7 was applied to quantify the concentration of hnqs due to the lack of isotopically labeled standards wang et al 2013 fig 5 a presents that the concentrations of hnqs in drinking water ranged between nd 136 7 ng l table 2 which were at comparable level with other emerging dbps wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 three mono hnqs were identified at 100 occurrence frequency in which mcnq showed the highest concentration 136 7 8 3 ng l in contrast two di hnqs were detected in four and five finished water samples out of the seven water treatment plants meanwhile the concentrations of most di hnqs were below the method quantification limits indicating that di hnqs were hardly formed under the common disinfected environment which was consistent with the results in fig 3 taking into account the asian custom of drinking boiled water and the transformation of mcnq to dcnq after boiling in aforementioned laboratory experiment the concentrations of hnqs in boiled drinking water samples were subsequently revealed and are shown in fig 5b five hnqs were identified in boiled water at 100 occurrence frequency and the concentrations of di hnqs increased in all boiled drinking water samples further supporting that boiling promoted the formation of di hnqs in drinking water in addition the concentration of mono hnqs increased in some water samples as well implying that precursors existing in these drinking water samples further converted to hnqs during boiling pahs were confirmed to be the precursors of hnqs in simulated chlorination experiments fig 3 therefore the 16 priority pahs were monitored in the source water water before chlorination and water after chlorination collected from the seven wtps the total pahs concentration of source water water before chlorination and water after chlorination in seven wtps were 53 54 96 72 28 22 144 38 and 35 53 140 51 ng l respectively fig s9 for plants 1 3 the pahs were reduced after the water treatment while the pahs substantially increased during the water treatment processes in plants 4 7 what these four plants had in common was the involvement of biological pretreatment in water treatment processes a potential explanation to the increasing pahs is the desorption of pahs from microorganisms and devices in this study the concentrations of hnqs were much higher than those expected based on molar yields from pah precursors suggesting pahs were not the main precursors of hnqs in water samples 3 6 cytotoxicity of hnqs after understanding the occurrence and concentration of hnq dbps in drinking water the cytotoxicity of five hnq dbps 1 4 naphthoquinone nq 2 6 dichlorobenzoquinone 2 6 dcbq and monochloronaphthalene 1 clnap in cho k1 cells was examined the cytotoxicity concentration response curves of the five hnqs are presented in fig 6 and table s9 s11 present the statistical analysis of the cytotoxicity data five hnq dbps showed significantly high toxicity with mean ic50 values of 3 17 mcnq 6 23 mbnq 4 41 minq 13 78 dcnq and 4 27 Î¼m dbnq respectively table s9 by comparing the cytotoxic index cti values the statistical rank order from the most toxic compound was mcnq dbnq minq mbnq dcnq tables s9 and s12 where the hnqs separated by were significantly different while the one separated by was not compared to the higher toxicity of dbnq than dcnq mcnq demonstrated higher toxicity than both mbnq and minq which was uncommon compared with previous study li et al 2016 a preliminary speculation was that naphthoquinone as the main body of hnq structure was the main contributor to the toxicity of hnqs while the substitution of halogen only showed secondary impact to verify this hypothesis the cytotoxicity of nq on cho k1 cell was tested fig s10 and table s9 the ic50 values of nq was 1 08 Î¼m indicating that nq was more toxic compared to the five hnqs which proved the hypothesis we proposed the cytotoxicity of 1 clnap and 2 6 dcbq was simultaneously evaluated for comparison purpose figs s11 and s12 the 1 clnap was chosen to represent the cytotoxicity of naphthalene as the high volatility of naphthalene may lead to inaccurate cytotoxicity result while 2 6 dcbq was selected as it is a highly toxic dbp possessing similar structure with hnqs the cytotoxicity of hnqs was significantly higher than both 1 clnap ic50 276 67 Î¼m and 2 6 dcbq ic50 21 73 Î¼m table s9 and the statistical rank order from the most toxic compound was mcnq dbnq minq mbnq dcnq 2 6 dcbq 1 clnap having known the cytotoxicity of hnq dbps and their concentrations in real drinking water the individual toxic potency weighted concentrations of each hnq and the calculated additive toxicity cat index of hnqs in seven wtps were also computed table s13 the details are shown in text s8 briefly the highest cat values of five hnqs in seven wtps were 2 52 10 4 which was much higher than the cat values of four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 cat 8 42 10 6 lau et al 2020 indicating the significant health risk of hnq dbps in addition although the cytotoxicity of 1 4 naphthoquinone was higher than hnqs it was hardly detected in water samples nascimento et al 2019 wu et al 2019 and may transform to hnqs during chlorination in contrast mcnq which is the most abundant hnq in drinking water exhibits comparable cytotoxicity with the most toxic known carbonaceous dbp iodoacetic acid ic50 2 95 Î¼m in drinking water wagner and plewa 2017 indicating the significant risk and urgency of researching hnq dbps in drinking water 4 conclusions and implications in the current study a comprehensive analysis was conducted on hnq dbps five hnqs were identified as new dbps in drinking water by using a sensitive and accurate analytical method based on cytotoxicity assessment hnqs were more toxic than most of known dbps and the cytotoxicity of mcnq was comparable to the most toxic carbonaceous dbp iodoacetic acid therefore although hnqs were found only at ng l level in drinking water their consequential health threat should not be neglected polycyclic aromatic compounds such as pahs and pahqs were the precursors but not the only precursors of hnqs in the environment hence the potentials and mechanisms of forming hnqs during disinfection is undoubtedly a research topic worth to be further studied besides many other types of pahqs are present in the water environment yet an insightful investigation on the production of new halogenated pahq dbps during disinfection process is still limited the analytical finding of this study provided scientific support that carbonaceous dbps particularly halo polycyclic dbps still need to be closely monitored and their occurrence in drinking water should be prevented declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16049,opportunistic pathogens ops such as pseudomonas spp legionella spp and mycobacteria have been detected in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and water storage tanks and pose potential risks to finished drinking water quality and safety emerging uv technologies such as uv light emitting diodes leds and krypton chloride krcl excimers could provide an alternative to chemical based secondary disinfection i e chlorine or chloramines for controlling biofilm bound ops uv systems offer long lifetimes ability to select wavelength small size with high power density and limited to no disinfection by product formation in this study inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa cells across different maturities was investigated using five uvc devices with different peak emission wavelengths including a krcl excimer 222 nm a low pressure mercury vapor lamp 254 nm and three uv leds 260 nm 270 nm and 282 nm the uv transmittance and absorbance through the biofilm structure was also documented for the first time using a unique approach our results show all uvc devices can inactivate biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells up to a point among which the uv led with peak emission at 270 nm provided the best disinfection performance uv sensitivities of biofilm bound cells decreased with biofilm maturity and while initial rates of inactivation were high no more than 1 5 2 5 log reduction was possible re suspended biofilm bacteria in aqueous solution were highly sensitive to uv reaching greater than 6 log reduction uv shielding by biofilm constituents was observed and was likely one of the reasons for uv resistance but did not fully explain the difference in uv sensitivity between biofilm bound cells versus planktonic cells this study improves upon fundamental knowledge and provides guidance for innovative designs using emerging uv technologies for biofilm and pathogen control in water distribution systems graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords

water from the final step of the drinking water treatment plant before it reaches the consumer they can also provide a suitable environment for microbial activity hwang et al 2012 linden et al 2019 microbial communities in dwds reside in their planktonic form in the bulk water as well as in biofilms on surfaces of the distribution system over 90 of the microbes in dwds are found in the biofilm mathieu et al 2014 opportunistic pathogens ops such as pseudomonas spp legionella spp and mycobacteria have been detected in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and water storage tanks all over the world which pose potential risks to finished drinking water quality and safety water distribution system disinfection is often accomplished using chemical oxidants such as chorine and chloramines with a persistent residual that is intended to limit regrowth of bacteria while water travels from the treatment plant to the tap however chemical antimicrobial agents have limited efficacy in preventing biofilm development due to poor penetration and enhanced stress responses davies 2003 mah and o toole 2001 other potential issues of using chemical disinfectants include disinfection byproduct dbp formation corrosion products nutrient release and weak effectiveness against chorine resistant viruses protozoa and bacteria like mycobacteria an op commonly found in water distribution systems and tap water waak et al 2019 given the ability of germicidal ultraviolet uv light to inactivate all classes of microorganisms including viruses protozoa and bacteria uv based disinfection is recognized as a viable option in water treatment usepa 2006 mercury vapor low pressure lp uv lamps have been widely used in water treatment facilities as a primary disinfection method but not as secondary disinfectant because uv cannot provide any disinfection residual moreover the geometry of lp lamps is too large and complicated to install into a water distribution system to provide sufficient disinfection effectiveness during water travel time emerging uv devices like uv light emitting diodes leds and krypton chloride excimer krcl sources however could be ideal solutions for disinfection applications in piped networks and to help control biofilm bound ops in drinking water distribution systems based on their small footprint selectable emission wavelength high power density instantaneous powering on lack of hazardous mercury and limited to no dbps hull and linden 2018 lawal et al 2018 linden et al 2019 reckhow et al 2010 there are only a few reports in the literature investigating inactivation of biofilm bound bacteria cells using uvc devices in general biofilm bound cells are much more resistant to uvc irradiation than planktonic cells uv inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined using lp lamps and uv leds argyraki et al 2016 bae and lee 2012 bak et al 2010 gora et al 2019 and the inactivation efficiencies ranged from no reduction to 4 log inactivation with doses up to 7 8 mj cm2 with the discrepancy in reductions probably being due to differences in the experimental setup and or conditions uvc devices have also been used to disinfect mixed culture biofilms formed in diverse applications such as medical catheter and groundwater wells bak et al 2009 murray et al 2015 for which a 2 log inactivation required a uv dose of 1 4 103 mj cm2 and 3 106 mj cm2 respectively other previous studies also focused on the prevention of biofilm formation using uvc devices such as lakretz et al 2010 who investigated the reduction of biofilm formation potential of p aeruginosa solutions after exposure to uv irradiation spanning from 220 to 280 nm and found that irradiation between 254 to 270 nm was the most effective for preventing biofilm formation from planktonic cells in this study inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was investigated using uvc devices emitting at various germicidal wavelengths ranging from 222 nm to 282 nm to elucidate the effect of wavelength on inactivation of biofilm bound bacteria biofilms were developed over 1 3 and 5 days using bioreactors and the effect of biofilm maturity on uv susceptibility of the cells was evaluated uv absorption and transmittance across the biofilm structure were measured two regression models non linear and linear were adopted to characterize the uv dose response of the biofilm bound cells under different uvc irradiation wavelengths 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm development the method for p aeruginosa biofilm development was adopted from a usepa standard operating procedure sop mb 19 02 usepa 2013 in brief approximately 1010 early stationary phase p aeruginosa cells were inoculated to the cdc biofilm reactor cbr 90 biosurface technologies mt usa containing 400 ml deionized di water with 300 mg l tryptic soy broth tsb culture medium at day 0 fig s1 the bioreactor was operated in batch mode i e without medium feeding for 1 day at room temperature and continuously stirred at 100 rpm then the bioreactor was switched to continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mode in which a continuous flow of 100 mg l of sterile tsb culture medium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 4 0 ml min for up to another 4 days two different types of coupons were used polycarbonate coupons for undertaking a biofilm growth curve and determining uv dose response and quartz coupons corning 7980 corning ny usa for evaluating uv transmittance uvt and uv absorption spectrum across the biofilm structure all coupons are 12 7 mm in diameter area 1 27 cm2 the method for biofilm extraction from coupons was adopted from a procedure published by gora et al 2019 biofilm bound cells on coupons were extracted by swabbing the biofilm from the entire face of the coupon into 1ml phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 using a sterile cotton swab and then homogenized using a vortex mixer the viable cell number in biofilm extracts was determined using a standard plate count method expressed as colony forming unit cfu briefly serial 10 fold dilutions of samples in pbs were prepared and then different dilutions were plated on tsb agar plate i e 30 g l tsb and 15g l agar the plates were incubated in a 30 c incubator for at least 16 hrs until colony counting 2 2 measurements of uv transmittance and uv absorption spectrum of biofilm the transmittance of irradiation from a uvc device across biofilm developed on the quartz coupon was determined using the experimental setup described in fig 1 a including a uvc device a calibrated radiometer ilt 2400 international light technologies inc peabody ma usa and a 40mm 40mm 3mm quartz slide corning 7980 corning ny usa with all centers aligned five uvc devices were used in this investigation a krcl excimer lamp emitting primarily at 222 nm with a small band at 258 nm ushio il usa a conventional lp mercury vapor lamp emitting at 254 nm and three benchtop uv led systems with peak emission wavelengths of 260nm 270 nm and 282 nm aquisense technologies ky usa normalized emission spectra for these uv lamps fig 1 b were measured using a calibrated maya 2000 pro spectrometer ocean insight dunedin fl the quartz slide was covered by a 40mm 40mm uv blocking paper with 1 mm in diameter opening at the center fig 1 a top view to measure the uv penetration across biofilm structure the biofilm attached to the quartz coupon was placed on top of a quartz slide over the 1mm opening and the uv irradiance i across the biofilm quartz coupon and quartz slide was measured using a calibrated radiometer the value was then compared with the uv intensity reading i0 without biofilm by replacing the biofilm containing quartz coupon with a clean quartz coupon to calculate uvt across biofilm structure eq 1 for each biofilm the uvt was measured at three different locations i e center of the coupon 2 mm from the center and 4 mm from the center by moving the coupon on the quartz slide fig 1 a top view duplicate coupons were collected each day in a 5 day operation and the average uvt across locations for a biofilm was calculated 1 u v t i n i i 0 100 the absorption spectrum of p aeruginosa biofilm across 200 nm to 400 nm was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach company loveland co usa by placing the biofilm containing quartz coupon vertically in a customized coupon holder with the biofilm side facing the detector fig s2 duplicate coupons were collected for absorbance measurement each day in a 5 day operation and each coupon was rotated to take triplicate measurements to determine if there is any variation in biofilm absorbance across the coupon the uvt in at peak emission wavelengths of each uvc device was calculated using eq 2 2 u v t i n 100 10 a where a is the absorbance per biofilm at peak emission wavelengths of the uvc devices 2 3 uv exposure experiments uv inactivation efficiencies of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells on polycarbonate coupons and resuspended biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells were determined using a bench scale collimated beam apparatus fig 1 c and fig s3 according to a standard protocol by bolton and linden 2003 all uv exposures were performed in a dark room with red lights to minimize any photo repair of dna damage induced by uv irradiation bohrerova and linden 2006 for uv exposure of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells biofilm containing polycarbonate coupons were placed directly underneath a uvc device for uv exposure tests fig 1 c the uv incident irradiance at the center of the coupon was measured using a calibrated radiometer ilt 2400 international light technologies inc peabody ma usa set at the respective peak emission wavelength for each uvc device uv exposure time for each sample was calculated using the target uvc fluences at the center of the coupon for unweighted emissions between 200 nm to 400 nm according to a protocol by linden and darby 1997 and bolton and linden 2003 where the uvc fluence calculation included corrections for radiometer detector sensitivity across lamp emission spectra for uv exposure of resuspended biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells the resuspended cells were prepared by swabbing the biofilm from the coupon into 2 ml pbs using a sterile cotton swab and then homogenizing using a vortex mixer for 1 minute a higher volume of pbs was used for resuspension than biofilm bound cell extraction i e 1 ml pbs to ensure there was enough volume for uv exposure tests the resuspended cell solutions were placed in a 60 mm petri dish underneath a uvc device for uv exposure tests fig s3 absorbance for the samples was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach company loveland co usa the uv incident irradiance at the sample surface was measured using a calibrated radiometer and uv exposure time for each sample was calculated using the target average uvc fluences across the suspended cell solution for unweighted emissions between 200 nm to 400 nm according to the previously mentioned protocol by linden and darby 1997 and bolton and linden 2003 where the average uvc fluence calculation included corrections for radiometer detector sensitivity across lamp emission spectra sample absorbance from 200 nm to 400 nm and path length beers law divergence of light through the sample reflection factor and non uniformity of incident irradiance across the sample surface i e petri factor triplicate control samples no uv exposure were collected throughout a uv exposure experiment viable p aeruginosa cell numbers in control samples n0 and post uv samples n were determined using the method described above the log reduction value lrv of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was calculated using eq 3 3 l r v l o g 10 n 0 n 2 4 uv dose response models the uv dose response of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells using different uvc devices was evaluated using two models i a non linear model adopted from geeraerd

fraction of biofilm bound cells that are resistant to uvc irradiation the derivation of eq 4 from the original inactivation model is shown in the supplementary information si ii a linear model which divides the uv dose response into two regions fig 3 an inactivation region where the uv inactivation follows a pseudo first order inactivation kinetics model in log10 scale eq 5 1 and a plateau region

where lrvmodel is the lrv computed at a tested uv dose using eq 4 or eq 5 and n is the number of uv doses tested in one uv dose response 2 5 statistical analyses spearman s correlation was used to determine if there was a significant correlation between the biofilm bound cell concentration and the uvt across the biofilm paired t tests were used to determine if there was a significant difference

fitting the lrv and d using eq 4 the mean and se of k in eq 5 1 were calculated using the linear regression function in originpro 2021 with intercept fixed at zero 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofilm growth and measurement of biofilm uv transmittance the biofilm bound p aeruginosa cell concentrations increased to 108 1 0 2 cfu coupon on polycarbonate coupons over 5 day cdc biofilm reactor operation fig 2 a no significant difference in the viable bacteria concentrations was observed between polycarbonate coupons and quartz coupons p 0 57 paired t test fig s4 uvt and uv absorbance results suggested that p aeruginosa biofilms were uv absorptive but not completely opaque to uv transmission fig 2 likely by biofilm constituents including proteins exopolymers i e alginate and biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells elasri and miller 1999 setlow and doyle 1957 the uvt across the biofilm decreased over the bioreactor operation likely due to the cell growth increasing biofilm density and the production of related biofilm constituents the cell concentration was negatively correlated with uvt spearman s correlation p 0 05 fig 2 a this is further supported by the uv absorption spectra of the biofilm which the uv absorbance across 200 400 nm wavelengths increased over a 5 day operation fig 2 b eventually resembling the characteristic spectrum of dna absorption jagger 1985 among all tested uvc devices irradiation from krcl excimer exhibited the lowest penetration into the biofilm i e lowest uvt as only 5 0 1 6 of the irradiation passed through the biofilm collected on day 5 of the bioreactor operation fig 2 a relatively higher uvt values were observed for uv leds compared to lp uv but no statistically significant difference in uvt p 0 05 paired t test was observed between the lp uv and uv leds and among different uv leds the uv absorption spectrum measured from 200 400 nm suggests that p aeruginosa biofilms had the highest uv absorbance at far uvc wavelengths 200 230 nm with a smaller absorbance feature at 250 nm to 280 nm fig 2 b the uvt values calculated using eq 2 with the absorbance at the peak emission wavelengths of each uvc device was similar to the uvt measured using respective uvc devices as light sources fig s5 with the mean se ratio of measured to calculated uvt values of 0 98 0 04 suggesting both approaches can be used to determine biofilm uvt across wavelengths 3 2 uv dose response across uvc wavelengths the performance of all selected uvc devices was compared by inactivating biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells collected on day 3 of the bioreactor operation with an average concentration of 107 37 0 06 cfu coupon the uv dose response curve of the biofilm bound cells can be divided into two regions fig 3 an initial inactivation region where the lrv increased with the uv dose and a plateau or tailing region where lrvs reached a maximum value and kept relatively constant as uv dose increased among all tested uvc devices uv led 270 provided the best performance in the initial inactivation region fig 3 achieving an lrv of 2 1 0 3 within a uv dose of 10 mj cm2 this is similar to the results from a previous study by gora et al 2019 which lrvs of 1 4 to 2 0 were observed with a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 from a uv led with peak emission wavelength at 268 nm the previous study by bak et al 2010 however suggested a 4 log reduction of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells in a polymer tube filled with 20 nacl solution can be achieved with 7 8 mj cm2 of uv irradiation from a similar uv led this discrepancy in the uv dose response is likely due to the difference in the experimental setup and conditions which the uv irradiation may be reflected within the polymer tube and the high concentration of nacl may have killed or detached the biofilm bound cells as the authors suggested another study by bae and lee 2012 investigated the effectiveness of uv inactivation using lp uv for p aeruginosa and other foodborne pathogen biofilms on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces and observed no significant reduction of p aeruginosa biofilm bound cells with up to 2 hours of uv irradiation 1 700 mj cm2 however because of the differences in the biofilm development i e the biofilm was developed on agar plates then transferred onto surfaces the uv dose response results are not comparable to the present study bae and lee 2012 also highlighted the possible impact of the surface material on uv inactivation performance which needs further investigation the uv dose response of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was evaluated here using non linear eq 4 and linear eq 5 regression models both models showed good representation of the uv dose response with similar rmse values table s1 the uv led 270 had the highest rate constants 0 42 0 09 and 0 28 0 01 cm2 mj for k non linear model eq 4 and k linear model eq 5 respectively table 1 among all uvc devices which further supports its superior performance compared to other uvc devices in the initial inactivation region this is likely attributed to the high uvt fig 2 combined with the relatively high spectral sensitivity of nucleic acids at around 270 nm voet et al 1963 the superior uv inactivation performance at around 270 nm was also observed for planktonic p aeruginosa cells sholtes and linden 2019 the lowest inactivation rate constants were observed for the krcl excimer 0 035 0 006 and 0 043 0 006 cm2 mj for k and k respectively table 1 which is likely a result of the low biofilm uvt at 222 nm fig 2 unlike other uvc devices for which the initial inactivation region ended at uv doses of 10 35 mj cm2 the lrv using the krcl excimer kept increasing with uv dose up to 55 0 mj cm2 dt table 1 resulting in a maximum lrv of 2 37 0 59 table 1 similar maximum lrvs in the plateau region were also observed for uv led 270 and uv led 282 2 30 0 28 and 2 38 0 25 respectively which are much higher than those for lp uv 1 47 0 28 and uv led 260 1 86 0 20 note that proteins are generally more susceptible to uv irradiation at 230 nm and around 280 nm setlow and doyle 1957 therefore one hypothesis for improved inactivation in these wavelength ranges is that the uv induced protein damage can lead to increased inactivation i e higher lrvmax in table 1 which has been seen for viruses beck et al 2018 the biofilm bound cells are much more resistant to uv irradiation than planktonic cells in aqueous solution previous studies found that a 4 log reduction of planktonic p aeruginosa cells only required up to 8 mj cm2 of uvc irradiation from krcl excimer lp and various uv leds clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 biofilm bound cells may exhibit higher uv resistance because uv irradiation was absorbed blocked or reflected by the biofilm constituents where only 24 6 to 58 0 of the irradiation was able to transmit the entire biofilm structure day 3 in fig 2 a previous study by elasri and miller 1999 also observed similar protective property by physically shielding against uv irradiation in a simulated biofilm i e p aeruginosa cells in an alginate matrix the minimum uv doses across the biofilm were calculated by making a correction for uv shielding effects for instance for an incident irradiance of 1 mw cm2 and a uvt of the biofilm at 65 the dose calculation would use a corrected irradiance calculated 1 mw cm2 0 65 0 65 mw cm2 and then time of exposure in seconds would result in the minimum delivered uv dose the lrvs were also plotted against the minimum uv doses and compared to uv dose response of planktonic p aeruginosa cells reported by clauÃ 2006 and sholtes and linden 2019 fig s6 the lrvs for biofilm bound cells were still much lower than those for planktonic cells suggesting lower uv irradiance penetration was not solely responsible for the uv resistance of biofilm bound cells 3 3 uv dose response of biofilms with different maturities the effect of biofilm maturity i e biofilm age on uv dose response using krcl excimer and uv led 282 was evaluated by inactivating biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells collected on day 1 day 3 and day 5 of the bioreactor operation fig 4 and fig s7 in general more mature biofilm exhibited a greater uv resistance leading to a lower uv inactivation rate constant k for non linear model or k for linear model table 1 and a lower maximum lrv or higher fraction of uv resistant cells r or r in table 1 for krcl excimer the greatest reduction of the inactivation rate constant was observed from day 1 to day 3 where upon k dropped from 0 37 0 11 to 0 035 0 006 and k dropped from 0 31 0 04 to 0 043 0 006 the maximum lrvs however did not change significantly from day 1 to day 3 p 0 28 two sample t test but decreased from 2 37 0 59 to 0 88 0 08 from day 3 to day 5 this decrease in lrv was mainly attributed to the increasing uv absorption blocking as the biofilm matured with uvt decreasing from 82 4 8 7 to 5 0 1 6 from day 1 to day 5 fig 2 a compared to krcl excimer biofilm maturity had less impact on the uv dose response using uv led 282 with much less reduction 35 in both the inactivation rate constants and the maximum lrvs table 1 the uvt of the light from the uv led 282 also significantly decreased from day 1 to day 5 from 93 6 5 7 to 33 6 4 2 fig 2 a but did not end up as low as for 222 nm the variable relationship between the biofilm uvt and uv dose response further supported that uv shielding may not be the only uv protective mechanism that the biofilm can provide although the biofilms collected at day 1 were more susceptible to uv irradiation from both krcl excimer and uv led 282 compared to the biofilms with greater maturity they are still much more resistant to uv irradiation than planktonic p aeruginosa cells i e 4 log inactvaition with less than 8 mj cm2 uv irradiation clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 considering over 80 uv irradiation passed through day 1 biofilms fig 2 a a 10 mj cm2 i e 10 mj cm2 80 8 mj cm2 passed through the biofilm should be enough to achieve 4 log inactivation of biofilm bound cells which is much higher than the inactivation observed fig 4 one possible explanation is that there could be micro localized shadowing by microbial aggregates with the biofilm having water filled pore and channel structures that may allow some light to pass through quan et al 2021 zhang and bishop 1994 while other micro structures block a specific fraction of the cells from uv much like a mesh screen in addition to localized physical shielding that may not be represented by a bulk uvt assessment another potential resistance mechanism could be quorum sensing which regulates expression of various genes such as for biofilm formation in response to fluctuations in cell population density miller and bassler 2001 previous studies suggested quorum sensing in biofilms plays an important role in promoting the oxidative stress response and in dna repair garcÃ­a contreras et al 2015 lin et al 2016 3 4 uv resistance mechanisms of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells while it has been previously shown that the uv inactivation of planktonic p aeruginosa cells was rapid sholtes and linden 2019 the inactivation of resuspended biofilm grown cells has not been evaluated uv dose response of resuspended biofilm bound cells were evaluated using krcl excimer and uv led 282 fig 5 compared to the biofilm bound cells resuspended cells are much more susceptible to uv irradiation and the uv dose responses are similar to the results for planktonic cells in aqueous solution from previous studies clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 this result suggests that the uv resistance is not within the cells themselves but that maintaining the biofilm structure is an essential mechanism for resisting uv inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells this also indicates that combining physical disruption of biofilm structure e g water jet with high velocity or turbulent flush and uvc irradiation could result in a higher inactivation effectiveness for biofilm bound cells 4 conclusions emerging uvc technologies such as uv leds and krcl excimers can achieve high levels of disinfection of planktonic and biofilm bound bacterial cells suggesting that they have the potential to serve as a control strategy for reducing biofilm development in water distribution systems for the first time the uv absorption characteristics of biofilms at different levels of maturity were measured illustrating the variation in penetration of uv light across a range of uv devices and wavelengths interestingly while uv can penetrate through biofilms this does not result in achieving the maximum theoretical level of biofilm inactivation suggesting some other physical or biological mechanism of bacterial resistance to uv disinfection while biofilm bound uvc exposures should be applied to early stage biofilms for better biofilm control because during growth biofilms tend to become more resistant to uvc irradiation and they become highly uv absorbing continuous or sequential uv exposures may be required for long term suppression of biofilm formation in water distribution systems

16049,opportunistic pathogens ops such as pseudomonas spp legionella spp and mycobacteria have been detected in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and water storage tanks and pose potential risks to finished drinking water quality and safety emerging uv technologies such as uv light emitting diodes leds and krypton chloride krcl excimers could provide an alternative to chemical

to no disinfection by product formation in this study inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa cells across different maturities was investigated using five uvc devices with different peak emission wavelengths including a krcl excimer 222 nm a low pressure mercury vapor lamp 254 nm and three uv leds 260 nm 270 nm and 282 nm the uv transmittance and absorbance through the biofilm structure was also documented for the first time using a unique approach our results show all uvc devices can inactivate biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells up to a point among which the uv led with peak emission at 270 nm provided the best disinfection performance uv sensitivities of biofilm bound cells decreased with biofilm maturity and while initial rates of inactivation were high no more than 1 5 2 5 log reduction was possible re suspended biofilm bacteria in aqueous solution were highly sensitive to uv reaching greater than 6 log reduction uv shielding by biofilm constituents was observed and was likely one of the reasons for uv resistance but did not fully explain the difference in uv sensitivity between biofilm bound cells versus planktonic cells this study improves upon fundamental

microbial communities in dwds reside in their planktonic form in the bulk water as well as in biofilms on surfaces of the distribution system over 90 of the microbes in dwds are found in the biofilm mathieu et al 2014 opportunistic pathogens ops such as pseudomonas spp legionella spp and mycobacteria have been detected in biofilms in drinking water distribution systems and water storage tanks all over the world which pose potential risks to finished drinking water quality and safety water distribution system disinfection is often accomplished using chemical oxidants such as chorine and chloramines with a persistent residual that is intended to limit regrowth of bacteria while water travels from the treatment plant to the tap however chemical antimicrobial agents have limited efficacy in preventing biofilm development due to poor penetration and enhanced stress responses davies 2003 mah and o toole 2001 other potential issues of using chemical disinfectants include disinfection byproduct dbp formation corrosion products nutrient release and weak effectiveness against chorine resistant viruses protozoa and bacteria like mycobacteria an op commonly found in water

disinfection is recognized as a viable option in water treatment usepa 2006 mercury vapor low pressure lp uv lamps have been widely used in water treatment facilities as a primary disinfection method but not as secondary disinfectant because uv cannot provide any disinfection residual moreover the geometry of lp lamps is too large and complicated to install into a water distribution system to

literature investigating inactivation of biofilm bound bacteria cells using uvc devices in general biofilm bound cells are much more resistant to uvc irradiation than planktonic cells uv inactivation of biofilm bound pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined using lp lamps and uv leds argyraki et al 2016 bae and lee 2012 bak et al 2010 gora et al 2019 and the inactivation efficiencies ranged from no reduction to 4 log inactivation with doses up to 7 8 mj cm2 with the discrepancy in reductions probably being due to differences in the experimental setup and or conditions uvc devices have also been used to disinfect mixed culture biofilms formed in diverse applications such as medical catheter and groundwater wells bak et al 2009 murray et al 2015 for which a 2 log inactivation required a uv dose of 1 4 103 mj cm2 and 3 106 mj cm2 respectively other previous studies also focused on the prevention of biofilm formation using uvc devices such as lakretz et al 2010 who investigated the reduction of biofilm formation potential of p aeruginosa solutions after exposure to uv irradiation spanning from 220 to 280 nm and found that irradiation between 254 to 270 nm was the most effective for preventing biofilm formation from planktonic cells in this study inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was investigated using uvc devices emitting at various germicidal wavelengths ranging from 222 nm to 282 nm to elucidate the effect of wavelength on inactivation of biofilm bound bacteria biofilms were developed over 1 3 and 5 days using bioreactors and the effect of biofilm maturity on uv susceptibility of the cells was evaluated uv absorption and transmittance across the biofilm structure were measured two regression models non linear and linear were adopted to characterize the uv dose response of the biofilm bound cells under different uvc irradiation wavelengths 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm development the method for p aeruginosa biofilm development was adopted from a usepa standard operating procedure sop mb 19 02 usepa 2013 in brief approximately 1010 early stationary phase p aeruginosa cells were inoculated to the cdc biofilm reactor cbr 90 biosurface technologies mt usa containing 400 ml deionized di water with 300 mg l tryptic soy broth tsb culture medium at day 0 fig s1 the bioreactor was operated in batch mode i e without medium feeding for 1 day at room temperature and continuously stirred at 100 rpm then the bioreactor was switched to continuous stirred tank reactor cstr mode in which a continuous flow of 100 mg l of sterile tsb culture medium was pumped through the reactor at a rate of 4 0 ml min for up to another 4 days two different types of coupons were used polycarbonate coupons for undertaking a biofilm growth curve and determining uv dose response and quartz coupons corning 7980 corning ny usa for evaluating uv transmittance uvt and uv absorption spectrum across the biofilm structure all coupons are 12 7 mm in diameter area 1 27 cm2 the method for biofilm extraction from coupons was adopted from a procedure published by gora et al 2019 biofilm bound cells on coupons were extracted by swabbing the biofilm from the entire face of the coupon into 1ml phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 using a sterile cotton swab and then homogenized using a vortex mixer the viable cell number in biofilm extracts was determined using a standard plate count method expressed as colony forming unit cfu briefly serial 10 fold dilutions of samples in pbs were prepared and then different dilutions were plated on tsb agar plate i e 30 g l tsb and 15g l agar the plates were incubated in a 30 c incubator for at least 16 hrs until colony counting 2 2 measurements of uv transmittance and uv absorption spectrum of biofilm the transmittance of irradiation from a uvc device across biofilm developed on the quartz coupon was determined using the experimental setup described in fig 1 a including a uvc device a calibrated radiometer ilt 2400 international light technologies inc peabody ma usa and a 40mm 40mm 3mm quartz slide corning 7980 corning ny usa with all centers aligned five uvc devices were used in this investigation a krcl excimer lamp emitting primarily at 222 nm with a small band at 258 nm ushio il usa a conventional lp mercury vapor lamp emitting at 254 nm and three benchtop uv led systems with peak emission wavelengths of 260nm 270 nm and 282 nm aquisense technologies ky usa normalized emission spectra for these uv lamps fig 1 b were measured using a calibrated maya 2000 pro spectrometer ocean insight dunedin fl the quartz slide was covered by a 40mm 40mm uv blocking paper with 1 mm in diameter opening at the center fig 1 a top view to measure the uv penetration across biofilm structure the biofilm attached to the quartz coupon was placed on top of a quartz slide over the 1mm opening and the uv irradiance i across the biofilm quartz coupon and quartz slide was measured using a calibrated radiometer the value was then compared with the uv intensity reading i0 without biofilm by replacing the biofilm containing quartz coupon with a clean quartz coupon to calculate uvt across biofilm structure eq 1 for each biofilm the uvt was measured at three different locations i e center of the coupon 2 mm from the center and 4 mm from the center by moving the coupon on the quartz slide fig 1 a top view duplicate coupons were collected each day in a 5 day operation and the average uvt across locations for a biofilm was calculated 1 u v t i n i i 0 100 the absorption spectrum of p aeruginosa biofilm across 200 nm to 400 nm was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach company loveland co usa by placing the biofilm containing quartz coupon vertically in a customized coupon holder with the biofilm side facing the detector fig s2 duplicate coupons were collected for absorbance measurement each day in a 5 day operation and each coupon was rotated to take triplicate measurements to determine if there is any variation in biofilm absorbance across the coupon the uvt in at peak emission wavelengths of each uvc device was calculated using eq 2 2 u v t i n 100 10 a where a is the absorbance per biofilm at peak emission wavelengths of the uvc devices 2 3 uv exposure experiments uv inactivation efficiencies of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells on polycarbonate coupons and resuspended biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells were determined using a bench scale collimated beam apparatus fig 1 c and fig s3 according to a standard protocol by bolton and linden 2003 all uv exposures were performed in a dark room with red lights to minimize any photo repair of dna damage induced by uv irradiation bohrerova and linden 2006 for uv exposure of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells biofilm containing polycarbonate coupons were placed directly underneath a uvc device for uv exposure tests fig 1 c the uv incident irradiance at the center of the coupon was measured using a calibrated radiometer ilt 2400 international light technologies inc peabody ma usa set at the respective peak emission wavelength for each uvc device uv exposure time for each sample was calculated using the target uvc fluences at the center of the coupon for unweighted emissions between 200 nm to 400 nm according to a protocol by linden and darby 1997 and bolton and linden 2003 where the uvc fluence calculation included corrections for radiometer detector sensitivity across lamp emission spectra for uv exposure of resuspended biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells the resuspended cells were prepared by swabbing the biofilm from the coupon into 2 ml pbs using a sterile cotton swab and then homogenizing using a vortex mixer for 1 minute a higher volume of pbs was used for resuspension than biofilm bound cell extraction i e 1 ml pbs to ensure there was enough volume for uv exposure tests the resuspended cell solutions were placed in a 60 mm petri dish underneath a uvc device for uv exposure tests fig s3 absorbance for the samples was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach company loveland co usa the uv incident irradiance at the sample surface was measured using a calibrated radiometer and uv exposure time for each sample was calculated using the target average uvc fluences across the suspended cell solution for unweighted emissions between 200 nm to 400 nm according to the previously mentioned protocol by linden and darby 1997 and bolton and linden 2003 where the average uvc fluence calculation included corrections for radiometer detector sensitivity across lamp emission spectra sample absorbance from 200 nm to 400 nm and path length beers law divergence of light through the sample reflection factor and non uniformity of incident irradiance across the sample surface i e petri factor triplicate control samples no uv exposure were collected throughout a uv exposure experiment viable p aeruginosa cell numbers in control samples n0 and post uv samples n were determined using the method described above the log reduction value lrv of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was calculated using eq 3 3 l r v l

growth and measurement of biofilm uv transmittance the biofilm bound p aeruginosa cell concentrations increased to 108 1 0 2 cfu coupon on polycarbonate coupons over 5 day cdc biofilm reactor operation fig 2 a no significant difference in the viable bacteria concentrations was observed between polycarbonate coupons and quartz coupons p 0 57 paired t test fig s4 uvt and uv absorbance results suggested that p aeruginosa biofilms were uv absorptive but not completely opaque to uv transmission fig 2 likely by biofilm constituents including proteins exopolymers i e alginate and biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells elasri and miller 1999 setlow and doyle 1957 the uvt across the biofilm decreased over the bioreactor operation likely due to the cell growth increasing biofilm density and the production of related biofilm constituents the cell concentration was negatively correlated with uvt spearman s correlation p 0 05 fig 2 a this is further supported by the uv absorption spectra of the biofilm which the uv absorbance across 200 400 nm wavelengths increased over a 5 day operation fig 2 b eventually resembling the characteristic spectrum of dna absorption jagger 1985 among all tested uvc devices irradiation from krcl excimer exhibited the lowest penetration into the biofilm i e lowest uvt as only 5 0 1 6 of the irradiation passed through the biofilm collected on day 5 of the bioreactor operation fig 2 a relatively higher uvt values were observed for uv leds compared to lp uv but no statistically significant difference in uvt p 0 05 paired t test was observed between the lp uv and uv leds and among different uv leds the uv absorption spectrum measured from 200 400 nm suggests that p aeruginosa biofilms had the highest uv absorbance at far uvc wavelengths 200 230 nm with a smaller absorbance feature at 250 nm to 280 nm fig 2 b the uvt values calculated using eq 2 with the absorbance at the peak emission wavelengths of each uvc device was similar to the uvt measured using respective uvc devices as light sources fig s5 with the mean se ratio of measured to calculated uvt values of 0 98 0 04 suggesting both approaches can be used to determine biofilm uvt across wavelengths 3 2 uv dose response across uvc wavelengths the performance of all selected uvc devices was compared by inactivating biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells collected on day 3 of the bioreactor operation with an average concentration of 107 37 0 06 cfu coupon the uv dose response curve of the biofilm bound cells can be divided into two regions fig 3 an initial inactivation region where the lrv increased with the uv dose and a plateau or tailing region where lrvs reached a maximum value and kept relatively constant as uv dose increased among all tested uvc devices uv led 270 provided the best performance in the initial inactivation region fig 3 achieving an lrv of 2 1 0 3 within a uv dose of 10 mj cm2 this is similar to the results from a previous study by gora et al 2019 which lrvs of 1 4 to 2 0 were observed with a uv dose of 8 1 mj cm2 from a uv led with peak emission wavelength at 268 nm the previous study by bak et al 2010 however suggested a 4 log reduction of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells in a polymer tube filled with 20 nacl solution can be achieved with 7 8 mj cm2 of uv irradiation from a similar uv led this discrepancy in the uv dose response is likely due to the difference in the experimental setup and conditions which the uv irradiation may be reflected within the polymer tube and the high concentration of nacl may have killed or detached the biofilm bound cells as the authors suggested another study by bae and lee 2012 investigated the effectiveness of uv inactivation using lp uv for p aeruginosa and other foodborne pathogen biofilms on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces and observed no significant reduction of p aeruginosa biofilm bound cells with up to 2 hours of uv irradiation 1 700 mj cm2 however because of the differences in the biofilm development i e the biofilm was developed on agar plates then transferred onto surfaces the uv dose response results are not comparable to the present study bae and lee 2012 also highlighted the possible impact of the surface material on uv inactivation performance which needs further investigation the uv dose response of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells was evaluated here using non linear eq 4 and linear eq 5 regression models both models showed good representation of the uv dose response with similar rmse values table s1 the uv led 270 had the highest rate constants 0 42 0 09 and 0 28 0 01 cm2 mj for k non linear model eq 4 and k linear model eq 5 respectively table 1 among all uvc devices which further supports its superior performance compared to other uvc devices in the initial inactivation region this is likely attributed to the high uvt fig 2 combined with the relatively high spectral sensitivity of nucleic acids at around 270 nm voet et al 1963 the superior uv inactivation performance at around 270 nm was also observed for planktonic p aeruginosa cells sholtes and linden 2019 the lowest inactivation rate constants were observed for the krcl excimer 0 035 0 006 and 0 043 0 006 cm2 mj for k and k respectively table 1 which is likely a result of the low biofilm uvt at 222 nm fig 2 unlike other uvc devices for which the initial inactivation region ended at uv doses of 10 35 mj cm2 the lrv using the krcl excimer kept increasing with uv dose up to 55 0 mj cm2 dt table 1 resulting in a maximum lrv of 2 37 0 59 table 1 similar maximum lrvs in the plateau region were also observed for uv led 270 and uv led 282 2 30 0 28 and 2 38 0 25 respectively which are much higher than those for lp uv 1 47 0 28 and uv led 260 1 86 0 20 note that proteins are generally more susceptible to uv irradiation at 230 nm and around 280 nm setlow and doyle 1957 therefore one hypothesis for improved inactivation in these wavelength ranges is that the uv induced protein damage can lead to increased inactivation i e higher lrvmax in table 1 which has been seen for viruses beck et al 2018 the biofilm bound cells are much more resistant to uv irradiation than planktonic cells in aqueous solution previous studies found that a 4 log reduction of planktonic p aeruginosa cells only required up to 8 mj cm2 of uvc irradiation from krcl excimer lp and various uv leds clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 biofilm bound cells may exhibit higher uv resistance because uv irradiation was absorbed blocked or reflected by the biofilm constituents where only 24 6 to 58 0 of the irradiation was able to transmit the entire biofilm structure day 3 in fig 2 a previous study by elasri and miller 1999 also observed similar protective property by physically shielding against uv irradiation in a simulated biofilm i e p aeruginosa cells in an alginate matrix the minimum uv doses across the biofilm were calculated by making a correction for uv shielding effects for instance for an incident irradiance of 1 mw cm2 and a uvt of the biofilm at 65 the dose calculation would use a corrected irradiance calculated 1 mw cm2 0 65 0 65 mw cm2 and then time of exposure in seconds would result in the minimum delivered uv dose the lrvs were also plotted against the minimum uv doses and compared to uv dose response of planktonic p aeruginosa cells reported by clauÃ 2006 and sholtes and linden 2019 fig s6 the lrvs for biofilm bound cells were still much lower than those for planktonic cells suggesting lower uv irradiance penetration was not solely responsible for the uv resistance of biofilm bound cells 3 3 uv dose response of biofilms with different maturities the effect of biofilm maturity i e biofilm age on uv dose response using krcl excimer and uv led 282 was evaluated by inactivating biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells collected on day 1 day 3 and day 5 of the bioreactor operation fig 4 and fig s7 in general more mature biofilm exhibited a greater uv resistance leading to a lower uv inactivation rate constant k for non linear model or k for linear model table 1 and a lower maximum lrv or higher fraction of uv resistant cells r or r in table 1 for krcl excimer the greatest reduction of the inactivation rate constant was observed from day 1 to day 3 where upon k dropped from 0 37 0 11 to 0 035 0 006 and k dropped from 0 31 0 04 to 0 043 0 006 the maximum lrvs however did not change significantly from day 1 to day 3 p 0 28 two sample t test but decreased from 2 37 0 59 to 0 88 0 08 from day 3 to day 5 this decrease in lrv was mainly attributed to the increasing uv absorption blocking as the biofilm matured with uvt decreasing from 82 4 8 7 to 5 0 1 6 from day 1 to day 5 fig 2 a compared to krcl excimer biofilm maturity had less impact on the uv dose response using uv led 282 with much less reduction 35 in both the inactivation rate constants and the maximum lrvs table 1 the uvt of the light from the uv led 282 also significantly decreased from day 1 to day 5 from 93 6 5 7 to 33 6 4 2 fig 2 a but did not end up as low as for 222 nm the variable relationship between the biofilm uvt and uv dose response further supported that uv shielding may not be the only uv protective mechanism that the biofilm can provide although the biofilms collected at day 1 were more susceptible to uv irradiation from both krcl excimer and uv led 282 compared to the biofilms with greater maturity they are still much more resistant to uv irradiation than planktonic p aeruginosa cells i e 4 log inactvaition with less than 8 mj cm2 uv irradiation clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 considering over 80 uv irradiation passed through day 1 biofilms fig 2 a a 10 mj cm2 i e 10 mj cm2 80 8 mj cm2 passed through the biofilm should be enough to achieve 4 log inactivation of biofilm bound cells which is much higher than the inactivation observed fig 4 one possible explanation is that there could be micro localized shadowing by microbial aggregates with the biofilm having water filled pore and channel structures that may allow some light to pass through quan et al 2021 zhang and bishop 1994 while other micro structures block a specific fraction of the cells from uv much like a mesh screen in addition to localized physical shielding that may not be represented by a bulk uvt assessment another potential resistance mechanism could be quorum sensing which regulates expression of various genes such as for biofilm formation in response to fluctuations in cell population density miller and bassler 2001 previous studies suggested quorum sensing in biofilms plays an important role in promoting the oxidative stress response and in dna repair garcÃ­a contreras et al 2015 lin et al 2016 3 4 uv resistance mechanisms of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells while it has been previously shown that the uv inactivation of planktonic p aeruginosa cells was rapid sholtes and linden 2019 the inactivation of resuspended biofilm grown cells has not been evaluated uv dose response of resuspended biofilm bound cells were evaluated using krcl excimer and uv led 282 fig 5 compared to the biofilm bound cells resuspended cells are much more susceptible to uv irradiation and the uv dose responses are similar to the results for planktonic cells in aqueous solution from previous studies clauÃ 2006 sholtes and linden 2019 this result suggests that the uv resistance is not within the cells themselves but that maintaining the biofilm structure is an essential mechanism for resisting uv inactivation of biofilm bound p aeruginosa cells this also indicates that combining physical disruption of biofilm structure e g water jet with high velocity or turbulent flush and uvc irradiation could result in a higher inactivation effectiveness for biofilm bound cells 4 conclusions emerging uvc technologies such as uv leds and krcl excimers can achieve high levels of disinfection of planktonic and biofilm bound bacterial cells suggesting that they have the potential to serve as a control strategy for reducing biofilm development in water distribution systems for the first time the uv absorption characteristics of biofilms at different levels of maturity were measured illustrating the variation in penetration of uv light across a range of uv devices and wavelengths interestingly while uv can penetrate through biofilms this does not result in achieving the maximum theoretical level of biofilm inactivation suggesting some other physical or biological mechanism of bacterial resistance to uv disinfection while biofilm bound uvc exposures should be applied to early stage biofilms for better biofilm control because during growth biofilms tend to become more resistant to uvc irradiation and they become highly uv absorbing continuous or sequential uv exposures may be required for long term suppression of biofilm formation in water distribution systems
