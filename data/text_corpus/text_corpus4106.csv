mainly caused by various marine power system and equipment excitation propeller excitation and wave excitation during the operation of marine power system and equipment mechanical parts will generate large power and broadband excitation sources these excitation sources will transmit vibration in the form of elastic waves through hull plate to cause structural vibration and noise radiation in addition in the vibration transmission process of hull plate elastic waves are mainly manifested as flexural wave longitudinal wave and torsion wave the longitudinal wave and torsion wave are both high impedance waves with high wave number and they can hardly interact with sound waves while the flexural wave is low impedance wave and can interact with sound waves therefore the suppression of

paid to explore the engineering application of elastic metamaterials in the vibration and noise reduction of ship and offshore structures li et al 2019 studied the flexural wave band gaps and vibration attenuation characteristics of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates the flexural wave band gap of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates is mainly concentrated in medium and high frequency which is difficult to solve the low frequency ship vibration isolation ruan et al 2021 designed and analyzed a single phase spiral shaped local resonant phononic crystal for the sake of vertical vibration excitation isolation of a certain type of ship this work is an active exploration of phononic crystals into the field of ship vibration and noise

responses were conducted to validate the accuracy and reliability of the numerical calculation method in addition the influences of geometrical parameters on the flexural wave band gap are studied finally the potential application of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure in the vibration control of marine power system is explored 2 physics model and calculation method 2 1 sandwich plate type elastic metastructures in this paper the representative marine power system is considered and installed on the foundation and hull grillage as shown in fig 1 a the hull grillage is composed of the tank top and the longitudinal frames as well as the reverse frames as shown in fig 1 b the geometrical parameter of the hull grillage is illustrated in table 1 the longitudinal frame space is 250 mm and the transverse frame space is 300 mm according to the principle of similarity theory the equivalent design of grid sandwich plate structure is carried out combination with the parameter equivalence such as the neutral axis height section area and section modulus of the scale down hull grillage the bending strength and stiffness of the equivalent sandwich plate is higher than those of the hull grillage which demonstrates that the equivalent sandwich plate can guarantee the structural mechanical property requirements in order to simultaneously realize the low frequency vibration isolation performance of marine power system a sandwich plate type elastic metastructure is designed based on the locally resonant metamaterial theory the sandwich plate type elastic metastructure considered here is constituted of the equivalent sandwich plate and periodically attached local resonators along x direction and y direction as shown in fig 1 c the z axis is perpendicular to the sandwich plate and parallel to the periodic stubs axis fig 1 b shows the schematic diagram of unit cell of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure in the unit cell the geometrical parameters of the considered metastructures are defined as follows the lattice constant of the sandwich plate type metastructures respectively are defined as a the plate thickness the web thickness and height are denoted by e b and h respectively the side length of the rubber block and the steel stub is d and the height of the rubber block and the steel stub are h 1 and h 2 respectively 2 2 calculation method in order to investigate the flexural wave propagation and vibration isolation characteristics of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the dispersion relations and the transmission power spectra of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures are calculated by using an efficient finite element method combination with solid shell multi physics coupling model and bloch theory via the comsol multiphysics 5 4 the local stepped resonators are built as solid structures by using the lagrange quadratic element type in the solid stress strain application mode for the elastic wave propagation in solid structures the wave equations can be written as 1 j 1 3 x i λ u j x j x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ 2 u i t 2 i j x y z where ρ is the mass density u and v denote the displacement vector t is the time λ and μ are the lame constants x y and z represent the coordinate variables in cartesian coordinates system respectively besides the equivalent grid sandwich plate is established as shell structures in the shell application mode the thicknesses as well as the material properties of the shell structures should been further defined the shell element type is defined as the mitc type which can be used for analyzing both thin kirchhoff theory and thick mindlin theory shells this mitc type shell theory is developed from the mindin reissner shell theory the mindin reissner shell theory improves the assumption of the straight normal line in the kirchhoff shell theory taking into account the transverse shear deformation and moment of inertia of the plate the flexural wave equation of the plate in the mindlin reissner shell theory can be written as follows 2 ρ h 2 w t 2 2 x 2 d 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 2 2 x y d 2 w x y 2 t 2 x κ ρ g ρ j w x y κ ρ g ρ j w y κ ρ g j 4 w t 4 where w is the transverse deflection h is the thickness of the plate d denotes flexural rigidity g is the modulus of rigidity κ is the shear correction factors and j represents moment of inertia 3 g e 2 1 υ κ 20 1 υ 24 25 υ υ 2 j h 3 12 in an attempt to calculate the dispersion relations and displacement fields of the eigenmodes only one representative unit cell of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures need to be considered due to spatial symmetry and translational periodicity according to energy band theory and solid lattice theory stress free boundary conditions are defined for free surfaces in the z direction while periodic boundary conditions are applied at the boundaries with the bloch theorem as follows 4 u i x a y a u i x y e j k x a k y a i x y where x and y are the coordinate components of position vector k x k y are the coordinate components of the bloch wave vector in the first brillouin zone the band structures and the eigenmodes can be obtained by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the wavevectors in this analysis the displacement is assumed to be a time harmonic of angular frequency ω according to the finite element principle the elastic wave dynamic formulation of the typical element can be transformed into the standard generalized eigenvalue formulation with discrete significance 5 k ω 2 m u 0 where k m and u represent the stiffness matrix mass matrix and eigenvector matrix respectively to calculate the transmission spectra of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the finite array system formed by 4 unit cells along the x direction and 2 unit cells along the y direction is considered as shown in fig 2 c the sine sweep acceleration excitation resource a in is imposed on one end of the sandwich plates the flexural vibration direction of the excitation resource is along the z direction and the flexural wave propagates along the y direction the transmitted acceleration response a out is detected on the other end of the sandwich plates the transmission spectra t is defined as 6 t 20 log a o u t a i n 3 results and discussion 3 1 dispersion relation and transmission spectra to study the flexural wave propagation and band gap characteristics of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the dispersion relation is obtained as shown in fig 2 a the horizontal axis represents the reduced wave vector along the boundary of the irreducible brillouin zone and the vertical axis is the wave frequency in the calculation the equivalent sandwich plate and the steel stubs are defined as steel while the rubber blocks are defined as rubber geometric parameters and material parameters are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively it can be found from fig 2 a that there are six bands in the frequency range from 0 to 500 hz where one complete low frequency band gap 236 262 hz in orange region and a flexural wave low frequency band gap 174 286 hz in canary region are involved on the basis of plate wave theory a finite thickness plate admits the propagation of a number of anti symmetric a mode and symmetric s mode lamb waves and shear horizontal sh mode waves with cutoff frequencies including three fundamental plate modes i e a0 s0 and sh0 modes and infinite overtones an sn and shn modes n 1 2 3 in the band structure the dispersion relation branches originating from γ point can be identified as the a0 s0 and sh0 i e the lowest anti symmetric symmetric and shear horizontal modes in the plate in addition we can observe a large number of flat modes in the band structures due to the locally resonant effect the location of subwavelength flexural band gap is two orders of magnitude lower than that of bragg scattering band gap to further demonstrate the existence of the low frequency band gap in the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the flexural vibration frequency response of the 4 2 unit cells periodic sandwich plate type metastructures is calculated as shown in fig 2 b during the calculation the geometrical and material parameters remain unchanged it can be observed that there is a significant broadband flexural vibration attenuation zone in the frequency response of bending vibration the location and width of the flexural vibration attenuation exhibit very good agreement between the dispersion relation and the flexural vibration frequency response which verifies the correction and feasibility of solid shell multi physics coupling method the results demonstrate that the proposed sandwich plate type metastructure have flexural wave band gap in the subwavelength frequency range which can inhibit low frequency flexural wave propagation and achieve the flexural vibration isolation in an attempt to further reveal the formation mechanisms of the flexural wave band gap in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures the displacement fields of the eigenmodes as well as their cross sections cutting by y z planes in the specific wave vectors are calculated as shown in fig 3 fig 3 a and d respectively correspond with the starting and cutoff frequencies of the flexural wave band gap it can be noted that eigenmodes a as shown in fig 3 a is mainly represented by the coupling locally resonant mode between the lamb wave of sandwich plates and the longitudinal vibration mode of local resonators which leads to the emergence of the locally resonant flexural wave band gap we can find from fig 3 d that the eigenmodes d mainly shows the coupling mode in which the local resonator twists about the y direction and the sandwich plate moves transversely along the x direction fig 3 b and c correspond with the starting and cutoff frequencies of the complete band gap respectively mode b is similar to mode d but the stepped resonator of the mode b twists about the x axis therefore mode d has a certain inhibitory effect on the propagation of the flexural wave along the y axis while mode b is conducive to the propagation of the flexural wave along the y axis the displacement field of the eigenmodes c as shown in fig 3 c is mainly attributed to the local resonator and the sandwich plate moving towards each other in the z direction from the above analysis we infer that the generation of the low frequency band gaps in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures is mainly due to the coupling between the local resonant modes and the asymmetric lamb wave modes propagating in all directions the vibration energy is concentrated near the local resonator and the locally resonant sandwich plate type elastic metamaterial can be equivalent to two degrees of freedom spring mass system model as shown in fig 4 with the introduction of sandwich plates the contact stiffness between the local resonator and the sandwich plate weakens the resonant frequency of the local resonator decreases resulting in the decrease of the coupling resonant frequency of the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures owing to the strong coupling of the local resonant lamb modes of sandwich plates the resonant mode of the local resonators enhances in order to further explain the propagation characteristics and isolation mechanism of the flexural wave in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures the frequency responses of the flexural vibration inside and outside the frequency range of band gap is calculated fig 5 a shows the propagation characteristics of the flexural wave at 200 hz which corresponds to the frequency in the flexural band gap it can be seen that the flexural wave within the flexural band gap can hardly propagate along the finite array sandwich plate type metastructures which proves that the finitely periodic sandwich plate type metastructures have an excellent weakening effect on the propagation of flexural wave vibration in contrast the flexural wave of the structure hardly shows any attenuation at 350 hz which is beyond the band gap as shown in fig 5 b 3 2 experimental validation in an attempt to further verify the correctness of the numerical calculation model the transmission measuring experiments of finite array sandwich plate type metastructures composed of 4 units in the x direction and 2 units in the y direction were conducted the experiment measurement system was composed of an m p test system a power amplifier a computer for installing control and analysis software three b k 4507 accelerometers and a vibration exciter as depicted in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the experiment measurement principle the experimental sample of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure was fabricated as shown in fig 6 c the geometrical dimensions and material parameters of the experimental sample are consistent with those in the numerical simulation during our experiment test the flexible rope was used to hang the sandwich plate type metastructure to achieve free boundary condition the vibration exciter rod is installed on one side of the metastructure to apply perpendicular excitation to the surface of the sandwich plate three accelerometers were installed to measure the input and output acceleration frequency responses the flexural vibration acceleration frequency response was calculated using the vibration transmission rate formula the vibration transmission characteristics obtained from the experiment were compared with the numerical calculation results as shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the flexural vibration frequency response characteristic curve of the sandwich plate type metastructures had an obvious attenuation area and showed an excellent low frequency flexural vibration isolation performance the experimental results showed a good agreement with the numerical results which demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of numerical method in addition it is worth noting that the vibration spectra increase fast in some specific frequency range such as 0 10 hz and 110 150 hz this phenomenon can be explained as follow for the calculation of the frequency response of the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures sine sweep acceleration excitation in the frequency range from 0 to 500 hz is defined so that the natural vibration modes will be stimulated in all frequency range however in the actual application the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures are generally designed to suppress the vibration propagation in the frequency range of certain band according to the actual excitation resource according to the forced vibration theory the vibration magnitude away from the actual excitation resource drastically reduces 4 effects of the geometrical parameters on the band gap in order to investigate the effects of geometrical parameters on the upper and lower frequencies of the flexural wave band gap a series of numerical calculations of the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures were performed as shown in fig 8 during our calculations the material parameters of the sandwich plate and the stepped resonator keep unchanged the effect of the lattice constant of sandwich plate type metastructures on the band gap is shown in fig 8 a as can be seen from fig 8 a with the increase of lattice constant both the start frequency of the lower boundary and the cut off frequency of the upper boundary move to low frequency and the absolute width of the band gaps becomes narrower this phenomenon can be explained that the band gap of elastic metamaterial is mainly attributed to the local resonator of unit cell rather than the structural periodicity of elastic metamaterial as the increase of the lattice constant the additional mass and natural frequency of the sandwich plate type metastructures decline leading to the moving of the upper and lower edges of the band gap to low frequency range it can be observed from fig 8 b and c that the start and cut off frequencies diminish with the increase of the height of the web while increase with the increase of the thickness of the web as the thickness of the web increases and the height decreases the overall spring stiffness of the sandwich plate increases which results in the increase of the resonant eigenmodes of local resonators similarly we can see from fig 8 d that the increase of plate thickness will also bring about the increase of start and cut off frequencies and the plate thickness has a more significant influence on the band gap evolution the above parameter analysis mainly focuses on the structural parameters of the sandwich plate the structural parameters of the local resonators will also have a key influence on the natural frequency of the local resonant mode therefore the influence of the geometric parameters of the stepped resonators will be analyzed in the following part as can be seen from fig 8 e and f with the increase of the height of rubber and stub both the start frequency and the cut off frequency move to the low frequency the increase of the height leads to the reduction of the equivalent stiffness in the local resonance element causing the band gap position to move down the above analysis results show that the flexural wave band gaps and vibration attenuation characteristics can be adjusted manually by changing the geometric parameters of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures which can be utilized to realize the low frequency broadband optimization design of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures 5 vibration control application of marine power system on the basis of the above research we carried out the exploration of vibration control real ship application of marine power system taking into account the scale ratio the sandwich plate type elastic metastructure is converted to the real ship scale the dimensions of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure at the real ship scale are depicted in table 4 in order to demonstrate the vibration isolation performance of sandwich plate type metastructures in the marine power system at the real ship scale the flexural vibration transmission characteristics are studied by using the solid shell multi physics coupling method as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the 9 9 local resonators are installed in the middle of the sandwich plate a sine sweep frequency acceleration excitation source is applied to one side of the sandwich plate to simulate the excitation of the marine power system the flexural vibration direction of the excitation source is along the z direction while the flexural wave propagation direction is along the x direction the flexural vibration frequency responses of sandwich plate type metastructures at the real ship scale are calculated as shown in fig 10 it can be found that there is a significant flexural vibration attenuation zone from 78 hz to 142 hz in the frequency response which indicates that the sandwich plate type metastructures at the real ship can achieve low frequency ship vibration isolation the flexural vibration frequency response characteristic curve of test point 1 and test point 2 are basically the same while the frequency response characteristic curve of sandwich plate type metastructures with damping is smoother than the metastructures without damping on the basis of type i sandwich plate type metastructures as shown in fig 8 another two types of sandwich plate type metastructures in ship vibration application are designed the geometrical parameters of type ii are similar to those of type i except that it has a central guard region with 4 9 local resonators on either side of the guard region type iii has the same structural form as type ii but the location of the excitation source is different the excitation source of type ii is on the left while that of type iii is in the center in order to more intuitively illustrate the application feasibility of sandwich plate type metastructures in the real ships the displacement field of the three types of marine sandwich plate type metastructures at 94 hz and 160 hz are calculated respectively as shown in fig 11 fig 11 a and b are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type i fig 11 c and d are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type ii and fig 11 e and f are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type iii respectively fig 11 intuitively shows the flow law of flexural vibration wave energy in marine sandwich plate type metastructures when the excitation frequency of the excitation source is within the band gap range f 94 hz the full scale sandwich metastructures can effectively limit the vibration near the excitation source and isolate the elastic wave propagation from the excitation source to the protected area when the excitation frequency of the excitation source is outside the band gap range f 160 hz the elastic wave can propagate smoothly from the excitation source to the protected area according to figs 10 and 11 it can be found that the full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures have a flexural wave band gap and vibration suppression zone in the frequency range of 78 142 hz which can be effectively used to isolate vibration propagation and reduce the vibration and noise level of the protected area consequently it can be concluded that the full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures may play an important role in low frequency ship vibration and noise reduction engineering applications 6 conclusions to

strength and stiffness the experimental results are consistent with the numerical results which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of numerical method 2 the formation mechanism of flexural band

geometrical parameters 3 full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures have a flexural wave band gap and vibration suppression zone in the frequency range of 78 142 hz which demonstrates that

j represents moment of inertia 3 g e 2 1 υ κ 20 1 υ 24 25 υ υ 2 j h 3 12 in an attempt to calculate the dispersion relations and displacement fields of the eigenmodes only one representative unit cell of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures need to be considered due to spatial symmetry and translational periodicity according to energy band theory and solid lattice theory stress free boundary conditions are defined for free surfaces in the z direction while periodic boundary conditions are applied at the boundaries with the bloch theorem as follows 4 u i x a y a u i x y e j k x a k y a i x y where x and y are the coordinate components of position vector k x k y are the coordinate components of the bloch wave vector in the first brillouin zone the band structures and the eigenmodes can be obtained by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the wavevectors in this analysis the displacement is assumed to be a time harmonic of angular frequency ω according to the finite element principle the elastic wave dynamic formulation of the typical element can be transformed into the standard generalized eigenvalue formulation with discrete significance 5 k ω 2 m u 0 where k m and u represent the stiffness matrix mass matrix and eigenvector matrix respectively to calculate the transmission spectra of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the finite array system formed by 4 unit cells along the x direction and 2 unit cells along the y direction is considered as shown in fig 2 c the sine sweep acceleration excitation resource a in is imposed on one end of the sandwich plates the flexural vibration direction of the excitation resource is along the z direction and the flexural wave propagates along the y direction the transmitted acceleration response a out is detected on the other end of the sandwich plates the transmission spectra t is defined as 6 t 20 log a o u t a i n 3 results and discussion 3 1 dispersion relation and transmission spectra to study the flexural wave propagation and band gap characteristics of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the dispersion relation is obtained as shown in fig 2 a the horizontal axis represents the reduced wave vector along the boundary of the irreducible brillouin zone and the vertical axis is the wave frequency in the calculation the equivalent sandwich plate and the steel stubs are defined as steel while the rubber blocks are defined as rubber geometric parameters and material parameters are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively it can be found from fig 2 a that there are six bands in the frequency range from 0 to 500 hz where one complete low frequency band gap 236 262 hz in orange region and a flexural wave low frequency band gap 174 286 hz in canary region are involved on the basis of plate wave theory a finite thickness plate admits the propagation of a number of anti symmetric a mode and symmetric s mode lamb waves and shear horizontal sh mode waves with cutoff frequencies including three fundamental plate modes i e a0 s0 and sh0 modes and infinite overtones an sn and shn modes n 1 2 3 in the band structure the dispersion relation branches originating from γ point can be identified as the a0 s0 and sh0 i e the lowest anti symmetric symmetric and shear horizontal modes in the plate in addition we can observe a large number of flat modes in the band structures due to the locally resonant effect the location of subwavelength flexural band gap is two orders of magnitude lower than that of bragg scattering band gap to further demonstrate the existence of the low frequency band gap in the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures the flexural vibration frequency response of the 4 2 unit cells periodic sandwich plate type metastructures is calculated as shown in fig 2 b during the calculation the geometrical and material parameters remain unchanged it can be observed that there is a significant broadband flexural vibration attenuation zone in the frequency response of bending vibration the location and width of the flexural vibration attenuation exhibit very good agreement between the dispersion relation and the flexural vibration frequency response which verifies the correction and feasibility of solid shell multi physics coupling method the results demonstrate that the proposed sandwich plate type metastructure have flexural wave band gap in the subwavelength frequency range which can inhibit low frequency flexural wave propagation and achieve the flexural vibration isolation in an attempt to further reveal the formation mechanisms of the flexural wave band gap in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures the displacement fields of the eigenmodes as well as their cross sections cutting by y z planes in the specific wave vectors are calculated as shown in fig 3 fig 3 a and d respectively correspond with the starting and cutoff frequencies of the flexural wave band gap it can be noted that eigenmodes a as shown in fig 3 a is mainly represented by the coupling locally resonant mode between the lamb wave of sandwich plates and the longitudinal vibration mode of local resonators which leads to the emergence of the locally resonant flexural wave band gap we can find from fig 3 d that the eigenmodes d mainly shows the coupling mode in which the local resonator twists about the y direction and the sandwich plate moves transversely along the x direction fig 3 b and c correspond with the starting and cutoff frequencies of the complete band gap respectively mode b is similar to mode d but the stepped resonator of the mode b twists about the x axis therefore mode d has a certain inhibitory effect on the propagation of the flexural wave along the y axis while mode b is conducive to the propagation of the flexural wave along the y axis the displacement field of the eigenmodes c as shown in fig 3 c is mainly attributed to the local resonator and the sandwich plate moving towards each other in the z direction from the above analysis we infer that the generation of the low frequency band gaps in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures is mainly due to the coupling between the local resonant modes and the asymmetric lamb wave modes propagating in all directions the vibration energy is concentrated near the local resonator and the locally resonant sandwich plate type elastic metamaterial can be equivalent to two degrees of freedom spring mass system model as shown in fig 4 with the introduction of sandwich plates the contact stiffness between the local resonator and the sandwich plate weakens the resonant frequency of the local resonator decreases resulting in the decrease of the coupling resonant frequency of the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures owing to the strong coupling of the local resonant lamb modes of sandwich plates the resonant mode of the local resonators enhances in order to further explain the propagation characteristics and isolation mechanism of the flexural wave in the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures the frequency responses of the flexural vibration inside and outside the frequency range of band gap is calculated fig 5 a shows the propagation characteristics of the flexural wave at 200 hz which corresponds to the frequency in the flexural band gap it can be seen that the flexural wave within the flexural band gap can hardly propagate along the finite array sandwich plate type metastructures which proves that the finitely periodic sandwich plate type metastructures have an excellent weakening effect on the propagation of flexural wave vibration in contrast the flexural wave of the structure hardly shows any attenuation at 350 hz which is beyond the band gap as shown in fig 5 b 3 2 experimental validation in an attempt to further verify the correctness of the numerical calculation model the transmission measuring experiments of finite array sandwich plate type metastructures composed of 4 units in the x direction and 2 units in the y direction were conducted the experiment measurement system was composed of an m p test system a power amplifier a computer for installing control and analysis software three b k 4507 accelerometers and a vibration exciter as depicted in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the experiment measurement principle the experimental sample of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure was fabricated as shown in fig 6 c the geometrical dimensions and material parameters of the experimental sample are consistent with those in the numerical simulation during our experiment test the flexible rope was used to hang the sandwich plate type metastructure to achieve free boundary condition the vibration exciter rod is installed on one side of the metastructure to apply perpendicular excitation to the surface of the sandwich plate three accelerometers were installed to measure the input and output acceleration frequency responses the flexural vibration acceleration frequency response was calculated using the vibration transmission rate formula the vibration transmission characteristics obtained from the experiment were compared with the numerical calculation results as shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the flexural vibration frequency response characteristic curve of the sandwich plate type metastructures had an obvious attenuation area and showed an excellent low frequency flexural vibration isolation performance the experimental results showed a good agreement with the numerical results which demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of numerical method in addition it is worth noting that the vibration spectra increase fast in some specific frequency range such as 0 10 hz and 110 150 hz this phenomenon can be explained as follow for the calculation of the frequency response of the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures sine sweep acceleration excitation in the frequency range from 0 to 500 hz is defined so that the natural vibration modes will be stimulated in all frequency range however in the actual application the sandwich plate type elastic metastructures are generally designed to suppress the vibration propagation in the frequency range of certain band according to the actual excitation resource according to the forced vibration theory the vibration magnitude away from the actual excitation resource drastically reduces 4 effects of the geometrical parameters on the band gap in order to investigate the effects of geometrical parameters on the upper and lower frequencies of the flexural wave band gap a series of numerical calculations of the proposed sandwich plate type metastructures were performed as shown in fig 8 during our calculations the material parameters of the sandwich plate and the stepped resonator keep unchanged the effect of the lattice constant of sandwich plate type metastructures on the band gap is shown in fig 8 a as can be seen from fig 8 a with the increase of lattice constant both the start frequency of the lower boundary and the cut off frequency of the upper boundary move to low frequency and the absolute width of the band gaps becomes narrower this phenomenon can be explained that the band gap of elastic metamaterial is mainly attributed to the local resonator of unit cell rather than the structural periodicity of elastic metamaterial as the increase of the lattice constant the additional mass and natural frequency of the sandwich plate type metastructures decline leading to the moving of the upper and lower edges of the band gap to low frequency range it can be observed from fig 8 b and c that the start and cut off frequencies diminish with the increase of the height of the web while increase with the increase of the thickness of the web as the thickness of the web increases and the height decreases the overall spring stiffness of the sandwich plate increases which results in the increase of the resonant eigenmodes of local resonators similarly we can see from fig 8 d that the increase of plate thickness will also bring about the increase of start and cut off frequencies and the plate thickness has a more significant influence on the band gap evolution the above parameter analysis mainly focuses on the structural parameters of the sandwich plate the structural parameters of the local resonators will also have a key influence on the natural frequency of the local resonant mode therefore the influence of the geometric parameters of the stepped resonators will be analyzed in the following part as can be seen from fig 8 e and f with the increase of the height of rubber and stub both the start frequency and the cut off frequency move to the low frequency the increase of the height leads to the reduction of the equivalent stiffness in the local resonance element causing the band gap position to move down the above analysis results show that the flexural wave band gaps and vibration attenuation characteristics can be adjusted manually by changing the geometric parameters of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures which can be utilized to realize the low frequency broadband optimization design of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures 5 vibration control application of marine power system on the basis of the above research we carried out the exploration of vibration control real ship application of marine power system taking into account the scale ratio the sandwich plate type elastic metastructure is converted to the real ship scale the dimensions of the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructure at the real ship scale are depicted in table 4 in order to demonstrate the vibration isolation performance of sandwich plate type metastructures in the marine power system at the real ship scale the flexural vibration transmission characteristics are studied by using the solid shell multi physics coupling method as shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the 9 9 local resonators are installed in the middle of the sandwich plate a sine sweep frequency acceleration excitation source is applied to one side of the sandwich plate to simulate the excitation of the marine power system the flexural vibration direction of the excitation source is along the z direction while the flexural wave propagation direction is along the x direction the flexural vibration frequency responses of sandwich plate type metastructures at the real ship scale are calculated as shown in fig 10 it can be found that there is a significant flexural vibration attenuation zone from 78 hz to 142 hz in the frequency response which indicates that the sandwich plate type metastructures at the real ship can achieve low frequency ship vibration isolation the flexural vibration frequency response characteristic curve of test point 1 and test point 2 are basically the same while the frequency response characteristic curve of sandwich plate type metastructures with damping is smoother than the metastructures without damping on the basis of type i sandwich plate type metastructures as shown in fig 8 another two types of sandwich plate type metastructures in ship vibration application are designed the geometrical parameters of type ii are similar to those of type i except that it has a central guard region with 4 9 local resonators on either side of the guard region type iii has the same structural form as type ii but the location of the excitation source is different the excitation source of type ii is on the left while that of type iii is in the center in order to more intuitively illustrate the application feasibility of sandwich plate type metastructures in the real ships the displacement field of the three types of marine sandwich plate type metastructures at 94 hz and 160 hz are calculated respectively as shown in fig 11 fig 11 a and b are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type i fig 11 c and d are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type ii and fig 11 e and f are the displacement fields of frequencies in and out of the band gap corresponding to type iii respectively fig 11 intuitively shows the flow law of flexural vibration wave energy in marine sandwich plate type metastructures when the excitation frequency of the excitation source is within the band gap range f 94 hz the full scale sandwich metastructures can effectively limit the vibration near the excitation source and isolate the elastic wave propagation from the excitation source to the protected area when the excitation frequency of the excitation source is outside the band gap range f 160 hz the elastic wave can propagate smoothly from the excitation source to the protected area according to figs 10 and 11 it can be found that the full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures have a flexural wave band gap and vibration suppression zone in the frequency range of 78 142 hz which can be effectively used to isolate vibration propagation and reduce the vibration and noise level of the protected area consequently it can be concluded that the full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures may play an important role in low frequency ship vibration and noise reduction engineering applications 6 conclusions to solve the low frequency vibration and noise control of marine power system a ship vibration isolation method using the band gap concept of sandwich plate type elastic metastructures is proposed an efficient finite element method combination with solid shell multi physics coupling model and bloch theory is applied to study the dispersion relations and flexural vibration isolation characteristics of sandwich plate type elastic metamaterials the experimental validation of flexural vibration isolation performance was carried out in addition the formation mechanism and geometrical parameter study of flexural wave band gap are performed finally the potential application of the proposed ship vibration isolation method in the marine power system is explored the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed sandwich plate type elastic metastructures possess significant low frequency subwavelength flexural wave band gap and vibration isolation characteristics under the premise of structural strength and stiffness the experimental results are consistent with the numerical results which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of numerical method 2 the formation mechanism of flexural band gap is mainly attributed to the mode coupling of the local resonant mode and the lamb wave mode of sandwich plate the subwavelength flexural wave band gap can be effectively modulated by the geometrical parameters 3 full scale marine sandwich plate type metastructures have a flexural wave band gap and vibration suppression zone in the frequency range of 78 142 hz which demonstrates that the proposed ship vibration isolation method has an attractive application prospect in low frequency vibration and noise control of marine power system credit authorship contribution statement

20531,the realistic three phase water entry of a free fall cylinder is investigated in this paper using an efficient lattice boltzmann method lbm with automatic interface capturing capability implemented in an in house fortran 90 code the numerical method takes advantage of automatic interface capturing using a real equation of state eos and considering the surface tension and gas phase

to more than a century ago in 1897 when worthington and cole 1897 reported images of spheres water entry using single spark photography many subsequent experimental and numerical studies have been conducting due to the complex physics of the problem and many effective parameters in this paper the cylinder water entry is intended and therefore the corresponding literature is reviewed here to some extent for the first time greenhow and lin 1983 presented images of water entry of two dimensional cylinders in 1983 the length and width of the tank in their experiment are almost the same leading to the formation of a two dimensional cavity wei and hu 2014 2015 experimentally investigated vertical and inclined water entry of horizontal cylinders for low fr numbers russo et al 2018 in 2018 also experimentally investigated water entry of buoyant cylinders at different impact velocities they reported that the penetration depth is increased with the impact velocity and cylinder weight direct numerical simulation dns of free surface flows involving fluid solid interactions fsi such as water entry problems is a challenging and complex subject capturing tracking and reconstructing the free surface at each time step solving the complex navier stokes n s pdes applying the no slip boundary condition on the moving solid and the solid movement in the simulation domain are some of the difficulties encountered in the traditional n s based methods in the computational fluid dynamics cfd furthermore important compressibility effects especially at the initial stage of high speed water entry zhang et al 2015 are typically neglected in the conventional cfd methods to simplify the complex n s equations and corresponding modeling constrained interpolation profile cip and volume of fluid vof are the typical traditional macroscopic based numerical methods used for the water entry simulation smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph a mesoscopic method based on streaming collisions is also widely used for free surface flow simulations including the water entry problems some representative works using these methods for simulating cylinder water entry are reviewed in continuation using different versions of the sph method including incompressible and weakly compressible sph vandamme et al 2011 gong et al 2019 skillen et al 2013 and sun et al 2018 investigated forced and free fall cylinder entry in two and three dimensions in all these sph simulations the viscosity and surface tension terms are not modeled using the vof method iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 and liu et al 2020 studied three dimensional water entry of circular cylinders with vertical and inclined impact respectively zhu et al 2007 simulated two dimensional water entry and exit of a circular cylinder using the cip method the lattice boltzmann method lbm mcnamara and zanetti 1988 mohamad 2011 krüger et al 2017 is a robust alternative cfd method developed in the mesoscopic scale based on the kinetic theory the technique is powerful for simulating complex flows such as multiphase flows where there is no need to track the interface lbm and hybrid lbm methods are also widely implemented and developed to simulate the water entry exit problems however simulations using lbm with no coupling methods mostly used the free surface lb model ginzburg and steiner 2003 ginzburg et al 2002 in this lb model the free surface needs to be captured and reconstructed typically using the vof technique appropriate boundary conditions need to be applied on the interface due to discarding the gas phase and the surface tension is neglected lack of clear wettability adjusting algorithm and lack of using a real equation of states eos are other limitations of this model using the free surface lbm zarghami et al 2014 simulated forced wedge entry at a low constant velocity hao et al haohao et al 2019 in 2019 simulated 2d free falling wedge entry and forced water exit of a sphere in the same year guo et al 2019 studied water exit of partially submerged spheres with constant velocity using the free surface lbm very recently rosis and tafuni de rosis and tafuni 2020 developed the phase field lbm for the simulation of water entry exit problems however two lb equations need to be solved using this method one for the fluid flow and the other for tracking the interface updating the order parameter the discrete element method dem is coupled with lbm and then applied for water entry problems in terms of hybrid methods the former is used for modeling the solid and the latter for the fluid flow simulation the dem originates from geotechnical applications for evaluating structural dynamics and interaction owen et al 2011 in this method all forces applied to each discrete element comprising the solid body are computed including contact hydrodynamic and inertia the velocity and position of each element must be updated then as well therefore the edm is mostly implemented and suitable for coupling multi body physics with lbm especially dense particles in fluids where the inter particle forces and contacts are significant and frequent owen et al 2011 however for a single solid body the method may add considerable complexity and computational cost to the simulation without significant advantage compared to corresponding simulations using lbm alone with no coupling method however some papers are reported in the literature simulating water entry of a solid body using the dem lbm method such as refs galindo torres 2013 ding and xu 2018 as mentioned the free surface lb method used for simulating water entry problems has some limitations and difficulties to remove all mentioned weaknesses and difficulties of the free surface lbm very recently kharmiani et al 2020 at the first stage coupled the well known pseudo potential multiphase lb model shan and chen 1993 1994 sukop and thorne 2006 huang et al 2015 chen et al 2014 with the moving boundary lb scheme for simulating forced water entry exit problems however the prescribed motion is not as practical and important as the free fall water entry therefore in this paper the surface integration method calculates the hydrodynamic forces on the solid as a result the instantaneous solid velocity and position in the free fall water entry can then be calculated and updated the introduced numerical lb model in this paper is argued to be one the best methods for the dns of the free fall water entry problems due to the following capabilities and advantages automatic free surface capturing modeling compressibility effects via implementing a real fluid eos obtaining the pressure from the eos simulating the gas phase surface tension and buoyancy force the possibility of varying the surface tension strength in a wide range from very low to very high values independent of the liquid to gas density ratio relative simplicity in applying the boundary conditions on the moving boundary solving only one lb equation stability at low liquid viscosities computational efficiency and capability of simulating water entry of any solid body with a regular shape the numerical method is validated against other numerical and experimental results reported in the literature the technique is then used for a comprehensive study of the cylinder trajectory and cavity diameter the effects of the froude number solid density or mass and surface wettability are studied in detail 2 numerical model the multiphase lb model implemented in this paper is recently proposed by the authors kharmiani et al 2019 which can handle large density ratios and surface tension adjustment independent of the density ratio the model is based on modifying the original pseudo potential interaction force coupled with a solid

shows the free surface dynamics for the free fall of a half buoyant hydrophobic cylinder at fr v 0 g d s 2 8 which is compared with those of 2d incompressible sph simulation reported in the literature skillen et al 2013 with a good agreement the simulation domain is 600 500 the initial liquid height equals h 218 lu and the solid diameter d s 80 lu which gives h d s 2 73 which is equal to the one in the mentioned sph simulation it should be noted that the width of the domain in the sph simulation is 9 1 times the cylinder diameter which was reported to be enough for canceling the side wall effects in our simulation the ratio is 600 40 15 and guarantees no impact of the sidewalls it was examined and ascertained the liquid and gas viscosities are set to ν l 3 3 10 5 and ν g 0 017 the surface tension to σ 5 8 10 5 and the initial impact velocity to v 0 0 117 all in lattice units leading to re v 0 d s ν l 2 8 10 5 and we ρ l v 0 2 d s σ 8 6 10 3 therefore the effects of liquid viscosity and surface tension are negligible the liquid to vapor density ratio equals 140 corresponding to the reduced temperature of t r 0 6 the non dimensional time is t t v 0 d s and t 0 is when the cylinder touches the free surface as observed in fig 3 the cavity behind the cylinder is filled without the bubble formation due to the relatively low fr number of 2 8 which indicates that the gravity force is comparable with the inertia force hindering bubble formation fig 4 shows variations of the non dimensional penetration depth depth divided by the solid diameter during the time which is compared with those 2d numerical results of isph skillen et al 2013 and cip zhu et al 2007 the simulation data correspond to those from fig 3 the depth is measured from the cylinder leading point not the center as observed there is an excellent agreement between the current lbm and the other 2d numerical methods variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter d cav d cav d s during the time corresponding to fig 3 simulation data is shown in fig 5 which is compared with that of the sph result skillen et al 2013 indicating a good agreement notice that the cavity diameter is measured concerning the initial calm liquid free surface as shown in fig 1 t 0 86 the cavity diameter at this low fr number is observed to be increased following a third order polynomial curve the turning point observed at almost t 4 is when the cavity shape inversion happens wei and hu 2014 in other words at this time another curvature is formed at the cavity surface which is near the solid and has a higher curvature value compared with the initial one this higher curvature part of the cavity surface moves with higher acceleration and in the opposite direction compared to the lower initial curvature and overtakes it leading to the pinch off fig 6 shows the simulation image at t 4 68 indicating the cavity inversion phenomenon the cavity shape inversion is observed in the experimental work of wei and hu 2014 and they stated that it is more obviously seen for longer cylinders fig 7 shows simulation images of another cylinder entry at fr 8 89 and ρ s ρ l 1 37 which is compared with experimental results of wei and hu 2014 experimental photographs are reprinted from wei and hu 2014 2014 j mar sci technol and three dimensional vof simulation of iranmanseh and passandideh fard iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 simulation images reprinted from iranmanseh and passandideh fard iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 2017 ocean engineering the non dimensional time is where is the pinch off time the time of the bubble formation the simulation domain is 1080 2000 h 1600 lu d s 80 lu and v 0 0 1 therefore the ratio of the cylinder diameter to the initial liquid height and to the width of the domain are d s h 0 05 and d s 2 1080 0 037 respectively which are the same as those of the experiment the we and re numbers equal we 6260 and re 1200 therefore the effects of the liquid viscosity and surface tension are negligible in simulations and the experiment as observed the cavity formation dynamics and pinch off are in good agreement with the experiment furthermore compared with the vof results the current lbm better captures the free surface deformation variation of the non dimensional trajectory of the cylinder center y s d s corresponding to simulation data of fig 7 is shown and compared with the experiment in fig 8 indicating a fair agreement the numerical results underestimate the penetration depth with a maximum discrepancy of 16 which can be attributed to the higher drag coefficient of the 2d cylinder compared to the 3d one sun et al 2018 fig 9 shows the variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter corresponding to simulation data of fig 7 compared with the experimental wei and hu 2014 and vof results iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 indicating an excellent agreement between the current lbm and the experimental results as observed the vof method overestimates the cavity diameter 3 1 effect of the impact velocity froude number fig 10 shows the effect of the impact velocity or froude number on the variation of the cylinder trajectory with time the other simulation data correspond to those from fig 7 as observed the penetration depth is increased almost linearly with the fr number which is reported in the experimental works of aristoff et al 2010a and russo et al 2018 for respectively the sphere and the cylinder water entry higher impact fr numbers indicate higher impact inertia which leads to the higher penetration depth fig 11 shows the effect of the fr number on the variation of the cylinder trajectory with another non dimensional time t t v t d s which shows that the trajectory becomes independent of the fr number iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 also report this founding fig 12 and fig 13 show the effect of the fr number on the variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter with time and non dimensional time respectively as observed in fig 12 the cavity diameter is increased with the fr number at each time because the impact inertia is increased according to fig 13 the cavity diameter is independent of the fr number and the simulation data obeys a power curve with the data fit function of d cav 1 4 t 0 45 the interesting point is that the non dimensional crown diameter in the droplet impact on a liquid film varies with t with almost the same power law cossali et al 2004 which is almost independent of the impact velocity this similarity is extracted and reported for the first time in this paper 3 2 effect of cylinder density fig 14 shows the effect of the solid density on the variation of the non dimensional trajectory vs non dimensional time it can be inferred from the figure that the penetration depth almost linearly increases with the solid density like the effect of the impact velocity shown in fig 10 in other words the solid momentum which is solid mass multiplied by its velocity determines the penetration power therefore the penetration depth increases with either of them another point that can be inferred from fig 14 is that the penetration curve tends to the linear trend as the solid density increases these two effects of the cylinder density on the trajectory are also reported by experiments of aristoff et al 2010b and russo et al 2018 fig 15 shows the effect of the solid density on the variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter vs t t v 0 d s in fig 15 a and vs in fig 15 b as observed in fig 15 a the cavity diameter is almost independent of the solid density for approximately t 4 but it is increased with the solid density for the later times furthermore the figure indicates that as the solid density increases the dependence of the cavity diameter on solid density is reduced according to fig 15 b the power trend observed in fig 15 a is changed to a linear one and the cavity diameter is linearly decreased with the solid density 3 3 effect of the surface wettability simulation images for the entry of a hydrophilic cylinder θ 72 at fr 11 and we 380 and re 5280 are shown in fig 16 other simulation data correspond to those from fig 7 as observed no cavity is formed and the liquid thoroughly wets the surface effect of the surface wettability on the cylinder trajectory is also shown in fig 17 for two static contact angles of θ 72 and θ 146 and the same other conditions the figure indicates that the penetration depth is independent of the surface wettability for t 2 and then is reduced by increasing the wettability the effect and difference become more considerable with time this is because the drag force is higher for the hydrophilic surface due to the higher wetted area the static pressure is increased with the depth of liquid making the drag force more considerable with time furthermore fig 17 indicates that the impact of the wettability is weakened as it is increased 4 conclusion a robust multiphase lbm is successfully coupled with a solid body movement lb model for the dns of free fall water entry problems the numerical model is efficient and powerful in terms of several items including automatic interface capturing modeling compressibility surface tension and gas phase simultaneously using a real eos relatively easy implementation and solving only one lb equation numerical results are successfully validated against experimental and numerical data reported in the literature therefore the proposed numerical model is argued to be one of the most efficient simple and fast dns cfd methods developed for studying water entry exit problems up to the present the free fall of hydrophobic cylinders at the high inertia regime is studied comprehensively in this paper and the following concluding remarks are recognized the cavity shape inversion reported by experimental works in the literature is recovered in this paper for the same simulation time d cav is increased with the fr number or impact velocity diagram of vs t t v 0 d s is independent of the impact velocity and obeys a power law function as d cav 1 4 t 0 45 this is very similar to the power law equation for the non dimensional crown diameter vs t in the droplet impact on a liquid film reported in the literature the penetration depth increases with either the impact velocity or solid density mass and changes from the parabolic trend to the linear one as the solid density increases the penetration depth vs t t v t d s is independent of the fr number as the surface wettability increases the penetration depth is reduced and the deviation of different wettability curves increases with time the effect of surface wettability is decreased as it is increased credit

20531,the realistic three phase water entry of a free fall cylinder is investigated in this paper using an efficient lattice boltzmann method lbm with automatic interface capturing capability implemented in an in house fortran 90 code the numerical method takes advantage of automatic interface capturing using a real equation of state eos and considering the surface tension and gas phase compared to the free surface lbm used for water entry simulations in a few previous lbm works simulation results are first compared with other numerical and experimental data with good agreements variation of the cylinder trajectory and cavity diameter is presented and effects of the froude number solid density and surface wettability are investigated data analysis shows that the non dimensional cavity diameter vs non dimensional time is independent of the fr number or impact velocity and obeys a power law trend almost the same as the one reported for variation of the non dimensional crown diameter for the droplet impact on a liquid film or a deep liquid the penetration depth during time is almost linearly increased with the impact velocity and solid density as the

to more than a century ago in 1897 when worthington and cole 1897 reported images of spheres water entry using single spark photography many subsequent experimental and numerical studies have been conducting due to the complex physics of the problem and many effective parameters in this paper the cylinder water entry is intended and therefore the corresponding literature is reviewed here to some extent for the first time greenhow and lin 1983 presented images of water entry of two dimensional cylinders in 1983 the length and width of the tank in their experiment are almost the same leading to the formation of a two dimensional cavity wei and hu 2014 2015 experimentally investigated vertical and inclined water entry of horizontal cylinders for low fr numbers russo et al 2018 in 2018 also experimentally investigated water entry of buoyant cylinders at different impact velocities they reported that the penetration depth is increased with the impact velocity and cylinder weight direct numerical simulation dns of free surface flows involving fluid solid interactions fsi such as water entry problems is a challenging and complex subject capturing tracking and reconstructing the free surface at each time step solving the complex navier stokes n s pdes applying the no slip boundary condition on the moving solid and the solid movement in the simulation domain are some of the difficulties encountered in the traditional n s based methods in the computational fluid dynamics cfd furthermore important compressibility effects especially at the initial stage of high speed water entry zhang et al 2015 are typically neglected in the conventional cfd methods to simplify the complex n s equations and corresponding modeling constrained interpolation profile cip and volume of fluid vof are the typical traditional macroscopic based numerical methods used for the water entry simulation smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph a mesoscopic method based on streaming collisions is also widely used for free surface flow simulations including the water entry problems some representative works using these methods for simulating cylinder water entry are reviewed in continuation using different versions of the sph method including incompressible and weakly compressible sph vandamme et al 2011 gong et al 2019 skillen et al 2013 and sun et al 2018 investigated forced and free fall cylinder entry in two and three dimensions in all these sph simulations the viscosity and surface tension terms are not modeled using the vof method iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 and liu et al 2020 studied three dimensional water entry of circular cylinders with vertical and inclined impact respectively zhu et al 2007 simulated two dimensional water entry and exit of a circular cylinder using the cip method the lattice boltzmann method lbm mcnamara and zanetti 1988 mohamad 2011 krüger et al 2017 is a robust alternative cfd method developed in the mesoscopic scale based on the kinetic theory the technique is powerful for simulating complex flows such as multiphase flows where there is no need to track the interface lbm and hybrid lbm methods are also widely implemented and developed to simulate the water entry exit problems however simulations using lbm with no coupling methods mostly used the free surface lb model ginzburg and steiner 2003 ginzburg et al 2002 in this lb model the free surface needs to be captured and reconstructed typically using the vof technique appropriate boundary conditions need to be applied on the interface due to discarding the gas phase and the surface tension is neglected lack of clear wettability adjusting algorithm and lack of using a real equation of states eos are other limitations of this model using the free surface lbm zarghami et al 2014 simulated forced wedge entry at a low constant velocity hao et al haohao et al 2019 in 2019 simulated 2d free falling wedge entry and forced water exit of a sphere in the same year guo et al 2019 studied water exit of partially submerged spheres with constant velocity using the free surface lbm very recently rosis and tafuni de rosis and tafuni 2020 developed the phase field lbm for the simulation of water entry exit problems however two lb equations need to be solved using this method one for the fluid flow and the other for tracking the interface updating the order parameter the discrete element method dem is coupled with lbm and then applied for water entry problems in terms of hybrid methods the former is used for modeling the solid and the latter for the fluid flow simulation the dem originates from geotechnical applications for evaluating structural dynamics and interaction owen et al 2011 in this method all forces applied to each discrete element comprising the solid body are computed including contact hydrodynamic and inertia the velocity and position of each element must be updated then as well therefore the edm is mostly implemented and suitable for coupling multi body physics with lbm especially dense particles in fluids where the inter particle forces and contacts are significant and frequent owen et al 2011 however for a single solid body the method may add considerable complexity and computational cost to the simulation without significant advantage compared to corresponding simulations using lbm alone with no coupling method however some papers are reported in the literature simulating water entry of a solid body using the dem lbm method such as refs galindo torres 2013 ding and xu 2018 as mentioned the free surface lb method used for simulating water entry problems has some limitations and difficulties to remove all mentioned weaknesses and difficulties of the free surface lbm very recently kharmiani et al 2020 at the first stage coupled the well known pseudo potential multiphase lb model shan and chen 1993 1994 sukop and thorne 2006 huang et al 2015 chen et al 2014 with the moving boundary lb scheme for simulating forced water entry exit problems however the prescribed motion is not as practical and important as the free fall water entry therefore in this paper the surface integration method calculates the hydrodynamic forces on the solid as a result the instantaneous solid velocity and position in the free fall water entry can then be calculated and updated the introduced numerical lb model in this paper is argued to be one the best methods for the dns of the free fall water entry problems due to the following capabilities and advantages automatic free surface capturing modeling compressibility effects via implementing a real fluid eos obtaining the pressure from the eos simulating the gas phase surface tension and buoyancy force the possibility of varying the surface tension strength in a wide range from very low to very high values independent of the liquid to gas density ratio relative simplicity in applying the boundary conditions on the moving boundary solving only one lb equation stability at low liquid viscosities computational efficiency and capability of simulating water entry of any solid body with a regular shape the numerical method is validated against other numerical and experimental results reported in the literature the technique is then used for a comprehensive study of the cylinder trajectory and cavity diameter the effects of the froude number solid density or mass and surface wettability are studied in detail 2 numerical model the multiphase lb model implemented in this paper is recently proposed by the authors kharmiani et al 2019 which can handle large density ratios and surface tension adjustment independent of the density ratio the model is based on modifying the original pseudo potential interaction force coupled with a solid

experimental works of aristoff et al 2010a and russo et al 2018 for respectively the sphere and the cylinder water entry higher impact fr numbers indicate higher impact inertia which leads to the higher penetration depth fig 11 shows the effect of the fr number on the variation of the cylinder trajectory with another non dimensional time t t v t d s which shows that the trajectory becomes independent of the fr number iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 also report this founding fig 12 and fig 13 show the effect of the fr number on the variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter with time and non dimensional time respectively as observed in fig 12 the cavity diameter is increased with the fr number at each time because the impact inertia is increased according to fig 13 the cavity diameter is independent of the fr number and the simulation data obeys a power curve with the data fit function of d cav 1 4 t 0 45 the interesting point is that the non dimensional crown diameter in the droplet impact on a liquid film varies with t with almost the same power law cossali et al 2004 which is almost independent of the impact velocity this similarity is extracted and reported for the first time in this paper 3 2 effect of cylinder density fig 14 shows the effect of the solid density on the variation of the non dimensional trajectory vs non dimensional time it can be inferred from the figure that the penetration depth almost linearly increases with the solid density like the effect of the impact velocity shown in fig 10 in other words the solid momentum which is solid mass multiplied by its velocity determines the penetration power therefore the penetration depth increases with either of them another point that can be inferred from fig 14 is that the penetration curve tends to the linear trend as the solid density increases these two effects of the cylinder density on the trajectory are also reported by experiments of aristoff et al 2010b and russo et al 2018 fig 15 shows the effect of the solid density on the variation of the non dimensional cavity diameter vs t t v 0 d s in fig 15 a and vs in fig 15 b as observed in fig 15 a the cavity diameter is almost independent of the solid density for approximately t 4 but it is increased with the solid density for the later times furthermore the figure indicates that as the solid density increases the dependence of the cavity diameter on solid density is reduced according to fig 15 b the power trend observed in fig 15 a is changed to a linear one and the cavity diameter is linearly decreased with the solid density 3 3 effect of the surface wettability simulation images for the entry of a hydrophilic cylinder θ 72 at fr 11 and we 380 and re 5280 are shown in fig 16 other simulation data correspond to those from fig 7 as observed no cavity is formed and the liquid thoroughly wets the surface effect of the surface wettability on the cylinder trajectory is also shown in fig 17 for two static contact angles of θ 72 and θ 146 and the same other conditions the figure indicates that the penetration depth is independent of the surface wettability for t 2 and then is reduced by increasing the wettability the effect and difference become more considerable with time this is because the drag force is higher for the hydrophilic surface due to the higher wetted area the static pressure is increased with the depth of liquid making the drag force more considerable with time furthermore fig 17 indicates that the impact of the wettability is weakened as it is increased 4 conclusion a robust multiphase lbm is successfully coupled with a solid body movement lb model for the dns of free fall water entry problems the numerical model is efficient and powerful in terms of several items including automatic interface capturing modeling compressibility surface tension and gas phase simultaneously using a real eos relatively easy implementation and solving only one lb equation numerical results are successfully validated against experimental and numerical data reported in the literature therefore the proposed numerical model is argued to be one of the most efficient simple and fast dns cfd methods developed for studying water entry exit problems up to the present the free fall of hydrophobic cylinders at the high inertia regime is studied comprehensively in this paper and the following concluding remarks are recognized the cavity shape inversion reported by experimental works in the literature is recovered in this paper for the same simulation time d cav is increased with the fr number or impact velocity diagram of vs t t v 0 d s is independent of the impact velocity and obeys a power law function as d cav 1 4 t 0 45 this is very similar to the power law equation for the non dimensional crown diameter vs t in the droplet impact on a liquid film reported in the literature the penetration depth increases with either the impact velocity or solid density mass and changes from the parabolic trend to the linear one as the solid density increases the penetration depth vs t t v t d s is independent of the fr number as the surface wettability increases the penetration depth is reduced and the deviation of different wettability curves increases with time the effect of surface wettability is decreased as it is increased credit

20532,grouted connections have been widely used in offshore construction to connect two different sized cylindrical steel tubes these connections include pile to sleeve grouted connections for mono piles of wind turbine towers and pile to jacket leg grouted connections for jacket structures because the grouted connections in seawater are mainly subjected to environmental loadings induced by waves and wind loading high strength grouted connections have been widely applied in offshore structures to enhance the structural performance and to prevent fatigue failure generated by the cyclic environmental loading in this study the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with shear keys subjected to unidirectional reversible cyclic loadings in dry conditions was evaluated based on experimental tests numerical evaluations and comparative analysis based on a test database established using prior studies it was revealed that the grout strength shear key density and stress

widely used in offshore construction to connect two different sized cylindrical steel tubes examples include pile to sleeve grouted connections for mono piles of wind turbine towers and pile to jacket leg grouted connections for jacket structures refer to fig 1 the grouted connection comprises two different sized steel tubes with and without shear keys and cementitious grout materials are infilled between them it possesses ring shaped shear keys between the pile and the sleeve so that interfacial shear strength can be achieved through the interlocking behaviour between the grout annulus and the shear keys of the pile and sleeve because grouted connections in seawater are mainly subjected to long term environmental loadings induced by waves and wind loading fatigue assessment is one of the key issues in grouted connection design to prevent fatigue failure from long term cyclic loading increasing the grout strength could be an effective method for enhancing the interfacial shear capacity of grouted connections thus high strength grouted connections with over 140 mpa of structural grout have been widely employed in offshore structures although there are several design codes commonly used for grouted connections in offshore engineering api 2007 dnvgl 2018b iso 2007 norsok 2013 the fatigue design equations for predicting the grout failure modes of grouted connections are stipulated in the dnvgl design code dnvgl 2018b the presented design equations in dnvgl are considered as a lower bound solution which covers iso fatigue test data with a wide range of load cycles bechtel 2016 harwood et al 1996 however other design codes do not provide clear information on the fatigue design of grout connections moreover the current design provisions do not provide the limits of compressive strength of grouts for fatigue design but provide a maximum grout compressive strength of 80 mpa iso 2007 norsok 2013 and 110 mpa api 2007 for ultimate limit states thus further studies on the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with a compressive strength greater than 80 mpa are required to achieve both more efficient and improved design practices the fatigue performance of grouted connections has been evaluated by many researchers in billington and tebbett 1980 a pioneering study was conducted in which fatigue tests with five shear key samples under zero mean stress and equal tension compression cycles were performed with loading frequencies of 0 1 hz and 3 hz for short term and long term environmental loadings respectively they reported that the fatigue performance demonstrates a linear relationship between the stress range and the cyclic number on a log scale with an apparent endurance limit of approximately 40 of the ultimate strength under which fatigue damage does not occur tebbett and billington 1985 validated the results of their study conducted in 1980 billington and tebbett 1980 with additional data samples a total of 11 experimental samples in boswell and d mello boswell and d mello 1986 fatigue tests were conducted on ten grouted connection samples with shear keys under a fully reversible cyclic loading condition in their work loading frequencies of 0 1 hz and 0 5 hz were applied to describe the typical wave action of the north sea they concluded that higher strength grout has a relatively poor fatigue performance compared with lower strength grout the fatigue performance value obtained in this study was approximately half of the critical values of lower strength specimens predicted in previous studies works billington and tebbett 1980 tebbett 1987 tebbett and billington 1985 however the influence of additional parameters such as the connection type and shear key configuration has not been investigated dallyn et al 2015 in ingebrigtsen et al 1990 the fatigue performance of 68 plain pipe and 96 shear key samples was investigated they confirmed that the plain pipe connections were highly resistant to dynamic loading while those with shear key samples appeared to be less resistant than their respective higher static strength for tensile compressive loading in harwood et al 1996 several experimental tests were evaluated with normal strength grout 10 80 mpa under a fully reversible cyclic loading condition previously conducted by the uk department of energy oth 1986 they concluded that the fatigue strength reduction could result from early age cyclic movement and increasing shear key spacing h s in hordyk 1996 the experimental tests previously conducted by the uk department of energy oth 1986 and dnv dnv 1984 were also evaluated they discussed the effects of shear key spacing and the stress ratio r which is the ratio between the maximum and minimum stress levels r f m i n f m a x o r p m i n p m a x from fatigue loading as the usage of high performance materials has been a more common practice in recent times experimental tests on high strength grouted connections using compressive strength above 80 mpa have been conducted by many researchers in etterdal et al 2001 the use of high strength grout compressive strengths of 140 mpa and 213 mpa was investigated to strengthen offshore steel tubular components in anders 2007 and anders and lohaus 2008 static and fatigue loading tests were conducted on small high strength grouted connections with and without steel fibres in a grout admixture under fully reversible cyclic loading the fatigue test results in their study showed that fatigue performance can be influenced by different compressive strengths of grout and shear key spacing it was reported that the failure modes of high strength grouted connections obtained with 110 mpa and 170 mpa compressive strength grout materials were very similar to those reported in prior research in sørensen et al 2011 the fatigue life of cylindrical specimens was investigated where the diameter and height of the specimens was 60 mm and 120 mm respectively constructed using high strength grout specimens with a compressive strength of 141 mpa under unidirectional reversible cyclic loading in compression they considered two different environmental conditions namely air and water they confirmed that the grout specimens in water conditions have a lower fatigue life than those under air conditions the latest important study of fatigue performance under dry and wet conditions was conducted at leibniz university hannover where the fatigue performance of grouted connections under unidirectional cyclic loading conditions during compression was evaluated bechtel 2016 grout material compressive strengths of 90 mpa and 140 mpa were considered for jacket structures under dry conditions subsequently the fatigue behaviour of submerged axially loaded grouted connections in wet conditions were investigated for 90 mpa and 140 mpa grout materials raba 2018 in this study a deep understanding of the degradation behaviour of fatigue loading under dry and wet conditions was achieved with both small and large scale fatigue test specimens under unidirectional cyclic loading in compression the results provided a comprehensive understanding of the effects of grouted layer thickness on the submerged grouted connections for two different ambient conditions as well as various loading levels and loading frequencies additionally it was concluded that the fatigue performance in wet conditions is considerably lower with a larger slip displacement due to the degradation behaviour of the grout annulus in lee et al 2016 the static and fatigue life under dry conditions was also investigated using seven high strength grouted connections under unidirectional cyclic loading during compression compressive strength grout materials of 125 mpa were considered with two different shear key configurations the fatigue test results of the five connections were compared to the design equations specified in the dnv design codes dnv 2014 in lee et al 2017 five large scaled high strength grouted connections with a compressive strength of 120 mpa were investigated by varying the shear key spacing and loading types recently experimental tests and analytical investigations considering different loading conditions have been widely conducted by many researchers chen et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b 2020 schaumann et al 2017 the test results in the literature it indicates that various important design parameters such as loading conditions the specimen geometry and the compression strength of grout materials may affect the fatigue performance of grouted connections although the previous studies attained meaningful findings for the fatigue behaviour of grouted connections it is still necessary to provide a better understanding of the comprehensive knowledge and general aspects of the fatigue performance because the test results in the literature were evaluated separately with a limited amount of test data within each test program which have different design parameters and loading conditions thus a comparative study using a wide range of fatigue test data from this study and the literature may provide a better understanding of fatigue life of high strength grouted connections considering various design parameters the aims of this study are to evaluate the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections considering different design parameters under various loading conditions and to present a simple design equation for unidirectional sinusoidal cyclic loading under dry conditions to achieve these goals comparative analysis studies using various design parameters such as stress ratio grout strength and shear key density are considered for experimental tests lee et al 2016 and in the test database of prior works 1980 2018 additionally in section 5 the test specimens are evaluated using nonlinear finite element analysis fea to consider the effects of the shear key spacings and failure modes based on the experimental tests the numerical evaluation and a comparative study the design equation in dnvgl 2018b is evaluated for both high strength and normal strength grouted connections especially when the connections are subjected to unidirectional cyclic loadings finally the general aspects of the effects of grout strength shear key density and stress ratio which influence the fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections are discussed in addition a design equation for the unidirectional cyclic loading condition under dry conditions is presented 2 design specifications for fatigue capacity of the grouted connections to design the fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections it is necessary to define both the static axial strength and the relationship between the ratio of the maximum applied axial loading to the static axial strength and the number of loading cycles meanwhile many of the design codes specify the static capacity under axial loading by considering two different failure modes grout failure and interfacial slippage the typical failure modes are shown in fig 2 in dnvgl 2018b and norsok 2013 the design strength under axial loading includes two different failure modes on the interfacial shear strength in which the interface shear capacity is attributed to the friction and crushing near the shear key and grout matrix failure thus the designer determines the strength of the grouted connections by selecting the lowest value among them equation 1 denotes the interface shear capacity obtained due to the friction and crushing near the shear key which can be explained by case b in fig 2 equation 2 denotes the interface shear capacity due to the grout matrix failure which can be explained by case a in fig 2 by selecting the lowest value from eq 1 and eq 2 the static axial strength of a shear key can be determined by substituting eq 1 or eq 2 into eq 3 the design load of a shear key can be calculated using eq 4 and the design strength achieved by one shear key can be determined using eq 5 the interfacial shear strength f b k attributed to the friction and crushing failure is as follows 1 f b k 800 d p 140 h s 0 8 k 0 6 f c k 0 3 and the interfacial shear strength f b k attributed to the grout matrix failure is given by 2 f b k 0 75 1 4 h s f c k 0 5 where k 2 r p t p 2 r s t s 1 e g e s 2 r s 2 t s t g 1 is the

uncertainty in iso 2007 design equations similar to dnvgl 2018b and norsok 2013 considering the two different failure modes which include the interface transfer strength for grout steel interface sliding and grout matrix shear failure are presented as follows the interface transfer strength for grout steel interface sliding f g s l i d i n g is defined as follows 6 f g s l i d i n g c p 2 140 h s 0 8 k 0 6 f c u 0 3 the interfacial shear strength by grout matrix failure f g s h e a r is defined as follows 7 f g s h e a r 0 75 1 4 h s f c u 0 5 where c p is the scale factor for the diameter

connection in api 2007 design equations are presented that applicable for grout compressive strengths of 17 75 110 mpa the static strength of the grouted connection is proportional to the ratio of the height to the spacing of the shear keys the equations are as follows for loading conditions 1 and 2 8 f b a 0 138 0 5 f c u h s and for loading conditions 3 and 4 9 f b a 0 184 0 67 f c u h s where f

and 2 are used when the environmental conditions combined with the dead and maximum live loads are appropriate for the normal operation of the platform loading conditions 3 and 4 are used in the design when the environmental conditions with dead and minimum live loads are appropriate for extreme conditions regarding fatigue design provisions for the grouted connection in the current design codes a lower bound design equation is specified in dnvgl 2018b for the fatigue limit state fls the design considering the fls of the grouted connection is based on the expected long term load history the relationship between the fatigue loading amplitude and number of cycles can be determined as follows 10 log n 5 4 8 y f o r y 0 3 log n 7 286 14 286 y f o r 0 16 y 0 3 log n 13 0 50 y f o r f x

current design codes that are most commonly used in offshore structures are summarised in table 1 and definitions of symbols for grouted connections are illustrated in fig 3 it can be observed from this table that the maximum design grout strength is limited to 80 110 mpa 3 experimental test program 3 1 test specimens it is important to design test specimens to reflect the realistic behaviour of grouted connections to achieve this the test specimens were designed to fulfil the design requirements specified in dnvgl 2018b the thicknesses of the piles and sleeves were carefully determined based on the current design specifications because a higher tube thickness may provide higher confinement of the grout annulus compared to realistic grouted connection designs according to lee et al 2017 and raba 2018 small scale test specimens with smaller slenderness ratios d t of the pile and sleeves could have an significantly improve the confinement effects of the grout annulus induced by the thicker pile and sleeve for realistic grouted connections the slenderness ratio is from 36 6 to 56 8 for sleeves and from 15 8 to 49 6 for piles therefore small scale test specimens were designed to fulfil the current design codes as strictly as possible the fatigue test specimens were designed with different shear key spacing values the piles and sleeves were designed to satisfy the ratio of diameter to thickness d t listed in table 1 the diameter and thickness of each pile were chosen to be 190 7 mm and 6 mm respectively and those of the sleeves were designed to be 267 4 mm and 6 mm respectively the pile and sleeves were constructed from a steel structural tubular section in which the design yielding and ultimate strengths were over 235 mpa and 400 mpa respectively a high strength grout with a compressive strength of 125 mpa was cast between the piles and sleeves cylinder specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm for grout specimens were cured for 28 days and tested using compression and split tensile tests the material properties of the yielding and ultimate strengths of the steel tubes were measured using the coupon test according to dnvgl 2018b the shear key height should be 5 mm or more and the shear key density should not exceed 0 1 however in this study considering small scale specimens the shear key height was determined to be 4 mm the shear keys were welded by welded beads to the surface of the pile and sleeves two eas for the piles and three eas for sleeves respectively the ratio of height to spacing was determined to be 0 067 0 075 to fulfil the condition of h s not exceeding 0 1 fig 4 shows the configuration of the specimens considered in this study the specimens were named the s60 and s80 series according to the shear key spacing s represents the for spacing of the shear key and 60 and 80 denote the spacing values st and ft denote the static and fatigue specimens respectively the measured material properties and dimensions of the specimens are summarised in tables 2 and 3 respectively the comparisons of the design parameters between the test specimens and design codes are presented in table 4 in this study the interfacial shear strength of each specimen was determined using static axial loading tests to estimate the actual interfacial shear strength of the specimens the static loading test specimens were constructed from two different specimens based on the spacing of the weld beads the fatigue specimens were also constructed based on the spacing of the weld beads with the same geometry and dimensions the specimens were constructed as shown in fig 5 first the piles and sleeves were attached to each loading plate the loading plate 25 mm thickness and pile and sleeve connections were fabricated by welding with a stiffener to prevent local buckling and to strengthen the connection parts next the weld bead shear keys were welded onto the outer surface of the piles and the inner surface of the sleeves for the welding process manual metal arc welding mma smaw or stick welding was adopted to form the weld bead shear keys and to connect each plate part after the welding process slags and spatters from the welding process near the weld beads were removed to improve the condition of both the weld beads and the interface of the steel tubes after the production of each part of the pile and sleeves these parts were fabricated to locate the proper positions of the weld beads as shown in fig 5 this was followed by grout casting 3 2 test set up fig 6 shows the setup of the loading and measurement devices of the fatigue test specimen each loading plate was connected to an actuator and a base plate with eight high strength bolts of 23 mm diameter each loading plates with a thickness of 25 mm were installed on both the top and bottom sides four linear variable differential transformers were installed at the sleeve parts to measure the dynamic response of the slip between the pile and sleeve and four strain gauges were attached along the tangential and vertical directions on the outer face of the sleeves at the centre of each shear key as shown in fig 6 b according to tebbett and billington 1985 the frequency of fatigue loading was 0 1 hz which represents the approximate north sea wave frequency for short term cyclic loading and that of long term cyclic loading was 3 hz a frequency of 0 1 hz can be considered as a large loading range which represents the short term cyclic loading while a frequency of 3 hz is used as a small loading such as the working cyclic loading range for long term periods in this study a uniaxial reversible sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 0 12 hz for a short term period and 3 hz for a long term period was applied within the range of the compression loading cycle for the wide range of cyclic loading which demonstrated an interfacial shear strength of over 400 kn a frequency of 0 12 hz was used for applied cyclic loading see fig 7 for a small range of cyclic loading which considers an interfacial shear strength under 400 kn a frequency of 3 hz was used for long term cyclic loading in the case of a frequency of 3 hz the dynamic response of the specimens was measured by a dynamic actuator and a data logger which could record the high frequency range for a frequency of 0 12 hz the quasi static response of the specimens was measured using a general purpose actuator and data logger and cyclic loading was applied by the actuator with a pressure capacity of 2000 kn the maximum load and loading frequency of each specimen are listed in table 5 4 test results 4 1 summary of test results when the static and fatigue tests were conducted on the seven grouted connections the fatigue life values of these connections were measured considering the loading cycle loading range and shear key spacing the ratio of the applied loading range to the static interfacial shear capacity y t e s t p m a x p s t a t i c can be calculated from the loading range p m a x divided by the static interfacial shear strength p s t a t i c the value of p s t a t i c which is the same as the maximum peak strength was

strength y t e s t maximum slip δ s l i p m a x permanent residual deformation δ p maximum number of cycles n and p s t a t i c after the fatigue test were obtained additionally the number of cycles was compared to the design fatigue life estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b refer to table 7 the dynamic responses of the relationship between the applied loading and slip of the pile and sleeve are shown in fig 9 the maximum slip and residual deformation between the pile and sleeves can be observed in this figure the fatigue failure of the s80 ft iii specimen which demonstrates the highest loading range was observed with very rapid and brittle failure the permanent residual deformation between the pile and sleeves with respect to the other specimens was measured although all the specimens were out of range in terms of the design fatigue life these specimens except for s80 ft iii did not exhibit any fatigue failure this type of fatigue behaviour is discussed and compared with the previously reported fatigue test results in the following section 4 2 evaluation of fatigue strength of specimens 4 2 1 specimens with a 3 hz loading cycle 1 s60 ft i specimen the s60 ft i specimen with a loading frequency of 3 hz for long term fatigue life was subjected to cyclic loading with a static strength of 35 the number of loading cycles estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b for the s60 ft i specimen was 409 although the number of loading cycles reached one million during the fatigue test no fatigue failure occurred the maximum relative slip between the pile and the sleeve was estimated to be 0 281 mm the failure displacement at static interfacial strength was estimated at 1 25 mm for the s60 st specimen and no fatigue failure was observed in this specimen 2 s80 ft i specimen the s80 ft i specimen with a loading frequency of 3 hz for long term fatigue life was applied with a cyclic loading of 25 of the static strength although the estimated number of fatigue loading cycles based on the code in dnvgl 2018b was calculated as 5 471 no failure occurred until the loading cycle of the specimen reached one million the maximum relative slip between the pile and the sleeve was estimated to be 0 248 mm with a slip of 3 04 mm at the peak static interfacial strength obtained from the static test of the s80 st specimen no fatigue failure was observed in this specimen 4 2 2 specimens with a 0 12 hz loading cycle 1 s60 ft ii specimen the s60 ft ii specimen with a loading frequency of 0 12 hz for short term fatigue life was applied with a cyclic loading of 74 of the static strength although the number of fatigue loading cycles was 4 800 no failure was observed in this specimen as the fatigue cycle was estimated at 0 1 based on dnvgl 2018b it showed a higher fatigue performance compared to the design code dnvgl 2018b after the fatigue test the residual static interfacial shear strength was measured using an axial static test the interfacial shear strength after the fatigue test was estimated as 1090 2 this value is close to that obtained in the static test results of the s60 st specimen 1147 4 kn the maximum slip and permanent residual deformations were estimated to be 0 976 and 0 564 respectively 2 s80 ft ii specimen the s80 ft ii specimen was subjected to 58 of static strength and the loading demonstrated a frequency of 0 12 this phenomenon is similar to that observed for s60 ft ii until the number of loading cycles reached 56 300 which was much higher than 5 8 as estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b no fatigue failure was observed after the fatigue test the residual static strength was determined using an axial static test the measured interfacial shear strength after the fatigue test was 1192 4 kn which was close to that obtained from the static test results of the s80 st specimen 1207 9 kn the maximum slip and permanent residual deformations were estimated to be 0 704 and 0 24 respectively 3 s80 ft iii specimen the s80 ft ii specimen was subjected to 83 static loading with a loading frequency of 0 12 in this case fatigue failure occurred with abrupt brittle failure accompanied by a large noise and vibration of the actuator during fatigue loading the number of loading cycles at fatigue failure is estimated to be 174 in addition fatigue failure occurred without any stiffness reduction residual static tests were performed to measure residual interfacial shear strength the residual interfacial shear strength was estimated as 1061 3 kn which was 87 9 of the value obtained through the static test results this implies that the strength reduction resulted from fatigue failure that occurred after the test the maximum slip and permanent residual deformation were estimated as 1 59 and 1 08 respectively 4 3 permanent slip between sleeves and piles it is important to check the slip displacement between the sleeves and the piles because the fatigue failure of the structures is type of the brittle failure mode corresponding to a significant displacement in this study the permanent slip displacements were chosen by residual slip displacements during the fatigue tests in which the residual slip displacements were chosen the minimum slip displacement of unloading branches of each loading cycle as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the relationships between the permanent slip displacement on the piles and sleeves and the number of cycles the fatigue test results show that the permanent slip displacements increased when the number of cycles and the maximum loading rate increased in the case of the s60 ft i and s80 ft i specimens which have a relatively low maximum loading rate under 35 of ultimate strength there is no significant increase in the permanent slip however the specimens with a high loading rate which include s60 ft ii s80 ft ii and s80 ft iii show relatively high permanent slip displacements in particular the s80 ft iii specimens which are considered as specimens with fatigue failure exhibited a considerable increase in the permanent slip displacement with 12 of the strength reduction at 174 cycles thus based on the permanent slip displacement evaluating the fatigue failure shows a reasonable prediction of the fatigue test results 4 4 response of steel tubes to estimate the failure mode of specimens between the fatigue of steel tubes and that of the grout annulus the dynamic response of the steel tubes was measured through the tangential and vertical strain gauges attached to the sleeves see fig 11 in general the fatigue failure of steel tubes is significantly critical when tensile loading is applied to the steel member in this study the vertical and tangential strains were measured to evaluate the failure of the steel tubes within the tensile stress range in the grouted connection the tensile stress can be developed in the tangential direction of the sleeves because the compressive stress can be applied only in the vertical direction of the sleeve and the vertical and tangential directions of the pile based on the test results of s80 ft iii in which fatigue failure was observed the strain components of the sleeve in the tangential direction were measured to be approximately 0 001 with 175 cycles considering the steel tube yielding strain ε y of 0 0016 and the low number of cycles fatigue failure could have occurred in the grout annulus for the stress level of the piles the maximum compressive stress can be estimated at 278 mpa with a lower yielding strength value 322 4 mpa in table 2 thus the yielding of the pile in the s80 ft iii specimen was not measured for the s60 ft ii specimens which have a high stress level of 74 of static capacity decreases in strain rates were observed for both vertical tangential directions as the number of cycles increased considering that the permanent load slip relationship in fig 10 increases after reaching 100 cycles and the decrease in the strain rates it may be assumed that a stress redistribution influenced by the higher stress rate of the applied loading with an increased permanent deformation was observed however fatigue failure was not observed until the number of cycles reached 4800 5 numerical analysis for estimating fatigue strength the fatigue capacities obtained in this study were compared with numerical estimations according to article 6 13 2 dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a and c2 7 in dnvgl st 0126 1 which are provisions for general cases of concrete structures and shear keyed grouted connections respectively the fatigue performance of the grouted connections can be estimated based on the maximum and minimum stresses and the design compressive strength the stress values can be obtained from the nonlinear fea which represents the realistic failure modes and behaviour by comparison with the experimental test results the fatigue life can be estimated using the following equations the provisions of article 6 13 2 in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a gives the following equations for the general case of concrete and grout materials for the fatigue life 11 log 10 n c 1 1 σ m a x c 5 f r d 1 σ m i n c 5 f r d where f r d is the compression strength for the

grouted connections in the air condition if the calculated design life log n is greater than the value of x given by 12 x c 1 1 σ m i n c 5 f r d 0 1 c 1 then the design life may be increased further by multiplying the value of log 10 n by the factor c 2 given as follows 13 c 2 1 0 2 log 10 n x 1 0 according to article c2 7 in dnvgl st 0126 dnvgl 2018b the s n curves for the grouted connections with shear keys could be chosen by model code 2010 mc2010 2013 and the required design value of the fatigue strength of the grout under compressive loading is given as follows 14 f c d f a t 0 85 β c

and β c c t is a coefficient that considers the time dependent strength increase in the grout 5 1 finite element analysis approaches in this study the static load slip relationships between the sleeves and the piles of the connections were evaluated based on an explicit fea the finite element fe models in which the specimens were modelled by rotational symmetric local fe models to reduce the total analysis time were modelled by an axisymmetric element cax4r with contact pairs between the steel tubes and the grout annulus to determine the friction between the steel tubes and the grout annulus a friction coefficient of 0 7 which is recommended in dnv 2014 for grout steel interfaces was used the separation after contact was applied to simulate a realistic load slip behaviour in the axisymmetric element the rotational symmetric boundary conditions were included the displacement loading on the sleeve end and fixed boundary conditions on the pile end were applied see fig 12 for the grout matrix concrete damaged plasticity cdp models were adopted to define the failure criterion the parameters of the cdp models were assumed to be 0 1 1 16 2 3 and 36 for ε σ b 0 σ c 0 k c and ψ

approaches and the adopted concrete constitutive model for high strength grout is presented 5 2 load slip relationships based on fe analysis the load slip relationships of the static test specimens were established based on the nonlinear analysis results the ultimate strength and slip displacements at the ultimate strength of the connections are compared in table 8 based on figs 14 and 15 the fea results show similar ultimate strength and slip behaviour to the experimental test results when 0 7 of the friction coefficients were used for the contact behaviour between the grout matrix and the steel tubes figs 14 and 15 show the load slip behaviour and failure modes on the grout matrix based on the fea the load slip curves in the static tests in figs 14 and 15 show several sudden load drops and recoveries after reaching the ultimate strength after several load drops in the post peak responses the applied load significantly decreased with large deformations for both the s60 and s80 specimens for the fea results of the s60 specimen in fig 14 b the initial slope is slightly steeper than the test results with a sudden load drop in the initial curves a decrease in stiffness which was not observed in the test results was then observed until reaching ultimate strength states subsequently the test and fea results for the s60 st specimens show several sudden drops and recoveries in the load slip behaviour for the fea results of the s80 specimens in fig 15 b the initial slope of the fea shows very similar trends to the test results of the s80 st specimen there are several discrepancies in the location of sudden drops and significant load drops after the ultimate strength between the fea and test results whereas the ultimate strength shows similar trends as listed in tables 6 and 7 these differences might be because the fea was conducted under idealised conditions without material and geometric imperfections and it is difficult to simulate large deformations considering the crack propagations in realistic behaviour in this study the failure modes of the grout were assumed by compression and tensile damage parameters in which the grout damage was assumed to start after the ultimate compressive and tensile strains of grout materials thus the grout region with a colourful contour was reached above the ultimate strain of both compression and tension based on fig 14 the progress of the failure was estimated based on the compression and tensile damages according to the failure modes the progression of grout failure can be summarised as follows 1 diagonal cracks were initiated near the adjacent shear key location of the pile and sleeves and a compression strut within the shear key location with or without crushing near the shear key developed 2 major diagonal cracks through the compression struts were created with considerable strength reductions 3 at the ultimate state the grouted connections could experience confinement of the grout matrix then the crushing area in the compression strut of the grout matrix widened with significant deformation the major difference between failure modes of the s60 st and s80 st specimens is the crushing failure mode near the shear key in the initial stages of the load slip behaviour these aspects can lead to a stress concentration on the shear key locations and it may also affect the fatigue behaviour of the grouted connections with degradation behaviour near the shear key locations in addition there is a considerable difference in the crushed area in the compression strut after the ultimate strength the grout matrix of the s60 st specimens was fully crushed between the adjacent shear key locations of the sleeves whereas those of the s80 st specimens were partially crushed between the adjacent shear key locations of the sleeves these differences may affect the confinement of the grout and the ductility of the connections these aspects of failure modes considering the effects of shear key spacings were also presented in the static tests of grouted connections conducted in lee et al 2017 5 3 evaluation of test results using design code based on fe analysis the fatigue capacities obtained from the experimental tests were compared with numerical estimations based on the provisions in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a the fatigue life can be estimated using eq 11 by using the maximum and minimum compressive stresses σ m a x σ m i n and the design strength f r d in this estimation as the design compressive strength is determined by the design unconfined concrete strength f c k which is different from the realistic material behaviour it could provide safe design values however the shear keyed grouted connections were exposed to the confinement of the grout matrix induced by the piles and the sleeves in this case hoop yielding could be the main failure mode with excessive confining stresses on the grout matrix in the real scaled specimens these aspects of the confinement of the grout matrix were discussed by lee et al 2017 because the stress assessment approaches in the design codes may provide a considerably conservative design value the maximum and minimum loading of the cyclic loading and ultimate strength expressed by the loading components were used for the fatigue assessment in this study moreover it is difficult to estimate the fatigue life based on the stress evaluation at certain positions such as the contact surface of the weld beads and the grout matrix because there could be a stress redistribution after the first reduction in strength in the realistic nonlinear load slip behaviour of the grouted connections thus the strength expressed by the load component can be used for simpler estimations for both the test and fea values of the grouted connections 22 log 10 n c 1 1 p m a x c 5 p s t a t i c t e s t 1 p m i n c 5 p s t a t i c t e s t o r log 10 n c 1 1 p m a x c 5 p s t a t i c f e a 1 p m i n c 5 p s t a t i c f e a the estimated fatigue life based on the design codes and numerical approaches are shown in table 9 in this comparison s60 ft i and s80 ft i specimens were excluded because their low stress range in which fatigue failures are not expected based on the literature thus the specimens with the high stress range were compared with the estimated fatigue life based on eq 11 fig 16 shows a comparison of the fatigue capacity between the test results and the estimation from eq 11 although the estimated fatigue life shows slightly different values the tendency of load levels and the number of cycles n showed a similar estimation between test values and estimation values 6 evaluation of fatigue strength based on the literature the fatigue capacities obtained in this study were compared with those obtained from previously conducted experimental tests numerous studies have been conducted on grouted connections with both normal strength and high strength grouts table 10 shows the parameters affecting the fatigue strength of high strength grouted connections as reported in the literature in several prior works the loading type frequency and stress ratio which is the ratio of the minimum to maximum applied loading shear key density and compressive strength of the grouted connections were considered however these connections demonstrated different geometries therefore a comprehensive understanding is necessary to appropriately evaluate the fatigue phenomenon and fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections in this study the effects of loading type stress ratio grout strength and shear key spacing were analyzed from the fatigue test data obtained from both the present study and the literature to evaluate the comprehensive fatigue performance of grouted connections 6 1 comparison of test results and the literature 6 1 1 comparison of high strength grouted connections the fatigue test results of this study with respect to the high strength grouted specimens were compared with the fatigue test data reported by previous researchers anders 2007 bechtel 2016 raba 2018 sørensen et al 2011 in anders 2007 numerous static and fatigue tests were conducted for small sized shear keyed grouted connections with grout compressive strengths of 110 170 mpa the maximum diameters of the sleeve and piles were 114 3 and 60 3 respectively some of the specimens in their study comprised steel fibres in the grout however in this study the test results obtained without steel fibres were used for comparison to avoid any additional effects generated by these fibres in their work fatigue loading with similar compression and tension amplitudes was applied this implies that the ratio of the maximum to minimum stress r f m i n f m a x is equal to 1 however the stress ratio in this study was estimated to be 0 0 067 another study on high strength grout was conducted in sørensen et al 2011 in this study cylinder specimens under dry and wet conditions with a grout compressive strength of 141 mpa were tested with 45 60 and 76 of the static compressive strength for cyclic loading and varied loading frequencies of 0 35 5 and 10 hz as in the case of this study the applied loading was within the compression stress range which was similar to the loading range of the present study the latest important findings on the fatigue performance under dry and wet conditions were conducted at leibniz university hannover in bechtel 2016 the fatigue performance of large scale grouted connections was evaluated under dry conditions with various loading scenarios within the compression loading range subsequently the fatigue behaviour of small scale fatigue tests and large scale fatigue test specimens under wet conditions was investigated in raba 2018 in their work the degradation behaviour of the fatigue loading under wet conditions and a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the grouted layer thickness loading rate and frequency on the submerged grouted connections were investigated in this study only small scale fatigue test results conducted in raba 2018 were compared with those in the literature and this study because the larger scaled specimens were subjected to various compression loadings during the test which may not be comparable with other studies for more detailed information a deep understanding of the degradation behaviour of the submerged grouted connection was presented in bechtel 2016 and raba 2018 fig 17 shows a comparison of the maximum amplitude of applied loading to static strength with the number of cycles in this study as well as in the literature the relationship between the number of cycles and the strength ratio for high strength grout specimens under dry conditions is located within a similar area above the dotted lines which are the approximate minimum fatigue life based on the test data in particular for the dry condition the results obtained by in sørensen et al 2011 for unidirectional cyclic loading with compression only showed a trend similar to that of this study both test results are located on the upper side of the results obtained in anders 2007 according to tebbett and billington 1985 full reversal cyclic loading with equal tensile and compression loadings when r is equal to 1 induced strength reduction due to the impact effect this is because simultaneously applied tensile and compression loadings can create voids behind the shear keys which can induce impact loading therefore the test results of the present study and those in sørensen et al 2011 without impact effects demonstrated higher values than those reported in anders 2007 for the fatigue test results in wet conditions there are limited test results in which only sørensen et al 2011 and raba 2018 are available in the literature the difference between their research was the geometry of the specimen and the maximum compression loading rate and frequency although sørensen et al 2011 investigated submerged grouted cylinder specimens the fatigue test results in wet conditions showed a good correlation with those of grouted connection specimens conducted in raba 2018 the fatigue performance in wet conditions could be approximately estimated by the dotted lines which are the approximate minimum fatigue life based on the test data in addition the fatigue life under wet conditions is less than that under dry conditions a more detailed estimation of the fatigue life according to geometry and frequency was presented in sørensen et al 2011 and raba 2018 respectively regarding the effects of frequencies it is typical that cyclic loading with a higher frequency reduces fatigue performance due to high speed cyclic loading however it is necessary to establish more fatigue test data for detailed comparisons 6 1 2 effect of stress ratio on fatigue capacity according to the literature loading types such as fully reversible sinusoidal loading and unidirectionally reversible loading have a significant influence on the fatigue failure of grouted connections in fully reversible sinusoidal loading the cyclic loading ranges from maximum compression to maximum tension in which the compression and tension demonstrate equal absolute amplitude loading however unidirectionally reversible loading was applied from zero minimum loading to maximum compression loading tebbett and billington 1985 reported that the displacement under a single application of static load was sufficient to generate voids behind the shear connectors however as the load was not reversible impact effects did not occur and no further deterioration of the connection could be recorded this implies that the voids behind the shear key demonstrate a significant impact on the fatigue capacity in fully reversible sinusoidal loading however there were no impact effects in the unidirectional cyclic loading condition in this study the effects of cyclic loading on the fatigue capacity values obtained in the present study and prior studies were evaluated the definitions of the applied loading types are summarised in table 11 and fig 18 a comparison of test results for r 0 fig 19 shows the fatigue test results obtained from this study and the literature when r is equal to or greater than zero in which the applied loading is uniaxial reversible sinusoidal loading with pure compression in this figure lines a and b denote simplified equations based on regression analysis in ingebrigtsen et al 1990 line a denotes the fatigue capacity of cyclic loading from zero to maximum compression stress condition r 0 and line b denotes the fatigue capacity of cyclic compression tension when the cyclic loading ratio is equal to 1 it can be observed from this figure that some of the test results of non deteriorated data denoted by arrow lines and those of cylinder specimens from sørensen et al 2011 when pmax pstatic is equal to 0 6 are under line a consequently considering the recently obtained fatigue test data line a suggested by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 overestimates the fatigue performance of high strength grout materials under an applied loading with a static strength of approximately 0 7 b comparison of test results for 1 r 0 fig 20 shows the fatigue test results reported in the literature when the applied loading condition is partially reversible sinusoidal in tension and compression in this figure lines a and b denote the simplified equations based on the regression analysis from the study conducted by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 it can be observed that the test results from the literature are almost above line a however there are insufficient data points obtained from vertec dnv 1984 in addition the test results from this study were not categorized with a specific value of r despite the lack of data points most of them were observed above line a as suggested by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 c comparison of test results for r 1 fig 21 shows the fatigue test results from the literature when r is equal to 1 in which the applied loading is fully reversible sinusoidal with similar absolute compression and tension values this figure shows a large scatter of data points under fully cyclic loading conditions the test results from the literature are almost below line a which is a unidirectional cyclic loading condition for the lower boundary line b which denotes a simplified equation for fully reversible cyclic loading under equal compression and tension does not show a reasonable estimation because numerous data from harwood et al 1996 and boswell and d mello boswell and d mello 1986 are located below b line the reason for the large scatter of data when r 1 is not clearly known this could be because the specimens in the literature demonstrate different shear key spacing configuration of shear keys grout strength and initial defectiveness on the voids behind shear keys during grout casting despite the difficulty in estimating a suitable fatigue capacity line b shows good agreement with recently obtained data from the test results in anders 2007 related to the high strength grouted connections however line b does not agree well with the test results in harwood et al 1996 and boswell and d mello 1986 6 1 3 effects of shear key spacing and grout strength on fatigue capacity according to harwood et al 1996 the fatigue performance declines as the shear key density increases it is mentioned in the study that it is difficult to determine the relationship between h s and fatigue performance with any degree of confidence as there are several small individual databases corresponding to different h s values although these databases still exist the effects of h s were evaluated based on the data obtained from the present study and previous research works to date fig 22 shows the effects of h s on the fatigue capacity according to different stress ratio values for r 0 no relevant database is available to determine the effects of h s on the fatigue damage the figure shows a contradictory trend compared to harwood et al 1996 when r 1 the fatigue performance tends to decline as the h s and grout strength decreases the results of studies conducted in anders 2007 and tebbett and billington 1985 with h s 0 012 showed that the fatigue performance decreased as the grout strength decreased to 69 mpa additionally the fatigue performance decreased as h s decreased these aspects regarding the h s ratio can be explained by the failure modes in the literature and are observed in section 5 2 before explaining the failure mechanisms of grouted connections under fatigue loading it is important to consider the failure mechanisms under static loading conditions to understand the fatigue failure mechanisms according to the static tests conducted in lee et al 2017 the ultimate strength of the grouted connections under static loading can be highly influenced by the confinement of grout materials induced by the total area of the outer and inner tubes between adjacent shear keys they concluded that crushing failure modes near the shear key are more likely to occur in the larger shear key spacing specimen because the larger shear key cases can possess a higher ultimate strength induced by the large confinement area compared to the small shear key cases the higher ultimate strength might cause a higher stress level on both the grout annulus and locations near the shear keys in the case of a larger shear key spacing the failure modes even in the initial loading stages could be governed by grout crushing near the shear keys similar aspects of the crushing failure near the shear keys at the initial loading stages for a larger shear key spacing case are observed in the fea results in fig 15 c if fatigue loading is applied the failure modes of considerable yielding in piles and sleeves due to the confinement of the grout annulus cannot occur because the fatigue loading is considerably lower than that of the ultimate strength states however it still has a higher load level near the shear key locations for larger shear key cases in conclusion the fatigue performance of grouted connections with larger shear key spacing which is a smaller value of h s can be lower than that of cases with a smaller shear key spacing these crushing failure modes near the shear keys due to higher stress levels are observed in the static and fatigue tests in the literature as shown in fig 23 thus it can be concluded that h s may contribute to the fatigue performance of grouted connections according to previous studies and this study additionally considering a higher stress level near the shear key the grout compressive strength can also play an important role in the fatigue performance as well however owing to the lack of a wide range of fatigue test data considering the effects of shear key spacings more fatigue test data considering various grout strengths and shear key densities are required to provide a more reasonable estimation of fatigue performance 6 2 comparison of test results and design provisions specific design equations for the fatigue capacity of grouted connections with a material reduction factor of 1 5 are stipulated in dnvgl 2018b in this study the design equations were compared and evaluated using the data from the fatigue test database obtained from the literature as shown in fig 24 the design equation covers the lower boundary of the test results as the overall fatigue data are located above the design equations it can safely determine the fatigue capacity of grouted connections according to harwood et al 1996 the stress ratio of lee side compression pile in practical constructions ranges between 0 7 and 0 4 for the design storm condition and 0 1 and 0 6 for the one year storm condition in general there is a simultaneous effect of both environmental loading conditions and the self weight of wind turbine towers or jacket structures on the stress ratio the stress ratio of the grouted connections can vary according to the combination of the loading conditions this implies that the design equation in dnvgl 2018b may lead to a safe design for designing practical grouted connections in other words the design equation in dnvgl 2018b achieves a safe design within the range of fully reversed cyclic loading conditions however the design equation may provide conservative results for the test results in anders 2007 related to high strength grouted connections under fully reversed cyclic loading conditions 6 3 design recommendations for r 0 according to bechtel 2016 and raba 2018 fully reversible cyclic loading with a loading ratio of r 1 is not likely for a realistic loading situation but represents a worst case scenario additionally in real structures fatigue loads with a relatively lower loading amplitude are unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression loads therefore it is important to estimate the proper fatigue capacity for the unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression loads for realistic design approaches fig 25 shows the fatigue test database for the unidirectional cyclic loading conditions as the fatigue test results in the literature show a large scatter the design equation can be assumed by a lower bound approximation of the test database in terms of conservative design approaches the presented design equation can be expressed as a logarithmic function that is a linear approximation in which the intercept of the y axis is equal to 1 which represents the static capacity therefore the design equations for unidirectional cyclic loading under dry conditions can be assumed as follows 23 y 0 054 ln x 1 7 conclusion in this study the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with shear keys was evaluated using the seven static and fatigue test specimens and numerical analysis additionally the effect of changes in the parameters on the fatigue capacity was analyzed based on a comparative study of the fatigue test data in the literature based on this study and comparative studies the following conclusions can be made 1 the fatigue test results with the five high strength grouted connections subjected to unidirectional cyclic loading show good agreement with both the cylinder fatigue test data conducted in sørensen et al 2011 and high strength and normal strength grouted connections under the same loading and environmental conditions dnv 1984 ingebrigtsen et al 1990 raba 2018 2 based on the fea of the static test specimens it was concluded that the larger shear key spacings could lead to crushing failure modes near the shear keys even from the initial stage of the loading whereas the grouted connections with smaller shear key spacings experienced diagonal cracking without crushing near the shear keys therefore in the case of larger shear key spacings a lower fatigue performance due to local failure near the shear keys may occur the assumed hypothesis of the effects of shear keys shows similar aspects to the fatigue test results conducted in anders 2007 3 the fatigue test data in this study were evaluated based on a numerical assessment approach using the nonlinear fea results and the provisions in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a the test results in this study provide a reasonable correlation with the assessment approach when using maximum and minimum loading and the ultimate strength of the specimens instead of using the stress values 4 the test results indicated that high strength grout demonstrates a substantial fatigue performance compared to the design equation specified in dnvgl 2018b based on the comparative study of the fatigue test data in the literature the design equation in dnvgl 2018b may provide conservative results for both the high strength and normal strength grouted connections especially when the unidirectional cyclic loadings are subjected to the connections 5 based on a comparative study it was revealed that the effects of the stress ratio r have a significant influence on the fatigue capacity of grouted connections the test data obtained with r 1 demonstrated a significant reduction in fatigue capacity whereas the test data obtained with r 0 demonstrated excellent fatigue performance 6 according to the literature bechtel 2016 raba 2018 unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression could be considered as a realistic fatigue loading scenario compared to the fully sinusoidal cyclic loading conditions which may represent severe loading cases thus in this study a tentative fatigue design equation for the grouted connections subjected to unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression under dry conditions was presented based on the present study and fatigue test data in the literature however because there is still a lack of fatigue test data with various parameters for unidirectional cyclic loading conditions in both dry and wet conditions it is necessary to establish more fatigue data with various shear key spacings which may influence on the failure modes realistic geometry of the connections low level frequencies under approximately 0 3 hz and different environmental conditions additionally fatigue data within the range of higher loading rates over 50 of the static strength under wet conditions are required for a more reasonable estimation of the submerged grouted connections credit authorship contribution statement jeonghwa lee conception and design of study acquisition of data formal analysis and or

20532,grouted connections have been widely used in offshore construction to connect two different sized cylindrical steel tubes these connections include pile to sleeve grouted connections for mono piles of wind turbine towers and pile to jacket leg grouted connections for jacket structures because the grouted connections in seawater are mainly subjected to environmental loadings induced by waves and wind loading high strength grouted connections have been widely applied in offshore structures to enhance the structural performance and to prevent fatigue failure generated by the cyclic environmental loading in this study the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with shear keys subjected to unidirectional reversible cyclic loadings in dry conditions was evaluated based on experimental tests numerical evaluations and comparative analysis based on a test database established using prior studies it was revealed that the grout strength shear key density and stress ratio have a significant influence on fatigue performance finally general aspects of effects of grout strength shear key density and stress ratio that influence the fatigue capacity of high strength

widely used in offshore construction to connect two different sized cylindrical steel tubes examples include pile to sleeve grouted connections for mono piles of wind turbine towers and pile to jacket leg grouted connections for jacket structures refer to fig 1 the grouted connection comprises two different sized steel tubes with and without shear keys and cementitious grout materials are infilled between them it possesses ring shaped shear keys between the pile and the sleeve so that interfacial shear strength can be achieved through the interlocking behaviour between the grout annulus and the shear keys of the pile and sleeve because grouted connections in seawater are mainly subjected to long term environmental loadings induced by waves and wind loading fatigue assessment is one of the key issues in grouted connection design to prevent fatigue failure from long term cyclic loading increasing the grout strength could be an effective method for enhancing the interfacial shear capacity of grouted connections thus high strength grouted connections with over 140 mpa of structural grout have been widely employed in offshore structures although there are several design codes commonly used for grouted connections in offshore engineering api 2007 dnvgl 2018b iso 2007 norsok 2013 the fatigue design equations for predicting the grout failure modes of grouted connections are stipulated in the dnvgl design code dnvgl 2018b the presented design equations in dnvgl are considered as a lower bound solution which covers iso fatigue test data with a wide range of load cycles bechtel 2016 harwood et al 1996 however other design codes do not provide clear information on the fatigue design of grout connections moreover the current design provisions do not provide the limits of compressive strength of grouts for fatigue design but provide a maximum grout compressive strength of 80 mpa iso 2007 norsok 2013 and 110 mpa api 2007 for ultimate limit states thus further studies on the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with a compressive strength greater than 80 mpa are required to achieve both more efficient and improved design practices the fatigue performance of grouted connections has been evaluated by many researchers in billington and tebbett 1980 a pioneering study was conducted in which fatigue tests with five shear key samples under zero mean stress and equal tension compression cycles were performed with loading frequencies of 0 1 hz and 3 hz for short term and long term environmental loadings respectively they reported that the fatigue performance demonstrates a linear relationship between the stress range and the cyclic number on a log scale with an apparent endurance limit of approximately 40 of the ultimate strength under which fatigue damage does not occur tebbett and billington 1985 validated the results of their study conducted in 1980 billington and tebbett 1980 with additional data samples a total of 11 experimental samples in boswell and d mello boswell and d mello 1986 fatigue tests were conducted on ten grouted connection samples with shear keys under a fully reversible cyclic loading condition in their work loading frequencies of 0 1 hz and 0 5 hz were applied to describe the typical wave action of the north sea they concluded that higher strength grout has a relatively poor fatigue performance compared with lower strength grout the fatigue performance value obtained in this study was approximately half of the critical values of lower strength specimens predicted in previous studies works billington and tebbett 1980 tebbett 1987 tebbett and billington 1985 however the influence of additional parameters such as the connection type and shear key configuration has not been investigated dallyn et al 2015 in ingebrigtsen et al 1990 the fatigue performance of 68 plain pipe and 96 shear key samples was investigated they confirmed that the plain pipe connections were highly resistant to dynamic loading while those with shear key samples appeared to be less resistant than their respective higher static strength for tensile compressive loading in harwood et al 1996 several experimental tests were evaluated with normal strength grout 10 80 mpa under a fully reversible cyclic loading condition previously conducted by the uk department of energy oth 1986 they concluded that the fatigue strength reduction could result from early age cyclic movement and increasing shear key spacing h s in hordyk 1996 the experimental tests previously conducted by the uk department of energy oth 1986 and dnv dnv 1984 were also evaluated they discussed the effects of shear key spacing and the stress ratio r which is the ratio between the maximum and minimum stress levels r f m i n f m a x o r p m i n p m a x from fatigue loading as the usage of high performance materials has been a more common practice in recent times experimental tests on high strength grouted connections using compressive strength above 80 mpa have been conducted by many researchers in etterdal et al 2001 the use of high strength grout compressive strengths of 140 mpa and 213 mpa was investigated to strengthen offshore steel tubular components in anders 2007 and anders and lohaus 2008 static and fatigue loading tests were conducted on small high strength grouted connections with and without steel fibres in a grout admixture under fully reversible cyclic loading the fatigue test results in their study showed that fatigue performance can be influenced by different compressive strengths of grout and shear key spacing it was reported that the failure modes of high strength grouted connections obtained with 110 mpa and 170 mpa compressive strength grout materials were very similar to those reported in prior research in sørensen et al 2011 the fatigue life of cylindrical specimens was investigated where the diameter and height of the specimens was 60 mm and 120 mm respectively constructed using high strength grout specimens with a compressive strength of 141 mpa under unidirectional reversible cyclic loading in compression they considered two different environmental conditions namely air and water they confirmed that the grout specimens in water conditions have a lower fatigue life than those under air conditions the latest important study of fatigue performance under dry and wet conditions was conducted at leibniz university hannover where the fatigue performance of grouted connections under unidirectional cyclic loading conditions during compression was evaluated bechtel 2016 grout material compressive strengths of 90 mpa and 140 mpa were considered for jacket structures under dry conditions subsequently the fatigue behaviour of submerged axially loaded grouted connections in wet conditions were investigated for 90 mpa and 140 mpa grout materials raba 2018 in this study a deep understanding of the degradation behaviour of fatigue loading under dry and wet conditions was achieved with both small and large scale fatigue test specimens under unidirectional cyclic loading in compression the results provided a comprehensive understanding of the effects of grouted layer thickness on the submerged grouted connections for two different ambient conditions as well as various loading levels and loading frequencies additionally it was concluded that the fatigue performance in wet conditions is considerably lower with a larger slip displacement due to the degradation behaviour of the grout annulus in lee et al 2016 the static and fatigue life under dry conditions was also investigated using seven high strength grouted connections under unidirectional cyclic loading during compression compressive strength grout materials of 125 mpa were considered with two different shear key configurations the fatigue test results of the five connections were compared to the design equations specified in the dnv design codes dnv 2014 in lee et al 2017 five large scaled high strength grouted connections with a compressive strength of 120 mpa were investigated by varying the shear key spacing and loading types recently experimental tests and analytical investigations considering different loading conditions have been widely conducted by many researchers chen et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b 2020 schaumann et al 2017 the test results in the literature it indicates that various important design parameters such as loading conditions the specimen geometry and the compression strength of grout materials may affect the fatigue performance of grouted connections although the previous studies attained meaningful findings for the fatigue behaviour of grouted connections it is still necessary to provide a better understanding of the comprehensive knowledge and general aspects of the fatigue performance because the test results in the literature were evaluated separately with a limited amount of test data within each test program which have different design parameters and loading conditions thus a comparative study using a wide range of fatigue test data from this study and the literature may provide a better understanding of fatigue life of high strength grouted connections considering various design parameters the aims of this study are to evaluate the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections considering different design parameters under various loading conditions and to present a simple design equation for unidirectional sinusoidal cyclic loading under dry conditions to achieve these goals comparative analysis studies using various design parameters such as stress ratio grout strength and shear key density are considered for experimental tests lee et al 2016 and in the test database of prior works 1980 2018 additionally in section 5 the test specimens are evaluated using nonlinear finite element analysis fea to consider the effects of the shear key spacings and failure modes based on the experimental tests the numerical evaluation and a comparative study the design equation in dnvgl 2018b is evaluated for both high strength and normal strength grouted connections especially when the connections are subjected to unidirectional cyclic loadings finally the general aspects of the effects of grout strength shear key density and stress ratio which influence the fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections are discussed in addition a design equation for the unidirectional cyclic loading condition under dry conditions is presented 2 design specifications for fatigue capacity of the grouted connections to design the fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections it is necessary to define both the static axial strength and the relationship between the ratio of the maximum applied axial loading to the static axial strength and the number of loading cycles meanwhile many of the design codes specify the static capacity under axial loading by considering two different failure modes grout failure and interfacial slippage the typical failure modes are shown in fig 2 in dnvgl 2018b and norsok 2013 the design strength under axial loading includes two different failure modes on the interfacial shear strength in which the interface shear capacity is attributed to the friction and crushing near the shear key and grout matrix failure thus the designer determines the strength of the grouted connections by selecting the lowest value among them equation 1 denotes the interface shear capacity obtained due to the friction and crushing near the shear key which can be explained by case b in fig 2 equation 2 denotes the interface shear capacity due to the grout matrix failure which can be explained by case a in fig 2 by selecting the lowest value from eq 1 and eq 2 the static axial strength of a shear key can be determined by substituting eq 1 or eq 2 into eq 3 the design load of a shear key can be calculated using eq 4 and the design strength achieved by one shear key can be determined using eq 5 the interfacial shear strength f b k attributed to the friction and crushing failure is as follows 1 f b k 800 d p 140 h s 0 8 k 0 6 f c k 0 3 and the interfacial shear strength f b k attributed to the grout matrix failure is given by 2 f b k 0 75 1 4 h s f c k 0 5 where k 2 r p t p 2 r s t s 1 e g e s 2 r s 2 t s t g 1 is the

uncertainty in iso 2007 design equations similar to dnvgl 2018b and norsok 2013 considering the two different failure modes which include the interface transfer strength for grout steel interface sliding and grout matrix shear failure are presented as follows the interface transfer strength for grout steel interface sliding f g s l i d i n g is defined as follows 6 f g s l i d i n g c p 2 140 h s 0 8 k 0 6 f c u 0 3 the interfacial shear strength by grout matrix failure f g s h e a r is defined as follows 7 f g s h e a r 0 75 1 4 h s f c u 0 5 where c p is the scale factor for the diameter

connection in api 2007 design equations are presented that applicable for grout compressive strengths of 17 75 110 mpa the static strength of the grouted connection is proportional to the ratio of the height to the spacing of the shear keys the equations are as follows for loading conditions 1 and 2 8 f b a 0 138 0 5 f c u h s and for loading conditions 3 and 4 9 f b a 0 184 0 67 f c u h s where f

and 2 are used when the environmental conditions combined with the dead and maximum live loads are appropriate for the normal operation of the platform loading conditions 3 and 4 are used in the design when the environmental conditions with dead and minimum live loads are appropriate for extreme conditions regarding fatigue design provisions for the grouted connection in the current design codes a lower bound design equation is specified in dnvgl 2018b for the fatigue limit state fls the design considering the fls of the grouted connection is based on the expected long term load history the relationship between the fatigue loading amplitude and number of cycles can be determined as follows 10 log n 5 4 8 y f o r y 0 3 log n 7 286 14 286 y f o r 0 16 y 0 3 log n 13 0 50 y f o r f x

current design codes that are most commonly used in offshore structures are summarised in table 1 and definitions of symbols for grouted connections are illustrated in fig 3 it can be observed from this table that the maximum design grout strength is limited to 80 110 mpa 3 experimental test program 3 1 test specimens it is important to design test specimens to reflect the realistic behaviour of grouted connections to achieve this the test specimens were designed to fulfil the design requirements specified in dnvgl 2018b the thicknesses of the piles and sleeves were carefully determined based on the current design specifications because a higher tube thickness may provide higher confinement of the grout annulus compared to realistic grouted connection designs according to lee et al 2017 and raba 2018 small scale test specimens with smaller slenderness ratios d t of the pile and sleeves could have an significantly improve the confinement effects of the grout annulus induced by the thicker pile and sleeve for realistic grouted connections the slenderness ratio is from 36 6 to 56 8 for sleeves and from 15 8 to 49 6 for piles therefore small scale test specimens were designed to fulfil the current design codes as strictly as possible the fatigue test specimens were designed with different shear key spacing values the piles and sleeves were designed to satisfy the ratio of diameter to thickness d t listed in table 1 the diameter and thickness of each pile were chosen to be 190 7 mm and 6 mm respectively and those of the sleeves were designed to be 267 4 mm and 6 mm respectively the pile and sleeves were constructed from a steel structural tubular section in which the design yielding and ultimate strengths were over 235 mpa and 400 mpa respectively a high strength grout with a compressive strength of 125 mpa was cast between the piles and sleeves cylinder specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm for grout specimens were cured for 28 days and tested using compression and split tensile tests the material properties of the yielding and ultimate strengths of the steel tubes were measured using the coupon test according to dnvgl 2018b the shear key height should be 5 mm or more and the shear key density should not exceed 0 1 however in this study considering small scale specimens the shear key height was determined to be 4 mm the shear keys were welded by welded beads to the surface of the pile and sleeves two eas for the piles and three eas for sleeves respectively the ratio of height to spacing was determined to be 0 067 0 075 to fulfil the condition of h s not exceeding 0 1 fig 4 shows the configuration of the specimens considered in this study the specimens were named the s60 and s80 series according to the shear key spacing s represents the for spacing of the shear key and 60 and 80 denote the spacing values st and ft denote the static and fatigue specimens respectively the measured material properties and dimensions of the specimens are summarised in tables 2 and 3 respectively the comparisons of the design parameters between the test specimens and design codes are presented in table 4 in this study the interfacial shear strength of each specimen was determined using static axial loading tests to estimate the actual interfacial shear strength of the specimens the static loading test specimens were constructed from two different specimens based on the spacing of the weld beads the fatigue specimens were also constructed based on the spacing of the weld beads with the same geometry and dimensions the specimens were constructed as shown in fig 5 first the piles and sleeves were attached to each loading plate the loading plate 25 mm thickness and pile and sleeve connections were fabricated by welding with a stiffener to prevent local buckling and to strengthen the connection parts next the weld bead shear keys were welded onto the outer surface of the piles and the inner surface of the sleeves for the welding process manual metal arc welding mma smaw or stick welding was adopted to form the weld bead shear keys and to connect each plate part after the welding process slags and spatters from the welding process near the weld beads were removed to improve the condition of both the weld beads and the interface of the steel tubes after the production of each part of the pile and sleeves these parts were fabricated to locate the proper positions of the weld beads as shown in fig 5 this was followed by grout casting 3 2 test set up fig 6 shows the setup of the loading and measurement devices of the fatigue test specimen each loading plate was connected to an actuator and a base plate with eight high strength bolts of 23 mm diameter each loading plates with a thickness of 25 mm were installed on both the top and bottom sides four linear variable differential transformers were installed at the sleeve parts to measure the dynamic response of the slip between the pile and sleeve and four strain gauges were attached along the tangential and vertical directions on the outer face of the sleeves at the centre of each shear key as shown in fig 6 b according to tebbett and billington 1985 the frequency of fatigue loading was 0 1 hz which represents the approximate north sea wave frequency for short term cyclic loading and that of long term cyclic loading was 3 hz a frequency of 0 1 hz can be considered as a large loading range which represents the short term cyclic loading while a frequency of 3 hz is used as a small loading such as the working cyclic loading range for long term periods in this study a uniaxial reversible sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 0 12 hz for a short term period and 3 hz for a long term period was applied within the range of the compression loading cycle for the wide range of cyclic loading which demonstrated an interfacial shear strength of over 400 kn a frequency of 0 12 hz was used for applied cyclic loading see fig 7 for a small range of cyclic loading which considers an interfacial shear strength under 400 kn a frequency of 3 hz was used for long term cyclic loading in the case of a frequency of 3 hz the dynamic response of the specimens was measured by a dynamic actuator and a data logger which could record the high frequency range for a frequency of 0 12 hz the quasi static response of the specimens was measured using a general purpose actuator and data logger and cyclic loading was applied by the actuator with a pressure capacity of 2000 kn the maximum load and loading frequency of each specimen are listed in table 5 4 test results 4 1 summary of test results when the static and fatigue tests were conducted on the seven grouted connections the fatigue life values of these connections were measured considering the loading cycle loading range and shear key spacing the ratio of the applied loading range to the static interfacial shear capacity y t e s t p m a x p s t a t i c can be calculated from the loading range p m a x divided by the static interfacial shear strength p s t a t i c the value of p s t a t i c which is the same as the maximum peak strength was determined by static loading tests the slip at peak strength δ s l i p p e a k was also determined from the test results refer to fig 8 and table 6 the ratio of the applied loading range to static strength y t e s t maximum slip δ s l i p m a x permanent residual deformation δ p maximum number of cycles n and p s t a t i c after the fatigue test were obtained additionally the number of cycles was compared to the design fatigue life estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b refer to table 7 the dynamic responses of the relationship between the applied loading and slip of the pile and sleeve are shown in fig 9 the maximum slip and residual deformation between the pile and sleeves can be observed in this figure the fatigue failure of the s80 ft iii specimen which demonstrates the highest loading range was observed with very rapid and brittle failure the permanent residual deformation between the pile and sleeves with respect to the other specimens was measured although all the specimens were out of range in terms of the design fatigue life these specimens except for s80 ft iii did not exhibit any fatigue failure this type of fatigue behaviour is discussed and compared with the previously reported fatigue test results in the following section 4 2 evaluation of fatigue strength of specimens 4 2 1 specimens with a 3 hz loading cycle 1 s60 ft i specimen the s60 ft i specimen with a loading frequency of 3 hz for long term fatigue life was subjected to cyclic loading with a static strength of 35 the number of loading cycles estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b for the s60 ft i specimen was 409 although the number of loading cycles reached one million during the fatigue test no fatigue failure occurred the maximum relative slip between the pile and the sleeve was estimated to be 0 281 mm the failure displacement at static interfacial strength was estimated at 1 25 mm for the s60 st specimen and no fatigue failure was observed in this specimen 2 s80 ft i specimen the s80 ft i specimen with a loading frequency of 3 hz for long term fatigue life was applied with a cyclic loading of 25 of the static strength although the estimated number of fatigue loading cycles based on the code in dnvgl 2018b was calculated as 5 471 no failure occurred until the loading cycle of the specimen reached one million the maximum relative slip between the pile and the sleeve was estimated to be 0 248 mm with a slip of 3 04 mm at the peak static interfacial strength obtained from the static test of the s80 st specimen no fatigue failure was observed in this specimen 4 2 2 specimens with a 0 12 hz loading cycle 1 s60 ft ii specimen the s60 ft ii specimen with a loading frequency of 0 12 hz for short term fatigue life was applied with a cyclic loading of 74 of the static strength although the number of fatigue loading cycles was 4 800 no failure was observed in this specimen as the fatigue cycle was estimated at 0 1 based on dnvgl 2018b it showed a higher fatigue performance compared to the design code dnvgl 2018b after the fatigue test the residual static interfacial shear strength was measured using an axial static test the interfacial shear strength after the fatigue test was estimated as 1090 2 this value is close to that obtained in the static test results of the s60 st specimen 1147 4 kn the maximum slip and permanent residual deformations were estimated to be 0 976 and 0 564 respectively 2 s80 ft ii specimen the s80 ft ii specimen was subjected to 58 of static strength and the loading demonstrated a frequency of 0 12 this phenomenon is similar to that observed for s60 ft ii until the number of loading cycles reached 56 300 which was much higher than 5 8 as estimated by the code in dnvgl 2018b no fatigue failure was observed after the fatigue test the residual static strength was determined using an axial static test the measured interfacial shear strength after the fatigue test was 1192 4 kn which was close to that obtained from the static test results of the s80 st specimen 1207 9 kn the maximum slip and permanent residual deformations were estimated to be 0 704 and 0 24 respectively 3 s80 ft iii specimen the s80 ft ii specimen was subjected to 83 static loading with a loading frequency of 0 12 in this case fatigue failure occurred with abrupt brittle failure accompanied by a large noise and vibration of the actuator during fatigue loading the number of loading cycles at fatigue failure is estimated to be 174 in addition fatigue failure occurred without any stiffness reduction residual static tests were performed to measure residual interfacial shear strength the residual interfacial shear strength was estimated as 1061 3 kn which was 87 9 of the value obtained through the static test results this implies that the strength reduction resulted from fatigue failure that occurred after the test the maximum slip and permanent residual deformation were estimated as 1 59 and 1 08 respectively 4 3 permanent slip between sleeves and piles it is important to check the slip displacement between the sleeves and the piles because the fatigue failure of the structures is type of the brittle failure mode corresponding to a significant displacement in this study the permanent slip displacements were chosen by residual slip displacements during the fatigue tests in which the residual slip displacements were chosen the minimum slip displacement of unloading branches of each loading cycle as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the relationships between the permanent slip displacement on the piles and sleeves and the number of cycles the fatigue test results show that the permanent slip displacements increased when the number of cycles and the maximum loading rate increased in the case of the s60 ft i and s80 ft i specimens which have a relatively low maximum loading rate under 35 of ultimate strength there is no significant increase in the permanent slip however the specimens with a high loading rate which include s60 ft ii s80 ft ii and s80 ft iii show relatively high permanent slip displacements in particular the s80 ft iii specimens which are considered as specimens with fatigue failure exhibited a considerable increase in the permanent slip displacement with 12 of the strength reduction at 174 cycles thus based on the permanent slip displacement evaluating the fatigue failure shows a reasonable prediction of the fatigue test results 4 4 response of steel tubes to estimate the failure mode of specimens between the fatigue of steel tubes and that of the grout annulus the dynamic response of the steel tubes was measured through the tangential and vertical strain gauges attached to the sleeves see fig 11 in general the fatigue failure of steel tubes is significantly critical when tensile loading is applied to the steel member in this study the vertical and tangential strains were measured to evaluate the failure of the steel tubes within the tensile stress range in the grouted connection the tensile stress can be developed in the tangential direction of the sleeves because the compressive stress can be applied only in the vertical direction of the sleeve and the vertical and tangential directions of the pile based on the test results of s80 ft iii in which fatigue failure was observed the strain components of the sleeve in the tangential direction were measured to be approximately 0 001 with 175 cycles considering the steel tube yielding strain ε y of 0 0016 and the low number of cycles fatigue failure could have occurred in the grout annulus for the stress level of the piles the maximum compressive stress can be estimated at 278 mpa with a lower yielding strength value 322 4 mpa in table 2 thus the yielding of the pile in the s80 ft iii specimen was not measured for the s60 ft ii specimens which have a high stress level of 74 of static capacity decreases in strain rates were observed for both vertical tangential directions as the number of cycles increased considering that the permanent load slip relationship in fig 10 increases after reaching 100 cycles and the decrease in the strain rates it may be assumed that a stress redistribution influenced by the higher stress rate of the applied loading with an increased permanent deformation was observed however fatigue failure was not observed until the number of cycles reached 4800 5 numerical analysis for estimating fatigue strength the fatigue capacities obtained in this study were compared with numerical estimations according to article 6 13 2 dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a and c2 7 in dnvgl st 0126 1 which are provisions for general cases of concrete structures and shear keyed grouted connections respectively the fatigue performance of the grouted connections can be estimated based on the maximum and minimum stresses and the design compressive strength the stress values can be obtained from the nonlinear fea which represents the realistic failure modes and behaviour by comparison with the experimental test results the fatigue life can be estimated using the following equations the provisions of article 6 13 2 in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a gives the following equations for the general case of concrete and grout materials for the fatigue life 11 log 10 n c 1 1 σ m a x c 5 f r d 1 σ m i n c 5 f r d where f r d is the compression strength for the

grouted connections in the air condition if the calculated design life log n is greater than the value of x given by 12 x c 1 1 σ m i n c 5 f r d 0 1 c 1 then the design life may be increased further by multiplying the value of log 10 n by the factor c 2 given as follows 13 c 2 1 0 2 log 10 n x 1 0 according to article c2 7 in dnvgl st 0126 dnvgl 2018b the s n curves for the grouted connections with shear keys could be chosen by model code 2010 mc2010 2013 and the required design value of the fatigue strength of the grout under compressive loading is given as follows 14 f c d f a t 0 85 β c

and β c c t is a coefficient that considers the time dependent strength increase in the grout 5 1 finite element analysis approaches in this study the static load slip relationships between the sleeves and the piles of the connections were evaluated based on an explicit fea the finite element fe models in which the specimens were modelled by rotational symmetric local fe models to reduce the total analysis time were modelled by an axisymmetric element cax4r with contact pairs between the steel tubes and the grout annulus to determine the friction between the steel tubes and the grout annulus a friction coefficient of 0 7 which is recommended in dnv 2014 for grout steel interfaces was used the separation after contact was applied to simulate a realistic load slip behaviour in the axisymmetric element the rotational symmetric boundary conditions were included the displacement loading on the sleeve end and fixed boundary conditions on the pile end were applied see fig 12 for the grout matrix concrete damaged plasticity cdp models were adopted to define the failure criterion the parameters of the cdp models were assumed to be 0 1 1 16 2 3 and 36 for ε σ b 0 σ c 0 k c and ψ

approaches and the adopted concrete constitutive model for high strength grout is presented 5 2 load slip relationships based on fe analysis the load slip relationships of the static test specimens were established based on the nonlinear analysis results the ultimate strength and slip displacements at the ultimate strength of the connections are compared in table 8 based on figs 14 and 15 the fea results show similar ultimate strength and slip behaviour to the experimental test results when 0 7 of the friction coefficients were used for the contact behaviour between the grout matrix and the steel tubes figs 14 and 15 show the load slip behaviour and failure modes on the grout matrix based on the fea the load slip curves in the static tests in figs 14 and 15 show several sudden load drops and recoveries after reaching the ultimate strength after several load drops in the post peak responses the applied load significantly decreased with large deformations for both the s60 and s80 specimens for the fea results of the s60 specimen in fig 14 b the initial slope is slightly steeper than the test results with a sudden load drop in the initial curves a decrease in stiffness which was not observed in the test results was then observed until reaching ultimate strength states subsequently the test and fea results for the s60 st specimens show several sudden drops and recoveries in the load slip behaviour for the fea results of the s80 specimens in fig 15 b the initial slope of the fea shows very similar trends to the test results of the s80 st specimen there are several discrepancies in the location of sudden drops and significant load drops after the ultimate strength between the fea and test results whereas the ultimate strength shows similar trends as listed in tables 6 and 7 these differences might be because the fea was conducted under idealised conditions without material and geometric imperfections and it is difficult to simulate large deformations considering the crack propagations in realistic behaviour in this study the failure modes of the grout were assumed by compression and tensile damage parameters in which the grout damage was assumed to start after the ultimate compressive and tensile strains of grout materials thus the grout region with a colourful contour was reached above the ultimate strain of both compression and tension based on fig 14 the progress of the failure was estimated based on the compression and tensile damages according to the failure modes the progression of grout failure can be summarised as follows 1 diagonal cracks were initiated near the adjacent shear key location of the pile and sleeves and a compression strut within the shear key location with or without crushing near the shear key developed 2 major diagonal cracks through the compression struts were created with considerable strength reductions 3 at the ultimate state the grouted connections could experience confinement of the grout matrix then the crushing area in the compression strut of the grout matrix widened with significant deformation the major difference between failure modes of the s60 st and s80 st specimens is the crushing failure mode near the shear key in the initial stages of the load slip behaviour these aspects can lead to a stress concentration on the shear key locations and it may also affect the fatigue behaviour of the grouted connections with degradation behaviour near the shear key locations in addition there is a considerable difference in the crushed area in the compression strut after the ultimate strength the grout matrix of the s60 st specimens was fully crushed between the adjacent shear key locations of the sleeves whereas those of the s80 st specimens were partially crushed between the adjacent shear key locations of the sleeves these differences may affect the confinement of the grout and the ductility of the connections these aspects of failure modes considering the effects of shear key spacings were also presented in the static tests of grouted connections conducted in lee et al 2017 5 3 evaluation of test results using design code based on fe analysis the fatigue capacities obtained from the experimental tests were compared with numerical estimations based on the provisions in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a the fatigue life can be estimated using eq 11 by using the maximum and minimum compressive stresses σ m a x σ m i n and the design strength f r d in this estimation as the design compressive strength is determined by the design unconfined concrete strength f c k which is different from the realistic material behaviour it could provide safe design values however the shear keyed grouted connections were exposed to the confinement of the grout matrix induced by the piles and the sleeves in this case hoop yielding could be the main failure mode with excessive confining stresses on the grout matrix in the real scaled specimens these aspects of the confinement of the grout matrix were discussed by lee et al 2017 because the stress assessment approaches in the design codes may provide a considerably conservative design value the maximum and minimum loading of the cyclic loading and ultimate strength expressed by the loading components were used for the fatigue assessment in this study moreover it is difficult to estimate the fatigue life based on the stress evaluation at certain positions such as the contact surface of the weld beads and the grout matrix because there could be a stress redistribution after the first reduction in strength in the realistic nonlinear load slip behaviour of the grouted connections thus the strength expressed by the load component can be used for simpler estimations for both the test and fea values of the grouted connections 22 log 10 n c 1 1 p m a x c 5 p s t a t i c t e s t 1 p m i n c 5 p s t a t i c t e s t o r log 10 n c 1 1 p m a x c 5 p s t a t i c f e a 1 p m i n c 5 p s t a t i c f e a the estimated fatigue life based on the design codes and numerical approaches are shown in table 9 in this comparison s60 ft i and s80 ft i specimens were excluded because their low stress range in which fatigue failures are not expected based on the literature thus the specimens with the high stress range were compared with the estimated fatigue life based on eq 11 fig 16 shows a comparison of the fatigue capacity between the test results and the estimation from eq 11 although the estimated fatigue life shows slightly different values the tendency of load levels and the number of cycles n showed a similar estimation between test values and estimation values 6 evaluation of fatigue strength based on the literature the fatigue capacities obtained in this study were compared with those obtained from previously conducted experimental tests numerous studies have been conducted on grouted connections with both normal strength and high strength grouts table 10 shows the parameters affecting the fatigue strength of high strength grouted connections as reported in the literature in several prior works the loading type frequency and stress ratio which is the ratio of the minimum to maximum applied loading shear key density and compressive strength of the grouted connections were considered however these connections demonstrated different geometries therefore a comprehensive understanding is necessary to appropriately evaluate the fatigue phenomenon and fatigue capacity of high strength grouted connections in this study the effects of loading type stress ratio grout strength and shear key spacing were analyzed from the fatigue test data obtained from both the present study and the literature to evaluate the comprehensive fatigue performance of grouted connections 6 1 comparison of test results and the literature 6 1 1 comparison of high strength grouted connections the fatigue test results of this study with respect to the high strength grouted specimens were compared with the fatigue test data reported by previous researchers anders 2007 bechtel 2016 raba 2018 sørensen et al 2011 in anders 2007 numerous static and fatigue tests were conducted for small sized shear keyed grouted connections with grout compressive strengths of 110 170 mpa the maximum diameters of the sleeve and piles were 114 3 and 60 3 respectively some of the specimens in their study comprised steel fibres in the grout however in this study the test results obtained without steel fibres were used for comparison to avoid any additional effects generated by these fibres in their work fatigue loading with similar compression and tension amplitudes was applied this implies that the ratio of the maximum to minimum stress r f m i n f m a x is equal to 1 however the stress ratio in this study was estimated to be 0 0 067 another study on high strength grout was conducted in sørensen et al 2011 in this study cylinder specimens under dry and wet conditions with a grout compressive strength of 141 mpa were tested with 45 60 and 76 of the static compressive strength for cyclic loading and varied loading frequencies of 0 35 5 and 10 hz as in the case of this study the applied loading was within the compression stress range which was similar to the loading range of the present study the latest important findings on the fatigue performance under dry and wet conditions were conducted at leibniz university hannover in bechtel 2016 the fatigue performance of large scale grouted connections was evaluated under dry conditions with various loading scenarios within the compression loading range subsequently the fatigue behaviour of small scale fatigue tests and large scale fatigue test specimens under wet conditions was investigated in raba 2018 in their work the degradation behaviour of the fatigue loading under wet conditions and a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the grouted layer thickness loading rate and frequency on the submerged grouted connections were investigated in this study only small scale fatigue test results conducted in raba 2018 were compared with those in the literature and this study because the larger scaled specimens were subjected to various compression loadings during the test which may not be comparable with other studies for more detailed information a deep understanding of the degradation behaviour of the submerged grouted connection was presented in bechtel 2016 and raba 2018 fig 17 shows a comparison of the maximum amplitude of applied loading to static strength with the number of cycles in this study as well as in the literature the relationship between the number of cycles and the strength ratio for high strength grout specimens under dry conditions is located within a similar area above the dotted lines which are the approximate minimum fatigue life based on the test data in particular for the dry condition the results obtained by in sørensen et al 2011 for unidirectional cyclic loading with compression only showed a trend similar to that of this study both test results are located on the upper side of the results obtained in anders 2007 according to tebbett and billington 1985 full reversal cyclic loading with equal tensile and compression loadings when r is equal to 1 induced strength reduction due to the impact effect this is because simultaneously applied tensile and compression loadings can create voids behind the shear keys which can induce impact loading therefore the test results of the present study and those in sørensen et al 2011 without impact effects demonstrated higher values than those reported in anders 2007 for the fatigue test results in wet conditions there are limited test results in which only sørensen et al 2011 and raba 2018 are available in the literature the difference between their research was the geometry of the specimen and the maximum compression loading rate and frequency although sørensen et al 2011 investigated submerged grouted cylinder specimens the fatigue test results in wet conditions showed a good correlation with those of grouted connection specimens conducted in raba 2018 the fatigue performance in wet conditions could be approximately estimated by the dotted lines which are the approximate minimum fatigue life based on the test data in addition the fatigue life under wet conditions is less than that under dry conditions a more detailed estimation of the fatigue life according to geometry and frequency was presented in sørensen et al 2011 and raba 2018 respectively regarding the effects of frequencies it is typical that cyclic loading with a higher frequency reduces fatigue performance due to high speed cyclic loading however it is necessary to establish more fatigue test data for detailed comparisons 6 1 2 effect of stress ratio on fatigue capacity according to the literature loading types such as fully reversible sinusoidal loading and unidirectionally reversible loading have a significant influence on the fatigue failure of grouted connections in fully reversible sinusoidal loading the cyclic loading ranges from maximum compression to maximum tension in which the compression and tension demonstrate equal absolute amplitude loading however unidirectionally reversible loading was applied from zero minimum loading to maximum compression loading tebbett and billington 1985 reported that the displacement under a single application of static load was sufficient to generate voids behind the shear connectors however as the load was not reversible impact effects did not occur and no further deterioration of the connection could be recorded this implies that the voids behind the shear key demonstrate a significant impact on the fatigue capacity in fully reversible sinusoidal loading however there were no impact effects in the unidirectional cyclic loading condition in this study the effects of cyclic loading on the fatigue capacity values obtained in the present study and prior studies were evaluated the definitions of the applied loading types are summarised in table 11 and fig 18 a comparison of test results for r 0 fig 19 shows the fatigue test results obtained from this study and the literature when r is equal to or greater than zero in which the applied loading is uniaxial reversible sinusoidal loading with pure compression in this figure lines a and b denote simplified equations based on regression analysis in ingebrigtsen et al 1990 line a denotes the fatigue capacity of cyclic loading from zero to maximum compression stress condition r 0 and line b denotes the fatigue capacity of cyclic compression tension when the cyclic loading ratio is equal to 1 it can be observed from this figure that some of the test results of non deteriorated data denoted by arrow lines and those of cylinder specimens from sørensen et al 2011 when pmax pstatic is equal to 0 6 are under line a consequently considering the recently obtained fatigue test data line a suggested by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 overestimates the fatigue performance of high strength grout materials under an applied loading with a static strength of approximately 0 7 b comparison of test results for 1 r 0 fig 20 shows the fatigue test results reported in the literature when the applied loading condition is partially reversible sinusoidal in tension and compression in this figure lines a and b denote the simplified equations based on the regression analysis from the study conducted by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 it can be observed that the test results from the literature are almost above line a however there are insufficient data points obtained from vertec dnv 1984 in addition the test results from this study were not categorized with a specific value of r despite the lack of data points most of them were observed above line a as suggested by ingebrigtsen et al 1990 c comparison of test results for r 1 fig 21 shows the fatigue test results from the literature when r is equal to 1 in which the applied loading is fully reversible sinusoidal with similar absolute compression and tension values this figure shows a large scatter of data points under fully cyclic loading conditions the test results from the literature are almost below line a which is a unidirectional cyclic loading condition for the lower boundary line b which denotes a simplified equation for fully reversible cyclic loading under equal compression and tension does not show a reasonable estimation because numerous data from harwood et al 1996 and boswell and d mello boswell and d mello 1986 are located below b line the reason for the large scatter of data when r 1 is not clearly known this could be because the specimens in the literature demonstrate different shear key spacing configuration of shear keys grout strength and initial defectiveness on the voids behind shear keys during grout casting despite the difficulty in estimating a suitable fatigue capacity line b shows good agreement with recently obtained data from the test results in anders 2007 related to the high strength grouted connections however line b does not agree well with the test results in harwood et al 1996 and boswell and d mello 1986 6 1 3 effects of shear key spacing and grout strength on fatigue capacity according to harwood et al 1996 the fatigue performance declines as the shear key density increases it is mentioned in the study that it is difficult to determine the relationship between h s and fatigue performance with any degree of confidence as there are several small individual databases corresponding to different h s values although these databases still exist the effects of h s were evaluated based on the data obtained from the present study and previous research works to date fig 22 shows the effects of h s on the fatigue capacity according to different stress ratio values for r 0 no relevant database is available to determine the effects of h s on the fatigue damage the figure shows a contradictory trend compared to harwood et al 1996 when r 1 the fatigue performance tends to decline as the h s and grout strength decreases the results of studies conducted in anders 2007 and tebbett and billington 1985 with h s 0 012 showed that the fatigue performance decreased as the grout strength decreased to 69 mpa additionally the fatigue performance decreased as h s decreased these aspects regarding the h s ratio can be explained by the failure modes in the literature and are observed in section 5 2 before explaining the failure mechanisms of grouted connections under fatigue loading it is important to consider the failure mechanisms under static loading conditions to understand the fatigue failure mechanisms according to the static tests conducted in lee et al 2017 the ultimate strength of the grouted connections under static loading can be highly influenced by the confinement of grout materials induced by the total area of the outer and inner tubes between adjacent shear keys they concluded that crushing failure modes near the shear key are more likely to occur in the larger shear key spacing specimen because the larger shear key cases can possess a higher ultimate strength induced by the large confinement area compared to the small shear key cases the higher ultimate strength might cause a higher stress level on both the grout annulus and locations near the shear keys in the case of a larger shear key spacing the failure modes even in the initial loading stages could be governed by grout crushing near the shear keys similar aspects of the crushing failure near the shear keys at the initial loading stages for a larger shear key spacing case are observed in the fea results in fig 15 c if fatigue loading is applied the failure modes of considerable yielding in piles and sleeves due to the confinement of the grout annulus cannot occur because the fatigue loading is considerably lower than that of the ultimate strength states however it still has a higher load level near the shear key locations for larger shear key cases in conclusion the fatigue performance of grouted connections with larger shear key spacing which is a smaller value of h s can be lower than that of cases with a smaller shear key spacing these crushing failure modes near the shear keys due to higher stress levels are observed in the static and fatigue tests in the literature as shown in fig 23 thus it can be concluded that h s may contribute to the fatigue performance of grouted connections according to previous studies and this study additionally considering a higher stress level near the shear key the grout compressive strength can also play an important role in the fatigue performance as well however owing to the lack of a wide range of fatigue test data considering the effects of shear key spacings more fatigue test data considering various grout strengths and shear key densities are required to provide a more reasonable estimation of fatigue performance 6 2 comparison of test results and design provisions specific design equations for the fatigue capacity of grouted connections with a material reduction factor of 1 5 are stipulated in dnvgl 2018b in this study the design equations were compared and evaluated using the data from the fatigue test database obtained from the literature as shown in fig 24 the design equation covers the lower boundary of the test results as the overall fatigue data are located above the design equations it can safely determine the fatigue capacity of grouted connections according to harwood et al 1996 the stress ratio of lee side compression pile in practical constructions ranges between 0 7 and 0 4 for the design storm condition and 0 1 and 0 6 for the one year storm condition in general there is a simultaneous effect of both environmental loading conditions and the self weight of wind turbine towers or jacket structures on the stress ratio the stress ratio of the grouted connections can vary according to the combination of the loading conditions this implies that the design equation in dnvgl 2018b may lead to a safe design for designing practical grouted connections in other words the design equation in dnvgl 2018b achieves a safe design within the range of fully reversed cyclic loading conditions however the design equation may provide conservative results for the test results in anders 2007 related to high strength grouted connections under fully reversed cyclic loading conditions 6 3 design recommendations for r 0 according to bechtel 2016 and raba 2018 fully reversible cyclic loading with a loading ratio of r 1 is not likely for a realistic loading situation but represents a worst case scenario additionally in real structures fatigue loads with a relatively lower loading amplitude are unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression loads therefore it is important to estimate the proper fatigue capacity for the unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression loads for realistic design approaches fig 25 shows the fatigue test database for the unidirectional cyclic loading conditions as the fatigue test results in the literature show a large scatter the design equation can be assumed by a lower bound approximation of the test database in terms of conservative design approaches the presented design equation can be expressed as a logarithmic function that is a linear approximation in which the intercept of the y axis is equal to 1 which represents the static capacity therefore the design equations for unidirectional cyclic loading under dry conditions can be assumed as follows 23 y 0 054 ln x 1 7 conclusion in this study the fatigue performance of high strength grouted connections with shear keys was evaluated using the seven static and fatigue test specimens and numerical analysis additionally the effect of changes in the parameters on the fatigue capacity was analyzed based on a comparative study of the fatigue test data in the literature based on this study and comparative studies the following conclusions can be made 1 the fatigue test results with the five high strength grouted connections subjected to unidirectional cyclic loading show good agreement with both the cylinder fatigue test data conducted in sørensen et al 2011 and high strength and normal strength grouted connections under the same loading and environmental conditions dnv 1984 ingebrigtsen et al 1990 raba 2018 2 based on the fea of the static test specimens it was concluded that the larger shear key spacings could lead to crushing failure modes near the shear keys even from the initial stage of the loading whereas the grouted connections with smaller shear key spacings experienced diagonal cracking without crushing near the shear keys therefore in the case of larger shear key spacings a lower fatigue performance due to local failure near the shear keys may occur the assumed hypothesis of the effects of shear keys shows similar aspects to the fatigue test results conducted in anders 2007 3 the fatigue test data in this study were evaluated based on a numerical assessment approach using the nonlinear fea results and the provisions in dnvgl st c502 dnvgl 2018a the test results in this study provide a reasonable correlation with the assessment approach when using maximum and minimum loading and the ultimate strength of the specimens instead of using the stress values 4 the test results indicated that high strength grout demonstrates a substantial fatigue performance compared to the design equation specified in dnvgl 2018b based on the comparative study of the fatigue test data in the literature the design equation in dnvgl 2018b may provide conservative results for both the high strength and normal strength grouted connections especially when the unidirectional cyclic loadings are subjected to the connections 5 based on a comparative study it was revealed that the effects of the stress ratio r have a significant influence on the fatigue capacity of grouted connections the test data obtained with r 1 demonstrated a significant reduction in fatigue capacity whereas the test data obtained with r 0 demonstrated excellent fatigue performance 6 according to the literature bechtel 2016 raba 2018 unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression could be considered as a realistic fatigue loading scenario compared to the fully sinusoidal cyclic loading conditions which may represent severe loading cases thus in this study a tentative fatigue design equation for the grouted connections subjected to unidirectional cyclic loading with pure compression under dry conditions was presented based on the present study and fatigue test data in the literature however because there is still a lack of fatigue test data with various parameters for unidirectional cyclic loading conditions in both dry and wet conditions it is necessary to establish more fatigue data with various shear key spacings which may influence on the failure modes realistic geometry of the connections low level frequencies under approximately 0 3 hz and different environmental conditions additionally fatigue data within the range of higher loading rates over 50 of the static strength under wet conditions are required for a more reasonable estimation of the submerged grouted connections credit authorship contribution statement jeonghwa lee conception and design of study acquisition of data formal analysis and or

20533,to investigate the bubble sweep down phenomenon of a scientific research ship from the perspective of its flow mechanism the flow field characteristics of the bow were measured in a towing tank environment first the silk thread method was used to visualise the streamline characteristics of the bow next the flow field of the bow was measured using multiple two section 2 dimensional computed tomography scans with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry the flow field information of different sections at different speeds e g velocity distribution vector characteristics and streamline

the bow generally exhibits a downward movement trend the flow structure of the bow flow field was found to be closely related to the wave making change of the bow on the other hand the cross sectional flow characteristics and 3d reconstruction results showed that with the bubble sweep down some bubbles flowed along the bilge and amassed with other bubbles breaking through the geometric inflection

from the perspective of their flow mechanism to reveal the fine flow field characteristics of the bow of a scientific research ship presently international research on the bubble sweep down phenomenon remains insufficient particularly that from an experimental viewpoint the main research bottleneck appears to be the difficulty in obtaining fine flow fields around large scale ship models experiments were carried out by waniewski et al 2001 to study the disturbance frequency and distribution of breaking wave bubbles at a ship s bow to better understand the entrainment effect of the bow wave on air perret and carrica 2015 used a 6 m scientific research ship model to observe the bubble flow using a double tip sapphire optical probe to obtain the trajectory and distribution of bubble flow under different speeds and water salinity conditions other researchers delacroix et al 2016 delacroix et al 2016a 2016b used the thalassa and pourquoi pas scientific research ships to analyse the factors causing bubble sweep down by assessing the ships sonar disturbances caused by the resultant bubble layers while sailing the experiment was conducted using a circulating flume and the bubble contour and flow traces were measured and analysed through an observation window using a 2d particle image velocimetry piv measurement system mallat et al 2018 compared the phenomena of bow breaking waves and bubble cloud sweep down using different forms of bulbous bows based on delacroix s 2016a research to further study the relationship between the hydrodynamic flow field and bubble formation dallinga and gunsing 2016 of the marin research institute in the netherlands carried out an experimental study on the bubble sweep down effect on scientific research ships compared with seawater they found that the salinity and viscosity of water in the laboratory environment directly affected bubble size distribution limiting coalescence cartmill and su 1993 kracht and finch 2009 in fact almost no bubbles were generated and bubble generation and sweep down had to be achieved by installing bubble injection ports around the ship wang et al 2020 used the dantec stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv system to capture the sweep down trajectory of microbubbles in the bow of scientific research ship and the coupled eulerian lagrangian method was adopted to verify the characteristics of the bubble sweep down it is apparent that most of the relevant experimental studies began with macroscopic phenomena such as bubble evolution and trajectory leading to the analyses of the influencing factors of the bubble sweep down phenomenon however there has been little research on the flow characteristics of the bow flow field especially for 3 dimensional 3d information gathering of a large model bow space consequently there is a lack of microscopic verification of the flow mechanism the flow field distribution around a bow is the dominant factor affecting bubble sweep down thus measuring and understanding their characteristics is a prerequisite to analysing the path of bubble sweep down doing so will ostensibly lead to the operational avoidance of strong bubble areas and the further exploration of bubble sweep down suppression this study is based on the experimental study of wang et al 2020 which explored the mechanism of the bow flow field and was the first to visualise the bow flow field from a macro perspective by using the silk wire method they realised the multi section microcosmic fine measurement of the bow flow field using the spiv method to explore the flow field motion characteristics around a ship model at different speeds this experiment innovatively constructed a 3d volume test method in a towing tank environment surpassing past measurement dimension limitations of underwater spiv systems and successfully reproducing the 3d wake field characteristics of a ship bow with limited testing resources the first part of this paper describes experimental facilities models and specific information about the conditions used during the experimental process next the relationship between the silk wire angle and the bow wave shape at two speeds is compared and the macro flow characteristics of the flow field are established finally the microcosmic flow field data of the spiv method is analysed using the reconstructed results of the 3d flow field of the bow emphasising the comparison between the tangential velocity cloud diagram velocity vector and 3d streamline characteristics and confirming the flow behaviour of microbubble groups near the ocean s surface during the sweep down process from the perspective of the flow mechanism 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental conditions and testing mode tests were conducted in the towing tank at the harbin engineering university china the dimensions of the main tank are as follows 108 m length 7 m width and 3 5 m depth the stable towing speed range of the trailer is 0 1 6 5 m s and the speed accuracy is 0 1 to reduce the influences of changes of the ship model s heave pitch and other floating states on the measurement results of the flow field it was necessary to adjust and fix the corresponding floating state of the ship model using a fixed formwork frame and other connectors based on the ship s navigational attitude under its design conditions to lock its motion posture a gopro underwater camera system was used for underwater photography in the flow display experiment its resolution was 1440 1080 pixels the test model mimicked a specific type of scientific research vessel table 1 shows the main scale parameters of the vessel table 2 lists the test conditions of the flow field in the stern region fig 1 shows the main characteristics of the line and model of the scientific research vessel and the settings of the coordinate system 2 2 silk thread flow visualisation from the flow visualisation experiment we obtained the intuitive flow phenomenon and evolution process of the bow flow field in the target state to visualise the macroscopic phenomenon of the bow flow in this study several light and soft silk threads were fixed to the surface of the ship model the ends of which swung freely in the flow field during motion the state of the flow field on the surface of the model and the motion of the vortices were observed in the swing direction to visually capture the flow field of the bow sweep down effect post and van walsum 1993 the silk thread used in this experiment was made of degreased cotton its length was less than the curvature radius of the expected streamline zuqing 2002 for a relatively simple flow field state whose radius of curvature is in the order of metres at the bow of the ship a silk thread that was 15 cm long and 0 5 mm in diameter was used to obtain the entire flow field pattern it was necessary to set the fixed end spacing of a single row of silk thread while improving the resolution of the flow scale on the model surface and avoiding mutual interference between the filaments after comparing several experimental results we set a spacing of 2 5 cm for a single row of threads at the fore of the scientific research ship model and a spacing of 10 cm for the single rows covering a total area of the bow from 0 to 80 cm the specific experimental arrangement is shown in fig 2 during the test a 532 nm underwater lighting system was used to illuminate the gopro camera s field of view the purpose of the flow visualisation test is to explore the law of streamlining in the bow area of a scientific research ship at different speeds to ensure the operation of the acoustic equipment under real world conditions scientific research ships usually adjust their speeds to achieve the best underwater information acquisition within a certain range based on design and actual sea conditions consequently the test used the working condition information shown in table 3 to conduct the flow visualisation study of the scientific research ship bow 2 3 spiv flow visualisation the underwater 2d 3c spiv measurement system used to measure the flow field in the bow area of the scientific research ship utilised a towing tank customised by harbin engineering university tiecheng 2019 produced by dantec dynamics of denmark its main body was divided into three parts the underwater mine body a laser system and a control and acquisition device the underwater mine body comprised several modules having different functions see fig 3 dynamics 2015 the nd yag laser system was supplied by litron lasers of the uk the maximum energy of the generated laser is 200 mj and the maximum frequency is 15 hz the laser was transmitted to the underwater mine through a light guide arm built into the streamlined aerofoil bracket the control and acquisition system includes an equipment power supply and control box an acquisition computer and a three degrees of freedom displacement frame polyamide particles of 50 μm diameter were used as tracer particles for the spiv test the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 guo et al 2016 2018 ouyang et al 1996 the installation position of the acoustic equipment comprised 14 16 stations on the ship and the distance from the bow vertical line was 850 mm based on the model scale therefore the measurement section of the spiv was set from 350 to 850 mm from the bow for a total length of 500 mm and the cross sectional shooting interval was 20 mm over 25 sections all flow field characteristics in front of the acoustic equipment were obtained to provide data on the microbubble entrainment sweep down paths adrian and westerweel 1998 anschau and mach 2007 the percentage uncertainties of instantaneous velocity of the various dantec spiv equipment components were root mean square rms u u 2 492 rms v u 1 014 and rms w u 3 179 because the estimated error for the instantaneous velocity field was approximately 3 of the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements reached 4 of the estimated flow velocity guo et al 2018 the acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz in the piv test the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dynamics 2015 with an initial 128 128 pixel interrogation window and a final one of 32 32 pixels a correlation analysis of images was implemented with two passes using 128 128 64 64 and 32 32 pixel interrogation windows in that order an overlap of 50 among neighbouring windows was used for correlation analysis in total 250 instantaneous velocity fields were measured with a single towing carriage theoretically the more pictures the better owing to the length limitation of the tank we took 250 pairs of images per run similar piv tests at the seoul national university towing tank and the towing tank at the university of iowa also took around 250 images seo et al 2016 yoon et al 2015 the time averaged parameters were calculated from n 250 pairs of piv images 2 4 similarity issues to fit the real bubble sweep down scenario the test parameters were set based on the real vessel conditions as follows the working speed of the acoustic transducer was 12 kn and the design speed of the scientific research ship was 16 kn in a calm water surface situation the parameters involved in the bubble sweep down phenomenon relate only to the free surfaces and ship parameters the experiment adhered to conditions related to the froude number 1 f r v s g l p p s v m g l p p m 0 225 v s 12 k n where v is the ship speed g is the gravity and lpp is the length between perpendiculars the subscript band s represents the real ship value and the subscript band m represents the model value in this case f r 0 277 v s 16 k n the reynolds number of the model test was reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude from that of the real scale ship v s 12 k n r e m 4 42 10 6 r e s 5 27 10 8 a n d v s 16 k n r e m 5 90 10 6 r e s 7 03 10 8 in the experimental environment the decrease in the reynolds number increased the thickness ratio of the velocity boundary layer of the entire bow field resulting in a change of velocity distribution near the wall boundary layer in addition to a difference in the flow field between the real scale and model scale zhenban and yingzhong 2004 the scale effect of the flow field caused by the different reynolds numbers affected the boundary layer region nearest to the ship hull at the model scale a low reynolds number has a small impact on the boundary layer millimetre scale flow near the ship s bow but it does not affect the flow field or the propagation of bubbles outside the boundary layer delacroix et al 2016 the measurement area was 300 360 mm and the final resolution of the velocity vector was 2 45 mm when using spiv to capture the flow field around the bow owing to the light spot generated by the diffuse reflection of the laser on the hull surface the near wall flow field over a certain range was over exposed hence the flow field information within 1 cm of the wall could not be obtained it was thus necessary to mask the flow field during image processing consequently the influence of a low reynolds number on the flow at the millimetre scale near the wall boundary layer is ignored 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave and streamline characteristics based on the image information obtained using the underwater camera the waveform and streamline characteristics of the 30 s stable speed section were extracted and averaged and the respective diagrams attached to the bow surface at different speeds were obtained to analyse the macroscopic flow field characteristics of the ship s bow the results are shown in fig 5 the blue line is the fitting wave making surface the cyan line is the designed water line position and the black line is the fitting silk line distribution in the figure the measurement results at speeds of v m 1 028 1 234 1 440 and 1 646 m s are denoted by fig 5 a d respectively first according to the wave making characteristics of the bow it can be seen that for different speeds the general structure of bow wave making is similar because the water begins to accumulate and lift in the front of the bow the water line enters the forward perpendicular at a height greater than the draft then it gradually rises to the wave crest before suddenly falling back entering a relatively flat trough after which the gas liquid interface gradually recovers to stable remaining at a level near the draft line when the velocity is low v m 1 028 m s within the camera s viewing angle after the first pair of peaks and troughs a second pair appears forming smaller secondary wave the wave making characteristics of the bow vary with speed with an increase in v m the wave crest position moves toward the stern the crest moves from 0 1 m from the bow at 1 028 m s to 0 3 m from the bow at 1 646 m s the height of the wave crest increases and the trough lengthens at high speeds the wave surface rises after the trough it can be inferred that there is still a secondary wave in this case and that its position is beyond the camera s observation window in view of the streamline characteristics represented by the silk thread the primary observation at various speeds is that the free end pointed in a lower right direction and the flow field at the bow tended to move downward when the silk thread swept down toward the ship bottom an excess portion stuck to the bottom of the ship and pointed to the stern this phenomenon indicates that the downward movement of the flow field disappeared when it reached the bottom of the ship hence it turned to flow along the bottom plane notably at all speeds the filaments nearest the trough of the free surface were horizontally distributed and the inclination angle was very small with an increase in the distance from the free surface the angle of the silk thread increased gradually and the bow wave effect weakened fig 6 displays a statistical chart of the change in the silk thread angle at 10 cm from the bottom of the ship fig 5 red line at different speeds to analyse the variation of the streamline of the bow flow field with the speed at this draft it can be seen from the figure that the changing trend of the silk line angle was consistent with that of the bow wave making curve the angle at the wave crest was larger than that at the wave trough and the average angle increased with increasing speed v m when the speed was high the bow wave had a longer wave crest range and a larger streamline downward the sweep angle which resulted in the continuous sweep flow field becoming wider and the downward sweep trend becoming stronger 3 2 cross section flow characteristics the six characteristic sections evenly distributed within the measurement range were extracted for flow characteristic analysis the influence of speed on the flow field of the bow is discussed next and the generation and evolution mechanism of the bubble sweep down phenomenon is analysed from the perspective of the flow phenomenon in the model scale the six sections were located at positions x 0 35 0 45 0 55 0 65 0 75 and 0 85 m respectively away from the bow the specific location distribution of each section is shown in fig 7 the vertical velocity distribution of the flow field is considered fig 8 shows the vertical velocity component nephogram and streamline distribution test results at the above cross sections at two speeds fig 8 a f are the flow field test results of x 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 mm from the bow respectively column i is the velocity distribution of the flow field at each section at the working speed of the acoustic equipment 12 kn v m 1 234 m s and column j is the flow field 16 kn v m 1 646 m s according to the design speed of the ship among them the vertical velocity v and the coordinate axis are dimensionless fig 9 shows the variation in the dimensionless vertical velocity at a position 3 cm away from the bow wall at different draughts in which the meanings of fig 9 a f are the same as those of fig 8 a f the results show that the distribution pattern of the flow field around the bow area of the scientific research ship at different speeds was similar and all had obvious downward sweeping velocity fields v v m 0 but the different speeds were different at the width height centre positions and at the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m of the down swept area at the position close to the bow a x 0 35 m it can be seen from fig 5 that the section position is at the wave crest when v m 1 646 m s and it is in the transition process of the water body from stacking to falling back and the flow trend is not obvious v v m is smaller than that of low speeds and approaches zero after breaking away from the influence of surface wave making the sweep down flow field tends to be stable at high speeds and the value of v v m gradually exceeds that of low speeds from bottom to top it exceeds it at the third section thus the distribution of sweep down flow field at the bow especially near the surface is closely related to the wave making characteristics of the bow fig 9 with an increase in the distance from the fore perpendicular the downward swept core area v v m larger gradually moved down when x 0 35 m the core area was close to the free surface position and it gradually moved to the bottom when x 0 85 m by comparison the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m was higher and the downward swept flow field distribution was more stable at high speeds at the model scale the velocity component in the downward direction of the flow field reached 0 35 m s however there was a dimensionless vertical velocity v v m 0 at the bilge of the ship bottom in the measurement area from the streamline distribution the streamline distribution of the flow field in the bow of a scientific research ship was manifested by the radiation from the hull to the outside accompanied by a downward trend there was an oscillating circumfluence vortex near the bilge of all test sections pointing to the bottom of the ship marked by g which may have caused the bubbles to sweep down to the bottom of the ship and accumulate from there they slid along the bottom surface to the stern apart from the streamline distribution at high speed x 0 35 m being chaotic the streamlines of the following sections were smoother than those at low speeds and the sweeping trend was more obvious hence the structure of the bilge vortex being more stable under this flow structure bubbles accumulated more quickly and intensively at the bottom of the ship posing a greater threat to the efficacy of acoustic sensors at the bottom the phenomenon of oscillatory backflow at the bilge bottom may have been caused by two fluids possessing larger velocity differences at that location the transition region was thus subject to fluid instability based on the structural characteristics of the bow of the ship model the characteristics and mechanism of the unstable vibration mode of the bilge were preliminarily analysed considering that the down swept flow from the bow can be approximated as a uniform laminar flow a boundary layer with a velocity gradient was formed on the bilge side surface owing to the sudden change of the structure at the inflection point of the bilge the boundary layer left the interface and formed a free shear layer then the flow separated a part of the fluid entered the bottom of the ship and drove the bottom fluid to move as a large vortex the other part continued to flow downward in the form of a free shear flow at the transition point owing to flow separation the ordered vortices fell off along the flow direction this phenomenon can be attributed to the instability of the shear layer oscillation the amplification of fluid oscillation this resulted in an oscillation backflow range that extended past the bilge range during the process of free shear layer oscillation propagation there was a reverse disturbance opposite to the main flow direction which led to the upward extrusion of the ship bottom streamline 3 3 analysis of 3d 3c reconstruction flow field characteristics thus far research on the 2d plane distribution characteristics of bow flow field have been covered however the bow flow field also has 3d space characteristics furthermore the 3d 3c flow field distribution is important to the mechanism analysis inspired by computer tomography ct technology mamourian 2013 the existing 2d 3c spiv flow field test system was applied to create a set of 3d 3c space flow field test methods suitable for large area measurements to realise a 3d 3c flow field spatial reconstruction felli et al 2015 the specific 3d reconstruction scheme was as follows 1 obtain multi 2d section flow field information based on the ct scanning method 2 establish a set of unified grid matrices for 2d cross sectional data 3 interpolate the original flow field data based on matrix coordinates and reconstruct the 2d 3c dataset into a 3d 3c spatial matrix dataset by combining the positional differences of the multi measurement sections consequently each point in the spatial matrix inherits coordinate information and three direction velocity information simultaneously the measurement area of ct scanning was a rectangular area of 200 200 500 mm on one side of the ship fig 10 shows the isosurface distribution 0 2 v v m 0 08 and the 3d streamline distribution of the research ship bow at speeds of v m 1 234 m s a and v m 1 646 m s b the average filter method was used to smooth and filter the isosurface fig 11 shows the slicing results of the spatial flow field information at different water depths parallel to the ship bottom plane the vertical velocity field information and streamline distribution are included in the figure the yellow area is the hull section from left to right the sections at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 22 cm 2 cm down the bottom are shown it can be seen from the reconstruction results that at low speed the main sweep down flow field was first wide and then narrow and the sweep down flow channel was small however at high speed the distribution trend was narrow first then wider the scope of sweep down channel was significantly greater and the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m was maintained at a high level with the increase in the distance from the fore perpendicular the sweeping core area and sweeping ability of the flow field gradually expanded and deepened and the entire measurement plane was extended under the design speed conditions the 3d streamline diagram shows the flow direction when the water flowed through the measuring area the changing trend of the streamline in the side view was consistent with the experimental results of section 2 2 which discussed the silk thread method at low speeds the streamline was concave along the vertical direction which shows that the front end swept down strongly and the follow up trend weakened in the case of high speed it was the opposite the flow field shows that there was almost no downward sweeping trend in the front and the downward sweeping was more violent in the rear under the hull there were two kinds of streamline states ascending and sweeping the up welling line was mainly distributed in the bilge area directly below the hull caused by the reverse disturbance of the shear layer oscillation the sweeping streamline was a continuous down sweep of the free shear flow swept down the side of the ship the bottom view and the streamline in fig 11 shows the flow state parallel to the bottom plane of the ship the streamline near the wall was basically consistent with that at surface of the ship whereas the streamline far away diffused outward at a small angle at the bilge part of the bottom of the ship the streamlines bunched and diffused which is clearer at the section at 22 cm water depth y lpp 0 01 slightly larger than the width of the bottom the streamlines bunched at both speeds and diffused to the positive and negative directions of the y axis one part entered the bottom of the ship v m 0 and the other entered the sweep down area outside the bilge which is consistent with the oscillation characteristics of the free shear layer mentioned above in summary the overall trend of the bow streamline is as follows after being down swept the streamline flows along the hull or bilge profile and merges with the other streamlines whereas a small number of streamlines are carried by the shear layer breaking through the geometric inflection point of bilge entering the upward turbulence caused by fluid instability and being squeezed out along the bottom plane fig 12 4 conclusions in this study silk thread and spiv methods were used to create a measured flow visualisation for a certain type of scientific research ship results were gathered from streamline display tests flow characteristics analysis of 2d cross sections and reconstruction of the 3d 3c bow flow field based on ct scanning the macro and micro flow mechanisms were analysed the results of the silk thread and spiv matched perfectly by processing and analysing the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn because of the existence of the fore bow on the scientific research ship within the wave making range the velocity of the upper fluid was smaller than that of the lower basin due to wave making accumulation and falling back from the free surface to the bottom of the ship the velocity increased step by step to form a pressure difference that promoted the downward sweeping of microbubbles different speeds led to changes of the pressure gradient which then affected the downward sweeping speed and trend under the conditions of high speed most streamlines reached the bottom plane faster owing to higher pressure gradients at that time the shear layer oscillation of the bilge flow field was more severe the streamlines easily crossed and entered the working area of acoustic equipment however at low speeds the down swept trend of the streamline was weak making it more difficult for the sweep down fluid to enter the bottom plane the microbubbles on the free surface were more likely to gather in the bilge and were wrapped by the bilge vortex which was transferred to the stern of the ship along the bilge and rose at the wake hence it did not flow through the acoustic equipment area to form interference although the time averaged velocity streamline characteristics and 3d distribution of the flow field in the bow area of the scientific research ship were investigated the present study endured some limitations first the piv data could only be obtained in the spanwise direction perpendicular to the centreline of the ship model owing to the design constraints of the existing underwater spiv system thus the data acquisition frequency was low second regarding the 3d 3c reconstruction method the flow field information between the cross sections was obtained by interpolation hence there was a gap between the results and the actual flow field therefore additional research should be conducted along time and spatial dimensions in the future so that a tr time resolved 3d 3c piv fine flow field test system having more dense spatial data and continuous

20533,to investigate the bubble sweep down phenomenon of a scientific research ship from the perspective of its flow mechanism the flow field characteristics of the bow were measured in a towing tank environment first the silk thread method was used to visualise the streamline characteristics of the bow next the flow field of the bow was measured using multiple two section 2 dimensional computed tomography scans with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry the flow field information of different sections at different speeds e g velocity distribution vector characteristics and streamline distribution were then obtained a 3 dimensional 3d three component 3c space reconstruction of the time averaged flow field in the bow was thus realised from the visualisation results the flow field in the bow generally exhibits a downward movement trend the flow structure of the bow flow field was found to be closely related to the wave making change of the bow on the other hand the cross sectional flow characteristics and 3d reconstruction results showed that with the bubble sweep down some bubbles flowed along the bilge and amassed with other bubbles breaking through the geometric inflection point of the bilge compressed by the bilge vortex they slid backward and affected the operation of acoustic equipment keywords scientific research ship stereoscopic particle image velocimetry bubble sweep down space reconstruction 1 introduction under natural conditions owing to breaking waves rain impact and other factors a layer of bubbles having diameters near 30 μm 1mm is maintained near the surface of the ocean over long periods dallinga and gunsing 2016 shi et al 2008 for special purpose and ocean research ships these tiny bubbles accumulate along the bottoms of ships due to the flow field around the bow during operation the waves breaking at the bow and the turbulence brought about by the concave convex structure of the hull also cause gas phase fluids to churn around the bow exacerbating the bubble sweep down phenomenon and significantly degrading the performance of acoustic equipment new 1992 effective reduction of these bubbles or mitigation of the negative impact of

expected streamline zuqing 2002 for a relatively simple flow field state whose radius of curvature is in the order of metres at the bow of the ship a silk thread that was 15 cm long and 0 5 mm in diameter was used to obtain the entire flow field pattern it was necessary to set the fixed end spacing of a single row of silk thread while improving the resolution of the flow scale on the model surface and avoiding mutual interference between the filaments after comparing several experimental results we set a spacing of 2 5 cm for a single row of threads at the fore of the scientific research ship model and a spacing of 10 cm for the single rows covering a total area of the bow from 0 to 80 cm the specific experimental arrangement is shown in fig 2 during the test a 532 nm underwater lighting system was used to illuminate the gopro camera s field of view the purpose of the flow visualisation test is to explore the law of streamlining in the bow area of a scientific research ship at different speeds to ensure the operation of the acoustic equipment under real world conditions scientific research ships usually adjust their speeds to achieve the best underwater information acquisition within a certain range based on design and actual sea conditions consequently the test used the working condition information shown in table 3 to conduct the flow visualisation study of the scientific research ship bow 2 3 spiv flow visualisation the underwater 2d 3c spiv measurement system used to measure the flow field in the bow area of the scientific research ship utilised a towing tank customised by harbin engineering university tiecheng 2019 produced by dantec dynamics of denmark its main body was divided into three parts the underwater mine body a laser system and a control and acquisition device the underwater mine body comprised several modules having different functions see fig 3 dynamics 2015 the nd yag laser system was supplied by litron lasers of the uk the maximum energy of the generated laser is 200 mj and the maximum frequency is 15 hz the laser was transmitted to the underwater mine through a light guide arm built into the streamlined aerofoil bracket the control and acquisition system includes an equipment power supply and control box an acquisition computer and a three degrees of freedom displacement frame polyamide particles of 50 μm diameter were used as tracer particles for the spiv test the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 guo et al 2016 2018 ouyang et al 1996 the installation position of the acoustic equipment comprised 14 16 stations on the ship and the distance from the bow vertical line was 850 mm based on the model scale therefore the measurement section of the spiv was set from 350 to 850 mm from the bow for a total length of 500 mm and the cross sectional shooting interval was 20 mm over 25 sections all flow field characteristics in front of the acoustic equipment were obtained to provide data on the microbubble entrainment sweep down paths adrian and westerweel 1998 anschau and mach 2007 the percentage uncertainties of instantaneous velocity of the various dantec spiv equipment components were root mean square rms u u 2 492 rms v u 1 014 and rms w u 3 179 because the estimated error for the instantaneous velocity field was approximately 3 of the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements reached 4 of the estimated flow velocity guo et al 2018 the acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz in the piv test the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dynamics 2015 with an initial 128 128 pixel interrogation window and a final one of 32 32 pixels a correlation analysis of images was implemented with two passes using 128 128 64 64 and 32 32 pixel interrogation windows in that order an overlap of 50 among neighbouring windows was used for correlation analysis in total 250 instantaneous velocity fields were measured with a single towing carriage theoretically the more pictures the better owing to the length limitation of the tank we took 250 pairs of images per run similar piv tests at the seoul national university towing tank and the towing tank at the university of iowa also took around 250 images seo et al 2016 yoon et al 2015 the time averaged parameters were calculated from n 250 pairs of piv images 2 4 similarity issues to fit the real bubble sweep down scenario the test parameters were set based on the real vessel conditions as follows the working speed of the acoustic transducer was 12 kn and the design speed of the scientific research ship was 16 kn in a calm water surface situation the parameters involved in the bubble sweep down phenomenon relate only to the free surfaces and ship parameters the experiment adhered to conditions related to the froude number 1 f r v s g l p p s v m g l p p m 0 225 v s 12 k n where v is the ship speed g is the gravity and lpp is the length between perpendiculars the subscript band s represents the real ship value and the subscript band m represents the model value in this case f r 0 277 v s 16 k n the reynolds number of the model test was reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude from that of the real scale ship v s 12 k n r e m 4 42 10 6 r e s 5 27 10 8 a n d v s 16 k n r e m 5 90 10 6 r e s 7 03 10 8 in the experimental environment the decrease in the reynolds number increased the thickness ratio of the velocity boundary layer of the entire bow field resulting in a change of velocity distribution near the wall boundary layer in addition to a difference in the flow field between the real scale and model scale zhenban and yingzhong 2004 the scale effect of the flow field caused by the different reynolds numbers affected the boundary layer region nearest to the ship hull at the model scale a low reynolds number has a small impact on the boundary layer millimetre scale flow near the ship s bow but it does not affect the flow field or the propagation of bubbles outside the boundary layer delacroix et al 2016 the measurement area was 300 360 mm and the final resolution of the velocity vector was 2 45 mm when using spiv to capture the flow field around the bow owing to the light spot generated by the diffuse reflection of the laser on the hull surface the near wall flow field over a certain range was over exposed hence the flow field information within 1 cm of the wall could not be obtained it was thus necessary to mask the flow field during image processing consequently the influence of a low reynolds number on the flow at the millimetre scale near the wall boundary layer is ignored 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave and streamline characteristics based on the image information obtained using the underwater camera the waveform and streamline characteristics of the 30 s stable speed section were extracted and averaged and the respective diagrams attached to the bow surface at different speeds were obtained to analyse the macroscopic flow field characteristics of the ship s bow the results are shown in fig 5 the blue line is the fitting wave making surface the cyan line is the designed water line position and the black line is the fitting silk line distribution in the figure the measurement results at speeds of v m 1 028 1 234 1 440 and 1 646 m s are denoted by fig 5 a d respectively first according to the wave making characteristics of the bow it can be seen that for different speeds the general structure of bow wave making is similar because the water begins to accumulate and lift in the front of the bow the water line enters the forward perpendicular at a height greater than the draft then it gradually rises to the wave crest before suddenly falling back entering a relatively flat trough after which the gas liquid interface gradually recovers to stable remaining at a level near the draft line when the velocity is low v m 1 028 m s within the camera s viewing angle after the first pair of peaks and troughs a second pair appears forming smaller secondary wave the wave making characteristics of the bow vary with speed with an increase in v m the wave crest position moves toward the stern the crest moves from 0 1 m from the bow at 1 028 m s to 0 3 m from the bow at 1 646 m s the height of the wave crest increases and the trough lengthens at high speeds the wave surface rises after the trough it can be inferred that there is still a secondary wave in this case and that its position is beyond the camera s observation window in view of the streamline characteristics represented by the silk thread the primary observation at various speeds is that the free end pointed in a lower right direction and the flow field at the bow tended to move downward when the silk thread swept down toward the ship bottom an excess portion stuck to the bottom of the ship and pointed to the stern this phenomenon indicates that the downward movement of the flow field disappeared when it reached the bottom of the ship hence it turned to flow along the bottom plane notably at all speeds the filaments nearest the trough of the free surface were horizontally distributed and the inclination angle was very small with an increase in the distance from the free surface the angle of the silk thread increased gradually and the bow wave effect weakened fig 6 displays a statistical chart of the change in the silk thread angle at 10 cm from the bottom of the ship fig 5 red line at different speeds to analyse the variation of the streamline of the bow flow field with the speed at this draft it can be seen from the figure that the changing trend of the silk line angle was consistent with that of the bow wave making curve the angle at the wave crest was larger than that at the wave trough and the average angle increased with increasing speed v m when the speed was high the bow wave had a longer wave crest range and a larger streamline downward the sweep angle which resulted in the continuous sweep flow field becoming wider and the downward sweep trend becoming stronger 3 2 cross section flow characteristics the six characteristic sections evenly distributed within the measurement range were extracted for flow characteristic analysis the influence of speed on the flow field of the bow is discussed next and the generation and evolution mechanism of the bubble sweep down phenomenon is analysed from the perspective of the flow phenomenon in the model scale the six sections were located at positions x 0 35 0 45 0 55 0 65 0 75 and 0 85 m respectively away from the bow the specific location distribution of each section is shown in fig 7 the vertical velocity distribution of the flow field is considered fig 8 shows the vertical velocity component nephogram and streamline distribution test results at the above cross sections at two speeds fig 8 a f are the flow field test results of x 350 450 550 650 750 and 850 mm from the bow respectively column i is the velocity distribution of the flow field at each section at the working speed of the acoustic equipment 12 kn v m 1 234 m s and column j is the flow field 16 kn v m 1 646 m s according to the design speed of the ship among them the vertical velocity v and the coordinate axis are dimensionless fig 9 shows the variation in the dimensionless vertical velocity at a position 3 cm away from the bow wall at different draughts in which the meanings of fig 9 a f are the same as those of fig 8 a f the results show that the distribution pattern of the flow field around the bow area of the scientific research ship at different speeds was similar and all had obvious downward sweeping velocity fields v v m 0 but the different speeds were different at the width height centre positions and at the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m of the down swept area at the position close to the bow a x 0 35 m it can be seen from fig 5 that the section position is at the wave crest when v m 1 646 m s and it is in the transition process of the water body from stacking to falling back and the flow trend is not obvious v v m is smaller than that of low speeds and approaches zero after breaking away from the influence of surface wave making the sweep down flow field tends to be stable at high speeds and the value of v v m gradually exceeds that of low speeds from bottom to top it exceeds it at the third section thus the distribution of sweep down flow field at the bow especially near the surface is closely related to the wave making characteristics of the bow fig 9 with an increase in the distance from the fore perpendicular the downward swept core area v v m larger gradually moved down when x 0 35 m the core area was close to the free surface position and it gradually moved to the bottom when x 0 85 m by comparison the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m was higher and the downward swept flow field distribution was more stable at high speeds at the model scale the velocity component in the downward direction of the flow field reached 0 35 m s however there was a dimensionless vertical velocity v v m 0 at the bilge of the ship bottom in the measurement area from the streamline distribution the streamline distribution of the flow field in the bow of a scientific research ship was manifested by the radiation from the hull to the outside accompanied by a downward trend there was an oscillating circumfluence vortex near the bilge of all test sections pointing to the bottom of the ship marked by g which may have caused the bubbles to sweep down to the bottom of the ship and accumulate from there they slid along the bottom surface to the stern apart from the streamline distribution at high speed x 0 35 m being chaotic the streamlines of the following sections were smoother than those at low speeds and the sweeping trend was more obvious hence the structure of the bilge vortex being more stable under this flow structure bubbles accumulated more quickly and intensively at the bottom of the ship posing a greater threat to the efficacy of acoustic sensors at the bottom the phenomenon of oscillatory backflow at the bilge bottom may have been caused by two fluids possessing larger velocity differences at that location the transition region was thus subject to fluid instability based on the structural characteristics of the bow of the ship model the characteristics and mechanism of the unstable vibration mode of the bilge were preliminarily analysed considering that the down swept flow from the bow can be approximated as a uniform laminar flow a boundary layer with a velocity gradient was formed on the bilge side surface owing to the sudden change of the structure at the inflection point of the bilge the boundary layer left the interface and formed a free shear layer then the flow separated a part of the fluid entered the bottom of the ship and drove the bottom fluid to move as a large vortex the other part continued to flow downward in the form of a free shear flow at the transition point owing to flow separation the ordered vortices fell off along the flow direction this phenomenon can be attributed to the instability of the shear layer oscillation the amplification of fluid oscillation this resulted in an oscillation backflow range that extended past the bilge range during the process of free shear layer oscillation propagation there was a reverse disturbance opposite to the main flow direction which led to the upward extrusion of the ship bottom streamline 3 3 analysis of 3d 3c reconstruction flow field characteristics thus far research on the 2d plane distribution characteristics of bow flow field have been covered however the bow flow field also has 3d space characteristics furthermore the 3d 3c flow field distribution is important to the mechanism analysis inspired by computer tomography ct technology mamourian 2013 the existing 2d 3c spiv flow field test system was applied to create a set of 3d 3c space flow field test methods suitable for large area measurements to realise a 3d 3c flow field spatial reconstruction felli et al 2015 the specific 3d reconstruction scheme was as follows 1 obtain multi 2d section flow field information based on the ct scanning method 2 establish a set of unified grid matrices for 2d cross sectional data 3 interpolate the original flow field data based on matrix coordinates and reconstruct the 2d 3c dataset into a 3d 3c spatial matrix dataset by combining the positional differences of the multi measurement sections consequently each point in the spatial matrix inherits coordinate information and three direction velocity information simultaneously the measurement area of ct scanning was a rectangular area of 200 200 500 mm on one side of the ship fig 10 shows the isosurface distribution 0 2 v v m 0 08 and the 3d streamline distribution of the research ship bow at speeds of v m 1 234 m s a and v m 1 646 m s b the average filter method was used to smooth and filter the isosurface fig 11 shows the slicing results of the spatial flow field information at different water depths parallel to the ship bottom plane the vertical velocity field information and streamline distribution are included in the figure the yellow area is the hull section from left to right the sections at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 22 cm 2 cm down the bottom are shown it can be seen from the reconstruction results that at low speed the main sweep down flow field was first wide and then narrow and the sweep down flow channel was small however at high speed the distribution trend was narrow first then wider the scope of sweep down channel was significantly greater and the dimensionless vertical velocity v v m was maintained at a high level with the increase in the distance from the fore perpendicular the sweeping core area and sweeping ability of the flow field gradually expanded and deepened and the entire measurement plane was extended under the design speed conditions the 3d streamline diagram shows the flow direction when the water flowed through the measuring area the changing trend of the streamline in the side view was consistent with the experimental results of section 2 2 which discussed the silk thread method at low speeds the streamline was concave along the vertical direction which shows that the front end swept down strongly and the follow up trend weakened in the case of high speed it was the opposite the flow field shows that there was almost no downward sweeping trend in the front and the downward sweeping was more violent in the rear under the hull there were two kinds of streamline states ascending and sweeping the up welling line was mainly distributed in the bilge area directly below the hull caused by the reverse disturbance of the shear layer oscillation the sweeping streamline was a continuous down sweep of the free shear flow swept down the side of the ship the bottom view and the streamline in fig 11 shows the flow state parallel to the bottom plane of the ship the streamline near the wall was basically consistent with that at surface of the ship whereas the streamline far away diffused outward at a small angle at the bilge part of the bottom of the ship the streamlines bunched and diffused which is clearer at the section at 22 cm water depth y lpp 0 01 slightly larger than the width of the bottom the streamlines bunched at both speeds and diffused to the positive and negative directions of the y axis one part entered the bottom of the ship v m 0 and the other entered the sweep down area outside the bilge which is consistent with the oscillation characteristics of the free shear layer mentioned above in summary the overall trend of the bow streamline is as follows after being down swept the streamline flows along the hull or bilge profile and merges with the other streamlines whereas a small number of streamlines are carried by the shear layer breaking through the geometric inflection point of bilge entering the upward turbulence caused by fluid instability and being squeezed out along the bottom plane fig 12 4 conclusions in this study silk thread and spiv methods were used to create a measured flow visualisation for a certain type of scientific research ship results were gathered from streamline display tests flow characteristics analysis of 2d cross sections and reconstruction of the 3d 3c bow flow field based on ct scanning the macro and micro flow mechanisms were analysed the results of the silk thread and spiv matched perfectly by processing and analysing the experimental data the following conclusions are drawn because of the existence of the fore bow on the scientific research ship within the wave making range the velocity of the upper fluid was smaller than that of the lower basin due to wave making accumulation and falling back from the free surface to the bottom of the ship the velocity increased step by step to form a pressure difference that promoted the downward sweeping of microbubbles different speeds led to changes of the pressure gradient which then affected the downward sweeping speed and trend under the conditions of high speed most streamlines reached the bottom plane faster owing to higher pressure gradients at that time the shear layer oscillation of the bilge flow field was more severe the streamlines easily crossed and entered the working area of acoustic equipment however at low speeds the down swept trend of the streamline was weak making it more difficult for the sweep down fluid to enter the bottom plane the microbubbles on the free surface were more likely to gather in the bilge and were wrapped by the bilge vortex which was transferred to the stern of the ship along the bilge and rose at the wake hence it did not flow through the acoustic equipment area to form interference although the time averaged velocity streamline characteristics and 3d distribution of the flow field in the bow area of the scientific research ship were investigated the present study endured some limitations first the piv data could only be obtained in the spanwise direction perpendicular to the centreline of the ship model owing to the design constraints of the existing underwater spiv system thus the data acquisition frequency was low second regarding the 3d 3c reconstruction method the flow field information between the cross sections was obtained by interpolation hence there was a gap between the results and the actual flow field therefore additional research should be conducted along time and spatial dimensions in the future so that a tr time resolved 3d 3c piv fine flow field test system having more dense spatial data and continuous time indicators can be created credit authorship contribution statement chun yu guo contributed to the conception of the study yun fei kuai performed the experiment contributed significantly to

20534,this study experimentally investigates the development and decay of bound energy fractions due to positive and negative interactions b 2 p and b 2 n respectively applying bispectral analysis it was revealed that the ursell number is the most successful parameter to estimate the variation patterns of b 2 p and b 2 n the experimental waves included 27 waves with three offshore wave heights three periods and three offshore water depths propagating over a mild slope of 1 30 a wide variety of wave nonlinearity and bound coupling intensities were observed across the experimental dissipative surf zone for a wave propagating toward the shore the corresponding ursell numbers for the relative maximum values of b 2 p and b 2 n are 0 27 and 0 22 respectively the ratio of significant wave height to water depth corresponding to these extreme values for positive and negative triads are 0 4 and 0 32 respectively the highest values of b 2 p and b 2 n for a progressive wave can be predicted as a function of the ursell number using two new proposed experimental formulations the sub harmonics are more persistent during wave breaking conditions than super harmonics due to lower wave steepness the biphase values of self coupling of the spectral peak are attained negative for waves with ursell numbers greater than 0 35 keywords bound triad interactions nonlinearity shallow water bispectral analysis experimental study ursell number 1 introduction asymmetric features in shoaling wave profile increase during propagation into shallow waters near the shore as a result of disturbance of the seabed on particle orbital motions beneath the water surface eldeberky 1996 wesselman 2014 the triad interaction is one of the main known mechanisms responsible for nonlinearities of shoaling waves in shallow waters the triad interactions including bound and free types are inseparable events from shoaling waves the shoreward velocity associated with peaked crests is more effective in sediment transportation than the seaward velocity associated with flat wave troughs cornish 1898 doering and bowen 1995 therefore asymmetric profiles of shoaling waves resulted from triad wave couplings can directly contribute to sediment transport and geomorphologic changes on sandy beaches hoefel and elgar 2003 ruessink et al 2011 silva et al 2011 in the wave coupling process a fraction of wave energy is exchanged between three frequencies in deep water quadruplet wave wave interactions occur between four wave components which result in white capping or freak waves mori and yasuda 2000 unlike weak four wave nonlinear interactions the intense energy transfer via triad interactions might occur over a few wavelengths forward to shore concurrent with water depth decreasing and wave nonlinearity increasing elgar and guza 1985 freilich et al 1990 it was proved that the second order stokes wave theory could be satisfied by the bound triad interaction both theoretically and experimentally longuet higgins and smith 1966 phillips 1960 the secondary and tertiary local peaks in the wave spectrum are indicative of bound triad interactions in nonlinear triad interactions some energy content transfers from two primary frequencies f 1 and f 2 to their sum or difference frequency f 3 the positive sum triad interactions result in super harmonics with higher frequencies whereas the negative difference triad interactions cause longer sub harmonics the necessary conditions for such energy exchange are as follows armstrong et al 1962 bretherton 1964 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 2 k 1 k 2 k 3 where f i and k i are the frequency and wave number of ith wave component i 1 2 and 3 respectively two primary components with f 1 k 2 and f 2 k 2 must satisfy the dispersion relationship given by 3 2 π f i 2 g k tanh k i h where g is gravitational acceleration and h is water depth the resulting harmonic component with f 3 k 3 obeys the dispersion relationship in resonant interactions which is only possible in very shallow water where the waves are non dispersive armstrong et al 1962 and two primary wave components are propagating in the same direction herbers and burton 1997 however it violates eq 3 in the intermediate water depths where the bound triad interactions occur although the resonant interactions result in considerable amplitudes for f 3 in the same order of the primary harmonics the amplitudes of bound harmonics are small compared with those of f 1 and f 2 young and eldeberky 1998 since the primitive and intensive couplings are expected to occur between frequencies with high energy content the interactions are usually significant for frequencies close to the spectral peak doering and bowen 1987 sheremet et al 2016 young and eldeberky 1998 in addition the interactions between f p spectral peak and 2f p or even higher harmonics of the spectral peak were also reported as important couplings in the previous studies beji and battjes 1993 elgar et al 1995 although the positive bound triad interactions result in skewness of wave profile the negative type excites infragravity waves near the shores the resonance of these long waves having the same natural frequency of harbors is usually responsible for large oscillations in harbors which can influence port operation bowers 1977 gonzález marco et al 2008 gao et al 2019 2020 also these waves contribute to several processes such as sediment transport shoreline erosion and coastal seiches de vries et al 2008 roelvink et al 2009 and bertin et al 2018 the bound infragravity waves are controlled by several features such as wave regime tidal phase and offshore topography thomson et al 2006 gao et al 2017 2018 mahmoudof et al 2021 since the nearshore wave evolution is dramatically controlled by wave shoaling and breaking e g herbers et al 2000 smit et al 2014 accurate knowledge about these dynamics is crucial to predict the nearshore wave regimes however the nonlinear bound couplings their consequences and the effects of wave breaking on them are still an interesting and active area of research in coastal engineering chen et al 2018 chen and zou 2019 mendes et al 2020 safak et al 2017 salmon et al 2016 sheremet et al 2016 the source term describing energy transfer in the bound triad interactions has also been modified to improve the capability of third generation of spectral wave models becq girard et al 1999 eldeberky and madsen 1999 salmon et al 2016 all types of bound near resonant and resonant interactions could be found in highly nonlinear irregular waves in the nature the increasing of wave nonlinearities leads to wave breaking finally when highly nonlinear waves break one question that needs to be raised is whether the effects of nonlinear interactions are weakened or even disappear due to releasing bound wave types or energy return to the primary frequencies inch et al 2017 henderson et al 2006 masselink 1995 ruessink 1998 since the quantitative understanding of the most intensive bound coupling of a progressive irregular wave has not yet to be addressed the predictions about the time and place water depth of such intensive couplings are still inaccurate the relation between nearshore nonlinear bound interactions and wave breaking tendency has been explored in some previous studies using dimensionless hydrodynamic parameters elgar and guza 1985 as well as freilich et al 1990 observed that the self interaction of the spectral peak was intensified as waves propagated toward the coast and the water depth decreased young and eldeberky 1998 reported a decrease in triad interaction for increasing normalized water depth k p d where k p is the peak frequency wave number based on fetch limited sea wave observations ruessink 1998 found that the most intensive negative triad interactions occurred for waves having the parameter of h d in the range of 0 2 0 4 herbers et al 2000 reported an outstanding finding that the decay of wave energy within the surf zone was primarily explained by triad energy transfer to the higher harmonics and then by dissipation at the high frequency harmonics based on field measurements mahmoudof et al 2016 observed the same trend in the bound interactions they also found that the most intensive bound interactions of spectral peak occurred in the waning phase of storms after the wave breaking ceased mendes et al 2020 introduced a conceptual model involving k p d and generalized nonlinearity parameter ga c 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration a stands for the wave amplitude and c is the wave phase speed to evaluate the exchange of bound infragravity wave energy during short wave breaking although the bound triad interaction has been widely investigated no specific simple indicator is agreed by researchers describing the increasing and decreasing trends of this type of coupling for a wave propagating toward shoreward in the present study experiments have been conducted on irregular waves with different intensities of nonlinearity or near breaking to investigate the development and decay of the bound triad interaction this paper seeks to find the most appropriate dimensionless parameter describing the variations of the bound wave wave interactions in shallow water moreover the phase relationship of higher harmonic coupling is reviewed in the present study therefore the excitation conditions of intensive bound interactions for a propagating irregular wave can be predicted the results of the present study improve the knowledge about the bound interactions in the presence of wave breaking in this paper the experimental conditions are explained in the next section and the analysis method is reviewed in section 3 the results and discussions including the spectral bispectral findings and determination of descriptive parameters of bound coupling variations are presented in section 4 also two new parameterizations to predict the high bound interactions are proposed in this section and the study is concluded in the last section 2 experimental conditions an experimental study was performed in a two dimensional wave flume with a length of 26 m a width of 1 m and an operational height of 1 2 m the flume is equipped with a piston type paddle to initiate both regular and irregular waves at the upstream end the second order correction method is implemented in wave maker controller and an active wave absorption control system awacs is provided to prevent the re reflection of reflected waves from testing structures at the wave board location into the flume this system allows users to conduct any desirable wave experiment with different conditions for a long time duration without any significant resonance and growth of wave energy in the flume a passive wave absorber composed of broken stones was also placed at the downstream end of the flume to dissipate the wave energy applying a constant steep slope 3 10 in the present study in front of the studied bed was unavoidable to compensate for the limitation of flume length and the increase of the water depth at the wave paddle then the desirable mild slope of 1 30 was constructed with masonry materials and six wave probes i e st1 st6 were alternatively deployed with three spans of 70 cm and two spans of 50 cm as depicted in fig 1 the implemented mild beach slope is important in dissipative beaches for the formation of spilling type of wave breakers due to the much shorter length of the steep slope than that of the main slope a constant minor effect on test results would be expected according to chen et al 2018 however this undesirable effect is mitigated as explained in section 4 in total 27 irregular waves with jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 σ a 0 07 and σ b 0 09 were generated considering three initial offshore significant wave heights h m0 6 9 and 12 cm at the paddle three peak periods t p 2 0 2 25 and 2 5 s and three water depths of wave generation d 0 55 60 and 65 cm the local water depth at each station for three offshore water depths is presented in table 1 each experiment was coded with three indices corresponding to h m0 t p and d 0 respectively for example t 232 introduced the experiment with h m0 9 cm t p 2 5 s and d 0 60 cm each test was repeated with a different random phase and the results were averaged for each station these wave parameters were selected in such a way that a wide range of wave nonlinearity bound triad interaction and spilling breaking conditions are expected to occur over the mild slope bed table 2 presents the offshore wave characteristic variations at paddle location and surf similarity value ξ o tan α h o l o where α is the bed slope and h o and l o are the offshore wave height and length ranges on the mild slope the water level fluctuation data were logged with a sampling frequency of 50 hz at each station each time series was 900 s long and the first 20 s data were ignored in the analysis to assure stationary condition applying the three point analysis method proposed by mansard and funke 1980 for estimating the wave reflection showed that the reflection coefficient was less than 6 the maximum is corresponding to the longest wave t p 2 5 and d 0 65 cm on the studied slope in all experiments therefore the wave reflection was neglected in all experiments however its effects were diminished in the final analysis as explained in subsection 4 3 3 methods the bispectrum was first used by hasselmann 1962 to evaluate the triad interactions the bispectrum is introduced as the fourier transform of the second order covariance function as follows 4 b f 1 f 2 e x f 1 x f 2 x f 1 f 2 where x f i denotes the complex fourier coefficient of ith wave component and x indicates the complex conjugate of x the general normalized form of bispectrum is entitled as bicoherence which varies between 0 and 1 and introduced by kim and powers 1979 as follows 5 b 2 f 1 f 2 b f 1 f 2 2 e x f 1 x f 2 2 e x f 1 f 2 2 the 95 confidence limit on the estimated bicoherence value is defined based on degree of freedom d o f of analysis as follows 6 b 95 2 6 d o f the 880 s long time series of water level data for each station was divided into 32 segments of 2750 data with a 50 overlap to provide two dimensional spectra of bispectral analysis with a frequency resolution of δf 0 018 hz the degree of freedom of analysis was approximately 64 a 95 significance level on zero bicoherence for all stations was resulted as b 2 95 6 dof 0 094 however the bicoherence values greater than b 2 95 for each experiment were averaged with the same values for the repeated same test with a different random phase the edges of each data segment were smoothed by applying the hanning window to avoid short time sampling effects two times of moving average with a window size of 5 were also applied to further smoothing the spectral results the fraction of forced energy due to the positive triad interaction of frequency range of f 1 f f 2 with a certain frequency of f could be defined as follows herbers et al 1994 7 b 2 2 f 1 f 2 d f b 2 f f f 1 f 2 d f e f e f e f f the integration of the above equation for f over the frequency band of f 3 f 4 results in a fraction of bound energy caused by triad interaction of frequency bands of f 3 f 4 with f 1 f 2 as follows 8 b 2 2 f 3 f 4 d f f 1 f 2 d f b 2 f f f 3 f 4 d f f 1 f 2 d f e f e f f 3 f 4 d f e f f as mentioned before the self triad interaction of spectral peak is more probable than other frequency pairs the self bound coupling of the spectral peak is so important that the parameters of b 2 f p f p or b f p f p were regarded as indicative of interaction intensity e g doering and bowen 1995 suh et al 2000 young and eldeberky 1998 therefore according to experimental spectral peak values 0 40 0 44 and 0 5 hz the frequency range of f p 0 1 f f p 0 1 hz was focused similar to mahmoudof et al 2018 and hanson and phillips 2001 this range includes frequencies with potential of intense triad interactions and the first primary positive and negative interacted harmonic was incorporated into this band normally the frequencies less than 0 2 hz f p 0 1 f 1 f 2 f p 0 1 were assumed as the most probable resulted sub harmonics the lower frequency cutoff of sub harmonics was supposed as the fundamental frequency f min 0 018 hz on the other hand the second interacted harmonic resulting sub harmonic was regarded in a range of f p 0 2 f 2 f p 0 2 hz considering the condition of f 1 f 2 0 2 hz finally eq 8 was modified for a fraction of bound wave energy in the super harmonic frequency range resulted from positive interactions of harmonics in the spectral peak range as follows 9 b p 2 e b o u n d sup e t o t a l sup 2 f p 0 1 h z f p 0 1 h z d

bound super harmonics several studies showed that the estimation of bound super harmonic fractions from the bispectrum in a broad banded spectrum is not straightforward e g young and eldeberky 1998 sénéchal et al 2002 however the exact value of the fraction of bound energy due to negative coupling of harmonics neighboring the spectral peak could be calculated in the same way following herbers et

dependency and cohesivity of harmonic phases are not addressed in these two parameters the shape of a nonlinear wave is dependent on the biphase between two primary waves coupled together the biphase is the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the bispectrum as follows 11 β f 1 f 2 a c r tan im b f 1 f 2 re b f 1 f 2 where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of the bispectrum respectively the biphase is unstable and random in range of π π in deep water where the waves are not coupled together although in the shoaling zone where the waves are skewed the biphase approaches to zero the biphase for saw toothed and asymmetrical waves in very shallow waters is going towards π 2 the relative wave energy flux variation along the distance between two successive stations was estimated as follows 12 d p p s t i p s t i 1 p s t i 1 100 and 13 p e c g where e 1 8 ρ g h r m s 2 and p stand for the wave energy and energy flux respectively and both of them are proportional to the square of the significant wave height c g is the group velocity at station i the parameter of dp is an indicative of the wave breaking intensity and the surf zone extension 4 results and discussions 4 1 spectral and bispectral analysis as a wave propagates over the sloped bed toward the shore the nonlinearity and bound coupling increase till it breaks at the first breaker line which results in a significant reduction of nonlinearity and wave wave coupling then breaker wave shoals and the nonlinearity increase again and breaks at the next breaker line and it continues until the dissipation of all wave s energy content in the present study the characteristics of experimental waves and water depths were selected in different conditions and sizes to attain different wave nonlinearity intensities spilling breaking and bound coupling intensity conditions all of the experimental surf similarity parameter values varied between 0 2 and 0 33 and less than 0 5 indicating that all of the breaker waves were spilling type this issue revealed that the obtained results were independent of different types of wave breaking 4 groups of spilling plunging collapsing and surging and the experimental sloped bed represented a dissipative surf zone since the ξ o parameter has an inverse relation to the square root of wave steepness steeper waves with higher dissipation rates represent lower values of ξ o for constant bed slope at first the interplay of probable positive bound interactions evident as local peaks of higher harmonics of spectral peak two and three times of spectral peak in 1d energy spectra and the wave nonlinearity intensity leading to break was investigated the observed qualitative conditions of higher harmonics of spectral peak and wave breaking in the present experimental study could be categorized in four conditions fig 2 as presented in the following 1 intensive wave breaking which dramatically dissipated peak frequency energy and eliminated all higher harmonics of spectral peak ξ 0 0 20 2 very mild wave breaking that allowed the spatial higher harmonic growth ξ 0 0 33 3 moderate wave breaking that preserved the main spectral peak while a sharp growth of higher harmonics in a finite narrow banded frequency was evident ξ 0 0 25 and 4 moderate wave breaking that gradually transferred the spectral peak toward the low frequencies while the higher harmonic growth appeared in a wide frequency range ξ 0 0 27 generally the cycle of wave shoaling and breaking with different intensities is the main evidence of wave transformation phenomena in all experiments for example the spatial variations of wave spectra in test t 133 are depicted in fig 2a in this figure a minor wave shoaling from st1 to st2 and from st4 to st5 could be observed from st2 to st6 the peak frequency is almost persistent also a gradual spatial growth of the secondary peak at 0 9 hz is apparent on the other hand fig 2b shows the wave evolution of test t 311 on the inclined bed the intensive wave breaking and a relatively significant dissipation rate of the peak frequency are clear the secondary peaks at frequencies of 1 00 1 15 hz which could be corresponded to triad interactions at st1 and st2 were gradually disappeared till st6 due to an intensive wave breaking the energy bulges in the frequency range of 1 35 1 60 hz which could be interpreted as the tertiary peaks due to probable positive bound interaction of f p and 2f p were also diminished in the distance of st1 to st6 span the resulted spectra from test t 223 are demonstrated in fig 2c as a representative of the third circumstance the peak stability from deep to shallow water induces continuous and significant growth of energy at 0 90 hz from st1 to st6 two minor secondary peaks at frequencies of 0 75 and 0 83 hz as well as the spatial growth of the main second peak at 0 9 hz at st6 could be regarded as the results of probable bound interactions also a minor energy development could be found in the frequency range of 1 25 1 4 hz which could be indicative of tertiary peaks test t 233 was another category that showed a moderate wave dissipation intensity as designated in fig 2d the super harmonics appeared in frequencies of 0 85 and 0 93 hz alongside the wave propagation in shallow water the main spectral peak was dissipated from the high frequency side probably due to steeper harmonics and was transferred toward the low frequency side the distribution of energy on a frequency range adjacent to the main peak resulted in multi secondary peaks and a wide frequency range of super harmonics for shallow waters also the spatial growth of possible tertiary peaks could be found in a wide range of 1 10 1 40 hz the emerging of new secondary peaks in short distances about one fifth of the wavelength in successive stations indicates that much shorter distances than the ones reported before e g a few wavelengths in young and eldeberky 1998 or approximately 5 times the wavelength reported by freilich et al 1990 are necessary for the occurrence of probably bound triad interactions in fig 2 it can be found that the long wave energy with f 0 2 hz is spatially reinforced with wave propagation in all the categories mentioned above mostly there were some measured low frequency waves 0 2 hz in all experiments the uniform notable low frequency amplification observed in test t 311 was more significant than other tests as shown in fig 2b this considerable energy transfer to low frequencies could be pertaining to severe wave breaking in random breakpoints resulting in free long waves however the resulted low values of bound energy fraction corresponded to negative triad interaction at st4 st5 and st6 with a descending trend presented in the next subsection table 3 confirms this rough estimation also the comparison between calculated second order energy spectrum from wave wave interaction according to longuet higgins and stewart 1960 and the observed spectrum at st6 showed a good agreement with this finding not shown here for more detailed investigation the energy spectra of t 223 and t 311 are focused in three ranges of f 1 5f p 0 5f p f 1 5f p and 1 5f p f 2 5f p in fig 3 to accurately investigate the low primary and high frequency ranges respectively the tests of t 223 and t 311 represent the most significant growth and decay of secondary peaks respectively while the distance between st1 till st6 is 310 cm fig 1 fig 3c indicates that the significant secondary peak at 0 9 hz in t 223 is enhanced approximately 150 across this span long approximately equal to 60 of a wavelength while fig 3a indicates that the low frequency energy content in this experiment t 223 increases from st1 to st6 the insignificant dissipation of primary peak frequency is apparent from st1 to st5 in fig 3b the increase of low frequency energy content from st1 to st4 and then reduction till st6 can be found for t 311 in fig 3d however the generated absolute low energy content for t 311 is more significant than that for t 223 on the other hand fig 3e shows that energy of higher harmonics with two local peaks at frequencies of 1 00 and 1 20 hz in t 311 entirely decays from st1 till st6 concurrent with intense energy dissipation of main peak frequency fig 3e all of these considerable energy variations occur within the span of st1 till st6 with a constant length of 310 cm generally most of the experimental irregular waves encountered a combination of break and shoaling over the sloped bed the energy flux at each station and the relative dissipation of energy flux within each gauge span were calculated using eqs 12 and 13 for the four tests fig 4 the dissipation and the shoaling of waves are demonstrated as negative and positive records in fig 3b respectively it is seen that the maximum dissipation corresponds to t 233 and the most obvious shoaling corresponds to t 133 along the fourth span between st4 to st5 in t 311 all of the measurement stations reside in the surf zone and saturated wave breaking is dominant along all gauge spans in tests t 223 and t 233 both moderate wave breaking and minor shoaling conditions occur and a relative balance between these two phenomena is dominant within some spans such as nos 3 and 4 generally all attained spectral results were confirmed with higher smoothing two time moving average of analysis but some details such as multi minor secondary peaks were diminished however the bispectral analysis was necessary to evaluate the intensity evaluation of positive and negative bound triad interactions the corresponding 2d bicoherence spectra at st1 and st6 corresponding to the aforementioned experiments are presented in fig 5 in this figure it could be observed that the intensity of bound positive interactions was significantly increased from st1 to st6 for test t 133 comparing fig 5a and b in contrast considerable bound triad interactions of the spectral peak were disappeared coincident with wave propagation and breaking from st1 to st6 in test t 311 fig 5c and d a similar analysis for test t 223 as shown in fig 5e and f indicates that the spectral peak interactions were amplified in the distance from st1 to st6 bic 0 4 in these two panels it could be found that this amplification occurred in a narrow band close to the spectral peak 0 44 hz in agreement with fig 2c the significant bound interaction of f p and 2f p resulted in the higher harmonic amplification which can be clearly perceived in fig 5f also fig 5g and h shows the intensities of bound interactions for test t 233 at st1 and st6 respectively it could be understood that the interactions were intensified and the active frequency band for interactions was widened from st1 to st6 in this test consistent with fig 2d finally it can be concluded that all of bispectral results showed very high agreement with findings deduced from the 1d spectral analysis 4 2 successful parameters to present excitation of bound triad interactions although the bound interaction potential was considered as a function of wave steepness in deep water this parameter is not appropriate to characterize the nonlinearity of waves in shallow water toffoli et al 2007 in this study the bound coupling intensity variation of waves b 2 p and b 2 n in eqs 9 and 10 was assessed against wave nonlinearity intensities also the breaking tendency of waves was assessed using four dimensionless parameters including the relative depth k m d relative height h m0 d shallow wave steepness h m0 l m and the ursell number svendsen 2006 defined as follows 14 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 01 2 d 2 in eq 14 g denotes the gravitational acceleration t m01 stands for mean relative wave period h m0 d k m and l m are the significant wave height water depth wave number and wavelength corresponding to the mean wave period respectively decreasing in the relative depth and increasing in the other three parameters indicate the growth of nonlinearity and more tendency of waves to break the computed ursell number using eq 14 is usually expected to have values less than 1 in some studies the ursell parameter is defined as h m 0 l m 2 d 3 which has no theoretical bound the bound wave energy fraction indices introduced in eqs 9 and 10 were regarded as the representative of relative positive and negative bound interaction intensities respectively the investigations were separately accomplished for each wave characteristic group for a given wave characteristic fig 6 a d shows the scatter diagram of b 2 p against four aforementioned dimensionless parameters the data are categorized based on the experimental wave period three significant findings are 1 the corresponding ursell numbers to the peak values of b 2 p were found to be in the range of 0 2 0 3 fig 6a 2 the increment of b 2 p by increasing the wave steepness fig 6b and 3 the maximum values of b 2 p were recorded in each period group for h m0 d 0 4 fig 6d ruessink 1998 resulted that the corresponding h m0 d values to waves having high fraction values of negative bound triad interaction were ranged from 0 2 to 0 4 based on field measurements in agreement with h m0 d 0 4 found in this study three different lines could be fitted to b 2 p against wave steepness for each wave period group the wave groups with a larger period would have a sharper slope of the fitted line the corresponding maximum values of b 2 p for each period group could not be predicted using such trend lines because the growth of h m0 l m for shoaling waves is limited by the wave breaking however the wave breaking domination could not be found in fig 6b in other words the maximum local steepness for nonbreaking waves observed in the present data set is approximately 0 03 which has the maximum b 2 p values the waves with lower b 2 p values and less steepness can be both breaking dissipating or nonbreaking shoaling types with descending or ascending trends of b 2 p respectively suh et al 2000 found the direct proportion between bicoherence at spectral peak and wave steepness according to experimental observations they pointed out that both bicoherence and wave steepness increase with the wave age during the early stage of wave generation and then drop off as the waves become more developed on the other hand doering and bowen 1995 acknowledged the significant role of ursell number in wave nonlinearity in agreement with the present study findings they proposed a simple ursell number based parameterization for bispectral amplitude and phase for shoaling waves the decreasing of b 2 p values against increasing the relative depth values when k m d 0 4 is also an apparent result in fig 5c this finding is consistent with the results of other studies e g young and eldeberky 1998 elgar and guza 1985 and mahmoudof et al 2016 in conclusion the general downward crescent trend of b 2 p against ursell number relative depth and relative height implies that during the wave propagation toward the shallow waters the increase of bound energy transfer is limited by probable resonant triad interactions or wave breaking and dissipation the exact mechanism of wave coupling reduction during wave breaking has been debated and not agreed by researchers the found reduction of bound energy of super harmonics is consistent with the opinion of herbers et al 2000 that the main reason for wave energy decay is the dissipation at high frequency harmonics which have been formerly amplified as a result of bound nonlinear energy transfer however the results of several studies showed the broadening diffusion and attenuation of bound wave coupling after or during wave breaking e g eldeberky 1996 becq 1998 wesselman 2014 sénéchal et al 2002 found that wave breaking dramatically weakens the strength of nonlinear wave coupling and generates released higher harmonics based on field measurement on a barred beach fig 7 a d shows similar results categorized in three groups of water depth of wave generation no considerable results were found except the fact that the relative maximum values of b 2 p for each water depth were recorded for 0 35 h m0 d 0 45 similar to the illustrated results in fig 5d the results of groups were mostly mixed together and zoning the scattering domain in the three groups was not meaningful and possible the only noteworthy case was that the results were rather grouped for depths of 55 60 and 65 cm from bottom to the top of the diagram fig 7b and d the results are grouped based on offshore significant wave height in fig 8 a d it is clear that the bound interactions are generally expected to be more important for higher waves in panels 8a and 8d it could be found that each data group formed two downward crescent configurations this finding is similar to the schematic pattern of waxing and waning phases of triad interactions relative to the breaking threshold presented by mahmoudof et al 2016 according to field observations although the corresponding h m0 d values to the maximum values of b 2 p for each height group were variant and increased with the growth of offshore wave height the corresponding ursell number to the maximum b 2 p values are approximately 0 25 for all groups in other words the bound energy due to positive bound triad interactions of the spectral peak reached its maximum fraction for waves with a given offshore height when the ursell numbers were close to 0 25 also the same was true for a given offshore period when h m0 d was close to 0 4 fig 6d this means that the phase coupling of peak frequency decreases for waves with criteria greater than these two values as a result of dissipation domination due to wave breaking although there were some correlations with relative depth and wave steepness the ursell parameter and h m0 d were more successful in detecting the development and decay of bound super harmonics it should be noted that the energy of waves with ursell numbers less than 0 25 or h m0 d less than 0 4 was seemed insufficient for noticeable bound interactions on the other hand the transfer of bound to resonant interactions and increasing of breaking tendency were dominated for waves with ursell or h m0 d values higher than these two thresholds therefore the bound interactions were weakened and then destroyed with an increment of these two parameters and wave breaking intensity the found threshold of ur 0 25 is the upper limit of reliability of second order stokes according to the results of madsen 1971 similar investigations were conducted to study the negative bound interactions resulting in long sub harmonics using the index introduced in eq 10 it is resulted that the ursell number and h m0 d were also useful for detecting the bound sub harmonics although the values of b 2 n were different from those of b 2 p both showed similar variations against all dimensionless parameters also the corresponding values of ursell number to the maximum values of b 2 n were different from the above mentioned values for b 2 p the maximum values of b 2 n for a given wave height were found when ursell numbers were close to 0 2 fig 8a the ursell numbers in the form of h m 0 l m 2 d 3 corresponding to high values of b 2 n were close to 60 in agreement with the present study mahmoudof and siadatmousavi 2020 found a similar increasing and decreasing trend of the fraction of bound to the total infragravity wave energy against u r h m 0 l m 2 d 3 from a field study at a sandy coast with an averaged bed slope of 1 5 representing the condition of a dissipative surf zone they found that the maximum value of this fraction occurs when the ursell numbers are in the range of 30 40 the corresponding values of h m0 d to the extreme values of b 2 n for a certain peak period ranged 0 35 fig 9 b the smaller values of ursell number for the high b 2 n values 0 22 than similar values for high b 2 p values 0 27 revealed that the negative bound interactions of a shoaling wave propagating on an inclined bed reached their maximum fractions before positive bound interactions wave breaking affects the magnitude of b 2 p and b 2 n with a different mechanism from decreasing bound interaction intensities decreasing of the numerators of eqs 9 and 10 the breaking of significant waves results in the formation of short free waves reported by several studies e g masselink 1998 and mahmoudof 2018 which appears as high frequency amplification in the wave spectrum on the other hand the generation of free long waves due to random breaking points is another consequence of irregular wave breaking baldock 2006 2012 therefore the decreasing of b 2 p and b 2 n is expected due to the growth of the denominators of eqs 9 and 10 this energy transfer into high frequencies is insignificant compared to the energy dissipation in this frequency range due to depth induced wave breaking therefore the effect of wave breaking with this mechanism is not important for b 2 p on the contrary the proportion of the time varying breaking point is significant for the free long wave generation also these long waves experience fewer breaking than the spectral peak range due to low wave steepness therefore the decrease of b 2 n is considerable because of the explained long wave release this considerable influence of energy transfer to lower frequencies could be another reason for the earlier dropping of b 2 n values than b 2 p by increasing the ursell number table 3 presents a selection of the results pertaining to the four abovementioned experiments in this table it could be found that all of the stations in t 133 and t 311 stand in the ascending and descending parts of scatter diagrams of b 2 p or b 2 n against ursell number or h m0 d fig 8a and d and fig 9a b respectively in other words depth induced wave breaking and dissipation are predominant in experiment t 311 and wave shoaling can be found more important than dissipation in t 133 also t 223 and t 233 are in the transitional parts of the pointed out diagrams spatial increase of b 2 p and b 2 n is concurrent with the growth of ursell number and h m0 d values from st1 to st6 from 0 116 to 0 210 and from 0 154 to 0 235 respectively in t 133 on the contrary with the spatial increase of ursell number from 0 241 to 0 615 in t 311 the values of b 2 p and b 2 n decreased from st1 to st6 drastically in t 223 the maximum value of b 2 p was observed at st4 where the ursell number was equal to 0 256 and the maximum value of b 2 n belonged to st2 where the ursell number was recorded as equal to 0 202 it is emphasized that the values of b 2 p or b 2 n are spatially comparable with its own test and the maximum values of b 2 p and b 2 n for each test are considered relative to the same test 4 3 new parameterizations of high values of b2 p and b2 n as shown in the previous section the ursell number and h m0 d are appropriate parameters to explain the growth and decay of bound triad interaction fractions in this section two simple formulations are sought to predict the relatively high bound interaction fractions the values of b 2 p against ursell numbers for different wave height groups fig 8a and h m0 d for different period groups fig 6d were normalized against the corresponded maximum values of each group this normalization mitigates the disturbances from undesirable effects such as the influence of the constant slope of 3 10 in the front of the sloped bed or negligible reflection effects as well as probable variation of d o f of analysis also the stage of growing or weakening of triad interactions fraction for waves with definite significant height or period can be determined the results for positive bound interactions are presented in fig 10 a and b the normalized b 2 p has less variation against ursell number than h m0 d parameter which means the ursell number is considerably more successful than the h m0 d parameter to specify the stage of growing or weakening of bound interaction fractions and estimating the relatively high values of b 2 p as shown in previous sections this superiority of ursell number compared to other non dimensional parameters was repeated for different wave conditions the less variation of the normal b 2 p against ursell number implies that this parameter is the most successful conventional dimensionless parameter for detecting the bound coupling intensities this finding is in agreement with the results of mendes et al 2018 who reported that the ursell number is the best option describing the nonlinear energy transfer from wind waves to infragravity waves and back however it was ideal if the variation range of b 2 p would be less than that observed for example the normalized b 2 p for ur 0 27 the corresponding ursell number to the relative maximum of b 2 p varied from 0 70 to 1 while the similar range for h m0 d varied from 0 2 to 1 therefore it could be predicted that the relative maximum fraction of bound super harmonic energy for a progressive wave with a certain offshore height corresponds to the ursell number of 0 27 similar diagrams of the normalized b 2 n against the ursell number and h m0 d parameters for negative bound interactions are illustrated in fig 11 a and b which show the superiority of ursell number rather than h m0 d then it was attempted to develop an equation to predict the relatively high bound interaction fractions based on ursell number the sharp ascending and the mild descending trends of data shown in figs 10a and 11a are evoking the following proposed equation of wood and white 2011 for tangential wind profile in tropical cyclones 15 v r v x ρ k 1 k n 1 ρ n λ 1 λ where v r is the tangential velocity with radial distance r from a vortex center v x is the peak value of tangential velocity ρ is the main variable based on the radial distance from the vortex center k n and λ are the power law parameters controlling different parts of the velocity profile this equation was modified for positive and negative bound interaction intensities as follows 16 b p h i g h 3 8 u r 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 8 u r 3 1 1 1 1 1 17 b n h i g h 5 0 u r 1 4 1 1 4 2 4 5 0 u r 2 4 1 2 1 1 2 the coefficients are selected such that the curves represent the higher envelope of data points to estimate the possible maximum bound intensities as a function of ursell number these formulations are specially calibrated for the studied slope 1 30 however the development of these types of investigations using numerical models would improve the estimation of nonlinear bound wave interactions in the presence of wave breaking for different slopes the final results are depicted in fig 12 a and b according to these fitted lines it seems that the bound sub harmonics were less weakened than super harmonics milder descending slope of b 2 n than b 2 p when the potential of wave breaking was increased and the negative bound interactions reached their relative maximum values earlier than positive ones the more stability of bound sub harmonics comparing to bound super harmonics during spectral peak breaking could be due to considerable wavelengths and less wave steepness resulting in small dissipation than super harmonics 4 4 the biphase of peak frequency self coupling the biphase of self interaction of peak frequency β f p f p is an indicator of skewness and asymmetry of wave profile in shallow water this parameter is implemented in spectral wave models such as swan to predict the wave characteristics near shores fig 13 shows the biphase values of self coupling of spectral peak calculated using eq 11 as a function of ursell parameter it can be found that the β f p f p values are fluctuating around 0 for waves with low ursell values with increasing the ursell values the biphase parameter has a general decreasing trend in such a way that for ur 0 35 all attained biphase values are negative however the experimental biphase values don t reach π 2 since all of the attained ursell values are less than 1 the swan as a widely used operational model applies the following relationship for biphase values as a function of the ursell parameter to compute the nonlinear energy transfer between harmonics 18 β π 2 π 2 tanh m u r where ur is the value of the ursell parameter and m is a tunable coefficient therefore the development of investigations such as the present study can improve the accuracy of nonlinear triad parametrizations for phased averaged wave models doering and bowen 1995 found m 0 63 based on field measurements at four coastal environments including plane and barred beaches with different bed slopes and ursell parameter values between 0 07 and 7 00 eldeberky and battjes 1995 proposed m 0 2 as a result of an experimental study over an inclined bottom however eq 18 always yields negative values between 0 and π 2 for the biphase parameter the swan model applies m 0 63 to calculate the biphase values for waves with ur 1 and assumes zero values for ur 1 fig 13 shows that the biphase values corresponding with waves with ur 0 4 have more agreement with eq 18 with the coefficient of m 0 63 than m 0 20 similarly mendes et al 2018 found that eq 18 with m 0 62 successfully performed for waves with ursell numbers in the range of 0 1 1 0 on dissipative plane and barred beaches saprykina et al 2017 explained observed positive biphase values within shallow waters and deviations from eq 18 as a result of periodic energy exchange between the first and second harmonics during near resonant coupling 5 conclusion the fractions of bound sub and super harmonic energy b 2 n and b 2 p respectively against irregular wave nonlinearity intensity and breaking tendency were investigated based on laboratory measurements the intensity of wave nonlinearity was assessed by four conventional simple dimensionless parameters those are the relative depth k m d the relative height h m0 d the wave steepness h m0 l m and the ursell number corresponding to mean wave parameters the spectral and bispectral analysis methods and primary investigations proved that different intensities of wave breaking and bound triad interactions were recorded within the experimental dissipative surf zone different conditions ranged from intense wave breaking and highly limited bound interactions to insignificant wave dissipation and a significant bound amplification in a narrow frequency band the required distances to allow the bound interactions observed in this study were shorter than those reported in previous studies e g young and eldeberky 1998 or freilich et al 1990 the fraction values were calculated based on bispectral analysis foundations explained by herbers et al 1994 and then assessed against four mentioned parameters categorized in three groups of offshore wave height period and water depth it was found that the slope of the fitted line between b 2 p as a function of wave steepness increases as the wave period increases the maximum values of b 2 p in all groups occurred when h m0 d close to 0 4 the relative maximum values of b 2 p also occurred in each certain offshore wave height group when ursell numbers were close to 0 25 a similar analysis for bound sub harmonic indicated that the corresponding values of ursell numbers and h m0 d to relative maximum values of b 2 n were close to 0 2 and 0 32 respectively the grouped values of b 2 p as a function of ursell number and h m0 d were normalized with their own maximum values of the same group to study the development and decay trends of b 2 p this process showed the superior performance of the ursell number than other aforementioned non dimensional numbers to explain the patterns of bound triad interaction growth and decay against the wave nonlinearity intensity and tendency to break generally for a shoreward progressive and nonbreaking irregular wave shoaling on an inclined bed with definite offshore characteristics it is expected to experience its maximum bound positive coupling where and when its ursell number approaches 0 27 similar conditions are valid for negative coupling when the ursell numbers are equal to 0 22 two relationships for b 2 n and b 2 p as functions of ursell number were developed to predict the high values of b 2 n and b 2 p the fitted trends indicated that b 2 n reaches its relative maximum values before b 2 p also the decay rate of b 2 n against the growth of ursell number is less than the corresponding rate of b 2 p due to the lower steepness of sub harmonics finally it has been observed that all of the biphase values of self coupling of the spectral peak for waves with ursell parameter values greater than 0 35 are negative declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20534,this study experimentally investigates the development and decay of bound energy fractions due to positive and negative interactions b 2 p and b 2 n respectively applying bispectral analysis it was revealed that the ursell number is the most successful parameter to estimate the variation patterns of b 2 p and b 2 n the experimental waves included 27 waves with three offshore wave heights three periods and three offshore water depths propagating over a mild slope of 1 30 a wide variety of wave nonlinearity and bound coupling intensities were observed across the experimental dissipative surf zone for a wave propagating toward the shore the corresponding ursell numbers for the relative maximum values of b 2 p and b 2 n are 0 27 and 0 22 respectively the ratio of significant wave height to water depth corresponding to these extreme values for positive and negative triads are 0 4 and 0 32 respectively the highest values of b 2 p and b 2 n for a progressive wave can be predicted as a function of the ursell number using two new proposed experimental formulations the sub harmonics are more persistent during wave breaking conditions than super harmonics due to lower wave steepness the biphase values of self coupling of the spectral peak are attained negative for waves with ursell numbers greater than 0 35 keywords bound triad interactions nonlinearity shallow water bispectral analysis experimental study ursell number 1 introduction asymmetric features in shoaling wave profile increase during propagation into shallow waters near the shore as a result of disturbance of the seabed on particle orbital motions beneath the water surface eldeberky 1996 wesselman 2014 the triad interaction is one of the main known mechanisms responsible for nonlinearities of shoaling waves in shallow waters the triad interactions including bound and free types are inseparable events from shoaling waves the shoreward velocity associated with peaked crests is more effective in sediment transportation than the seaward velocity associated with flat wave troughs cornish 1898 doering and bowen 1995 therefore asymmetric profiles of shoaling waves resulted from triad wave couplings can directly contribute to sediment transport and geomorphologic changes on sandy beaches hoefel and elgar 2003 ruessink et al 2011 silva et al 2011 in the wave coupling process a fraction of wave energy is exchanged between three frequencies in deep water quadruplet wave wave interactions occur between four wave components which result in white capping or freak waves mori and yasuda 2000 unlike weak four wave nonlinear interactions the intense energy transfer via triad interactions might occur over a few wavelengths forward to shore concurrent with water depth decreasing and wave nonlinearity increasing elgar and guza 1985 freilich et al 1990 it was proved that the second order stokes wave theory could be satisfied by the bound triad interaction both theoretically and experimentally longuet higgins and smith 1966 phillips 1960 the secondary and tertiary local peaks in the wave spectrum are indicative of bound triad interactions in nonlinear triad interactions some energy content transfers from two primary frequencies f 1 and f 2 to their sum or difference frequency f 3 the positive sum triad interactions result in super harmonics with higher frequencies whereas the negative difference triad interactions cause longer sub harmonics the necessary conditions for such energy exchange are as follows armstrong et al 1962 bretherton 1964 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 2 k 1 k 2 k 3 where f i and k i are the frequency and wave number of ith wave component i 1 2 and 3 respectively two primary components with f 1 k 2 and f 2 k 2 must satisfy the dispersion relationship given by 3 2 π f i 2 g k tanh k i h where g is gravitational acceleration and h is water depth the resulting harmonic component with f 3 k 3 obeys the dispersion relationship in resonant interactions which is only possible in very shallow water where the waves are non dispersive armstrong et al 1962 and two primary wave components are propagating in the same direction herbers and burton 1997 however it violates eq 3 in the intermediate water depths where the bound triad interactions occur although the resonant interactions result in considerable amplitudes for f 3 in the same order of the primary harmonics the amplitudes of bound harmonics are small compared with those of f 1 and f 2 young and eldeberky 1998 since the primitive and intensive couplings are expected to occur between frequencies with high energy content the interactions are usually significant for frequencies close to the spectral peak doering and bowen 1987 sheremet et al 2016 young and eldeberky 1998 in addition the interactions between f p spectral peak and 2f p or even higher harmonics of the spectral peak were also reported as important couplings in the previous studies beji and battjes 1993 elgar et al 1995 although the positive bound triad interactions result in skewness of wave profile the negative type excites infragravity waves near the shores the resonance of these long waves having the same natural frequency of harbors is usually responsible for large oscillations in harbors which can influence port operation bowers 1977 gonzález marco et al 2008 gao et al 2019 2020 also these waves contribute to several processes such as sediment transport shoreline erosion and coastal seiches de vries et al 2008 roelvink et al 2009 and bertin et al 2018 the bound infragravity waves are controlled by several features such as wave regime tidal phase and offshore topography thomson et al 2006 gao et al 2017 2018 mahmoudof et al 2021 since the nearshore wave evolution is dramatically controlled by wave shoaling and breaking e g herbers et al 2000 smit et al 2014 accurate knowledge about these dynamics is crucial to predict the nearshore wave regimes however the nonlinear bound couplings their consequences and the effects of wave breaking on them are still an interesting and active area of research in coastal engineering chen et al 2018 chen and zou 2019 mendes et al 2020 safak et al 2017 salmon et al 2016 sheremet et al 2016 the source term describing energy transfer in the bound triad interactions has also been modified to improve the capability of third generation of spectral wave models becq girard et al 1999 eldeberky and madsen 1999 salmon et al 2016 all types of bound near resonant and resonant interactions could be found in highly nonlinear irregular waves in the nature the increasing of wave nonlinearities leads to wave breaking finally when highly nonlinear waves break one question that needs to be raised is whether the effects of nonlinear interactions are weakened or even disappear due to releasing bound wave types or energy return to the primary frequencies inch et al 2017 henderson et al 2006 masselink 1995 ruessink 1998 since the quantitative understanding of the most intensive bound coupling of a progressive irregular wave has not yet to be addressed the predictions about the time and place water depth of such intensive couplings are still inaccurate the relation between nearshore nonlinear bound interactions and wave breaking tendency has been explored in some previous studies using dimensionless hydrodynamic parameters elgar and guza 1985 as well as freilich et al 1990 observed that the self interaction of the spectral peak was intensified as waves propagated toward the coast and the water depth decreased young and eldeberky 1998 reported a decrease in triad interaction for increasing normalized water depth k p d where k p is the peak frequency wave number based on fetch limited sea wave observations ruessink 1998 found that the most intensive negative triad interactions occurred for waves having the parameter of h d in the range of 0 2 0 4 herbers et al 2000 reported an outstanding finding that the decay of wave energy within the surf zone was primarily explained by triad energy transfer to the higher harmonics and then by dissipation at the high frequency harmonics based on field measurements mahmoudof et al 2016 observed the same trend in the bound interactions they also found that the most intensive bound interactions of spectral peak occurred in the waning phase of storms after the wave breaking ceased mendes et al 2020 introduced a conceptual model involving k p d and generalized nonlinearity parameter ga c 2 where g is the gravitational acceleration a stands for the wave amplitude and c is the wave phase speed to evaluate the exchange of bound infragravity wave energy during short wave breaking although the bound triad interaction has been widely investigated no specific simple indicator is agreed by researchers describing the increasing and decreasing trends of this type of coupling for a wave propagating toward shoreward in the present study experiments have been conducted on irregular waves with different intensities of nonlinearity or near breaking to investigate the development and decay of the bound triad interaction this paper seeks to find the most appropriate dimensionless parameter describing the variations of the bound wave wave interactions in shallow water moreover the phase relationship of higher harmonic coupling is reviewed in the present study therefore the excitation conditions of intensive bound interactions for a propagating irregular wave can be predicted the results of the present study improve the knowledge about the bound interactions in the presence of wave breaking in this paper the experimental conditions are explained in the next section and the analysis method is reviewed in section 3 the results and discussions including the spectral bispectral findings and determination of descriptive parameters of bound coupling variations are presented in section 4 also two new parameterizations to predict the high bound interactions are proposed in this section and the study is concluded in the last section 2 experimental conditions an experimental study was performed in a two dimensional wave flume with a length of 26 m a width of 1 m and an operational height of 1 2 m the flume is equipped with a piston type paddle to initiate both regular and irregular waves at the upstream end the second order correction method is implemented in wave maker controller and an active wave absorption control system awacs is provided to prevent the re reflection of reflected waves from testing structures at the wave board location into the flume this system allows users to conduct any desirable wave experiment with different conditions for a long time duration without any significant resonance and growth of wave energy in the flume a passive wave absorber composed of broken stones was also placed at the downstream end of the flume to dissipate the wave energy applying a constant steep slope 3 10 in the present study in front of the studied bed was unavoidable to compensate for the limitation of flume length and the increase of the water depth at the wave paddle then the desirable mild slope of 1 30 was constructed with masonry materials and six wave probes i e st1 st6 were alternatively deployed with three spans of 70 cm and two spans of 50 cm as depicted in fig 1 the implemented mild beach slope is important in dissipative beaches for the formation of spilling type of wave breakers due to the much shorter length of the steep slope than that of the main slope a constant minor effect on test results would be expected according to chen et al 2018 however this undesirable effect is mitigated as explained in section 4 in total 27 irregular waves with jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 σ a 0 07 and σ b 0 09 were generated considering three initial offshore significant wave heights h m0 6 9 and 12 cm at the paddle three peak periods t p 2 0 2 25 and 2 5 s and three water depths of wave generation d 0 55 60 and 65 cm the local water depth at each station for three offshore water depths is presented in table 1 each experiment was coded with three indices corresponding to h m0 t p and d 0 respectively for example t 232 introduced the experiment with h m0 9 cm t p 2 5 s and d 0 60 cm each test was repeated with a different random phase and the results were averaged for each station these wave parameters were selected in such a way that a wide range of wave nonlinearity bound triad interaction and spilling breaking conditions are expected to occur over the mild slope bed table 2 presents the offshore wave characteristic variations at paddle location and surf similarity value ξ o tan α h o l o where α is the bed slope and h o and l o are the offshore wave height and length ranges on the mild slope the water level fluctuation data were logged with a sampling frequency of 50 hz at each station each time series was 900 s long and the first 20 s data were ignored in the analysis to assure stationary condition applying the three point analysis method proposed by mansard and funke 1980 for estimating the wave reflection showed that the reflection coefficient was less than 6 the maximum is corresponding to the longest wave t p 2 5 and d 0 65 cm on the studied slope in all experiments therefore the wave reflection was neglected in all experiments however its effects were diminished in the final analysis as explained in subsection 4 3 3 methods the bispectrum was first used by hasselmann 1962 to evaluate the triad interactions the bispectrum is introduced as the fourier transform of the second order covariance function as follows 4 b f 1 f 2 e x f 1 x f 2 x f 1 f 2 where x f i denotes the complex fourier coefficient of ith wave component and x indicates the complex conjugate of x the general normalized form of bispectrum is entitled as bicoherence which varies between 0 and 1 and introduced by kim and powers 1979 as follows 5 b 2 f 1 f 2 b f 1 f 2 2 e x f 1 x f 2 2 e x f 1 f 2 2 the 95 confidence limit on the estimated bicoherence value is defined based on degree of freedom d o f of analysis as follows 6 b 95 2 6 d o f the 880 s long time series of water level data for each station was divided into 32 segments of 2750 data with a 50 overlap to provide two dimensional spectra of bispectral analysis with a frequency resolution of δf 0 018 hz the degree of freedom of analysis was approximately 64 a 95 significance level on zero bicoherence for all stations was resulted as b 2 95 6 dof 0 094 however the bicoherence values greater than b 2 95 for each experiment were averaged with the same values for the repeated same test with a different random phase the edges of each data segment were smoothed by applying the hanning window to avoid short time sampling effects two times of moving average with a window size of 5 were also applied to further smoothing the spectral results the fraction of forced energy due to the positive triad interaction of frequency range of f 1 f f 2 with a certain frequency of f could be defined as follows herbers et al 1994 7 b 2 2 f 1 f 2 d f b 2 f f f 1 f 2 d f e f e f e f f the integration of the above equation for f over the frequency band of f 3 f 4 results in a fraction of bound energy caused by triad interaction of frequency bands of f 3 f 4 with f 1 f 2 as follows 8 b 2 2 f 3 f 4 d f f 1 f 2 d f b 2 f f f 3 f 4 d f f 1 f 2 d f e f e f f 3 f 4 d f e f f as mentioned before the self triad interaction of spectral peak is more probable than other frequency pairs the self bound coupling of the spectral peak is so important that the parameters of b 2 f p f p or b f p f p were regarded as indicative of interaction intensity e g doering and bowen 1995 suh et al 2000 young and eldeberky 1998 therefore according to experimental spectral peak values 0 40 0 44 and 0 5 hz the frequency range of f p 0 1 f f p 0 1 hz was focused similar to mahmoudof et al 2018 and hanson and phillips 2001 this range includes frequencies with potential of intense triad interactions and the first primary positive and negative interacted harmonic was incorporated into this band normally the frequencies less than 0 2 hz f p 0 1 f 1 f 2 f p 0 1 were assumed as the most probable resulted sub harmonics the lower frequency cutoff of sub harmonics was supposed as the fundamental frequency f min 0 018 hz on the other hand the second interacted harmonic resulting sub harmonic was regarded in a range of f p 0 2 f 2 f p 0 2 hz considering the condition of f 1 f 2 0 2 hz finally eq 8 was modified for a fraction of bound wave energy in the super harmonic frequency range resulted from positive interactions of harmonics in the spectral peak range as follows 9 b p 2 e b o u n d sup e t o t a l sup 2 f p 0 1 h z f p 0 1 h z d f f p 0 1 h z f p 0 1 h z d f b 2 f f f p 0 1 f p 0 1 d f f p 0 1 h z f p 0 1 h z d f e f f e f f p 0 1 f p 0 1 d f e f it is worth mentioning that eq 9 is an approximate estimation of the fraction of bound super harmonics several studies showed that the estimation of bound super harmonic fractions from the bispectrum in a broad banded spectrum is not straightforward e g young and eldeberky 1998 sénéchal et al 2002 however the exact value of the fraction of bound energy due to negative coupling of harmonics neighboring the spectral peak could be calculated in the same way following herbers et al 1994 regarding δf f f 10 b n 2 e b o u n d s u b e t o t a l s u b 2 0 018 h z 0 2 h z d δ f f p 0 2 h z f p 0 2 h z d f b 2 f δ f 0 018 h z 0 2 h z d δ f f p 0 2 h z f p 0 2 h z d f e f δ f e f 0 018 h z 0 2 h z d δ f e δ f the nonlinear shapes of waves can be generally explained by two parameters of asymmetry and skewness resulted from bispectrum calculations e g de wit et al 2020 however the dependency and cohesivity of harmonic phases are not addressed in these two parameters the shape of a nonlinear wave is dependent on the biphase between two primary waves coupled together the biphase is the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the bispectrum as follows 11 β f 1 f 2 a c r tan im b f 1 f 2 re b f 1 f 2 where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of the bispectrum respectively the biphase is unstable and random in range of π π in deep water where the waves are not coupled together although in the shoaling zone where the waves are skewed the biphase approaches to zero the biphase for saw toothed and asymmetrical waves in very shallow waters is going towards π 2 the relative wave energy flux variation along the distance between two successive stations was estimated as follows 12 d p p s t i p s t i 1 p s t i 1 100 and 13 p e c g where e 1 8 ρ g h r m s 2 and p stand for the wave energy and energy flux respectively and both of them are proportional to the square of the significant wave height c g is the group velocity at station i the parameter of dp is an indicative of the wave breaking intensity and the surf zone extension 4 results and discussions 4 1 spectral and bispectral analysis as a wave propagates over the sloped bed toward the shore the nonlinearity and bound coupling increase till it breaks at the first breaker line which results in a significant reduction of nonlinearity and wave wave coupling then breaker wave shoals and the nonlinearity increase again and breaks at the next breaker line and it continues until the dissipation of all wave s energy content in the present study the characteristics of experimental waves and water depths were selected in different conditions and sizes to attain different wave nonlinearity intensities spilling breaking and bound coupling intensity conditions all of the experimental surf similarity parameter values varied between 0 2 and 0 33 and less than 0 5 indicating that all of the breaker waves were spilling type this issue revealed that the obtained results were independent of different types of wave breaking 4 groups of spilling plunging collapsing and surging and the experimental sloped bed represented a dissipative surf zone since the ξ o parameter has an inverse relation to the square root of wave steepness steeper waves with higher dissipation rates represent lower values of ξ o for constant bed slope at first the interplay of probable positive bound interactions evident as local peaks of higher harmonics of spectral peak two and three times of spectral peak in 1d energy spectra and the wave nonlinearity intensity leading to break was investigated the observed qualitative conditions of higher harmonics of spectral peak and wave breaking in the present experimental study could be categorized in four conditions fig 2 as presented in the following 1 intensive wave breaking which dramatically dissipated peak frequency energy and eliminated all higher harmonics of spectral peak ξ 0 0 20 2 very mild wave breaking that allowed the spatial higher harmonic growth ξ 0 0 33 3 moderate wave breaking that preserved the main spectral peak while a sharp growth of higher harmonics in a finite narrow banded frequency was evident ξ 0 0 25 and 4 moderate wave breaking that gradually transferred the spectral peak toward the low frequencies while the higher harmonic growth appeared in a wide frequency range ξ 0 0 27 generally the cycle of wave shoaling and breaking with different intensities is the main evidence of wave transformation phenomena in all experiments for example the spatial variations of wave spectra in test t 133 are depicted in fig 2a in this figure a minor wave shoaling from st1 to st2 and from st4 to st5 could be observed from st2 to st6 the peak frequency is almost persistent also a gradual spatial growth of the secondary peak at 0 9 hz is apparent on the other hand fig 2b shows the wave evolution of test t 311 on the inclined bed the intensive wave breaking and a relatively significant dissipation rate of the peak frequency are clear the secondary peaks at frequencies of 1 00 1 15 hz which could be corresponded to triad interactions at st1 and st2 were gradually disappeared till st6 due to an intensive wave breaking the energy bulges in the frequency range of 1 35 1 60 hz which could be interpreted as the tertiary peaks due to probable positive bound interaction of f p and 2f p were also diminished in the distance of st1 to st6 span the resulted spectra from test t 223 are demonstrated in fig 2c as a representative of the third circumstance the peak stability from deep to shallow water induces continuous and significant growth of energy at 0 90 hz from st1 to st6 two minor secondary peaks at frequencies of 0 75 and 0 83 hz as well as the spatial growth of the main second peak at 0 9 hz at st6 could be regarded as the results of probable bound interactions also a minor energy development could be found in the frequency range of 1 25 1 4 hz which could be indicative of tertiary peaks test t 233 was another category that showed a moderate wave dissipation intensity as designated in fig 2d the super harmonics appeared in frequencies of 0 85 and 0 93 hz alongside the wave propagation in shallow water the main spectral peak was dissipated from the high frequency side probably due to steeper harmonics and was transferred toward the low frequency side the distribution of energy on a frequency range adjacent to the main peak resulted in multi secondary peaks and a wide frequency range of super harmonics for shallow waters also the spatial growth of possible tertiary peaks could be found in a wide range of 1 10 1 40 hz the emerging of new secondary peaks in short distances about one fifth of the wavelength in successive stations indicates that much shorter distances than the ones reported before e g a few wavelengths in young and eldeberky 1998 or approximately 5 times the wavelength reported by freilich et al 1990 are necessary for the occurrence of probably bound triad interactions in fig 2 it can be found that the long wave energy with f 0 2 hz is spatially reinforced with wave propagation in all the categories mentioned above mostly there were some measured low frequency waves 0 2 hz in all experiments the uniform notable low frequency amplification observed in test t 311 was more significant than other tests as shown in fig 2b this considerable energy transfer to low frequencies could be pertaining to severe wave breaking in random breakpoints resulting in free long waves however the resulted low values of bound energy fraction corresponded to negative triad interaction at st4 st5 and st6 with a descending trend presented in the next subsection table 3 confirms this rough estimation also the comparison between calculated second order energy spectrum from wave wave interaction according to longuet higgins and stewart 1960 and the observed spectrum at st6 showed a good agreement with this finding not shown here for more detailed investigation the energy spectra of t 223 and t 311 are focused in three ranges of f 1 5f p 0 5f p f 1 5f p and 1 5f p f 2 5f p in fig 3 to accurately investigate the low primary and high frequency ranges respectively the tests of t 223 and t 311 represent the most significant growth and decay of secondary peaks respectively while the distance between st1 till st6 is 310 cm fig 1 fig 3c indicates that the significant secondary peak at 0 9 hz in t 223 is enhanced approximately 150 across this span long approximately equal to 60 of a wavelength while fig 3a indicates that the low frequency energy content in this experiment t 223 increases from st1 to st6 the insignificant dissipation of primary peak frequency is apparent from st1 to st5 in fig 3b the increase of low frequency energy content from st1 to st4 and then reduction till st6 can be found for t 311 in fig 3d however the generated absolute low energy content for t 311 is more significant than that for t 223 on the other hand fig 3e shows that energy of higher harmonics with two local peaks at frequencies of 1 00 and 1 20 hz in t 311 entirely decays from st1 till st6 concurrent with intense energy dissipation of main peak frequency fig 3e all of these considerable energy variations occur within the span of st1 till st6 with a constant length of 310 cm generally most of the experimental irregular waves encountered a combination of break and shoaling over the sloped bed the energy flux at each station and the relative dissipation of energy flux within each gauge span were calculated using eqs 12 and 13 for the four tests fig 4 the dissipation and the shoaling of waves are demonstrated as negative and positive records in fig 3b respectively it is seen that the maximum dissipation corresponds to t 233 and the most obvious shoaling corresponds to t 133 along the fourth span between st4 to st5 in t 311 all of the measurement stations reside in the surf zone and saturated wave breaking is dominant along all gauge spans in tests t 223 and t 233 both moderate wave breaking and minor shoaling conditions occur and a relative balance between these two phenomena is dominant within some spans such as nos 3 and 4 generally all attained spectral results were confirmed with higher smoothing two time moving average of analysis but some details such as multi minor secondary peaks were diminished however the bispectral analysis was necessary to evaluate the intensity evaluation of positive and negative bound triad interactions the corresponding 2d bicoherence spectra at st1 and st6 corresponding to the aforementioned experiments are presented in fig 5 in this figure it could be observed that the intensity of bound positive interactions was significantly increased from st1 to st6 for test t 133 comparing fig 5a and b in contrast considerable bound triad interactions of the spectral peak were disappeared coincident with wave propagation and breaking from st1 to st6 in test t 311 fig 5c and d a similar analysis for test t 223 as shown in fig 5e and f indicates that the spectral peak interactions were amplified in the distance from st1 to st6 bic 0 4 in these two panels it could be found that this amplification occurred in a narrow band close to the spectral peak 0 44 hz in agreement with fig 2c the significant bound interaction of f p and 2f p resulted in the higher harmonic amplification which can be clearly perceived in fig 5f also fig 5g and h shows the intensities of bound interactions for test t 233 at st1 and st6 respectively it could be understood that the interactions were intensified and the active frequency band for interactions was widened from st1 to st6 in this test consistent with fig 2d finally it can be concluded that all of bispectral results showed very high agreement with findings deduced from the 1d spectral analysis 4 2 successful parameters to present excitation of bound triad interactions although the bound interaction potential was considered as a function of wave steepness in deep water this parameter is not appropriate to characterize the nonlinearity of waves in shallow water toffoli et al 2007 in this study the bound coupling intensity variation of waves b 2 p and b 2 n in eqs 9 and 10 was assessed against wave nonlinearity intensities also the breaking tendency of waves was assessed using four dimensionless parameters including the relative depth k m d relative height h m0 d shallow wave steepness h m0 l m and the ursell number svendsen 2006 defined as follows 14 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 01 2 d 2 in eq 14 g denotes the gravitational acceleration t m01 stands for mean relative wave period h m0 d k m and l m are the significant wave height water depth wave number and wavelength corresponding to the mean wave period respectively decreasing in the relative depth and increasing in the other three parameters indicate the growth of nonlinearity and more tendency of waves to break the computed ursell number using eq 14 is usually expected to have values less than 1 in some studies the ursell parameter is defined as h m 0 l m 2 d 3 which has no theoretical bound the bound wave energy fraction indices introduced in eqs 9 and 10 were regarded as the representative of relative positive and negative bound interaction intensities respectively the investigations were separately accomplished for each wave characteristic group for a given wave characteristic fig 6 a d shows the scatter diagram of b 2 p against four aforementioned dimensionless parameters the data are categorized based on the experimental wave period three significant findings are 1 the corresponding ursell numbers to the peak values of b 2 p were found to be in the range of 0 2 0 3 fig 6a 2 the increment of b 2 p by increasing the wave steepness fig 6b and 3 the maximum values of b 2 p were recorded in each period group for h m0 d 0 4 fig 6d ruessink 1998 resulted that the corresponding h m0 d values to waves having high fraction values of negative bound triad interaction were ranged from 0 2 to 0 4 based on field measurements in agreement with h m0 d 0 4 found in this study three different lines could be fitted to b 2 p against wave steepness for each wave period group the wave groups with a larger period would have a sharper slope of the fitted line the corresponding maximum values of b 2 p for each period group could not be predicted using such trend lines because the growth of h m0 l m for shoaling waves is limited by the wave breaking however the wave breaking domination could not be found in fig 6b in other words the maximum local steepness for nonbreaking waves observed in the present data set is approximately 0 03 which has the maximum b 2 p values the waves with lower b 2 p values and less steepness can be both breaking dissipating or nonbreaking shoaling types with descending or ascending trends of b 2 p respectively suh et al 2000 found the direct proportion between bicoherence at spectral peak and wave steepness according to experimental observations they pointed out that both bicoherence and wave steepness increase with the wave age during the early stage of wave generation and then drop off as the waves become more developed on the other hand doering and bowen 1995 acknowledged the significant role of ursell number in wave nonlinearity in agreement with the present study findings they proposed a simple ursell number based parameterization for bispectral amplitude and phase for shoaling waves the decreasing of b 2 p values against increasing the relative depth values when k m d 0 4 is also an apparent result in fig 5c this finding is consistent with the results of other studies e g young and eldeberky 1998 elgar and guza 1985 and mahmoudof et al 2016 in conclusion the general downward crescent trend of b 2 p against ursell number relative depth and relative height implies that during the wave propagation toward the shallow waters the increase of bound energy transfer is limited by probable resonant triad interactions or wave breaking and dissipation the exact mechanism of wave coupling reduction during wave breaking has been debated and not agreed by researchers the found reduction of bound energy of super harmonics is consistent with the opinion of herbers et al 2000 that the main reason for wave energy decay is the dissipation at high frequency harmonics which have been formerly amplified as a result of bound nonlinear energy transfer however the results of several studies showed the broadening diffusion and attenuation of bound wave coupling after or during wave breaking e g eldeberky 1996 becq 1998 wesselman 2014 sénéchal et al 2002 found that wave breaking dramatically weakens the strength of nonlinear wave coupling and generates released higher harmonics based on field measurement on a barred beach fig 7 a d shows similar results categorized in three groups of water depth of wave generation no considerable results were found except the fact that the relative maximum values of b 2 p for each water depth were recorded for 0 35 h m0 d 0 45 similar to the illustrated results in fig 5d the results of groups were mostly mixed together and zoning the scattering domain in the three groups was not meaningful and possible the only noteworthy case was that the results were rather grouped for depths of 55 60 and 65 cm from bottom to the top of the diagram fig 7b and d the results are grouped based on offshore significant wave height in fig 8 a d it is clear that the bound interactions are generally expected to be more important for higher waves in panels 8a and 8d it could be found that each data group formed two downward crescent configurations this finding is similar to the schematic pattern of waxing and waning phases of triad interactions relative to the breaking threshold presented by mahmoudof et al 2016 according to field observations although the corresponding h m0 d values to the maximum values of b 2 p for each height group were variant and increased with the growth of offshore wave height the corresponding ursell number to the maximum b 2 p values are approximately 0 25 for all groups in other words the bound energy due to positive bound triad interactions of the spectral peak reached its maximum fraction for waves with a given offshore height when the ursell numbers were close to 0 25 also the same was true for a given offshore period when h m0 d was close to 0 4 fig 6d this means that the phase coupling of peak frequency decreases for waves with criteria greater than these two values as a result of dissipation domination due to wave breaking although there were some correlations with relative depth and wave steepness the ursell parameter and h m0 d were more successful in detecting the development and decay of bound super harmonics it should be noted that the energy of waves with ursell numbers less than 0 25 or h m0 d less than 0 4 was seemed insufficient for noticeable bound interactions on the other hand the transfer of bound to resonant interactions and increasing of breaking tendency were dominated for waves with ursell or h m0 d values higher than these two thresholds therefore the bound interactions were weakened and then destroyed with an increment of these two parameters and wave breaking intensity the found threshold of ur 0 25 is the upper limit of reliability of second order stokes according to the results of madsen 1971 similar investigations were conducted to study the negative bound interactions resulting in long sub harmonics using the index introduced in eq 10 it is resulted that the ursell number and h m0 d were also useful for detecting the bound sub harmonics although the values of b 2 n were different from those of b 2 p both showed similar variations against all dimensionless parameters also the corresponding values of ursell number to the maximum values of b 2 n were different from the above mentioned values for b 2 p the maximum values of b 2 n for a given wave height were found when ursell numbers were close to 0 2 fig 8a the ursell numbers in the form of h m 0 l m 2 d 3 corresponding to high values of b 2 n were close to 60 in agreement with the present study mahmoudof and siadatmousavi 2020 found a similar increasing and decreasing trend of the fraction of bound to the total infragravity wave energy against u r h m 0 l m 2 d 3 from a field study at a sandy coast with an averaged bed slope of 1 5 representing the condition of a dissipative surf zone they found that the maximum value of this fraction occurs when the ursell numbers are in the range of 30 40 the corresponding values of h m0 d to the extreme values of b 2 n for a certain peak period ranged 0 35 fig 9 b the smaller values of ursell number for the high b 2 n values 0 22 than similar values for high b 2 p values 0 27 revealed that the negative bound interactions of a shoaling wave propagating on an inclined bed reached their maximum fractions before positive bound interactions wave breaking affects the magnitude of b 2 p and b 2 n with a different mechanism from decreasing bound interaction intensities decreasing of the numerators of eqs 9 and 10 the breaking of significant waves results in the formation of short free waves reported by several studies e g masselink 1998 and mahmoudof 2018 which appears as high frequency amplification in the wave spectrum on the other hand the generation of free long waves due to random breaking points is another consequence of irregular wave breaking baldock 2006 2012 therefore the decreasing of b 2 p and b 2 n is expected due to the growth of the denominators of eqs 9 and 10 this energy transfer into high frequencies is insignificant compared to the energy dissipation in this frequency range due to depth induced wave breaking therefore the effect of wave breaking with this mechanism is not important for b 2 p on the contrary the proportion of the time varying breaking point is significant for the free long wave generation also these long waves experience fewer breaking than the spectral peak range due to low wave steepness therefore the decrease of b 2 n is considerable because of the explained long wave release this considerable influence of energy transfer to lower frequencies could be another reason for the earlier dropping of b 2 n values than b 2 p by increasing the ursell number table 3 presents a selection of the results pertaining to the four abovementioned experiments in this table it could be found that all of the stations in t 133 and t 311 stand in the ascending and descending parts of scatter diagrams of b 2 p or b 2 n against ursell number or h m0 d fig 8a and d and fig 9a b respectively in other words depth induced wave breaking and dissipation are predominant in experiment t 311 and wave shoaling can be found more important than dissipation in t 133 also t 223 and t 233 are in the transitional parts of the pointed out diagrams spatial increase of b 2 p and b 2 n is concurrent with the growth of ursell number and h m0 d values from st1 to st6 from 0 116 to 0 210 and from 0 154 to 0 235 respectively in t 133 on the contrary with the spatial increase of ursell number from 0 241 to 0 615 in t 311 the values of b 2 p and b 2 n decreased from st1 to st6 drastically in t 223 the maximum value of b 2 p was observed at st4 where the ursell number was equal to 0 256 and the maximum value of b 2 n belonged to st2 where the ursell number was recorded as equal to 0 202 it is emphasized that the values of b 2 p or b 2 n are spatially comparable with its own test and the maximum values of b 2 p and b 2 n for each test are considered relative to the same test 4 3 new parameterizations of high values of b2 p and b2 n as shown in the previous section the ursell number and h m0 d are appropriate parameters to explain the growth and decay of bound triad interaction fractions in this section two simple formulations are sought to predict the relatively high bound interaction fractions the values of b 2 p against ursell numbers for different wave height groups fig 8a and h m0 d for different period groups fig 6d were normalized against the corresponded maximum values of each group this normalization mitigates the disturbances from undesirable effects such as the influence of the constant slope of 3 10 in the front of the sloped bed or negligible reflection effects as well as probable variation of d o f of analysis also the stage of growing or weakening of triad interactions fraction for waves with definite significant height or period can be determined the results for positive bound interactions are presented in fig 10 a and b the normalized b 2 p has less variation against ursell number than h m0 d parameter which means the ursell number is considerably more successful than the h m0 d parameter to specify the stage of growing or weakening of bound interaction fractions and estimating the relatively high values of b 2 p as shown in previous sections this superiority of ursell number compared to other non dimensional parameters was repeated for different wave conditions the less variation of the normal b 2 p against ursell number implies that this parameter is the most successful conventional dimensionless parameter for detecting the bound coupling intensities this finding is in agreement with the results of mendes et al 2018 who reported that the ursell number is the best option describing the nonlinear energy transfer from wind waves to infragravity waves and back however it was ideal if the variation range of b 2 p would be less than that observed for example the normalized b 2 p for ur 0 27 the corresponding ursell number to the relative maximum of b 2 p varied from 0 70 to 1 while the similar range for h m0 d varied from 0 2 to 1 therefore it could be predicted that the relative maximum fraction of bound super harmonic energy for a progressive wave with a certain offshore height corresponds to the ursell number of 0 27 similar diagrams of the normalized b 2 n against the ursell number and h m0 d parameters for negative bound interactions are illustrated in fig 11 a and b which show the superiority of ursell number rather than h m0 d then it was attempted to develop an equation to predict the relatively high bound interaction fractions based on ursell number the sharp ascending and the mild descending trends of data shown in figs 10a and 11a are evoking the following proposed equation of wood and white 2011 for tangential wind profile in tropical cyclones 15 v r v x ρ k 1 k n 1 ρ n λ 1 λ where v r is the tangential velocity with radial distance r from a vortex center v x is the peak value of tangential velocity ρ is the main variable based on the radial distance from the vortex center k n and λ are the power law parameters controlling different parts of the velocity profile this equation was modified for positive and negative bound interaction intensities as follows 16 b p h i g h 3 8 u r 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 8 u r 3 1 1 1 1 1 17 b n h i g h 5 0 u r 1 4 1 1 4 2 4 5 0 u r 2 4 1 2 1 1 2 the coefficients are selected such that the curves represent the higher envelope of data points to estimate the possible maximum bound intensities as a function of ursell number these formulations are specially calibrated for the studied slope 1 30 however the development of these types of investigations using numerical models would improve the estimation of nonlinear bound wave interactions in the presence of wave breaking for different slopes the final results are depicted in fig 12 a and b according to these fitted lines it seems that the bound sub harmonics were less weakened than super harmonics milder descending slope of b 2 n than b 2 p when the potential of wave breaking was increased and the negative bound interactions reached their relative maximum values earlier than positive ones the more stability of bound sub harmonics comparing to bound super harmonics during spectral peak breaking could be due to considerable wavelengths and less wave steepness resulting in small dissipation than super harmonics 4 4 the biphase of peak frequency self coupling the biphase of self interaction of peak frequency β f p f p is an indicator of skewness and asymmetry of wave profile in shallow water this parameter is implemented in spectral wave models such as swan to predict the wave characteristics near shores fig 13 shows the biphase values of self coupling of spectral peak calculated using eq 11 as a function of ursell parameter it can be found that the β f p f p values are fluctuating around 0 for waves with low ursell values with increasing the ursell values the biphase parameter has a general decreasing trend in such a way that for ur 0 35 all attained biphase values are negative however the experimental biphase values don t reach π 2 since all of the attained ursell values are less than 1 the swan as a widely used operational model applies the following relationship for biphase values as a function of the ursell parameter to compute the nonlinear energy transfer between harmonics 18 β π 2 π 2 tanh m u r where ur is the value of the ursell parameter and m is a tunable coefficient therefore the development of investigations such as the present study can improve the accuracy of nonlinear triad parametrizations for phased averaged wave models doering and bowen 1995 found m 0 63 based on field measurements at four coastal environments including plane and barred beaches with different bed slopes and ursell parameter values between 0 07 and 7 00 eldeberky and battjes 1995 proposed m 0 2 as a result of an experimental study over an inclined bottom however eq 18 always yields negative values between 0 and π 2 for the biphase parameter the swan model applies m 0 63 to calculate the biphase values for waves with ur 1 and assumes zero values for ur 1 fig 13 shows that the biphase values corresponding with waves with ur 0 4 have more agreement with eq 18 with the coefficient of m 0 63 than m 0 20 similarly mendes et al 2018 found that eq 18 with m 0 62 successfully performed for waves with ursell numbers in the range of 0 1 1 0 on dissipative plane and barred beaches saprykina et al 2017 explained observed positive biphase values within shallow waters and deviations from eq 18 as a result of periodic energy exchange between the first and second harmonics during near resonant coupling 5 conclusion the fractions of bound sub and super harmonic energy b 2 n and b 2 p respectively against irregular wave nonlinearity intensity and breaking tendency were investigated based on laboratory measurements the intensity of wave nonlinearity was assessed by four conventional simple dimensionless parameters those are the relative depth k m d the relative height h m0 d the wave steepness h m0 l m and the ursell number corresponding to mean wave parameters the spectral and bispectral analysis methods and primary investigations proved that different intensities of wave breaking and bound triad interactions were recorded within the experimental dissipative surf zone different conditions ranged from intense wave breaking and highly limited bound interactions to insignificant wave dissipation and a significant bound amplification in a narrow frequency band the required distances to allow the bound interactions observed in this study were shorter than those reported in previous studies e g young and eldeberky 1998 or freilich et al 1990 the fraction values were calculated based on bispectral analysis foundations explained by herbers et al 1994 and then assessed against four mentioned parameters categorized in three groups of offshore wave height period and water depth it was found that the slope of the fitted line between b 2 p as a function of wave steepness increases as the wave period increases the maximum values of b 2 p in all groups occurred when h m0 d close to 0 4 the relative maximum values of b 2 p also occurred in each certain offshore wave height group when ursell numbers were close to 0 25 a similar analysis for bound sub harmonic indicated that the corresponding values of ursell numbers and h m0 d to relative maximum values of b 2 n were close to 0 2 and 0 32 respectively the grouped values of b 2 p as a function of ursell number and h m0 d were normalized with their own maximum values of the same group to study the development and decay trends of b 2 p this process showed the superior performance of the ursell number than other aforementioned non dimensional numbers to explain the patterns of bound triad interaction growth and decay against the wave nonlinearity intensity and tendency to break generally for a shoreward progressive and nonbreaking irregular wave shoaling on an inclined bed with definite offshore characteristics it is expected to experience its maximum bound positive coupling where and when its ursell number approaches 0 27 similar conditions are valid for negative coupling when the ursell numbers are equal to 0 22 two relationships for b 2 n and b 2 p as functions of ursell number were developed to predict the high values of b 2 n and b 2 p the fitted trends indicated that b 2 n reaches its relative maximum values before b 2 p also the decay rate of b 2 n against the growth of ursell number is less than the corresponding rate of b 2 p due to the lower steepness of sub harmonics finally it has been observed that all of the biphase values of self coupling of the spectral peak for waves with ursell parameter values greater than 0 35 are negative declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
