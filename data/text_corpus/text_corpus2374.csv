11870,in this study response surface methodology has been used to model and optimize the flux and the removal efficiency of uranium from aqueous solution via micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as a surfactant screening study was employed and as a result ph pressure uranium concentration and sds concentration was obtained as the effective factors on the process analysis of variance anova illustrated that quadratic model was highly significant furthermore a central composite design ccd by use of response surface methodology rsm was applied to obtain the reciprocal interactions between the variables and optimizing them as a result of optimizing the maximum rejection coefficient of uranium was found more than 0 65 in sds concentrations greater than its critical micelle concentration cmc which was achieved as 16 mm using solution conductivity measurements while sds concentration was below its critical micelle concentration maximum rejection of uranium was 0 15 this demonstrates a good growth in uranium removal yield graphical abstract image 1 keywords uranium treatment groundwater heavy metal water pollution 1 introduction heavy metals removal is a growing challenge in the industrial wastewater treatment plants since they are biodegradable highly toxic and have carcinogenic effects in nature this has led to increasing concern due to their harmful impact on human and aquatic life li et al 2011 sarkar et al 2015 so the treatment of polluted effluents for removal of heavy metal is a very important environmental challenge uranium a naturally occurring primordial and ubiquitous heavy metal is found in various chemical forms in the environment since its discovery in 1789 it has been of interest because of its propitious application in generating nuclear energy yusaf et al 2019 uranium subsists in the environment due to leaching from mine tailings natural deposits uranium combustion products emissions from the nuclear industry corrosion of uranium and use of uranium containing phosphate fertilizer wang et al 2020 liu et al 2016 the inhalation of high levels of uranium compounds results in its deposition in lungs which reach kidneys through the blood stream resulting in progressive or irrevocable renal injury and in severe cases leading to kidney failure and death exposure to uranium radionuclides formed during decay for a long period is known to develop cancer gudkov et al 2016 therefore there are literature reports manifest the remediation technologies that have been studied for the removal and recovery of uranium from industrial effluents and waste water on account of the above methods such as adsorption precipitation ion exchange and membrane separation have been reported for uranium removal chemical precipitation is widely used in industry because it is relatively simple and inexpensive to operate this method has been reported to be ineffective when uranium concentrations are low and can also produce large amounts of sludge that needs subsequent treatment krishnan et al 2021 ion exchange resins are advantageous due to high removal efficiency and fast kinetics however large scale applications are economically inefficient especially at low uranium concentrations and the regeneration of resins can cause secondary pollution fernando et al 2018 the adsorption process can produce high quality treated effluent even at low uranium concentration he et al 2018 however adsorption materials such as activated carbon are often expensive and the development of more economical materials is needed membrane filtration technologies with various modifications have seen prodigious application in uranium removal for their high efficiency easy operation space saving and also ability to hybrid with other processes which can help to increase flexibility of process and removal efficiency dasgupta et al 2015 ghasemitorkabad et al 2017 giwa et al 2017 it is notable that adsorption and membrane technologies are more efficient and reliable for low concentration wastewaters and removal approach not recovery however with relatively dense membranes used in the ro and nf processes the permeability is low and thus to obtain the desired permeate flux a high operating pressure is required on the other hand ultrafiltration has reliable permeability but does not allow the separation of the metal ions from wastewater due to the large pore size of ultrafilter yu et al 2018 arsalan et al 2019 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf a surfactant based membrane process is an alternative technique for uranium treatment in this method a surfactant is added to the aqueous stream in such concentration equal to or higher than its critical micelle concentration cmc to form micelles which are spherical aggregates containing 50 150 surfactant molecules in meuf metal ions are removed by binding the cations to oppositely charged micelle surface which is primarily electrostatic in nature the ultrafilter membrane used in the process with pore size smaller than the diameter of the micelle rejects the micelles containing metal cations removal efficiency is mostly a function of the concentration of solvent and surfactant solution ph and features of solvent and surfactant schwarze 2017 this process is a combination of selective nanofiltration and high flux ultrafiltration so in this process high rejection factor can be achieved together with high flux so these advantages has attracted the attention of researchers meuf has been widely studied in the scientific literature it is reported in most of them that meuf it is an effective technique for metal ions removal from wastewater while conventional ultrafiltration process cannot remove heavy metals efficiently bollisetti et al compared ultrafiltration process with meuf in their paper and resulted conventional ultrafiltration process is not efficient for heavy metal removal but meuf can remove them properly bolisetty et al 2019 dk janna et al jana et al 2018 studied the removal of lead from a real wastewater using sds as the surfactant in the meuf process maximum rejections of 70 under optimal operating conditions are reported in another research rf rafique et al evaluated the performance of the meuf process for cadmium removal rejection of 75 is achieved by using sds as the surfactant rafique et al 2016 meuf process is also used for organic material removal jhilly dasgupta et al applied pauf for methylene blue dye removal dye rejection of 99 and permeate flux over 71 l m2h were thus achieved dasgupta et al 2016 f li et al presented an appropriate review study on organic matter removal via micellar enhanced ultrafiltration li et al 2017 meuf also used for metals such as cadmium li et al 2011 mercury yaqub and lee 2020 zinc huang et al 2017 and arsenic chen et al 2018 and rejections higher than 70 were achieved in most of meuf investigations the effect of each parameter is separately investigated as a function of time too many tests and consumption of a significant amount of materials are disadvantages of this method furthermore this method does not take into account the interactions between each factor so the optimization of the process is inefficient in this regard statistical analysis such as response surface methodology can be used as an alternative approach considering the magnitude of the interaction between parameters and also the capability of optimal condition characterization are the main advantages of this approach rsm is a combination of mathematical and statistical method that can be applied to investigate the effect of several factors at different level and their influence on each other furthermore it helps us to obtain the surface contour that provides a good way for visualizing the parameter interaction the objective of rsm is to optimize the response based on the factors investigated in the field of ultrafiltration response surface methodology techniques have been used successfully innocenzi et al 2018 applied meuf to remove yttrium and zinc from weee industrial wastewaters statistical analysis by applying a full factorial plan was used to evaluate membrane pore size sds concentration and operative pressure also interactions between these parameters were used in their research to optimize the process verma et al verma and sarkar 2017 studied the simultaneous removal of cd2 and p cresol from wastewater using rhl as the surfactant the process was optimized using response surface methodology rsm optimal conditions were rhl 370 mg l cd2 60 mg l p cresol 75 mg l and ph 7 8 consequently in this study response surface methodology is applied to have more accurate analysis in which not only parameters but also their interaction investigated and the process was optimized in view of the above facts the present study is undertaken to apply the meuf for the treatment of synthetic wastewater consisting of uranium to the best of our knowledge this is the first study where meuf has been attempted for removal of uranium from wastewater the feasibility of applying the meuf method for treating uranium from synthetic wastewaters has been investigated the core of our research is modeling and optimizing uranium removal from aqueous solution by meuf method using response surface methodology rsm approach the experiments were conducted by using rsm in which the effect of the factors determined in the screening section on the rejection coefficient and the flux were studied the final aim was to maximize response parameters rejection and flux to ensure good membrane operation stability 2 materials and methods 2 1 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration the experiments were carried out in a dead end type setup the volume of cell of set was 0 5 l and had an effective membrane surface of 7 07 cm2 3 cm diameter disc all the experiments were carried out with an initial feed volume of 250 ml and the permeate sample was collected when 50 ml of solution crossed the membrane the setup is shown in more detail in fig 1 the overpressure required for the system was from 3 to 8 bar and supplied by nitrogen gas a flat 6 kda polyethersulfone membrane sheet obtained from sepro was used in this study before loading the membrane into the setup the membrane was thoroughly washed with deionized water and submerged in it for 24 h 2 2 preparation of feed the feed solutions were synthesized from uranyl nitrate uo2 no3 2 6h2o sodium dodecyl sulfate merck supplied and distilled water the concentration of uranium in the feed was attained by mixing the appropriate volume of a stock solution of uranium 1000 mg l and then diluted to 250 ml powder surfactant was added in the required amount to the aqueous solution solution ph was adjusted using ph meter metrohm model 691 then a magnetic stirrer at 100 rpm was used to mix feed solution for 1 h the solution kept for 24 h at room temperature to reach equilibrium 2 3 experimental design in the first step of this study parameters that significantly affect rejection factor of uranium and flux were just identified without attention to detail relation between them screening design by minitab 18 was used for this purpose tables 1 and 2 the selected independent variables to be studied were uranium concentration x1 in the range of 10 100 mg l sodium dodecyl sulfate sds concentration x2 in the range of 16 24 mm pressure x3 between 3 and 8 bar ph x4 from 3 to 6 and stirrer speed x5 from 100 to 500 rpm while the rejection of uranium ions y1 and the permeate flux y2 were chosen as responses which were achieved using following equations 1 r 1 c p c f where cp and cf are uranium concentration in permeate and feed respectively uranium concentration was measured using icp aes method optima dv 7300 model with a wavelength of 409 014 and flux was attained by following equation 2 f l u x v t a where v is permeate sample volume t is the time needed for permeate collecting and a is membrane sheet effective area in the second step relation between effective parameters which were identified in first step and response parameters uranium rejection and flux were investigated in detail using response surface methodology optimal feed conditions that achieve the maximum permeate flux and the rejection of uranium were obtained a central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm were applied for optimization a second order polynomial model was used to satisfy the mathematical relationship between independent variables and responses y b 0 i 1 4 b i x i i 1 4 b i i x 2 i 1 3 j i 1 4 b i j x i x j where y was responses b0 the constant coefficient bi linear coefficient bij the interaction coefficient bii the quadratic coefficient and xi xj were independent variables the experimental designs in 30 run illustrated in table 3 the model was validated with the analysis of variances anova anova was carried out using design expert 7 0 0 the value of the coefficients according to relation 1 determination coefficient r2 adjusted coefficient adj r2 p value and f value for the model were shown in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 critical micelle concentration cmc fig 2 illustrates electrical conductivity as a function of sds concentration in presence of uranium 100 mg l in aqueous solution at ph 7 5 and room temperature of 20 c as reported in this figure solution conductivity increased from 1 5 to 8 μs cm conductivity increases with increase in concentration as the number of ions per unit volume that carries the current in a solution increase on dilution when the conductivity of solutions with increasing surfactant concentration is measured the specific conductivity surfactant concentration plot shows two straight lines with different slopes the first one corresponds to the concentration range below the cmc in which only surfactant monomers exist in solution at higher surfactant concentrations micelles start to form and a slope change appears because the conductivity increases in a different manner the intersection of these two straight lines corresponds to the cmc value of the surfactant grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2018 rahmati et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 it is noteworthy that a wide range from 8 to 30 mm for sds critical micelle concentration is reported in the literature because cmc is mainly a function of the chemical composition of the solution karate and marathe 2008 for instance the cmc of sds was reported as 8 3 mm in the presence of copper ions in research performed by ioannis xiarchos et al in another study junkal landaburu aguirre et al obtained the cmc of sds as 20 mm for the separation of heavy metals from wastewater by the meuf process landaburu aguirre et al 2012 in our research the cmc of sds was determined as 15 1 mg l this means in surfactant concentrations below 15 1 mg l surfactant micelles do not form as a result we have conventional ultrafiltration process not meuf fig 3 shows the rejection factor of uranium when sds concentration is below cmc 15 1 mg l as we expected since sds concentration is below critical concentration no micelles form and uranium rejection is in 10 13 range which is very low on the other hand when sds concentration is below cmc we have conventional ultrafiltration process not meuf 3 2 screening analysis 3 2 1 effect of factors on the permeate flux reening design was applied to identify independent factors have significant effect on the meuf process the f value method with a confidence level of 95 was used to determine the main factors affect the process fig 4 is pareto chart of standardized effect on permeate flux according to this chart the parameters crossed the standard line 2 36 have significant effect on permeate flux as reported in this figure x1 uranium concentration x2 sds concentration and x3 pressure have a significant influence on the permeate flux of the meuf process so in permeate flux optimization study figs 9 and 11 only these parameters have been investigated in detail according to fig 5 uranium concentration and sds concentration are at the left hand side of the diagonal line that means they had a negative effect on the permeate flux while pressure is more impressive on the process the reason is that pressure is the driving force of the meuf process and has a direct effect on the flux 3 2 2 effect of factors on the rejection coefficient screening design was used also to specify factors affect the process the f value method with a confidence level of 95 was used which means factors having a significance level greater than 95 were effective the effect of factors can be observed in fig 6 uranium concentration x1 sds concentration x2 and ph x3 had a substantial effect on the rejection coefficient moreover as demonstrated in fig 7 unlike sds concentration and ph uranium concentration had a negative effect on the rejection coefficient 3 3 response surface analysis the data processing of both independent variables and the interactions between them on the permeate flux and the rejection coefficient as the response parameters were carried out by analysis of variance anova independent parameters were determined in the screening plan it was found that uranium concentration x1 and sds concentration x2 were effective in both flux and rejection pressure x3 and ph x4 were effective on the permeate flux and the rejection coefficient respectively 3 3 1 effect of pollutant and surfactant fig 6 shows the effect of both uranium and sds feed concentration on the rejection of uranium as shown in table 4 all linear terms of the model except pressure were significant p 0 0001 also the quadratic effect of sds concentration b22 was significant p 0 0011 as observed in fig 8 in constant sds concentration increasing in uranium concentration cause to decrease in its rejection since surfactant concentration is constant numbers of active binding sites of micelles for adsorbing uranium are constant so with the increase in uranium concentration some of them would not adsorb on the micelles and cross the ultrafilter as a result rejection of uranium ions decreases with the change in the uranium concentration from 10 to 100 mg l the rejection coefficient of uranium decreases from 0 633 to 0 598 according to table 4 b1 which is the coefficient of uranium concentration x1 is equal to 0 015 the negative sign of this coefficient achieved by annova confirms the inverse relation of uranium concentration and its rejection about the effect of the surfactant on the rejection of uranium the experimental results state that with an increase in the sds concentration the uranium rejection raised to a maximum value with more increase in sds concentration the rejection coefficient decreases fig 6 has revealed this fact at sds feed concentration between 16 and 22 mm uranium rejection increases from 0 576 to 0 608 after that with the increase in sds concentration from 22 to 24 the rejection coefficient decreases to 0 595 the positive interaction x1x2 b12 indicated that there was synergism between concentration of uranium and sds this might be attributed to the fact that increase in sds concentration cause to the foundation of more binding sites for adsorption uranium and result in rejection enhancement but in higher sds concentration the rejection dropped this is probably due to the shape and size variation of micelles as reported in the literature high surfactant concentration leads to change in the shape and size of micelles therefore the effective binding sites would not enhance with the increase in sds concentration verma et al reported the size of micelles as a function of surfactant concentration in their study with the variation of surfactant concentration from 50 to 650 mg l vesicle size dropped by 30 the possible reason for decrease in vesicle size at higher concentration might be due to decrease in vesicle aggregation number verma and sarkar 2017 moreover the research of karate et al was shown a change in the shape of vesicles from spherical to cylindrical with increase in the surfactant concentration karate and marathe 2008 in fig 9 permeate flux can be observed as a function of sds and uranium ions concentration with an increase in uranium concentration in the feed permeate flux decreases this was due to the accumulation of uranium near the membrane that cause concentration polarization shi et al 2019 this gel type layer causes an additional resistance for the solution passing the membrane so the permeate flux decrease however lei liu et al represented a technique in pes membrane fabrication process to improve the commercial pes uf membrane based on their experimental results the excellent anti fouling properties render the prepared membranes suitable for recycling utilization liu et al 2013 fig 9 also illustrated the effect of sds concentration on the permeate flux as understood from statistical analysis table 4 the effect of sds concentration in both linear and quadratic terms is significant p 0 0001 at constant uranium concentration with an increase in sds concentration from 16 to 24 mm the permeate flux decreased from 0 79 to 0 729 m3 m2 hr this decrease in the permeate flux might be due to concentration polarization 3 3 2 effect of pressure and solution ph as observed in table 4 transmembrane pressure significantly influenced the permeate flux p 0 0001 the coefficient of this variable is positive that means an increase in pressure leads to permeate flux enhancement fig 10 showed the surface plot of the uranium rejection as a function of operating pressure the sds concentration was set as 20 mm also the uranium ions concentration was 55 mg l as shown transmembrane pressure did not have any considerable influence on uranium rejection which is about 0 615 the reason can be that electrostatic attraction between sds micelles and uranium cannot be overcome by the force arising from operating pressure also in fig 10 showed that ph had a positive influence on the uranium rejection coefficient due to competition of h with uranium for adsorbing on negatively charged micelles at higher ph less h is available in the solution so more active binding sites for uranium exist to adsorb at low ph there are more h in the solution and consequently the binding sites of vesicles are occupied by hydrogen ions in fig 11 positive effect of pressure on the permeate flux can be observed increase in the pressure consequent increase of driving force and therefore higher flux for all range of pressure from 3 to 8 bar the permeate flux varies linearly that indicates the process was under the pressure control region at pressures higher than 6 5 bar concentration polarization enhanced as a result of vesicle accumulation on the membrane surface the result is forming an additional layer on the membrane surface and an extra resistance to flow therefore as can be observe in fig 11 permeate flux increased slower in pressures higher than 6 5 bar in other words in high pressure the process is controlled by resistance arising from polarization ph has very little effect on the permeate flux 3 4 optimization of the permeate flux and rejection coefficient in any process investigation the main purpose is to obtain the optimum point to operate in this study state ease design expert 7 0 0 was used to determine the maximum uranium rejection and the permeate flux as a result uranium concentration 10 ppm sds concentration 20 12 mm ph 6 and pressure 8 bar were specified as optimum conditions by the software moreover maximum response variables were predicted as permeate flux 0 948 m3 m2 hr and uranium rejection 0 655 after that the results were verified by confirmative test the experiment was implemented at optimal conditions permeate flux and the rejection were obtained as 0 951 m3 m2 hr and 0 651 respectively therefore there was good agreement between the experiment results with values predicted by the rsm model 4 conclusions meuf was performed to remove uranium from aqueous solution to the best of our knowledge there is no meuf investigation for uranium 6 kda ultrafilter was used adding sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant above its cmc this study shows micellar enhanced ultrafiltration cause an appropriate growth in uranium rejection in compare with the ordinary ultrafiltration process effective parameters on permeate flux and uranium rejection using screening module of minitab and optimization was carried out using rsm uranium concentration sds concentration ph and pressure were the effective parameters on the response parameters pressure and uranium concentration were controlling parameter on permeate flux and uranium rejection respectively also the maximum uranium rejection and permeate flux of 0 655 and 0 948 m3 m2 hr respectively were achieved in optimal conditions cu 10 ppm csds 20 12 mm ph 6 and pressure 8 bar finally conventional ultrafiltration process is not a reliable process for metal removal in the best state rejection of 0 15 for uranium has been achieved however according to figs 8 and 10 in meuf process rejection of uranium is more than 0 65 that shows an acceptable growth in the rejection factor of uranium from an industrial point of view retentate stream which is rich in metals transferred from initial solutions in this case uranium should be further processed in order to recover the metals

corresponds to the cmc value of the surfactant grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2018 rahmati et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 it is noteworthy that a wide range from 8 to 30 mm for sds critical micelle concentration is reported in the literature because cmc is mainly a function of the chemical composition of the solution karate and marathe 2008 for instance the cmc of sds was reported as 8 3 mm in the presence of copper ions in research performed by ioannis xiarchos et al in another study junkal landaburu aguirre et al obtained the cmc of sds as 20 mm for the separation of heavy metals from wastewater by the meuf process landaburu aguirre et al 2012 in our research the cmc of sds was determined as 15 1 mg l this means in surfactant concentrations below 15 1 mg l surfactant micelles do not form as a result we have conventional ultrafiltration process not meuf fig 3 shows the rejection factor of uranium when sds concentration is below cmc 15 1 mg l as we expected since sds concentration is below critical concentration no micelles form and uranium rejection is in 10 13 range which is very low on the other hand when sds concentration is below cmc we have conventional ultrafiltration process not meuf 3 2 screening analysis 3 2 1 effect of factors on the permeate flux reening design was applied to identify independent factors have significant effect on the meuf process the f value method with a confidence level of 95 was used to determine the main factors affect the process fig 4 is pareto chart of standardized effect on permeate flux according to this chart the parameters crossed the standard line 2 36 have significant effect on permeate flux as reported in this figure x1 uranium concentration x2 sds concentration and x3 pressure have a significant influence on the permeate flux of the meuf process so in permeate flux optimization study figs 9 and 11 only these parameters have been investigated in detail according to fig 5 uranium concentration and sds concentration are at the left hand side of the diagonal line that means they had a negative effect on the permeate flux while pressure is more impressive on the process the reason is that pressure is the driving force of the meuf process and has a direct effect on the flux 3 2 2 effect of factors on the rejection coefficient screening design was used also to specify factors affect the process the f value method with a confidence level of 95 was used which means factors having a significance level greater than 95 were effective the effect of factors can be observed in fig 6 uranium concentration x1 sds concentration x2 and ph x3 had a substantial effect on the rejection coefficient moreover as demonstrated in fig 7 unlike sds concentration and ph uranium concentration had a negative effect on the rejection coefficient 3 3 response surface analysis the data processing of both independent variables and the interactions between them on the permeate flux and the rejection coefficient as the response parameters were carried out by analysis of variance anova independent parameters were determined in the screening plan it was found that uranium concentration x1 and sds concentration x2 were effective in both flux and rejection pressure x3 and ph x4 were effective on the permeate flux and the rejection coefficient respectively 3 3 1 effect of pollutant and surfactant fig 6 shows the effect of both uranium and sds feed concentration on the rejection of uranium as shown in table 4 all linear terms of the model except pressure were significant p 0 0001 also the quadratic effect of sds concentration b22 was significant p 0 0011 as observed in fig 8 in constant sds concentration increasing in uranium concentration cause to decrease in its rejection since surfactant concentration is constant numbers of active binding sites of micelles for adsorbing uranium are constant so with the increase in uranium concentration some of them would not adsorb on the micelles and cross the ultrafilter as a result rejection of uranium ions decreases with the change in the uranium concentration from 10 to 100 mg l the rejection coefficient of uranium decreases from 0 633 to 0 598 according to table 4 b1 which is the coefficient of uranium concentration x1 is equal to 0 015 the negative sign of this coefficient achieved by annova confirms the inverse relation of uranium concentration and its rejection about the effect of the surfactant on the rejection of uranium the experimental results state that with an increase in the sds concentration the uranium rejection raised to a maximum value with more increase in sds concentration the rejection coefficient decreases fig 6 has revealed this fact at sds feed concentration between 16 and 22 mm uranium rejection increases from 0 576 to 0 608 after that with the increase in sds concentration from 22 to 24 the rejection coefficient decreases to 0 595 the positive interaction x1x2 b12 indicated that there was synergism between concentration of uranium and sds this might be attributed to the fact that increase in sds concentration cause to the foundation of more binding sites for adsorption uranium and result in rejection enhancement but in higher sds concentration the rejection dropped this is probably due to the shape and size variation of micelles as reported in the literature high surfactant concentration leads to change in the shape and size of micelles therefore the effective binding sites would not enhance with the increase in sds concentration verma et al reported the size of micelles as a function of surfactant concentration in their study with the variation of surfactant concentration from 50 to 650 mg l vesicle size dropped by 30 the possible reason for decrease in vesicle size at higher concentration might be due to decrease in vesicle aggregation number verma and sarkar 2017 moreover the research of karate et al was shown a change in the shape of vesicles from spherical to cylindrical with increase in the surfactant concentration karate and marathe 2008 in fig 9 permeate flux can be observed as a function of sds and uranium ions concentration with an increase in uranium concentration in the feed permeate flux decreases this was due to the accumulation of uranium near the membrane that cause concentration polarization shi et al 2019 this gel type layer causes an additional resistance for the solution passing the membrane so the permeate flux decrease however lei liu et al represented a technique in pes membrane fabrication process to improve the commercial pes uf membrane based on their experimental results the excellent anti fouling properties render the prepared membranes suitable for recycling utilization liu et al 2013 fig 9 also illustrated the effect of sds concentration on the permeate flux as understood from statistical analysis table 4 the effect of sds concentration in both linear and quadratic terms is significant p 0 0001 at constant uranium concentration with an increase in sds concentration from 16 to 24 mm the permeate flux decreased from 0 79 to 0 729 m3 m2 hr this decrease in the permeate flux might be due to concentration polarization 3 3 2 effect of pressure and solution ph as observed in table 4 transmembrane pressure significantly influenced the permeate flux p 0 0001 the coefficient of this variable is positive that means an increase in pressure leads to permeate flux enhancement fig 10 showed the surface plot of the uranium rejection as a function of operating pressure the sds concentration was set as 20 mm also the uranium ions concentration was 55 mg l as shown transmembrane pressure did not have any considerable influence on uranium rejection which is about 0 615 the reason can be that electrostatic attraction between sds micelles and uranium cannot be overcome by the force arising from operating pressure also in fig 10 showed that ph had a positive influence on the uranium rejection coefficient due to competition of h with uranium for adsorbing on negatively charged micelles at higher ph less h is available in the solution so more active binding sites for uranium exist to adsorb at low ph there are more h in the solution and consequently the binding sites of vesicles are occupied by hydrogen ions in fig 11 positive effect of pressure on the permeate flux can be observed increase in the pressure consequent increase of driving force and therefore higher flux for all range of pressure from 3 to 8 bar the permeate flux varies linearly that indicates the process was under the pressure control region at pressures higher than 6 5 bar concentration polarization enhanced as a result of vesicle accumulation on the membrane surface the result is forming an additional layer on the membrane surface and an extra resistance to flow therefore as can be observe in fig 11 permeate flux increased slower in pressures higher than 6 5 bar in other words in high pressure the process is controlled by resistance arising from polarization ph has very little effect on the permeate flux 3 4 optimization of the permeate flux and rejection coefficient in any process investigation the main purpose is to obtain the optimum point to operate in this study state ease design expert 7 0 0 was used to determine the maximum uranium rejection and the permeate flux as a result uranium concentration 10 ppm sds concentration 20 12 mm ph 6 and pressure 8 bar were specified as optimum conditions by the software moreover maximum response variables were predicted as permeate flux 0 948 m3 m2 hr and uranium rejection 0 655 after that the results were verified by confirmative test the experiment was implemented at optimal conditions permeate flux and the rejection were obtained as 0 951 m3 m2 hr and 0 651 respectively therefore there was good agreement between the experiment results with values predicted by the rsm model 4 conclusions meuf was performed to remove uranium from aqueous solution to the best of our knowledge there is no meuf investigation for uranium 6 kda ultrafilter was used adding sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant above its cmc this study shows micellar enhanced ultrafiltration cause an appropriate growth in uranium rejection in compare with the ordinary ultrafiltration process effective parameters on permeate flux and uranium rejection using screening module of minitab and optimization was carried out using rsm uranium concentration sds concentration ph and pressure were the effective parameters on the response parameters pressure and uranium concentration were controlling parameter on permeate flux and uranium rejection respectively also the maximum uranium rejection and permeate flux of 0 655 and 0 948 m3 m2 hr respectively were achieved in optimal conditions cu 10 ppm csds 20 12 mm ph 6 and pressure 8 bar finally conventional ultrafiltration process is not a reliable process for metal removal in the best state rejection of 0 15 for uranium has been achieved however according to figs 8 and 10 in meuf process rejection of uranium is more than 0 65 that shows an acceptable growth in the rejection factor of uranium from an industrial point of view retentate stream which is rich in metals transferred from initial solutions in this case uranium should be further processed in order to recover the metals

11871,declining groundwater level gwl has posed an immense threat to the groundwater based irrigated agriculture in the north west nw region of bangladesh this study determined time lag after which gwl responds to rainfall quantified threshold minimum rainfall to initiate rising of gwl identified locations and durations of recharge deficit and rejection and quantified these from locally recorded rainfall and gwl data to understand local aquifers dynamics and water storage these objectives were realized by interpreting weekly total rainfall and weekly gwl data of 137 monitoring wells by dividing the data sets into 1985 1994 10 years 1995 2004 10 years and 2005 2016 12 years time spans and the region into three sub regions high barind level barind and other area the average lag period varied from 2 1 to 2 9 weeks and threshold rainfall from 34 to 75 mm recharge deficit occurred in some years and rejection in the other years at all monitoring well sites both quantities greatly varied spatio temporarily revealing non uniform development potential of the aquifers recharge rejection significantly decreased from 1995 to 2004 to 2005 2016 period in all sub regions in spite of clear evidence of continuously declining gwl recharge rejection was obtained in both the high and level barind in each time span this indicates presence of dominant recharge process es other than from rainfalls and necessity of curtailing groundwater extraction or enhancing of recharge for further development of the aquifers in contrast recharge rejection period of 4 7 5 6 weeks per year and 7 8 8 2 years in each time span in other area with no evidence of permanent decline in gwl reveals scope for further development of the aquifers the reported parameters of the recharge depletion characteristics when estimated would guide updating groundwater extraction and management policy for the concerned aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater rainfall recharge deficit recharge rejection 1 introduction groundwater resources are the major source of irrigation industrial and domestic water supplies worldwide konikow and kendy 2005 hoque et al 2007 famiglietti et al 2011 the dependence on groundwater has increased fourfold in the last 50 years in south asia the middle east and north china kumar et al 2018 in bangladesh transformation of high risk monsoon dependent agriculture into irrigation based dry season agriculture over the past 3 to 4 decades has tremendously increased groundwater use in addition to its accelerated use in urban and industrial sectors groundwater irrigation covering 79 of irrigated area bbs 2017 now has become vital for the agro based economy and food security of the country haque et al 2013 currently declining groundwater level gwl decreased availability of surface water in the dry season due to silting and drying up of most rivers deforestation and recurrent drought have become common in many parts of the country mojid 2020 moreover the population of the country has been projected to be 185 million in 2030 and 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 the additional population will need 12 4 and 21 0 million tons of rice respectively mainuddin and kirby 2015 production of this additional rice will further increase extraction of groundwater that is already under stress in many locations specifically in the north west nw region which utilizes much higher groundwater than the other regions of the country mainuddin et al 2014 2019 irrigated agriculture utilizes approximately 96 5 of the extracted groundwater while households and industry utilize the remaining quantity in this region shahid et al 2015 bangladesh has a tropical climate with a distinct wet monsoon june september and a dry winter november february there are 3 cropping seasons in the country that are known as kharif i march june kharif ii july october and rabi november february rabi is the main crop season which is almost rainless and dry based on hydro climatic characteristics kharif i is partially irrigated kharif ii is mostly rainfed with occasional supplemental irrigation and rabi is a fully irrigated season most of the groundwater is abstracted during dry season irrigation period january to april the rapid expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture associated with decreased dry season rainfall increased overall temperature and inadequate replenishment of groundwater has caused lowering of the gwl at a worrying rate in some parts of the country islam et al 2012 zahid et al 2017 pena arancibia et al 2020 several studies e g rodell et al 2009 shamsudduha et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 ali et al 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 dey et al 2017 haque et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 reported clear declining trend in gwls in some areas in the nw region indicating continuous reduction in water storage in those aquifers continuous depletion of gwl with expanding groundwater irrigation is specifically worrying in the barind tract of the nw region aziz et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2016 rushton et al 2020 groundwater resource in this region being under accelerated stress rahman et al 2018 has already become unsustainable shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 kirby et al 2016 mojid et al 2019 in bangladesh groundwater is a dynamic renewable resource whose optimum level is often expressed as the quantity of water determined by the difference between optimum and minimum gwls within the aquifers gwl represents water table in unconfined aquifers and pressure head in confined aquifers groundwater recharge and discharge being the major components of a hydrological cycle predominantly control the gwl and groundwater storage in the aquifers in the nw region major recharge of groundwater occurs from rainfall and flood water pena arancibia et al 2020 and to some extent from irrigation fields rushton et al 2020 while groundwater discharge occurs through pumping of groundwater by wells or natural discharge from aquifers to nearby rivers when gwls remain higher than river water surface mukherjee et al 2018 pena arancibia et al 2020 however the processes by which groundwater is replenished remain poorly understood specifically in the barind tract fluctuations of gwls being directly related to groundwater recharge dickinson et al 2004 zhang and schilling 2004 cuthbert 2010 occur due to seasonality in groundwater recharge discharge phenomena the mega deltas of asia contains mostly shallow aquifers in which gwls are largely influenced by seasonality comprising distinctive dry and wet periods shamsudduha et al 2009 so there is a direct relationship between gwl fluctuation and the amount of rainfall occurring in a season mojid et al 1994 mojid and rashid 1994 pena arancibia et al 2020 groundwater recharge greatly depends on soil moisture condition of the vadoze zone the unsaturated zone overlying the aquifers van hoang and roi 2016 since gwl has to respond to rainfall after meeting all requirements of soil moisture in this zone so there is a time difference between occurrence of rainfall and response of gwl to recharge from rainfall note that any changes in land use and land cover both long term and short term can modify the pattern of water balance components in an area and affect various hydrological processes ansari et al 2016 the long term changes are primarily caused by developmental activities like agricultural expansion urbanization and decline in forest while the short term changes are mostly associated with changes in vegetation or water body as a response to the annual cycles of climate vogelmann et al 2016 eventually both types of changes can greatly affect groundwater recharge wang et al 2018 there are compelling evidence that groundwater in bangladesh is mostly derived from rainfall and floodwater majumder et al 2011 specifically for the nw region the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall rahman and mahbub 2012 adhikary et al 2013 aziz et al 2015 it is therefore important to generate knowledge on how groundwater systems specifically shallow groundwater systems respond to rainfall variability duvert et al 2015 such knowledge on hydrological interactions of surface water and groundwater is essential to improve our understanding of the water cycle toran 2019 since it provides insight into responses of groundwater resources to surface based recharge sources it is crucial to estimate and project groundwater recharge and aquifers storage capacity to manage groundwater resources effectively islam et al 2014 although a good number of research works has been done on hydrogeology occurrence and potential of groundwater and some works on groundwater dynamics cited earlier only few studies e g mpo 1987 shamsudduha et al 2011 mojid et al 2019 have reported limited information on locations with potential for further recharge or areas with deficit groundwater resources no comprehensive information on recharge lag period threshold rainfall period of recharge rejection and quantity of recharge deficit and rejection are available for the nw region of bangladesh the knowledge on lag period is important since recharge response to rainfall has an influence on available groundwater in an aquifer nemaxwi et al 2019 groundwater may take from hours to decades to reveal the influence of rainfall events depending on site specific hydrogeological characteristics such stretched response of groundwater systems to rainfall when rainfall is the main source of recharge is the prime mechanism that sustains water supply even during dry periods lee et al 2020 specifically detailed area specific data based information on the period and quantity of recharge rejection and deficit is crucial for planning groundwater development in the area inadequate knowledge on the processes by which groundwater is replenished in nw region limits our understanding of the vulnerability of shallow groundwater resources to depletion bui et al 2012 shamsudduha et al 2012 the areas with occurrence of recharge rejection have further scope to extract more groundwater than the current extraction level the quantity of potential additional extraction in an area can be determined from the recharge rate of groundwater and the period of recharge rejection in the area on the other hand the areas with recharge deficit are already under stress and gwls are declining over the years in order to establish sustainable extraction level of groundwater in these areas the current extraction level may need to be reduced the quantity of which can be estimated from the quantity of deficit reduction in extraction may not be needed if recharge to the aquifer can be enhanced to establish dynamic equilibrium of gwls the area specific information on groundwater recharge from rainfall is also necessary in devising mechanisms to enhance natural recharge to the aquifers to increase useable storage of groundwater taking into account these factors of sustainable groundwater use this study determined the recharge related hydrological parameters of the aquifers at 137 gwl monitoring wells distributed roughly uniformly in the nw region of bangladesh 2 methodology 2 1 study area 2 1 1 hydro climatic characteristics the nw region of bangladesh comprises sixteen administrative districts namely bogura chapai nawabganj joypurhat naogaon natore pabna rajshahi sirajganj thakurgaon rangpur panchagar nilfamari lalmonirhat kurigram gaibandha and dinajpur fig 1 it is one of the eight natural features based hydrological regions in the country that is situated on the west of the jamuna river known as the brahmaputra in india and north of the padma river known as the ganges in india and includes a pre holocene hydrogeological zone called barind tract the region is characterized with a typical dry climate with relatively high temperature and receives an average 1927 mm rainfall annually mojid et al 2019 this rainfall amount is the lowest amongst the eight hydrological regions the barind tract is a distinctive physiographic unit comprising series of uplifted blocks of terraced land covering 8720 square kilometers in the nw region between the floodplains of the padma and jamuna rivers spread over parts of bogura dinajpur joypurhat naogaon rajshahi and rangpur districts the barind tract includes 773 000 ha of which 532 000 ha are cultivable it is one of the direst and hottest parts of the country rainfall is relatively low in this region with the long term average being 1250 mm in the west and 2000 mm in the northeast riches 2008 most of the rainfall 80 occurs during june to september fao 2015 temperature ranges from 25 c to 35 c very often exceeding 40 c and often reaching up to 50 c in the summer rushton et al 2020 2 1 2 hydro geologic characteristics the barind tract is characterized by pre holocene sediments and the remainder in the region by holocene unconsolidated sediments reimann 1993 both quaternary deposits consist of sands silts and clays that form aquifers throughout the region nowreen et al 2020 the pre holocene aquifers typically occur below a clay unit that varies in thickness from 8 m to 45 m ravenscroft et al 2005 as illustrated in fig 2 the holocene aquifers are commonly unconfined or semi confined but the pre holocene aquifers are confined to semi confined dphe 2001 ravenscroft and rahman 2003 groundwater generally occurs at shallow depth 10 m below ground surface in the holocene aquifers but at deeper depths 10 m below ground surface in the pre holocene aquifers shamsudduha et al 2011 mojid et al 2019 the permeability of holocene surficial cover is higher than that of pre holocene surficial cover nowreen et al 2020 the lithologies within both quaternary sediments are however highly variable both in horizontal and vertical directions producing localized and highly heterogeneous aquifers dphe 2001 hasan et al 2016 zahid et al 2016 a top clay layer 1 5 51 8 m thick hasan et al 2016 fig 2 composite sand layer 3 0 68 5 m thick of different grain sizes and at the bottom in most locations an impermeable clay layer is the common geologic formation in the south western part rajshahi nawabganj and naogaon districts fig 1 of the nw region the composite sand formation is the only useable groundwater source in this part an aquifer of coarse and medium sand and gravel underlying a thin sandy clay layer 3 6 m fig 2 is the general characteristics of the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon dinajpur and joypurhat except the area covered by the barind tract dphe 2010 one thick medium and coarse sand aquifer at 3 150 m depth in panchagarh five medium and coarse sand aquifer units at 3 153 m depth inter bedded with aquitards in thakurgaon three aquifer units at 3 184 m depth inter bedded with aquitards in dinajpur and two aquifer units at 3 54 m depth in joypurhat districts are available zahid et al 2016 the upper most layer in pabna district comprises 1 m 20 m clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 which acts as aquitard the aquifer system is hydraulically connected regionally although one or more aquitards are encountered at the local level zahid et al 2016 the barind tract is at higher elevation than the adjoining floodplain and there are two terrace levels one at 40 m above mean sea level known as high barind and the other between 19 8 m and 22 9 m known as level barind fig 1 approximately 47 of the barind tract is classified as highland 41 as medium highland and the rest as lowland zahid et al 2016 for this study the whole nw region was therefore divided into three sub regions high barind level barind and other area 2 2 data collection and training both gwl and rainfall data were used for assessing the rainfall groundwater recharge dynamics in bangladesh there is an extensive network of gwl monitoring wells 1200 which are fairly distributed across the country out of these 437 monitoring wells are in the nw region bangladesh water development board bwdb records gwls in the monitoring wells on weekly basis a few other organizations e g bangladesh agricultural development corporation barind multi purpose development authority also monitor gwls in some specific parts of the country bangladesh meteorological department collects and maintains climate data for 34 weather stations spread across the country of which six weather stations are in the nw region at bogura rajshahi ishurdi rangpur dinajpur and sayedpur districts fig 1 the weekly gwl and daily rainfall data of 1985 2016 period were collected and trained before objective oriented analysis to synchronize with gwl weekly rainfalls were calculated from the daily rainfall data and cumulative weekly rainfall was calculated therefrom the gwls were arranged and sorted according to the location and id numbers of the monitoring wells by plotting gwls against time in scatter plots in ms excel sheets the drifts seasonality gaps and outliers in the data sets were identified after inspecting data of all monitoring wells 350 wells were found having consistent gwl data with typical distribution over time considering huge time requirement for manual analysis and interpretation of data 5 wells from the high barind 19 from level barind and 113 from the remaining area of the nw region were selected the wells are distributed fairly uniformly over the entire nw region fig 1 the gwls reached the maximum depths from ground surface at the end of dry season and the minimum depth occurred some times in the wet season both depths were identified on gwl hydrographs and noted separately for each monitoring wells a typical gwl hydrograph is displayed in fig 3 a 2 3 determination of recharge lag period recharge lag periods were calculated from gwl hydrographs of the selected 137 monitoring wells for each year from 1985 to 2016 gwl hydrographs were prepared by plotting gwls of each monitoring well against time week of the data period rainfall hydrographs were prepared by plotting cumulative weekly total rainfall against weeks fig 3 b for each monitoring well rainfall hydrographs of the nearest meteorological station fig 1 were assigned for that well for both hydrographs january was taken as the starting month since dry season irrigation starts at this month and it is also starting of large scale extraction of groundwater for irrigation the irrigation period continues up to april and gwl continues dropping due to extraction by irrigation wells without reflecting any effect of recharge from irrigation fields although some recharge might occur rushton et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020 majumder et al 2011 evaluated the groundwater flow systems in bengal delta aquifers bangladesh using environmental isotope techniques and reported that all groundwater are derived from rainfall and floodwater with a minor localized evaporation effects for the shallow groundwater their result is also similar to that of mustafa et al 2018 who obtained insignificant effect of irrigation return flow in the improvement of gwls during dry season since there is no measured data on the contribution of irrigation fields to groundwater recharge we considered only the effect of rainfall in determining the response time of gwl to rainfall the week of seasonal first rainfall was identified on the rainfall hydrograph at each monitoring well for each year some rainfall events with small quantity did not contribute recharging the aquifer since the unsaturated soil layer overlying the aquifer needed to be saturated before infiltrating water to the aquifer when percolated water from rainfall reached the aquifer gwl started rising fig 3 b for example elucidates that gwl responded one week after rainfall had occurred the week at which gwl responded to rainfall was recorded in each year during 1985 2016 period for the 137 monitoring wells the difference between the week at which rainfall started and the week at which gwl responded lag period of recharge from rainfall was determined in bangladesh large scale development of groundwater started in early 1980s and continued expanding rapidly almost to reach its full potential at around 2010 after which extraction of groundwater mostly remains unchanged or it declines because of continuous decline in gwl in many parts of the country including the nw region taking this into account we divided the gwl data set into three time segments 1985 1994 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 periods to effectively capture the temporal variation of the recharge rainfall mechanism therefore the average lag period of recharge for each monitoring well was calculated for these three different time periods by taking average of lag periods of each year for each time period 2 4 determination of the periods and quantities of recharge deficit and rejection the amount of water which percolates through the vadoze zone and joins the aquifer causing eventual rise in gwl is the actual net recharge on the other hand the quantity of water which could reach the aquifer hypothetically is the potential recharge when an aquifer has been fully recharged and gwl has reached its possible highest level aquifer full condition cannot accept any more water so water available on the ground surface but unable to move to groundwater because of aquifer full condition is the rejected recharge in principle potential recharge is the sum of actual recharge and rejected recharge orehova et al 2012 at aquifer full condition the potential recharge mostly contributes to surface runoff instead of recharging the aquifer thus the status of groundwater recharge at any monitoring well site can be explained in terms of one of three states of recharge recharge deficit recharge rejection or recharge balance these states were determined by interpreting and analyzing local rainfall hydrographs and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells the three states of groundwater recharge were differentiated by comparing the time of whether gwl reached the minimum depth from ground surface before after or at the time of cessation of monsoon rainfall deficit in recharge occurred when the amount of water withdrawn from the aquifer in dry season was not fully replenished during subsequent monsoon in this case gwl continued rising during whole monsoon period but did not reach the previous year s highest peak as illustrated in fig 4 a the amount of recharge deficit was determined from the difference between the highest peaks of gwl minimum depth from ground surface of two successive years recharge balance condition was observed when cessation of rainfall and the highest peak of gwl occurred almost at the same time and gwl reached the previous year s highest peak if gwl reached the highest peak well before cessation of rainfall there was rejection of recharge for example fig 4 b shows the highest peak of gwl in 38th week and the occurrence of seasonal last appreciable rainfall event in 42nd week revealing that the rainfall occurring after 38th week could not contribute to recharging the aquifer and hence was rejected mainly as runoff the difference of times at which gwl reached the highest peak and rainfall ceased was the recharge rejection period this time period was calculated from the difference between the times of occurrence of the two events fig 4 b the amount of rejected recharge was calculated from the difference between cumulative rainfall on the week when rainfall ceased and cumulative rainfall on the week when gwl reached the highest peak fig 5 a demonstrates that the end of rainfall and arrival of gwl to its highest peak occurred at the same week 39th week also the gwl was at the previous year s highest peak there was neither deficit of recharge nor additional scope for recharge implying that the aquifer was at recharge balance condition similar to lag period recharge deficit and rejection periods and their quantities were determined for the three time periods the locations of recharge deficit rejection and balance were identified from the identification number and associated locations of the monitoring wells 3 results 3 1 recharge lag period and threshold rainfall gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells reflected response of the aquifers to recharge from rainfalls the responses were more vigorous in other area than in high and level barind fig 5 b as an example demonstrates that total 50 mm rainfall occurring during 8th to 16th weeks 8 weeks before onset of monsoon march april at a monitoring well site in natore district within other area fig 1 had no influence on gwl the rise in gwl was first evident in 21st week after 26 mm rainfall had occurred in 17th week the previous 50 mm rainfall distributed over 8 weeks was used partly for surface evaporation and partly for wetting the vadoze zone the previous weeks total rainfall 50 mm and 17th week s rainfall 26 mm was the required threshold amount to start recharging the underlying aquifer in 21st week after satisfying surface evaporation and soil moisture requirement of the vadoze zone since a large proportion of the crop acreage was under irrigated rice the vadose zone within the irrigated area might remain saturated or partially saturated consequently some recharge might have occurred both from the irrigated rice fields through deep percolation and appreciable rainfall events when there was any rushton et al 2020 the irrigation return flow can play a major role in recharging the aquifer in the irrigated area compared to local rainfall in the dry season during the dry season mean seasonal groundwater recharge has been reported to be almost double over the last 2 decades as a result of increased abstraction for irrigation mustafa et al 2018 however the quantity of recharge from these sources irrigation return flow and rainfall being much smaller than the large scale extraction of water from the aquifer during the same time period was not reflected visibly and hence not detectable in the gwl hydrographs nevertheless without the recharge from rice fields the groundwater levels would drop below what were actually observed mainuddin et al 2020 the average of the monitoring wells range of lag period of recharge from rainfall varied widely among the three sub regions high barind level barind and other area fig 1 the highest range being in high barind and the lowest in other area table 1 the minimum range was relatively narrow between 1 week and 3 weeks and remained consistent among the sub regions and three time periods 1985 1994 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 while the maximum range was wide between 1 week and 13 weeks the widest range being in other area the average minimum lag period was largest 1 5 1 8 weeks in high barind and smallest 1 0 1 2 weeks in other area while the average maximum lag period was the largest 4 8 6 5 weeks in other area and smallest 2 7 3 9 weeks in level barind the overall average lag period varied from 2 1 to 2 9 weeks among the three time periods with the largest value in high barind and smallest value in other area comparison of spatial distributions of the average lag periods for the three time periods fig 6 reveals that the lag periods increased over time at several monitoring well sites this observation is a clear indication of increasing depth of dry season gwls over time in those sites the threshold rainfall to initiate rising of gwl varied widely among the three sub regions and the three time periods the minimum threshold rainfall was the largest 24 36 mm in high barind and smallest 11 13 mm in other area with consistently increasing values over the three time periods in high barind due to continuously declining gwl the maximum threshold rainfall varied inconsistently both among the sub regions and the time periods table 2 the average threshold rainfall was 39 75 mm in high barind 34 43 mm in level barind and 35 41 mm in other area with no consistent variation among the three time periods except in high barind where it increased over time the variation in threshold rainfalls among the years at the same monitoring well sites occurred due to variation in depth of gwl and initial pre recharge moisture condition of the vadoze zone on the other hand the variation in threshold rainfall among the monitoring well sites with the same depth of gwl and moisture condition of the vadoze zone was due to difference in hydraulic conductivity of formation materials of the vadoze zone both the lag period and threshold rainfall were greater in the barind tract both high and level than in other area due to thick clay layer overlying the aquifer in the barind tract fig 2 3 2 recharge rejection period recharge deficit and recharge rejection occurred at the monitoring well sites depending on the amount of water extracted from or moved out of the aquifer amount of water added to the aquifer through deep percolation from surface sources and interflow from the adjacent aquifer s and the amount of rainfall occurred at the sites in a hydrological cycle at each monitoring well site there was recharge deficit for some period in some years and recharge rejection for some period in the other years thus providing a year averaged recharge deficit period as well as recharge rejection period for the well site although the range of year averaged minimum recharge rejection period was within 0 nil to 3 weeks in the three sub regions that of maximum recharge rejection period varied widely 2 21 weeks with consistently widening range over the three time periods in high barind table 3 the average minimum recharge rejection period over the three time periods was 0 nil to 2 weeks both in high and level barind and 1 5 2 2 weeks in other area the average maximum recharge rejection period for the corresponding sub region was 4 2 8 0 weeks 8 6 12 5 weeks and 10 3 12 7 weeks the overall average recharge rejection period over the three time periods was 2 2 3 6 weeks 3 6 4 5 weeks and 4 7 5 6 weeks in high barind level barind and other area respectively with consistently decreasing recharge rejection period in level barind it is noted that despite continuous decline in gwl in most parts in the barind region mojid et al 2019 the rainfall gwl relation revealed occurrence of some recharge rejection period this might be due to that because of deeper gwl and larger recharge lag periods table 1 the infiltrating water was lost through lateral flow and surface evaporation before reaching the aquifer the year averaged minimum recharge rejection year for the individual monitoring wells within the three time periods was 0 nil to 1 year both in high and level barind and 1 3 years in other area table 3 the year averaged maximum recharge rejection year in the corresponding sub regions was 4 7 years 9 10 years and 10 11 years within the three time periods the average of the year averaged recharge rejection year within the three time periods was 2 0 4 8 years 4 6 7 2 years and 7 8 8 2 years in high barind level barind and other area respectively the variations of annual recharge rejection week at the monitoring well sites are illustrated in fig 7 for the three sub regions while fig 8 demonstrates spatial distribution of year averaged recharge rejection weeks for the three time periods in general recharge rejection period was higher in other area than in level barind which had higher recharge rejection period than high barind the larger proportion of monitoring well sites in other area provided larger recharge rejection period compared to other two sub regions in the three time periods figs 7 and 8 reveal that the number of weeks of recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites with larger recharge rejection period in other area increased from 1985 to 1994 to 1995 2004 period after which it decreased during 2005 2016 period there was wide variation in recharge rejection period over the years in the three time periods and three sub regions wide variation was also in the number of years of recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites table 3 fig 9 3 3 quantity of recharge deficit because of recharge deficit in some years and recharge rejection in the other years at the monitoring well sites there was a year averaged recharge deficit as well as year averaged recharge rejection for each well site note that recharge deficit in a year was determined in terms of decline in peak gwl of the year compared to the previous year s peak gwl fig 4 a not with respect to whether the aquifer was fully replenished to its full storage capacity the estimated recharge deficit thus indicated shortage of recharge in the aquifer storage that was depleted in the year under consideration the annual quantities of recharge deficit in terms of depth of aquifer for unconfined aquifer or pressure head for confined aquifer at the monitoring well sites are provided in table 4 for the three time periods for the three sub regions the quantity of minimum maximum and year averaged recharge deficits varied over wide ranges but inconsistently both over the time periods and in the sub regions the average annual recharge deficit remained practically unchanged 87 90 cm in high barind during 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 but increased enormously 415 cm during 2005 2016 due to wide variations in recharge deficit 21 1730 108 1990 and 165 1105 cm in 3 monitoring wells at nachol upazila in the high barind the wide variation in recharge deficit is also reflected in the maximum and average range of recharge deficits 21 1730 and 65 1272 cm respectively for this sub region table 4 the recharge deficit varied over a narrow range 107 122 cm over the three time periods in level barind but decreased significantly from 180 to 99 cm from 1985 to 1994 to the latter periods in other area fig 10 illustrates variation of the quantity of year averaged recharge deficit at the monitoring well sites in the three sub regions over the three time periods while fig 11 shows spatial variation of this recharge deficit over the nw region for the three time periods a large proportion of the monitoring wells in other area shows larger quantity of recharge deficit during 1985 1994 period compared to the latter periods recharge deficit increased significantly both in high and level barind and at some parts in other area over the time periods however in some northern parts of other area it increased during 1985 1994 to 1995 2004 period but decreased during 2005 2016 period 3 4 quantity of recharge rejection the annual quantities of recharge rejection in terms of rainfall depth at the monitoring well sites are provided in table 5 for the three sub regions for three time periods similar to recharge deficit the quantity of minimum maximum and year averaged recharge rejection also varied over wide ranges but inconsistently both over the time periods and in the sub regions the average annual recharge rejection was the smallest 65 149 cm in high barind the other two sub regions showed mostly similar average annual recharge rejection between 314 cm and 336 cm during 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 periods but decreased significantly to 243 cm in level barind and 265 cm in other area during 2005 2016 fig 12 illustrates variation of the quantity of year averaged recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites in the three sub regions over the three time periods while fig 13 illustrates spatial variation of this recharge rejection for the three time periods for the nw region recharge rejection was significantly larger in other area than in high and level barind high barind showed significantly lower recharge rejection than the other sub regions a large proportion of monitoring wells in level barind and other area showed smaller quantity of recharge rejection during 2005 2016 period compared to 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 periods 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in recharge lag period and rejection period two unique hydrologic seasons dry and wet along with groundwater based irrigation in the dry season provide annually recycling gwl hydrographs with a distinct rising limb a falling limb a highest peak and a lowest peak the aquifers are depleted during november through april and replenished during may through october the major depletion occurs during january to april due to large scale extraction of groundwater for use in irrigation while the replenishment occurs from monsoon rainfall and to some extent from flood water irrigation return flow and perhaps interflow from adjacent aquifers quantification of the effect of irrigation return flow to recharge the groundwater system is still unclear because of a complex flow of groundwater generally from north to south following the basement structure and topographic gradient majumder et al 2011 it is difficult to estimate the interflow component especially during the dry season when irrigation pumps continuously operate over the entire region no measured data on the interflow component of recharge is available in the literature however due to the flow of groundwater towards downslope it is presumed that the quantity of water entering an aquifer from the upstream is mostly same as the quantity of water leaving the aquifer at the downstream therefore the interflow would not affect gwl significantly recharge to the aquifers also occurs through sandy layers both in the river beds and banks when they remain submerged in the barind tract there are scratches that have created a direct hydraulic connection between river channels and the aquifers underlying the upper clay layers nowreen et al 2020 consequently the aquifers are recharged through seepage from the river channels the gwl responds quickly to recharge from rainfall for a permeable overlying soil formation while it requires more time to respond to rainfall in case of a relatively impermeable overlying soil formation so the fluctuations of gwl in response to rainfall events contain information on temporally and spatially variable groundwater recharge rates knotters and bierkens 2000 coulibaly et al 2001 healy and cook 2002 rai et al 2006 and thus rainfall is a good indicator for gwl fluctuations todd and mays 2005 however rainfall may cause minor fluctuations if surface subsurface losses of rainfall become large or the lag period is long enough this study identified a threshold minimum rainfall at each monitoring well site at the end of each dry season illustrated in fig 3 b that caused gwl to initiate rising first at the end of dry season this threshold minimum rainfall was determined by interpreting rainfall events and initiation of gwl rising in every year of the data period 1985 2016 at each monitoring well site there is no measured data on the amount of rainfall actually needed to satisfy moisture requirement of the vadoze zone before initiation of gwl rising this was a main uncertainty in the estimation of threshold rainfall for a south eastern area in bangladesh titas upazila kanoua and merkel 2015 reported that most of the dry season rainfall 20 of annual total is consumed to satisfy soil moisture requirement and evapotranspiration however we are not aware of any available method to accurately quantify threshold rainfall from sparsely dispersed several relatively small rainfall events as present in our data sets there was also an uncertainty in identifying the initiation of gwl s response to rainfall the gwl s first response can be identified only when percolated water joins the gwl at a greater rate compared to that at which groundwater leaves the aquifer healy and cook 2002 because of the clay layers overlying the confined or semi confined aquifers in most parts of the barind tract ravenscroft and rahman 2003 fig 2 sufficient vertical recharge cannot occur to these aquifers many questions therefore remain unresolved about the recharge processes and how water moves from ground surface to the deeper aquifers being exploited for various purposes rushton et al 2020 in spite of these uncertainties the long data period 32 years of this study are expected to provide fairly good estimates of lag period at the monitoring well sites the results therefore expand our knowledge on the nature of response of groundwater recharge from rainfall in the aquifers of the region this study estimated recharge rejection period from the difference of time at which gwl reached the minimum depth to ground surface and the time at which the last significant monsoon rainfall event occurred fig 4 b although recharge would continue for some time period after occurrence of the last rainfall event we ignored this end of recharge season lag period due to lack of measured data this assumption is rational for most parts of other area where the end of recharge season lag period would be much smaller than the beginning of recharge season lag period due to smaller depth of gwl from ground surface and larger moisture content in the overlying vadose zone but this supposition would not be true for high and level barind since gwl remains at considerably greater depth over the whole year compared to the other area the estimated recharge rejection periods therefore represented the time period between gwl had reached the minimum depth to ground surface and the time of occurrence of the last significant rainfall event before recharge rejection commenced gwl had reached the minimum depth to ground surface before cessation of monsoon rainfall the latter rainfall event s could not contribute recharging the aquifer since it was already fully replenished and there was no more space in the aquifer to accommodate more recharging water comparison of the rainfall events and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells of the other area revealed that most of the rainfalls occurring between july and september were rejected due to lack of storage capacity of the aquifer these observations imply that more water could be extracted from the aquifers of those well sites and the depleted aquifer still would have recharged fully in monsoon 4 2 spatial and temporal variations of lag period the response time of gwl to rainfall at the same monitoring well sites varied over the years due to variation of first recharge generating rainfall amount depth to gwl and moisture content of the vadoze zone on the other hand the variation of response time among different sites for the homogeneous hydraulic and hydrologic conditions was due to variation of geological formations among the sites the lag periods were larger in high barind than in the other two sub regions table 1 fig 6 with the smallest values in other area and increased over the three time periods in level barind the barind tract both high and level barind and other area comprise mainly two different geological formations the barind tract is characterized by pre holocene sediments and remainder in the region by holocene unconsolidated sediments reimann 1993 for example the upper most layer of chapai nawabganj district within barind tract fig 1 comprises 2 5 35 0 m thick clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 1 while the upper most layer in pabna district within other area comprises 1 20 m thick clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 2 due to higher elevation and less annual flood in the barind tract the apparent main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall but the thick sticky clay surface acting as aquitard impedes infiltration and increased surface runoff so the relatively thicker semi permeable upper layer delayed and also reduced infiltrating water to reach the underlying aquifer compared to other area an aquifer of coarse and medium sand and gravel underlying often a thin sandy clay layer is the general characteristics of the far northern districts of the study area dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 3 so recharge from rainfall can occur with much ease in these aquifers compared to the aquifers in barind tract 4 3 current water storage status of the aquifers bangladesh mostly comprises alluvial sediments of three major rivers the ganges brahmaputra and meghna the main alluvial aquifers of the country consist primarily of sand with layers of clay and silt with very often an upper silty clay layer miah and rushton 1997 nowreen et al 2020 fig 2 although there are scopes of significant potential recharge during monsoon period the upper silty clay layer limits water entry into the main aquifers to a large extent miah and rushton 1997 in contrast the thick clay layer overlying the aquifer in the barind tract greatly restricts although not entirely prevents recharge from the surface sources the rainfall gwl response phenomena associated with higher lag period in the barind tract compared to other area table 1 fig 6 clearly demonstrate occurrence of at least some recharge from rainfall as opposed to most often perceived despite evidence of occurring both recharge deficit in some years and recharge rejection in the other years in the barind tract intensive groundwater withdrawals are causing gwl to decline gradually over the past years shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 ali et al 2012 haque et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 with a net reduction in groundwater storage in the aquifers land use and land cover changes might also influence gwl agricultural development e g irrigation expansion may be a dominant cause of extensive changes in land use and land cover and decline in gwl at many regions in the world scanlon et al 2005 expansion in irrigation over the past 3 to 4 decades associated with increased pumping of groundwater in the nw region of bangladesh might cause decline in gwl with resulting increase in the lag period also increased impervious surfaces e g roofs or roads resulting from expanded urbanization can reduce the natural infiltration with resulting decline in gwl however urbanization reduces evapotranspiration by reducing the amount of vegetation with a possibility of increase in recharge minning et al 2018 mustafa et al 2017 by estimating changes in land cover between the year 1990 and 2010 and evaluating their influence on groundwater recharge in the nw region of bangladesh obtained only insignificant effects of land cover changes on the large basin scale in addition to higher net water extraction there is reduced recharge due to an observed decline 20 in rainfall pena arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or due to a combination of these two factors these opposing factors of the dynamic groundwater resource have been causing reduced long term safe yield of the aquifer rushton et al 2020 shamsudduha et al 2009 and indicating groundwater withdrawal in excess of the aquifer s sustainable limit it is noted that this non equilibrium dynamism of groundwater resource is being encountered for high and level barind and a few sites in other area this problem is however not prevalent in most parts of other area the aquifers in most parts of other area being overlain by relatively thin silt clay layers fig 2 supplementary fig 3 have high recharge potential that if utilized fully can supply large quantities of groundwater interpretation of gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells in those areas revealed that the aquifers were fully replenished well before the end of monsoon in most of the years table 3 fig 9 and there was no more space in the aquifers to accommodate remaining rechargeable rainfall consequently a considerable part of the rechargeable rainfall that was rejected could be utilized to recharge the aquifer by creating more storage space by extracting groundwater during the dry season in areas with permeable surface geologies e g most parts of other area groundwater abstraction in dry season has been reported to induce greater recharge during the subsequent monsoon shamsudduha et al 2015 through increased capture of surface water although recharge deficits occurred at some sites in some years in other area the quantity is much lower evident in fig 11 during 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 periods and the years of deficit are also fewer in number evident in table 3 from the years of rejection than in high and level barind groundwater is characterized by an annual recharge discharge cycle in bangladesh thus groundwater being a renewable resource remains in dynamic equilibrium when gwl fully recovers to previous year s position during the subsequent monsoon a certain amount of decline in gwl in one year or in a few consecutive years as currently being occurred in some monitoring well sites may be regained in the subsequent monsoon s as long as the decline does not exceed potential recharge over a few years time span and as long as recharge rejection occurs in most of the years by taking this and the observed large quantity of annual rejected recharge into account further withdrawal of groundwater would be possible in most parts of other area sustainable development and preservation of groundwater resource largely depend on its proper management for which adequate knowledge on spatial variability of groundwater recharge is critically important moon et al 2004 the sustainability issue is linked to ensure usage of groundwater for an unlimited time without causing undesirable ecological economic or social penalties alley and leake 2004 the government of bangladesh plans to prevent declining gwl by reducing pumping of groundwater through adoption of farm scale water saving measures like improved irrigation delivery technologies e g canal lining buried pipe and agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying irrigation method conservation agricultural practices such as reduced or zero tillage the water saving measures may reduce the pumping volume of groundwater and associated cost by reducing evaporation from soil and water surfaces but if the actual evapotranspiration of crops does not change the net impact on groundwater reserve will be nil mainuddin et al 2020 water percolating below the crop fields is neither consumed by the plants nor is it lost from the groundwater irrigation system since it goes back to the underlying aquifer as return flow mainuddin et al 2020 rushton et al 2020 mojid and mainuddin 2021 while conservation agricultural practices reduce seepage and percolation there is no evidence that they reduce actual evapotranspiration of the crop ahmad et al 2007 perry and steduto 2017 the supposition behind the government s policy intervention to achieve sustainable groundwater irrigation is therefore unlikely to have any significant impact on declining gwl mainuddin et al 2020 groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water usage i e evapotranspiration in high and level barind and at a few sites in other area where the annual recharge is less than the net water usage needs to be reduced preferably by crop diversification in recent years the government is emphasizing surface water use through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water which have the potential to increase recharge and sustain groundwater irrigation in spite of continuously declining gwl in high and level barind and also in some locations in other area considerable amount of recharge rejection has been occurring in most of the years table 1 fig 9 so the provision of increasing recharge opportunity period by storing the available rechargeable water currently being rejected currently in surface storage can be very important towards increasing groundwater storage both in the barind tract and other area therefore a comprehensive rethinking of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the nw region is essential 5 conclusions the hydrological interaction between rainfall or surface sources of recharge and groundwater can reveal spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of groundwater this can guide making measurements at the appropriate scale and developing proper management policies for groundwater resources interpretation of long term in this study 32 years gwl hydrographs of monitoring wells total 137 revealed crucial information on recharge discharge dynamics of the aquifers gwl responded to a threshold minimum rainfall that varied both spatially and temporally at each monitoring well sites recharge deficit occurred in some years and recharge rejection in the other years the threshold rainfall was greater and lag period was longer in areas with thick clay layers overlying the aquifers e g in barind tract in the years with recharge rejection most of the rainfall occurring during monsoon july to september was rejected since the aquifers got fully replenished before rejection of recharge had started except in the clay overlain barind tract at many locations of the study region recharge rejection occurred in most of the years indicating further potential of groundwater withdrawal from the aquifers in the dry season despite clear evidence of continuously declining gwl the barind tract exhibited recharge rejection period in some years with considerable quantity of recharge rejection these incongruent results from the gwl s response to rainfall are in contrast to field observed recharge dynamics of the aquifer and clear indications of the presence of dominant recharge process es in the area other than from local rainfalls the results based on locally observed gwl data provide information on duration and quantity of recharge deficit and recharge rejection and their spatial and temporal variations such information derived for any groundwater basin is crucial in updating groundwater development program for the concerned region the strong point of the employed methodology is that rainfall and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells were inspected visually year by year on ms excel sheets and information picked up from the rationally target points on the hydrographs most of which were very often confounded with some non systematic data points this procedure provided information on real time measured data without any assumption or approximation the weak point was that the response of gwl was identified by considering only rainfall the major source of recharge for the study region although irrigation return flow and interflow had some contributions in recharging the aquifers future studies can take into account these recharge sources to identify recharge deficit and recharge rejection more precisely in the aquifers future research may also estimate percentage of rainfall that contributes groundwater recharge in different sub regions for various rainfall events to be used

11871,declining groundwater level gwl has posed an immense threat to the groundwater based irrigated agriculture in the north west nw region of bangladesh this study determined time lag after which gwl responds to rainfall quantified threshold minimum rainfall to initiate rising of gwl identified locations and durations of recharge deficit and rejection and quantified these from locally recorded rainfall and gwl data to understand local aquifers dynamics and water storage these objectives were realized by interpreting weekly total rainfall and weekly gwl data of 137 monitoring wells by dividing the data sets into 1985 1994 10 years 1995 2004 10 years and 2005 2016 12 years time spans and the region into three sub regions high barind level barind and other area the average lag period varied from 2 1 to 2 9 weeks and threshold rainfall from 34 to 75 mm recharge deficit occurred in some years and rejection in the other years at all monitoring well sites both quantities greatly varied spatio temporarily revealing non uniform development potential of the aquifers recharge rejection significantly decreased from 1995 to 2004 to 2005 2016 period in all sub regions in spite of clear evidence of continuously declining gwl recharge rejection was obtained in both the high and level barind in each time span this indicates presence of dominant recharge process es other than from rainfalls and necessity of curtailing groundwater extraction or enhancing of recharge for further development of the aquifers in contrast recharge rejection period of 4 7 5 6 weeks per year and 7 8 8 2 years in each time span in other area with no evidence of permanent decline in gwl reveals scope for further development of the aquifers the reported parameters of the recharge depletion characteristics when estimated would guide updating groundwater extraction and management policy for the concerned aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater rainfall recharge deficit

2011 the dependence on groundwater has increased fourfold in the last 50 years in south asia the middle east and north china kumar et al 2018 in bangladesh transformation of high risk monsoon dependent agriculture into irrigation based dry season agriculture over the past 3 to 4 decades has tremendously increased groundwater use in addition to its accelerated use in urban and industrial sectors groundwater irrigation covering 79 of irrigated area bbs 2017 now has become vital for the agro based economy and food security of the country haque et al 2013 currently declining groundwater level gwl decreased availability of surface water in the dry season due to silting and drying up of most rivers deforestation and recurrent drought have become common in many parts of the country mojid 2020 moreover the population of the country has been projected to be 185 million in 2030 and 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 the additional population will need 12 4 and 21 0 million tons of rice respectively mainuddin and kirby 2015 production of this additional rice will further increase extraction of groundwater that is already under stress in many locations specifically in the north west nw region which utilizes much higher groundwater than the other regions of the country mainuddin et al 2014 2019 irrigated agriculture utilizes approximately 96 5 of the extracted groundwater while households and industry utilize the remaining quantity in this region shahid et al 2015 bangladesh has a tropical climate with a distinct wet monsoon june september and a dry winter november february there are 3 cropping seasons in the country that are known as kharif i march june kharif ii july october and rabi november february rabi is the main crop season which is almost rainless and dry based on hydro climatic characteristics kharif i is partially irrigated kharif ii is mostly rainfed with occasional supplemental irrigation and rabi is a fully irrigated season most of the groundwater is abstracted during dry season irrigation period january to april the rapid expansion of groundwater based irrigated agriculture associated with decreased dry season rainfall increased overall temperature and inadequate replenishment of groundwater has caused lowering of the gwl at a worrying rate in some parts of the country islam et al 2012 zahid et al 2017 pena arancibia et al 2020 several studies e g rodell et al 2009 shamsudduha et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 ali et al 2012 rahman and mahbub 2012 dey et al 2017 haque et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 reported clear declining trend in gwls in some areas in the nw region indicating continuous reduction in water storage in those aquifers continuous depletion of gwl with expanding groundwater irrigation is specifically worrying in the barind tract of the nw region aziz et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2016 rushton et al 2020 groundwater resource in this region being under accelerated stress rahman et al 2018 has already become unsustainable shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 kirby et al 2016 mojid et al 2019 in bangladesh groundwater is a dynamic renewable resource whose optimum level is often expressed as the quantity of water determined by the difference between optimum and minimum gwls within the aquifers gwl represents water table in unconfined aquifers and pressure head in confined aquifers groundwater recharge and discharge being the major components of a hydrological cycle predominantly control the gwl and groundwater storage in the aquifers in the nw region major recharge of groundwater occurs from rainfall and flood water pena arancibia et al 2020 and to some extent from irrigation fields rushton et al 2020 while groundwater discharge occurs through pumping of groundwater by wells or natural discharge from aquifers to nearby rivers when gwls remain higher than river water surface mukherjee et al 2018 pena arancibia et al 2020 however the processes by which groundwater is replenished remain poorly understood specifically in the barind tract fluctuations of gwls being directly related to groundwater recharge dickinson et al 2004 zhang and schilling 2004 cuthbert 2010 occur due to seasonality in groundwater recharge discharge phenomena the mega deltas of asia contains mostly shallow aquifers in which gwls are largely influenced by seasonality comprising distinctive dry and wet periods shamsudduha et al 2009 so there is a direct relationship between gwl fluctuation and the amount of rainfall occurring in a season mojid et al 1994 mojid and rashid 1994 pena arancibia et al 2020 groundwater recharge greatly depends on soil moisture condition of the vadoze zone the unsaturated zone overlying the aquifers van hoang and roi 2016 since gwl has to respond to rainfall after meeting all requirements of soil moisture in this zone so there is a time difference between occurrence of rainfall and response of gwl to recharge from rainfall note that any changes in land use and land cover both long term and short term can modify the pattern of water balance components in an area and affect various hydrological processes ansari et al 2016 the long term changes are primarily caused by developmental activities like agricultural expansion urbanization and decline in forest while the short term changes are mostly associated with changes in vegetation or water body as a response to the annual cycles of climate vogelmann et al 2016 eventually both types of changes can greatly affect groundwater recharge wang et al 2018 there are compelling evidence that groundwater in bangladesh is mostly derived from rainfall and floodwater majumder et al 2011 specifically for the nw region the main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall rahman and mahbub 2012 adhikary et al 2013 aziz et al 2015 it is therefore important to generate knowledge on how groundwater systems specifically shallow groundwater systems respond to rainfall variability duvert et al 2015 such knowledge on hydrological interactions of surface water and groundwater is essential to improve our understanding of the water cycle toran 2019 since it provides insight into responses of groundwater resources to surface based recharge sources it is crucial to estimate and project groundwater recharge and aquifers storage capacity to manage groundwater resources effectively islam et al 2014 although a good number of research works has been done on hydrogeology occurrence and potential of groundwater and some works on groundwater dynamics

resources no comprehensive information on recharge lag period threshold rainfall period of recharge rejection and quantity of recharge deficit and rejection are available for the nw region of bangladesh the knowledge on lag period is important since recharge response to rainfall has an influence on available groundwater in an aquifer nemaxwi et al 2019 groundwater may take from hours to decades to reveal the influence of rainfall events depending on site specific hydrogeological characteristics such stretched response of groundwater systems to rainfall when rainfall is the main source of recharge is the prime mechanism that sustains water supply even during dry periods lee et al 2020 specifically detailed area specific data based information on the period and quantity of recharge rejection and deficit is crucial for planning groundwater development in the area inadequate knowledge on the processes by which groundwater is replenished in nw region limits our understanding of the vulnerability of shallow groundwater resources to depletion bui et al 2012 shamsudduha et al 2012 the areas with occurrence of recharge rejection have further scope to extract more groundwater than the current extraction level the quantity of potential additional extraction in an area can be determined from the recharge rate of groundwater and the period of recharge rejection in the area on the other hand the areas with recharge deficit are already under stress and gwls are declining over the years in order to establish sustainable extraction level of groundwater in these areas the current extraction level may need to be reduced the quantity of which can be estimated from the quantity of deficit reduction in extraction may not be needed if recharge to the aquifer can be enhanced to establish dynamic equilibrium of gwls the area specific information on groundwater recharge from rainfall is also necessary in devising mechanisms to enhance natural recharge to the aquifers to increase useable storage of groundwater taking into account these factors of sustainable groundwater use this study determined the recharge related hydrological parameters of the aquifers at 137 gwl monitoring wells distributed roughly uniformly in the nw region of bangladesh 2 methodology 2 1 study area 2 1 1 hydro climatic characteristics the nw region of bangladesh comprises sixteen administrative districts namely bogura chapai nawabganj joypurhat naogaon natore pabna rajshahi sirajganj thakurgaon rangpur panchagar nilfamari lalmonirhat kurigram gaibandha and dinajpur fig 1 it is one of the eight natural features based hydrological regions in the country that is situated on the west of the jamuna river known as the brahmaputra in india and north of the padma river known as the ganges in india and includes a pre holocene hydrogeological zone called barind tract the region is characterized with a typical dry climate with relatively high temperature and receives an average 1927 mm rainfall annually mojid et al 2019 this rainfall amount is the lowest amongst the eight hydrological regions the barind tract is a distinctive physiographic unit comprising series of uplifted blocks of terraced land covering 8720 square kilometers in the nw region between the floodplains of the padma and jamuna rivers spread over parts of bogura dinajpur joypurhat naogaon rajshahi and rangpur districts the barind tract includes 773 000 ha of which 532 000 ha are cultivable it is one of the direst and hottest parts of the country rainfall is relatively low in this region with the long term average being 1250 mm in the west and 2000 mm in the northeast riches 2008 most of the rainfall 80 occurs during june to september fao 2015 temperature ranges from 25 c to 35 c very often exceeding 40 c and often reaching up to 50 c in the summer rushton et al 2020 2 1 2 hydro geologic characteristics the barind tract is characterized by pre holocene sediments and the remainder in the region by holocene unconsolidated sediments reimann 1993 both quaternary deposits consist of sands silts and clays that form aquifers throughout the region nowreen et al 2020 the pre holocene aquifers typically occur below a clay unit that varies in thickness from 8 m to 45 m ravenscroft et al 2005 as illustrated in fig 2 the holocene aquifers are commonly unconfined or semi confined but the pre holocene aquifers are confined to semi confined dphe 2001 ravenscroft and rahman 2003 groundwater generally occurs at shallow depth 10 m below ground surface in the holocene aquifers but at deeper depths 10 m below ground surface in the pre holocene aquifers shamsudduha et al 2011 mojid et al 2019 the permeability of holocene surficial cover is higher than that of pre holocene surficial cover nowreen et al 2020 the lithologies within both quaternary sediments are however highly variable both in horizontal and vertical directions producing localized and highly heterogeneous aquifers dphe 2001 hasan et al 2016 zahid et al 2016 a top clay layer 1 5 51 8 m thick hasan et al 2016 fig 2 composite sand layer 3 0 68 5 m thick of different grain sizes and at the bottom in most locations an impermeable clay layer is the common geologic formation in the south western part rajshahi nawabganj and naogaon districts fig 1 of the nw region the composite sand formation is the only useable groundwater source in this part an aquifer of coarse and medium sand and gravel underlying a thin sandy clay layer 3 6 m fig 2 is the general characteristics of the northern districts panchagarh thakurgaon dinajpur and joypurhat except the area covered by the barind tract dphe 2010 one thick medium and coarse sand aquifer at 3 150 m depth in panchagarh five medium and coarse sand aquifer units at 3 153 m depth inter bedded with aquitards in thakurgaon three aquifer units at 3 184 m depth inter bedded with aquitards in dinajpur and two aquifer units at 3 54 m depth in joypurhat districts are available zahid et al 2016 the upper most layer in pabna district comprises 1 m 20 m clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 which acts as aquitard the aquifer system is hydraulically connected regionally although one or more aquitards are encountered at the local level zahid et al 2016 the barind tract is at higher elevation than the adjoining floodplain and there are two terrace levels one at 40 m above mean sea level known as high barind and the other between 19 8 m and 22 9 m known as level barind fig 1 approximately 47 of the barind tract is classified as highland 41 as medium highland and the rest as lowland zahid et al 2016 for this study the whole nw region was therefore divided into three sub regions high barind level barind and other area 2 2 data collection and training both gwl and rainfall data were used for assessing the rainfall groundwater recharge dynamics in bangladesh there is an extensive network of gwl monitoring wells 1200 which are fairly distributed across the country out of these 437 monitoring wells are in the nw region bangladesh water development board bwdb records gwls in the monitoring wells on weekly basis a few other organizations e g bangladesh agricultural development corporation barind multi purpose development authority also monitor gwls in some specific parts of the country bangladesh meteorological department collects and maintains climate data for 34 weather stations spread across the country of which six weather stations are in the nw region at bogura rajshahi ishurdi rangpur dinajpur and sayedpur districts fig 1 the weekly gwl and daily rainfall data of 1985 2016 period were collected and trained before objective oriented analysis to synchronize with gwl weekly rainfalls were calculated from the daily rainfall data and cumulative weekly rainfall was calculated therefrom the gwls were arranged and sorted according to the location and id numbers of the monitoring wells by plotting gwls against time in scatter plots in ms excel sheets the drifts seasonality gaps and outliers in the data sets were identified after inspecting data of all monitoring wells 350 wells were found having consistent gwl data with typical distribution over time considering huge time requirement for manual analysis and interpretation of data 5 wells from the high barind 19 from level barind and 113 from the remaining area of the nw region were selected the wells are distributed fairly uniformly over the entire nw region fig 1 the gwls reached the maximum depths from ground surface at the end of dry season and the minimum depth occurred some times in the wet season both depths were identified on gwl hydrographs and noted separately for each monitoring wells a typical gwl hydrograph is displayed in fig 3 a 2 3 determination of recharge lag period recharge lag periods were calculated from gwl hydrographs of the selected 137 monitoring wells for each year from 1985 to 2016 gwl hydrographs were prepared by plotting gwls of each monitoring well against time week of the data period rainfall hydrographs were prepared by plotting cumulative weekly total rainfall against weeks fig 3 b for each monitoring well rainfall hydrographs of the nearest meteorological station fig 1 were assigned for that well for both hydrographs january was taken as the starting month since dry season irrigation starts at this month and it is also starting of large scale extraction of groundwater for irrigation the irrigation period continues up to april and gwl continues dropping due to extraction by irrigation wells without reflecting any effect of recharge from irrigation fields although some recharge might occur rushton et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2020 majumder et al 2011 evaluated the groundwater flow systems in bengal delta aquifers bangladesh using environmental isotope techniques and reported that all groundwater are derived from rainfall and floodwater with a minor localized evaporation effects for the shallow groundwater their result is also similar to that of mustafa et al 2018 who obtained insignificant effect of irrigation return flow in the improvement of gwls during dry season since there is no measured data on the contribution of irrigation fields to groundwater recharge we considered only the effect of rainfall in determining the response time of gwl to rainfall the week of seasonal first rainfall was identified on the rainfall hydrograph at each monitoring well for each year some rainfall events with small quantity did not contribute recharging the aquifer since the unsaturated soil layer overlying the aquifer needed to be saturated before infiltrating water to the aquifer when percolated water from rainfall reached the aquifer gwl started rising fig 3 b for example elucidates that gwl responded one week after rainfall had occurred the week at which gwl responded to rainfall was recorded in each year during 1985 2016 period for the 137 monitoring wells the difference between the week at which rainfall started and the week at which gwl responded lag period of recharge from rainfall was determined in bangladesh large scale development of groundwater started in early 1980s and continued expanding rapidly almost to reach its full potential at around 2010 after which extraction of groundwater mostly remains unchanged or it declines because of continuous decline in gwl in many parts of the country including the nw region taking this into account we divided the gwl data set into three time segments 1985 1994 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 periods to effectively capture the temporal variation of the recharge rainfall mechanism therefore the average lag period of recharge for each monitoring well was calculated for these three different time periods by taking average of lag periods of each year for each time period 2 4 determination of the periods and quantities of recharge deficit and rejection the amount of water which percolates through the vadoze zone and joins the aquifer causing eventual rise in gwl is the actual net recharge on the other hand the quantity of water which could reach the aquifer hypothetically is the potential recharge when an aquifer has been fully recharged and gwl has reached its possible highest level aquifer full condition cannot accept any more water so water available on the ground surface but unable to move to groundwater because of aquifer full condition is the rejected recharge in principle potential recharge is the sum of actual recharge and rejected recharge orehova et al 2012 at aquifer full condition the potential recharge mostly contributes to surface runoff instead of recharging the aquifer thus the status of groundwater recharge at any monitoring well site can be explained in terms of one of three states of recharge recharge deficit recharge rejection or recharge balance these states were determined by interpreting and analyzing local rainfall hydrographs and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells the three states of groundwater recharge were differentiated by comparing the time of whether gwl reached the minimum depth from ground surface before after or at the time of cessation of monsoon rainfall deficit in recharge occurred when the amount of water withdrawn from the aquifer in dry season was not fully replenished during subsequent monsoon in this case gwl continued rising during whole monsoon period but did not reach the previous year s highest peak as illustrated in fig 4 a the amount of recharge deficit was determined from the difference between the highest peaks of gwl minimum depth from ground surface of two successive years recharge balance condition was observed when cessation of rainfall and the highest peak of gwl occurred almost at the same time and gwl reached the previous year s highest peak if gwl reached the highest peak well before cessation of rainfall there was rejection of recharge for example fig 4 b shows the highest peak of gwl in 38th week and the occurrence of seasonal last appreciable rainfall event in 42nd week revealing that the rainfall occurring after 38th week could not contribute to recharging the aquifer and hence was rejected mainly as runoff the difference of times at which gwl reached the highest peak and rainfall ceased was the recharge rejection period this time period was calculated from the difference between the times of occurrence of the two events fig 4 b the amount of rejected recharge was calculated from the difference between cumulative rainfall on the week when rainfall ceased and cumulative rainfall on the week when gwl reached the highest peak fig 5 a demonstrates that the end of rainfall and arrival of gwl to its highest peak occurred at the same week 39th week also the gwl was at the previous year s highest peak there was neither deficit of recharge nor additional scope for recharge implying that the aquifer was at recharge balance condition similar to lag period recharge deficit and rejection periods and their quantities were determined for the three time periods the locations of recharge deficit rejection and balance were identified from the identification number and associated locations of the monitoring wells 3 results 3 1 recharge lag period and threshold rainfall gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells reflected response of the aquifers to recharge from rainfalls the responses were more vigorous in other area than in high and level barind fig 5 b as an example demonstrates that total 50 mm rainfall occurring during 8th to 16th weeks 8 weeks before onset of monsoon march april at a monitoring well site in natore district within other area fig 1 had no influence on gwl the rise in gwl was first evident in 21st week after 26 mm rainfall had occurred in 17th week the previous 50 mm rainfall distributed over 8 weeks was used partly for surface evaporation and partly for wetting the vadoze zone the previous weeks total rainfall 50 mm and 17th week s rainfall 26 mm was the required threshold amount to start recharging the underlying aquifer in 21st week after satisfying surface evaporation and soil moisture requirement of the vadoze zone since a large proportion of the crop acreage was under irrigated rice the vadose zone within the irrigated area might remain saturated or partially saturated consequently some recharge might have occurred both from the irrigated rice fields through deep percolation and appreciable rainfall events when there was any rushton et al 2020 the irrigation return flow can play a major role in recharging the aquifer in the irrigated area compared to local rainfall in the dry season during the dry season mean seasonal groundwater recharge has been reported to be almost double over the last 2 decades as a result of increased abstraction for irrigation mustafa et al 2018 however the quantity of recharge from these sources irrigation return flow and rainfall being much smaller than the large scale extraction of water from the aquifer during the same time period was not reflected visibly and hence not detectable in the gwl hydrographs nevertheless without the recharge from rice fields the groundwater levels would drop below what were actually observed mainuddin et al 2020 the average of the monitoring wells range of lag period of recharge from rainfall varied widely among the three sub regions high barind level barind and other area fig 1 the highest range being in high barind and the lowest in other area table 1 the minimum range was relatively narrow between 1 week and 3 weeks and remained consistent among the sub regions and three time periods 1985 1994 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 while the maximum range was wide between 1 week and 13 weeks the widest range being in other area the average minimum lag period was largest 1 5 1 8 weeks in high barind and smallest 1 0 1 2 weeks in other area while the average maximum lag period was the largest 4 8 6 5 weeks in other area and smallest 2 7 3 9 weeks in level barind the overall average lag period varied from 2 1 to 2 9 weeks among the three time periods with the largest value in high barind and smallest value in other area comparison of spatial distributions of the average lag periods for the three time periods fig 6 reveals that the lag periods increased over time at several monitoring well sites this observation is a clear indication of increasing depth of dry season gwls over time in those sites the threshold rainfall to initiate rising of gwl varied widely among the three sub regions and the three time periods the minimum threshold rainfall was the largest 24 36 mm in high barind and smallest 11 13 mm in other area with consistently increasing values over the three time periods in high barind due to continuously declining gwl the maximum threshold rainfall varied inconsistently both among the sub regions and the time periods table 2 the average threshold rainfall was 39 75 mm in high barind 34 43 mm in level barind and 35 41 mm in other area with no consistent variation among the three time periods except in high barind where it increased over time the variation in threshold rainfalls among the years at the same monitoring well sites occurred due to variation in depth of gwl and initial pre recharge moisture condition of the vadoze zone on the other hand the variation in threshold rainfall among the monitoring well sites with the same depth of gwl and moisture condition of the vadoze zone was due to difference in hydraulic conductivity of formation materials of the vadoze zone both the lag period and threshold rainfall were greater in the barind tract both high and level than in other area due to thick clay layer overlying the aquifer in the barind tract fig 2 3 2 recharge rejection period recharge deficit and recharge rejection occurred at the monitoring well sites depending on the amount of water extracted from or moved out of the aquifer amount of water added to the aquifer through deep percolation from surface sources and interflow from the adjacent aquifer s and the amount of rainfall occurred at the sites in a hydrological cycle at each monitoring well site there was recharge deficit for some period in some years and recharge rejection for some period in the other years thus providing a year averaged recharge deficit period as well as recharge rejection period for the well site although the range of year averaged minimum recharge rejection period was within 0 nil to 3 weeks in the three sub regions that of maximum recharge rejection period varied widely 2 21 weeks with consistently widening range over the three time periods in high barind table 3 the average minimum recharge rejection period over the three time periods was 0 nil to 2 weeks both in high and level barind and 1 5 2 2 weeks in other area the average maximum recharge rejection period for the corresponding sub region was 4 2 8 0 weeks 8 6 12 5 weeks and 10 3 12 7 weeks the overall average recharge rejection period over the three time periods was 2 2 3 6 weeks 3 6 4 5 weeks and 4 7 5 6 weeks in high barind level barind and other area respectively with consistently decreasing recharge rejection period in level barind it is noted that despite continuous decline in gwl in most parts in the barind region mojid et al 2019 the rainfall gwl relation revealed occurrence of some recharge rejection period this might be due to that because of deeper gwl and larger recharge lag periods table 1 the infiltrating water was lost through lateral flow and surface evaporation before reaching the aquifer the year averaged minimum recharge rejection year for the individual monitoring wells within the three time periods was 0 nil to 1 year both in high and level barind and 1 3 years in other area table 3 the year averaged maximum recharge rejection year in the corresponding sub regions was 4 7 years 9 10 years and 10 11 years within the three time periods the average of the year averaged recharge rejection year within the three time periods was 2 0 4 8 years 4 6 7 2 years and 7 8 8 2 years in high barind level barind and other area respectively the variations of annual recharge rejection week at the monitoring well sites are illustrated in fig 7 for the three sub regions while fig 8 demonstrates spatial distribution of year averaged recharge rejection weeks for the three time periods in general recharge rejection period was higher in other area than in level barind which had higher recharge rejection period than high barind the larger proportion of monitoring well sites in other area provided larger recharge rejection period compared to other two sub regions in the three time periods figs 7 and 8 reveal that the number of weeks of recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites with larger recharge rejection period in other area increased from 1985 to 1994 to 1995 2004 period after which it decreased during 2005 2016 period there was wide variation in recharge rejection period over the years in the three time periods and three sub regions wide variation was also in the number of years of recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites table 3 fig 9 3 3 quantity of recharge deficit because of recharge deficit in some years and recharge rejection in the other years at the monitoring well sites there was a year averaged recharge deficit as well as year averaged recharge rejection for each well site note that recharge deficit in a year was determined in terms of decline in peak gwl of the year compared to the previous year s peak gwl fig 4 a not with respect to whether the aquifer was fully replenished to its full storage capacity the estimated recharge deficit thus indicated shortage of recharge in the aquifer storage that was depleted in the year under consideration the annual quantities of recharge deficit in terms of depth of aquifer for unconfined aquifer or pressure head for confined aquifer at the monitoring well sites are provided in table 4 for the three time periods for the three sub regions the quantity of minimum maximum and year averaged recharge deficits varied over wide ranges but inconsistently both over the time periods and in the sub regions the average annual recharge deficit remained practically unchanged 87 90 cm in high barind during 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 but increased enormously 415 cm during 2005 2016 due to wide variations in recharge deficit 21 1730 108 1990 and 165 1105 cm in 3 monitoring wells at nachol upazila in the high barind the wide variation in recharge deficit is also reflected in the maximum and average range of recharge deficits 21 1730 and 65 1272 cm respectively for this sub region table 4 the recharge deficit varied over a narrow range 107 122 cm over the three time periods in level barind but decreased significantly from 180 to 99 cm from 1985 to 1994 to the latter periods in other area fig 10 illustrates variation of the quantity of year averaged recharge deficit at the monitoring well sites in the three sub regions over the three time periods while fig 11 shows spatial variation of this recharge deficit over the nw region for the three time periods a large proportion of the monitoring wells in other area shows larger quantity of recharge deficit during 1985 1994 period compared to the latter periods recharge deficit increased significantly both in high and level barind and at some parts in other area over the time periods however in some northern parts of other area it increased during 1985 1994 to 1995 2004 period but decreased during 2005 2016 period 3 4 quantity of recharge rejection the annual quantities of recharge rejection in terms of rainfall depth at the monitoring well sites are provided in table 5 for the three sub regions for three time periods similar to recharge deficit the quantity of minimum maximum and year averaged recharge rejection also varied over wide ranges but inconsistently both over the time periods and in the sub regions the average annual recharge rejection was the smallest 65 149 cm in high barind the other two sub regions showed mostly similar average annual recharge rejection between 314 cm and 336 cm during 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 periods but decreased significantly to 243 cm in level barind and 265 cm in other area during 2005 2016 fig 12 illustrates variation of the quantity of year averaged recharge rejection at the monitoring well sites in the three sub regions over the three time periods while fig 13 illustrates spatial variation of this recharge rejection for the three time periods for the nw region recharge rejection was significantly larger in other area than in high and level barind high barind showed significantly lower recharge rejection than the other sub regions a large proportion of monitoring wells in level barind and other area showed smaller quantity of recharge rejection during 2005 2016 period compared to 1985 1994 and 1995 2004 periods 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty in recharge lag period and rejection period two unique hydrologic seasons dry and wet along with groundwater based irrigation in the dry season provide annually recycling gwl hydrographs with a distinct rising limb a falling limb a highest peak and a lowest peak the aquifers are depleted during november through april and replenished during may through october the major depletion occurs during january to april due to large scale extraction of groundwater for use in irrigation while the replenishment occurs from monsoon rainfall and to some extent from flood water irrigation return flow and perhaps interflow from adjacent aquifers quantification of the effect of irrigation return flow to recharge the groundwater system is still unclear because of a complex flow of groundwater generally from north to south following the basement structure and topographic gradient majumder et al 2011 it is difficult to estimate the interflow component especially during the dry season when irrigation pumps continuously operate over the entire region no measured data on the interflow component of recharge is available in the literature however due to the flow of groundwater towards downslope it is presumed that the quantity of water entering an aquifer from the upstream is mostly same as the quantity of water leaving the aquifer at the downstream therefore the interflow would not affect gwl significantly recharge to the aquifers also occurs through sandy layers both in the river beds and banks when they remain submerged in the barind tract there are scratches that have created a direct hydraulic connection between river channels and the aquifers underlying the upper clay layers nowreen et al 2020 consequently the aquifers are recharged through seepage from the river channels the gwl responds quickly to recharge from rainfall for a permeable overlying soil formation while it requires more time to respond to rainfall in case of a relatively impermeable overlying soil formation so the fluctuations of gwl in response to rainfall events contain information on temporally and spatially variable groundwater recharge rates knotters and bierkens 2000 coulibaly et al 2001 healy and cook 2002 rai et al 2006 and thus rainfall is a good indicator for gwl fluctuations todd and mays 2005 however rainfall may cause minor fluctuations if surface subsurface losses of rainfall become large or the lag period is long enough this study identified a threshold minimum rainfall at each monitoring well site at the end of each dry season illustrated in fig 3 b that caused gwl to initiate rising first at the end of dry season this threshold minimum rainfall was determined by interpreting rainfall events and initiation of gwl rising in every year of the data period 1985 2016 at each monitoring well site there is no measured data on the amount of rainfall actually needed to satisfy moisture requirement of the vadoze zone before initiation of gwl rising this was a main uncertainty in the estimation of threshold rainfall for a south eastern area in bangladesh titas upazila kanoua and merkel 2015 reported that most of the dry season rainfall 20 of annual total is consumed to satisfy soil moisture requirement and evapotranspiration however we are not aware of any available method to accurately quantify threshold rainfall from sparsely dispersed several relatively small rainfall events as present in our data sets there was also an uncertainty in identifying the initiation of gwl s response to rainfall the gwl s first response can be identified only when percolated water joins the gwl at a greater rate compared to that at which groundwater leaves the aquifer healy and cook 2002 because of the clay layers overlying the confined or semi confined aquifers in most parts of the barind tract ravenscroft and rahman 2003 fig 2 sufficient vertical recharge cannot occur to these aquifers many questions therefore remain unresolved about the recharge processes and how water moves from ground surface to the deeper aquifers being exploited for various purposes rushton et al 2020 in spite of these uncertainties the long data period 32 years of this study are expected to provide fairly good estimates of lag period at the monitoring well sites the results therefore expand our knowledge on the nature of response of groundwater recharge from rainfall in the aquifers of the region this study estimated recharge rejection period from the difference of time at which gwl reached the minimum depth to ground surface and the time at which the last significant monsoon rainfall event occurred fig 4 b although recharge would continue for some time period after occurrence of the last rainfall event we ignored this end of recharge season lag period due to lack of measured data this assumption is rational for most parts of other area where the end of recharge season lag period would be much smaller than the beginning of recharge season lag period due to smaller depth of gwl from ground surface and larger moisture content in the overlying vadose zone but this supposition would not be true for high and level barind since gwl remains at considerably greater depth over the whole year compared to the other area the estimated recharge rejection periods therefore represented the time period between gwl had reached the minimum depth to ground surface and the time of occurrence of the last significant rainfall event before recharge rejection commenced gwl had reached the minimum depth to ground surface before cessation of monsoon rainfall the latter rainfall event s could not contribute recharging the aquifer since it was already fully replenished and there was no more space in the aquifer to accommodate more recharging water comparison of the rainfall events and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells of the other area revealed that most of the rainfalls occurring between july and september were rejected due to lack of storage capacity of the aquifer these observations imply that more water could be extracted from the aquifers of those well sites and the depleted aquifer still would have recharged fully in monsoon 4 2 spatial and temporal variations of lag period the response time of gwl to rainfall at the same monitoring well sites varied over the years due to variation of first recharge generating rainfall amount depth to gwl and moisture content of the vadoze zone on the other hand the variation of response time among different sites for the homogeneous hydraulic and hydrologic conditions was due to variation of geological formations among the sites the lag periods were larger in high barind than in the other two sub regions table 1 fig 6 with the smallest values in other area and increased over the three time periods in level barind the barind tract both high and level barind and other area comprise mainly two different geological formations the barind tract is characterized by pre holocene sediments and remainder in the region by holocene unconsolidated sediments reimann 1993 for example the upper most layer of chapai nawabganj district within barind tract fig 1 comprises 2 5 35 0 m thick clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 1 while the upper most layer in pabna district within other area comprises 1 20 m thick clay to silty clay layer dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 2 due to higher elevation and less annual flood in the barind tract the apparent main source of groundwater recharge is rainfall but the thick sticky clay surface acting as aquitard impedes infiltration and increased surface runoff so the relatively thicker semi permeable upper layer delayed and also reduced infiltrating water to reach the underlying aquifer compared to other area an aquifer of coarse and medium sand and gravel underlying often a thin sandy clay layer is the general characteristics of the far northern districts of the study area dphe 2010 fig 2 supplementary fig 3 so recharge from rainfall can occur with much ease in these aquifers compared to the aquifers in barind tract 4 3 current water storage status of the aquifers bangladesh mostly comprises alluvial sediments of three major rivers the ganges brahmaputra and meghna the main alluvial aquifers of the country consist primarily of sand with layers of clay and silt with very often an upper silty clay layer miah and rushton 1997 nowreen et al 2020 fig 2 although there are scopes of significant potential recharge during monsoon period the upper silty clay layer limits water entry into the main aquifers to a large extent miah and rushton 1997 in contrast the thick clay layer overlying the aquifer in the barind tract greatly restricts although not entirely prevents recharge from the surface sources the rainfall gwl response phenomena associated with higher lag period in the barind tract compared to other area table 1 fig 6 clearly demonstrate occurrence of at least some recharge from rainfall as opposed to most often perceived despite evidence of occurring both recharge deficit in some years and recharge rejection in the other years in the barind tract intensive groundwater withdrawals are causing gwl to decline gradually over the past years shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 ali et al 2012 haque et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 with a net reduction in groundwater storage in the aquifers land use and land cover changes might also influence gwl agricultural development e g irrigation expansion may be a dominant cause of extensive changes in land use and land cover and decline in gwl at many regions in the world scanlon et al 2005 expansion in irrigation over the past 3 to 4 decades associated with increased pumping of groundwater in the nw region of bangladesh might cause decline in gwl with resulting increase in the lag period also increased impervious surfaces e g roofs or roads resulting from expanded urbanization can reduce the natural infiltration with resulting decline in gwl however urbanization reduces evapotranspiration by reducing the amount of vegetation with a possibility of increase in recharge minning et al 2018 mustafa et al 2017 by estimating changes in land cover between the year 1990 and 2010 and evaluating their influence on groundwater recharge in the nw region of bangladesh obtained only insignificant effects of land cover changes on the large basin scale in addition to higher net water extraction there is reduced recharge due to an observed decline 20 in rainfall pena arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or due to a combination of these two factors these opposing factors of the dynamic groundwater resource have been causing reduced long term safe yield of the aquifer rushton et al 2020 shamsudduha et al 2009 and indicating groundwater withdrawal in excess of the aquifer s sustainable limit it is noted that this non equilibrium dynamism of groundwater resource is being encountered for high and level barind and a few sites in other area this problem is however not prevalent in most parts of other area the aquifers in most parts of other area being overlain by relatively thin silt clay layers fig 2 supplementary fig 3 have high recharge potential that if utilized fully can supply large quantities of groundwater interpretation of gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells in those areas revealed that the aquifers were fully replenished well before the end of monsoon in most of the years table 3 fig 9 and there was no more space in the aquifers to accommodate remaining rechargeable rainfall consequently a considerable part of the rechargeable rainfall that was rejected could be utilized to recharge the aquifer by creating more storage space by extracting groundwater during the dry season in areas with permeable surface geologies e g most parts of other area groundwater abstraction in dry season has been reported to induce greater recharge during the subsequent monsoon shamsudduha et al 2015 through increased capture of surface water although recharge deficits occurred at some sites in some years in other area the quantity is much lower evident in fig 11 during 1995 2004 and 2005 2016 periods and the years of deficit are also fewer in number evident in table 3 from the years of rejection than in high and level barind groundwater is characterized by an annual recharge discharge cycle in bangladesh thus groundwater being a renewable resource remains in dynamic equilibrium when gwl fully recovers to previous year s position during the subsequent monsoon a certain amount of decline in gwl in one year or in a few consecutive years as currently being occurred in some monitoring well sites may be regained in the subsequent monsoon s as long as the decline does not exceed potential recharge over a few years time span and as long as recharge rejection occurs in most of the years by taking this and the observed large quantity of annual rejected recharge into account further withdrawal of groundwater would be possible in most parts of other area sustainable development and preservation of groundwater resource largely depend on its proper management for which adequate knowledge on spatial variability of groundwater recharge is critically important moon et al 2004 the sustainability issue is linked to ensure usage of groundwater for an unlimited time without causing undesirable ecological economic or social penalties alley and leake 2004 the government of bangladesh plans to prevent declining gwl by reducing pumping of groundwater through adoption of farm scale water saving measures like improved irrigation delivery technologies e g canal lining buried pipe and agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying irrigation method conservation agricultural practices such as reduced or zero tillage the water saving measures may reduce the pumping volume of groundwater and associated cost by reducing evaporation from soil and water surfaces but if the actual evapotranspiration of crops does not change the net impact on groundwater reserve will be nil mainuddin et al 2020 water percolating below the crop fields is neither consumed by the plants nor is it lost from the groundwater irrigation system since it goes back to the underlying aquifer as return flow mainuddin et al 2020 rushton et al 2020 mojid and mainuddin 2021 while conservation agricultural practices reduce seepage and percolation there is no evidence that they reduce actual evapotranspiration of the crop ahmad et al 2007 perry and steduto 2017 the supposition behind the government s policy intervention to achieve sustainable groundwater irrigation is therefore unlikely to have any significant impact on declining gwl mainuddin et al 2020 groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water usage i e evapotranspiration in high and level barind and at a few sites in other area where the annual recharge is less than the net water usage needs to be reduced preferably by crop diversification in recent years the government is emphasizing surface water use through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water which have the potential to increase recharge and sustain groundwater irrigation in spite of continuously declining gwl in high and level barind and also in some locations in other area considerable amount of recharge rejection has been occurring in most of the years table 1 fig 9 so the provision of increasing recharge opportunity period by storing the available rechargeable water currently being rejected currently in surface storage can be very important towards increasing groundwater storage both in the barind tract and other area therefore a comprehensive rethinking of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the nw region is essential 5 conclusions the hydrological interaction between rainfall or surface sources of recharge and groundwater can reveal spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of groundwater this can guide making measurements at the appropriate scale and developing proper management policies for groundwater resources interpretation of long term in this study 32 years gwl hydrographs of monitoring wells total 137 revealed crucial information on recharge discharge dynamics of the aquifers gwl responded to a threshold minimum rainfall that varied both spatially and temporally at each monitoring well sites recharge deficit occurred in some years and recharge rejection in the other years the threshold rainfall was greater and lag period was longer in areas with thick clay layers overlying the aquifers e g in barind tract in the years with recharge rejection most of the rainfall occurring during monsoon july to september was rejected since the aquifers got fully replenished before rejection of recharge had started except in the clay overlain barind tract at many locations of the study region recharge rejection occurred in most of the years indicating further potential of groundwater withdrawal from the aquifers in the dry season despite clear evidence of continuously declining gwl the barind tract exhibited recharge rejection period in some years with considerable quantity of recharge rejection these incongruent results from the gwl s response to rainfall are in contrast to field observed recharge dynamics of the aquifer and clear indications of the presence of dominant recharge process es in the area other than from local rainfalls the results based on locally observed gwl data provide information on duration and quantity of recharge deficit and recharge rejection and their spatial and temporal variations such information derived for any groundwater basin is crucial in updating groundwater development program for the concerned region the strong point of the employed methodology is that rainfall and gwl hydrographs of the monitoring wells were inspected visually year by year on ms excel sheets and information picked up from the rationally target points on the hydrographs most of which were very often confounded with some non systematic data points this procedure provided information on real time measured data without any assumption or approximation the weak point was that the response of gwl was identified by considering only rainfall the major source of recharge for the study region although irrigation return flow and interflow had some contributions in recharging the aquifers future studies can take into account these recharge sources to identify recharge deficit and recharge rejection more precisely in the aquifers future research may also estimate percentage of rainfall that contributes groundwater recharge in different sub regions for various rainfall events to be used

lateral and vertical changes of resistivity values for the saturated and unsaturated subsurface layers of the quaternary aquifer this unique study tem method has been established as a successful technique to explore groundwater and environmental problems gonçalves et al 2017 the tem technique is illustrated in detail in several publications stewart and gay 1986 nabighian and macnae 1991 sharma 1997 and kanta et al 2013 compared to the other geophysical methods the tem method can determine the uppermost layer variations and display good quality data barsukov et al 2006 soupios et al

2 barsukov et al 2006 was used to invert tem data field measurements of loop size 25 25 m the maximum estimated depth for these measurements is 64 m while the minimum is 12 m this is based on the effect of the conductive layer on the depth of investigation which limits the current to flow into the deep subsurface layers the acquired tem soundings data sets across the study area were of good quality except for tem 9 sounding which was excluded due to recorded noise an initial model was chosen for each tem sounding according to the previous geological fig 1b and available lithology of the drilling wells in figure 2b the inversion results showed a realistic model fit with rms error ranging between 1 5 and 6 0 figure 3a and b displays an example of the inversion result of tem 29 with the lithological description of each layer based on the drilling wells such as well 27 at tem 29 and previous geological work of the study area the results of the inverted tem measurements reveal five layers except at some tem sounding s location have six layers the weathered layer is of higher resistivity and extends to about 28 m at tem 29 the heterogeneity of the first three layers reflected the natural of unsaturated sediments as expected from the previous hydrogeological work on the study area the results clarify that the distinguished decrease of resistivity value 70 ωm of the fourth layer coincides with the measured groundwater level all over the investigated area the inverted model ends with two conductive layers at depth 39 m of resistivity of 48 and 2 3 ωm respectively attributed to brackish saline water interface 2d electromagnetic cross sections were generated from selecting several inverted tem soundings the tem cross sections a a b b and c c run parallel to the gulf of suez as indicated in figure 2a by the blue dashed lines the constructed cross sections interpretations depend on the available drilling wells obtained data with the geological and hydrogeological previous work four main layers are detected 1 the first two surficial layers of resistivity ranges from 50 to 120 ωm reddish color are corresponding to the unsaturated alluvial deposits fig 4 2 a layer with resistivity band varies from 20 to 70 ωm pale yellow to orange color it corresponds to water bearing zone of partially to full saturated alluvial sand this zone is intercalated in some localities with clay layer s and is saturated with fresh brackish water tem 27 closes to well 28 at cross section a a tem 29 closes to well 27 at cross section b b and tem 30 closes to well 34 and tem 18 at cross section c c this zone is represented the good water potentiality depends on the measured resistivity values and the available drilling wells 3 a layer with a resistivity value ranges between 7 and 20 ω m green color this layer is located as zones along the three cross sections with thicknesses differ between 2 and 20 m this zone may be composed of alluvial sand and silt saturated with brackish to saline water as displayed at cross section a à under tem 21 and 26 cross section b b below tem 23 and 36 and at cross section c c at tem 18 these results found a good agreement between tem analysis and groundwater level that ranges from 0 to 4 2 m as well as salinity obtained from the available wells overall the study area 4 a zone of very low resistive sediments 2 ωm blue color this zone has appeared at a depth from 7 m near coastal plain to 34 m below sea level dashed yellow line representing the brackish saline water interface as shown in figure 4 the observed conductive zone saline water clay along the three parallel cross sections is noticed close to the coastal plain of the gulf on the other hand fig 5 shows three cross sections d d e e and f f are conducted crossing the gulf of suez to complement the aquifer causes salinization in the study area figure 2a shows the location of the cross sections by black dashed lines these cross sections illustrated 5 to 6 layers the surface layer weathered layer represents by alluvial deposits with a resistivity ranging from 7 to up to 120 ωm and with a maximum thickness of approximately 6 m at tem 27 along e e cross section and minimum thickness 1 1 m at tem 7 and 17 along d d and f f cross sections respectively the first geoelectrical layer along the two cross sections d d and f f northern and southern is represented by unsaturated sand and silt deposits the thickness of this layer ranges from 5 5 to 7 m below this weathered thin layer a layer with a thickness of 3 m has a resistivity value of 2 ωm this layer represents an evidence of the presence of clay intercalations saturated with saline water along the tem cross sections the resistivity of the last two layers decreases to 2 ωm which shows the evidence of seawater intrusion which extends to 1900 m in d d cross section at ras sudr basin and to 1600 m along f f cross section at ras matarma basin these two sites possess a lower groundwater potentiality due to the very low resistivity and high salinity values at wells 14 15 and 16 cross section f f the salinity values of these wells range from 7000 to 27 580 ppm and have relatively lower rbr rcl and rna rcl ratios indicating mixing with seawater and limited groundwater recharge in cross section e e fig 5b which runs at the middle part of the tem grid as shown in figure 2a the weathered layer composed of alluvial deposits with a minimum thickness of 1 3 m at tem 30 and a maximum thickness of 6 m at tem 27 the first and second layers of relatively high resistive 122 234 ωm sediments of unsaturated sand and silt followed by moderate resistivity sediments of saturated alluvial sand 25 71 ωm the intermediate resistivity layer is considered the brackish layer found under the resistive layers e e cross section shows a different resistivity behavior than the northern and southern cross sections where the depth to the brackish groundwater zone increases from the gulf of suez to the watershed area in the east direction the expected extension of the seawater intrusion is deduced from the tem cross section e e to be about 2200 m however at tem 29 and 30 the top of the conductive layer appears at a deeper depth around 60 m in the eastern region wells 27 and 34 at tem 29 and tem 30 respectively are considered strong evidence of good groundwater potentiality along tem cross section e e where the salinity record lower range 3000 4000 ppm figures 4 and 5 represent the circular diagram for rbr cl rso4 rcl rna rcl and hco3 were used as indicators and provide good insights into seawater mixing vengoush 2014 klassen et al 2014 the rbr rcl record relatively lower values while rna rcl and hco3 have higher values indicating promising subsurface groundwater recharge in these areas the single most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was the consistence between water levels from available water wells with water levels obtained from tem measurements both show fluctuating water level varies between 0 and 4 2 m a sl similarly el sayed et al 1999 and jica 1999 found that static water level in sudr area less than 4 m a sl figure 6a shows the iso resistivity contour map which illustrated the distribution of the resistivity of the water bearing layer overall the study area the depth of this layer is changed from location to location the average depth for this layer is approximately 15 m overall the study area and fig 6b shows the isopach contour map of the same layer which displayed the distribution of thickness overall the study area the depth to water bearing obtained from tem measurements is consistent with the depth to water obtained from available water wells esm 1 the water bearing depth increases towards inland east direction and ranges between 2 3 and 35 m fig 6 these maps show that resistivity and thickness values increase at the central part of the investigated area and decrease north and south figure 6d shows the tem cross section as a panel diagram in a 3d view with the available drilling wells to clarify how the seawater affects the study area 3 2 interpretation of 2deri transverse data the inverted 2deri of the four lines displayed two to three main zones the uppermost zone comprises alluvial deposits unsaturated zone and represents by a reddish to orange color the second zone is a thin sand layer of resistivity ranges from 67 to 129 ωm saturated zone and is illustrated by yellow to green color the blue color is considered the third zone of highly conductive layers brackish saline water zone typical of seawater intrusion into shallow quaternary aquifer these 2deri lines can significantly contrast the high resistivity layers from a more conductive layer on such coastal areas 3 2 1 2deri of line 1 line 1 was performed in the northern part of the investigated area and ran in the west east direction crossing tem1 fig 7a the length of its layout is 84 m with an interval of 2 m the unsaturated zone has resistivity up to 129 ω m with thickness ranges between 7 and 8 m the saturated layer is characterized by moderate resistivity value varies between 35 and 67 ωm with thickness ranges from 3 m at western part to 2 m in the eastern region the water level along this line decreases from east 1 m to west 0 5 m which validated that the groundwater flow is coming from the east the brackish layer is represented by different values of resistivity 9 18 ωm its thickness is 1 m at x distance 50 m where the western side of the line is 4 m and at the eastern side is 3 m the groundwater salinity along this line is 6494 2 ppm based on well 2 located close to a distance of 41 m the last layer is the alluvial sediments saturated with saline water where the resistivity varies from 4 to 9 ω m these resistivity values may illustrate the cause of salinization due to seawater intrusion into shallow aquifer the depth to the interface between brackish and saline water varies from 5 9 m at the eastern and western sides to 2 9 m at a distance of 50 m relative to sea level the higher salinity values of these wells and the relatively lower rbr rcl and rna rcl ratios indicating mixing with seawater and limited groundwater recharge in this part of the investigated area 3 2 2 2deri of line 2 and line 3 2deri of lines 2 and 3 were performed inside two farms in the middle portion of the studied area and ran in north south and northeast southwest directions the lines layout is 210 m with an interval spacing of 5 m fig 7b and c 2deri of line 2 passes by tem 34 and well 30 while line 3 passes by tem 29 and well 27 the depth to the water bearing zone obtained from both lines is about 16 and 26 m at lines 2 and 3 respectively which is in agreement with the depths to water obtained from wells 30 and 27 respectively at line 2 the unsaturated zone thickness ranges from 13 m on the southwestern side to 28 m on the northeastern side the resistivity of this zone similar to line 3 ranges within 129 ωm and up to 447 ωm the resistivity 50 ωm zone represents the saturated zone along the whole line at the southwestern side the freshwater zone is thinning to be 2 5 5 m followed by 15 m of brackish water zone of resistivity 9 18 ωm moreover at the northeastern side the freshwater zone has recorded a thickness of 20 m followed by a thin layer of brackish water and saline water of resistivity values 4 ωm on the other hand the unsaturated zone at line 3 is extended along the whole line with a variation in its thickness ranging from 22 m in the northern direction to 27 m in the southern direction the saturated zone is divided into two zones the first zone represents the fresh zone with a range of resistivity from 67 to 85 ωm and thickness from 5 to 10 m the second zone is considered the conductive zone brackish water clay of resistivity values of 9 18 ωm the geochemical analysis of wells 27 and 30 supports the results of two lines and validated the good potentiality of the groundwater where the water salinity value of well 27 is 2405 6 ppm and the water salinity value of well 30 is 4385 0 ppm in addition a circular diagram above each well for rbr cl rso4 rcl rna rcl and hco3 were used as indicators of seawater mixing the ratios of rbr rcl and rna rcl at well 27 and 30 are relatively higher indicating promising subsurface groundwater recharge in these areas 3 2 3 2deri of line 4 line 4 was conducted in the southern part of the study area ras matarma it takes the northeastern southwestern direction with a layout of 210 m with an interval of 5 m fig 7d the thickness of the unsaturated zone at this line ranges between 5 m at the southwestern side and 10 m at the northeastern side of the line and the resistivity value varies from 40 to up to 129 ωm the second zone represents the highly conductive layer s of low resistivity value 4 ωm this zone s depth is recorded at 5 5 m at the southwestern line 4 to 12 5 m at the northeastern side results show a clear trend of decreasing resistivity value to 4 ωm which may be due to the effect of seawater intrusion into the shallow aquifer the geochemical analysis coincided with this result as the water salinity of well 14 is approximately 27573 4 ppm it shows the relatively lower ratios of the rbr rcl and rna rcl indicating that mixing with seawater and groundwater s potentiality is limited the very low resistivity values and very high salinity values confirm the low quality and scarce groundwater potentiality at the ras matarma basin in conclusion the occurrences of seawater intrusion in the study area may explain the reasons for the salinization of most groundwater samples moreover the presence of alternating thin clay layers as seen in figure 4 at cross section b b under tem 36 at cross section c c at tem 18 and in figures 7a and d at lines 1 and 4 these factors permit the diffusion and mixing of seawater with fresh water at shallow coastal aquifers 3 3 groundwater chemistry and salinization origins 3 3 1 the groundwater salinity the hydrochemistry of groundwater aquifers can be significantly influenced by lithology geology topography and mixing with seawater at coastal aquifers su and wang 2013 the groundwater chemistry data gathered from 36 groundwater wells are presented in esm 1 and signified in figure 3b the expression salinity indicates the total dissolved constituents of minor and major ingredients in water generally the ph values of the water samples range from 6 5 to 8 3 which means that the groundwater is slightly alkaline where the minor increase of ph values could be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonate mineral deposits the concentricity of dissolved solutes can vary extensively as a means of the mineral gratified of the aquifer matrix via the groundwater flows consequences of the chemical investigation show high variations in the salinity of groundwater samples groundwater samples gathered from the study area were categorized into four groups agreeing with the groundwater salinity i ii iii and iv group i specifies a wide variety of water salinity where the total dissolved solids differ from 507 to 3920 mg l with an average of 2668 mg l indicating that water varies from fresh to brackish water types sites 37 12 36 8 11 27 10 38 32 39 34 31 28 and 33 located in the outlet front of sudr basin group ii has groundwater salinity extending from 4031 to 4717 mg l with an average of 4397 mg l sites 40 9 30 25 and 21 representing groundwater samples at the front of the wardan basin group i and group ii s high salinity values reflect the amount of water rock interactions where leaching and dissolution of carbonate rocks is a vigorous procedure in such methods group iii has a salinity ranging from 5144 to 6771 mg l with an average of 5815 mg l sites 19 20 18 24 13 3 2 and 1 group iv has groundwater salinity varies from 7452 to 27 573 mg l with an average 13 710 mg l sites 29 23 6 22 4 16 17 15 and 14 the group iii and iv were located near the gulf of suez area and at the outlet of the matarma basin the higher salinity at this site is mainly attributed to mixing due to the upwelling of the underneath seawater due to over pumping this agrees with the finding results obtained from the tem figs 5 7 and 2d eri fig 8 group i and ii are located within the thick brackish zones while group iii and iv are dislocated in the terminal thin brackish and thick saline zones recorded at matarma and the northern portion of the investigated area the order of the plenty of the major cations is na ca mg 92 and the rest is ca na mg 8 while the plenty of the major anions is cl so4 hco3 50 and so4 cl hco3 47 and hco3 cl so4 3 of groundwater samples esm 1 based on the dominant cation and anion four hypothetical salt assemblages characterize the groundwater in the investigated area the ca hco3 na so4 caso4 dominate promising recharge areas and are characterized by a thick brackish zone sudr and wardan basins while nacl dominates thick saline and thin brackish zones esm 1 3 3 2 spatial distribution of major ions and equivalent minerals dissolved major ions in water create the majority of total groundwater salinity fig 8 ca2 na mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in addition to the equivalent saturation indices si of dolomite calcite gypsum and halite esm 1 displays confident relationships with the representative aquifer salinity fig 8a f the groundwater samples appointing the examined aquifer are plotted among the recharge seawater and rainwater samples indicating two mixing end members these anions and cations are existent in measurable quantities and govern their physical and chemical characteristics the water samples could be categorized into four individual groups fig 8 group i and group ii include groundwater samples with lower mg ca na and so4 in fig 8 groups i and ii are plotted close to the rainwater representing the groundwater developed due to leaching and dissolution procedures of the aquifer matrix with the meteoric recharge water in contrast groups iii and iv are plotted close to the gulf area due to mixing with the marine origin underneath the deep saline layer the ca2 and mg2 ions occur in co3 such as limestone and dolomite respectively the mg2 is abundant in rocks and soil containing limestone dolomites and gypsum comes from the eocene marine limestone and chert and miocene carbonate rocks extended alongside the gulf of suez in the study region fig 3a abdel latif and al temamy 2008 the relationships between ca and mg versus hco3 show the groundwater s ph values mainly control them where dissolution increased with higher ph values figs 8 a h the dissolved na and k ions in groundwater are generated from the silicate minerals orthoclase microcline and feldspars embedded in the extrusive basalt dolerite dykes upstream watershed fig 1b an aqueous explanation was generated by the netpath model plummer et al 1992 the saturation index si is extensively used as a pointer of hydrochemical procedures influencing water chemistry langmuir 1997 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 li et al 2010 the impacts of water rock interfaces and mixing with diverse waters were observed via computing the si values of carbonate minerals dolomite and calcite halite and sulfate mineral gypsum in figs 8 a h the si 0 line is highlighted by a red dashed color to distinct the saturated and unsaturated contour areas the outcomes display that almost all the water samples were oversaturated with calcite and dolomite indicating that more these minerals dissolve in a slightly acidic character where dissolution is mainly controlled with the ph value the saturation values of carbonate minerals are usually associated with increasing ca2 or mg2 and hco3 concentrations and ph value where co2 interacts with the rainwater to create the hco3 ions and leaching of co3 materials hem 1989 all groundwater samples are unsaturated with halite advising that their soluble constituent na and cl are not limited by mineral equilibrium the values of si show most groundwater samples 80 are unsaturated with sulfate mineral gypsum fig 8 a h the unsaturation is mostly ascribed to recharge replacements via the upstream watersheds of the studied aquifer therefore halite and gypsum s spatial distribution can give insights into the main salinization and recharge sources groundwater samples from the investigated aquifer at the downstream portions of sudr and wardan basins have relatively lower sis of halite and gypsum indicating replenishments and promising subsurface recharge from the upstream watersheds figs 9a and b lower saturation zones represent the thick brackish groundwater zones and coincide with the geophysical finding results indicated in figures 4 6 on the other hand higher sis values indicate the scarcest of recharge close to the coastal zone and the matarma basin due to mixing with deep saline groundwater and over pumping 3 3 3 hydrochemical facies piper diagram piper 1953 shows the comparative confirmation of groundwater in expressions of the cation anion combines related to the salinity category the major ion chemistry of water in the study region is revealed via the piper graph to estimate the chemical water types and the chemical character of natural waters the areas affected by mixing with a different water source fig 10a the chemical configuration of water samples gathered from the study area is categorized into four groups based on the major ion data group i ii and iii categorized as calcium chloride ca cl water kind and which signifies the most water samples in the study region excluding sites 37 is deliberated a subset of the group i categorized mainly as mg cl water type the ca cl and mg cl water types indicate leaching of the aquifer matrix of marine pledges of the eocene and miocene marine limestone and chert rock fragments embedded in the alluvial deposits group iv has na cl and mg cl water types located close to the coast and dominates scarce recharge areas located at the recharge zone terminals the rest of the water samples located in the section of alkaline elements surpasses alkaline earth and strong anions surpass weak acid anion replicating a sodium chloride na cl water kind na cl water type represents the northern matarma and southern portion of the investigated region due to the scarce natural recharge the impact of upwelling of deep saline water and mixing with underneath deep saline water has been recorded at shallow depth the tem and eri indicate a thin layer of brackish groundwater and shallow saline groundwater at these areas figs 4 6 reactions among water and aquifer minerals have an essential service on water excellence which is too beneficial to assess the origin of groundwater cederstorm 1946 as revealed previously groundwater chemistry in the investigated area is controlled via various procedures and mechanisms the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been utilized to examine the source of groundwater salinization in the study area fig 10b moreover processes controlling water chemistry dissolution evaporation and mixing were evaluated by the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 where water has schemed among the two end associates rainwater characterizes the highest recharge source for groundwater and seawater exemplifies groundwater mixing subsequently the study area involves an arid and semiarid circumstance therefore evaporation may also participate in water chemistry in the area under consideration in figure 10b groundwater samples group i and group ii that fall close to the rainwater sample and in the precipitation evaporation and rock dominance contrivances are located downstream of sudr and wardan basins close to the promising recharge zone group iii and group iv have been schemed nearly the seawater indicating seawater mixing 3 3 4 impact of rock water interaction and seawater intrusion ion molar ratio against is generally used to estimate seawater s impact on groundwater mthembu et al 2020 abu alnaeem et al 2018 seddique et al 2019 tiwari et al 2019 the na cl

groundwater samples fall nearby the seawater fraction owing to saline water mixing the majority of groundwater samples are schemed under and overhead the seawater fraction signifying that groundwater is affected by saline water the cl hco3 fraction is extensively utilized to observe groundwater salinization owing to seawater yohana et al 2013 kanagaraj et al 2018 the cl hco3 fraction can be categorized into three classes unaffected 0 5 moderately or slightly exaggerated 0 6 6 6 and strongly exaggerated 6 6 via salinization procedure revelle 1941 in the investigated region the cl hco3 ratio ranged from 1 to 136 with an average of 29 fig 11b this shows that all water samples are strongly affected by seawater intrusion a scheme of so4 cl against cl with values above 0 1 suggests that seawater does not influence groundwater and samples with values lower than 0 1 are affected by seawater intrusion in the investigated area the so4 cl proportion ranged from 0 23 to 1 99 with an average of 0 8 fig 11c all groundwater samples had so4 cl quantity superior to 0 1 proposing that they are not polluted by seawater completely water samples were mostly influenced by seawater interference the ec and cl br against cl s distribution graph indicates that all groundwater samples of group iii and group iv fall in the seawater zone fig 11d the van wirdum diagram provides a corresponding vision of the influence of water rock interfaces on groundwater mineralization besides the diverse salinization source geneses fig 11c this kind of graph tells the ionic fraction ir ca2 ca2 cl with concentricity stated in meq l schemed in contradiction of the tds mg l of the groundwater birke et al 2010 tanaskovic et al 2012 the ir showed the existence of ca2 amongst the cations and cl amongst the anions the groundwater samples can be categorized seeing two end associates recharge groundwater i e rainwater and seawater figure 11f displays that all groundwater samples have schemed among the recharged groundwater and seawater end associates those samples near the rainwater end member represent group i ii and iii that should be more influenced by the recharge meteoric water and evolution due to the rock water interaction at the downstream portion of delta sudr and wardan basins 4 conclusions in this research geophysical and geochemical techniques have been integrated to detect the promising zones for groundwater recharge in the arid coastal region the quaternary investigated aquifer located in the area between ras sudr and matarma is ill constraint hydrogeologic aquifer data therefore the property being measured are tem and 2deri related to the geochemical features in the quaternary coastal aquifer the performed geophysical measurements tem and 2deri are consistent with the geochemical finding results of the quaternary groundwater the geophysical data provided good insights into the higher resistive subsurface zones of good groundwater quality and detected the lower resistive seawater encroachment the geochemical results reveal that groundwater at the well field area in the downstream portion of sudr and wardan basins showed fresh brackish groundwater type the geophysical techniques configure the fresh brackish groundwater zone that appears as a lenticular shape of lower dense groundwater floating over deeper saline water this zone is characterized by higher resistivity lower groundwater salinity the groundwater has mainly evolved due to the water rock interaction and dissolution process the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer downstream of the matarma basin records lower resistivity and higher groundwater salinity the groundwater in this region is essentially deteriorated probably due to seawater intrusion it is concluded that the declining of the groundwater level 0 4 2 m is mainly due to the aridity of the study area coincided with the over groundwater withdrawal the current integrated approach reflects the vulnerability of groundwater and with the recent intensive expansion of groundwater excavation for agriculture and touristic purposes a continual monitoring program and modelling is highly recommended

floating over deeper saline groundwater with a very low resistivity range 0 8 5 8 ωm the relatively moderate to higher resistivity of the fresh brackish groundwater zone recorded in the eastern side at the downstream portion of the study area indicates promising subsurface recharge the thickness of this zone ranges from 4 to 24 m groundwater group i 507 tds 3920 mg l groundwater group ii 4031 tds 4717 mg l while the lower resistivity values characterize the northern and southern portions of higher groundwater salinity group iii 5144 tds 6771 mg l group iv 7452 tds 27573 mg l suggesting mixing with deeper saline seawater and intercalations of clay sheets regarding water quality it is recommended to excavate the groundwater only for the freshwater brackish zone to avoid up conning of deep

2 barsukov et al 2006 was used to invert tem data field measurements of loop size 25 25 m the maximum estimated depth for these measurements is 64 m while the minimum is 12 m this is based on the effect of the conductive layer on the depth of investigation which limits the current to flow into the deep subsurface layers the acquired tem soundings data sets across the study area were of good quality except for tem 9 sounding which was excluded due to recorded noise an initial model was chosen for each tem sounding according to the previous geological fig 1b and available lithology of the drilling wells in figure 2b the inversion results showed a realistic model fit with rms error ranging between 1 5 and 6 0 figure 3a and b displays an example of the inversion result of tem 29 with the lithological description of each layer based on the drilling wells such as well 27 at tem 29 and previous geological work of the study area the results of the inverted tem measurements reveal five layers except at some tem sounding s location have six layers the weathered layer is of higher resistivity and extends to about 28 m at tem 29 the heterogeneity of the first three layers reflected the natural of unsaturated sediments as expected from the previous hydrogeological work on the study area the results clarify that the distinguished decrease of resistivity value 70 ωm of the fourth layer coincides with the measured groundwater level all over the investigated area the inverted model ends with two conductive layers at depth 39 m of resistivity of 48 and 2 3 ωm respectively attributed to brackish saline water interface 2d electromagnetic cross sections were generated from selecting several inverted tem soundings the tem cross sections a a b b and c c run parallel to the gulf of suez as indicated in figure 2a by the blue dashed lines the constructed cross sections interpretations depend on the available drilling wells obtained data with the geological and hydrogeological previous work four main layers are detected 1 the first two surficial layers of resistivity ranges from 50 to 120 ωm reddish color are corresponding to the unsaturated alluvial deposits fig 4 2 a layer with resistivity band varies from 20 to 70 ωm pale yellow to orange color it corresponds to water bearing zone of partially to full saturated alluvial sand this zone is intercalated in some localities with clay layer s and is saturated with fresh brackish water tem 27 closes to well 28 at cross section a a tem 29 closes to well 27 at cross section b b and tem 30 closes to well 34 and tem 18 at cross section c c this zone is represented the good water potentiality depends on the measured resistivity values and the available drilling wells 3 a layer with a resistivity value ranges between 7 and 20 ω m green color this layer is located as zones along the three cross sections with thicknesses differ between 2 and 20 m this zone may be composed of alluvial sand and silt saturated with brackish to saline water as displayed at cross section a à under tem 21 and 26 cross section b b below tem 23 and 36 and at cross section c c at tem 18 these results found a good agreement between tem analysis and groundwater level that ranges from 0 to 4 2 m as well as salinity obtained from the available wells overall the study area 4 a zone of very low resistive sediments 2 ωm blue color this zone has appeared at a depth from 7 m near coastal plain to 34 m below sea level dashed yellow line representing the brackish saline water interface as shown in figure 4 the observed conductive zone saline

of suez to complement the aquifer causes salinization in the study area figure 2a shows the location of the cross sections by black dashed lines these cross sections illustrated 5 to 6 layers the surface layer weathered layer represents by alluvial deposits with a resistivity ranging from 7 to up to 120 ωm and with a maximum thickness of approximately 6 m at tem 27 along e e cross section and minimum thickness 1 1 m at tem 7 and 17 along d d and f f cross sections respectively the first geoelectrical layer along the two cross sections d d and f f northern and southern is represented by unsaturated sand and silt deposits the thickness of this layer ranges from 5 5 to 7 m below this weathered thin layer a layer with a thickness of 3 m has a resistivity value of 2 ωm this layer represents an evidence of the presence of clay intercalations saturated with saline water along the tem cross sections the resistivity of the last two layers decreases to 2 ωm which shows the evidence of seawater intrusion which extends to 1900 m in d d cross section at ras sudr basin and to 1600 m along f f cross section at ras matarma basin these two sites possess a lower groundwater potentiality due to the very low resistivity and high salinity values at wells 14 15 and 16 cross section f f the salinity values of these wells range from 7000 to 27 580 ppm and have relatively lower rbr rcl and rna rcl ratios indicating mixing with seawater and limited groundwater recharge in cross section e e fig 5b which runs at the middle part of the tem grid as shown in figure 2a the weathered layer composed of alluvial deposits with a minimum thickness of 1 3 m at tem 30 and a maximum thickness of 6 m at tem 27 the first and second layers of relatively high resistive 122 234 ωm sediments of unsaturated sand and silt followed by moderate resistivity sediments of saturated alluvial sand 25 71 ωm the intermediate resistivity layer is considered the brackish layer found under the resistive layers e e cross section shows a different resistivity behavior than the northern and southern cross sections where the depth to the brackish groundwater zone increases from the gulf of suez to the watershed area in the east direction the expected extension of the seawater intrusion is deduced from the tem cross section e e to be about 2200 m however at tem 29 and 30 the top of the conductive layer appears at a deeper depth around 60 m in the eastern region wells 27 and 34 at tem 29 and tem 30 respectively are considered strong evidence of good groundwater potentiality along tem cross section e e where the salinity record lower range 3000 4000 ppm figures 4 and 5 represent the circular diagram for rbr cl rso4 rcl rna rcl and hco3 were used as indicators and provide good insights into seawater mixing vengoush 2014 klassen et al 2014 the rbr rcl record relatively lower values while rna rcl and hco3 have higher values indicating promising subsurface groundwater recharge in these areas the single most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was the consistence between water levels from available water wells with water levels obtained from tem measurements both show fluctuating water level varies between 0 and 4 2 m a sl similarly el sayed et al 1999 and jica 1999 found that static water level in sudr area less than 4 m a sl figure 6a shows the iso resistivity contour map which illustrated the distribution of the resistivity of the water bearing layer overall the study area the depth of this layer is changed from location to location the average depth for this layer is approximately 15 m overall the study area and fig 6b shows the isopach contour map of the same layer which displayed the distribution of thickness overall the study area the depth to water bearing obtained from tem measurements is consistent with the depth to water obtained from available water wells esm 1 the water bearing depth increases towards inland east direction and ranges between 2 3 and 35 m fig 6 these maps show that resistivity and thickness values increase at the central part of the investigated area and decrease north and south figure 6d shows the tem cross section as a panel diagram in a 3d view with the available drilling wells to clarify how the seawater affects the study area 3 2 interpretation of 2deri transverse data the inverted 2deri of the four lines displayed two to three main zones the uppermost zone comprises alluvial deposits unsaturated zone and represents by a reddish to orange color the second zone is a thin sand layer of resistivity ranges from 67 to 129 ωm saturated zone and is illustrated by yellow to green color the blue color is considered the third zone of highly conductive layers brackish saline water zone typical of seawater intrusion into shallow quaternary aquifer these 2deri lines can significantly contrast the high resistivity layers from a more conductive layer on such coastal areas 3 2 1 2deri of line 1 line 1 was performed in the northern part of the investigated area and ran in the west east direction crossing tem1 fig 7a the length of its layout is 84 m with an interval of 2 m the unsaturated zone has resistivity up to 129 ω m with thickness ranges between 7 and 8 m the saturated layer is characterized by moderate resistivity value varies between 35 and 67 ωm with thickness ranges from 3 m at western part to 2 m in the eastern region the water level along this line decreases from east 1 m to west 0 5 m which validated that the groundwater flow is coming from the east the brackish layer is represented by different values of resistivity 9 18 ωm its thickness is 1 m at x distance 50 m where the western side of the line is 4 m and at the eastern side is 3 m the groundwater salinity along this line is 6494 2 ppm based on well 2 located close to a distance of 41 m the last layer is the alluvial sediments saturated with saline water where the resistivity varies from 4 to 9 ω m these resistivity values may illustrate the cause of salinization due to seawater intrusion into shallow aquifer the depth to the interface between brackish and saline water varies from 5 9 m at the eastern and western sides to 2 9 m at a distance of 50 m relative to sea level the higher salinity values of these wells and the relatively lower rbr rcl and rna rcl ratios indicating mixing with seawater and limited groundwater recharge in this part of the investigated area 3 2 2 2deri of line 2 and line 3 2deri of lines 2 and 3 were performed inside two farms in the middle portion of the studied area and ran in north south and northeast southwest directions the lines layout is 210 m with an interval spacing of 5 m fig 7b and c 2deri of line 2 passes by tem 34 and well 30 while line 3 passes by tem 29 and well 27 the depth to the water bearing zone obtained from both lines is about 16 and 26 m at lines 2 and 3 respectively which is in agreement with the depths to water obtained from wells 30 and 27 respectively at line 2 the unsaturated zone thickness ranges from 13 m on the southwestern side to 28 m on the northeastern side the resistivity of this zone similar to line 3 ranges within 129 ωm and up to 447 ωm the resistivity 50 ωm zone represents the saturated zone along the whole line at the southwestern side the freshwater zone is thinning to be 2 5 5 m followed by 15 m of brackish water zone of resistivity 9 18 ωm moreover at the northeastern side the freshwater zone has recorded a thickness of 20 m followed by a thin layer of brackish water and saline water of resistivity values 4 ωm on the other hand the unsaturated zone at line 3 is extended along the whole line with a variation in its thickness ranging from 22 m in the northern direction to 27 m in the southern direction the saturated zone is divided into two zones the first zone represents the fresh zone with a range of resistivity from 67 to 85 ωm and thickness from 5 to 10 m the second zone is considered the conductive zone brackish water clay of resistivity values of 9 18 ωm the geochemical analysis of wells 27 and 30 supports the results of two lines and validated the good potentiality of the groundwater where the water salinity value of well 27 is 2405 6 ppm and the water salinity value of well 30 is 4385 0 ppm in addition a circular diagram above each well for rbr cl rso4 rcl rna rcl and hco3 were used as indicators of seawater mixing the ratios of rbr rcl and rna rcl at well 27 and 30 are relatively higher indicating promising subsurface groundwater recharge in these areas 3 2 3 2deri of line 4 line 4 was conducted in the southern part of the study area ras matarma it takes the northeastern southwestern direction with a layout of 210 m with an interval of 5 m fig 7d the thickness of the unsaturated zone at this line ranges between 5 m at the southwestern side and 10 m at the northeastern side of the line and the resistivity value varies from 40 to up to 129 ωm the second zone represents the highly conductive layer s of low resistivity value 4 ωm this zone s depth is recorded at 5 5 m at the southwestern line 4 to 12 5 m at the northeastern side results show a clear trend of decreasing resistivity value to 4 ωm which may be due to the effect of seawater intrusion into the shallow aquifer the geochemical analysis coincided with this result as the water salinity of well 14 is approximately 27573 4 ppm it shows the relatively lower ratios of the rbr rcl and rna rcl indicating that mixing with seawater and groundwater s potentiality is limited the very low resistivity values and very high salinity values confirm the low quality and scarce groundwater potentiality at the ras matarma basin in conclusion the occurrences of seawater intrusion in the study area may explain the reasons for the salinization of most groundwater samples moreover the presence of alternating thin clay layers as seen in figure 4 at cross section b b under tem 36 at cross section c c at tem 18 and in figures 7a and d at lines 1 and 4 these factors permit the diffusion and mixing of seawater with fresh water at shallow coastal aquifers 3 3 groundwater chemistry and salinization origins 3 3 1 the groundwater salinity the hydrochemistry of groundwater aquifers can be significantly influenced by lithology geology topography and mixing with seawater at coastal aquifers su and wang 2013 the groundwater chemistry data gathered from 36 groundwater wells are presented in esm 1 and signified in figure 3b the expression salinity indicates the total dissolved constituents of minor and major ingredients in water generally the ph values of the water samples range from 6 5 to 8 3 which means that the groundwater is slightly alkaline where the minor increase of ph values could be ascribed to the dissolution of carbonate mineral deposits the concentricity of dissolved solutes can vary extensively as a means of the mineral gratified of the aquifer matrix via the groundwater flows consequences of the chemical investigation show high variations in the salinity of groundwater samples groundwater samples gathered from the study area were categorized into four groups agreeing with the groundwater salinity i ii iii and iv group i specifies a wide variety of water salinity where the total dissolved solids differ from 507 to 3920 mg l with an average of 2668 mg l indicating that water varies from fresh to brackish water types sites 37 12 36 8 11 27 10 38 32 39 34 31 28 and 33 located in the outlet front of sudr basin group ii has groundwater salinity extending from 4031 to 4717 mg l with an average of 4397 mg l sites 40 9 30 25 and 21 representing groundwater samples at the front of the wardan basin group i and group ii s high salinity values reflect the amount of water rock interactions where leaching and dissolution of carbonate rocks is a vigorous procedure in such methods group iii has a salinity ranging from 5144 to 6771 mg l with an average of 5815 mg l sites 19 20 18 24 13 3 2 and 1 group iv has groundwater salinity varies from 7452 to 27 573 mg l with an average 13 710 mg l sites 29 23 6 22 4 16 17 15 and 14 the group iii and iv were located near the gulf of suez area and at the outlet of the matarma basin the higher salinity at this site is mainly attributed to mixing due to the upwelling of the underneath seawater due to over pumping this agrees with the finding results obtained from the tem figs 5 7 and 2d eri fig 8 group i and ii are located within the thick brackish zones while group iii and iv are dislocated in the terminal thin brackish and thick saline zones recorded at matarma and the northern portion of the investigated area the order of the plenty of the major cations is na ca mg 92 and the rest is ca na mg 8 while the plenty of the major anions is cl so4 hco3 50 and so4 cl hco3 47 and hco3 cl so4 3 of groundwater samples esm 1 based on the dominant cation and anion four hypothetical salt assemblages characterize the groundwater in the investigated area the ca hco3 na so4 caso4 dominate promising recharge areas and are characterized by a thick brackish zone sudr and wardan basins while nacl dominates thick saline and thin brackish zones esm 1 3 3 2 spatial distribution of major ions and equivalent minerals dissolved major ions in water create the majority of total groundwater salinity fig 8 ca2 na mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in addition to the equivalent saturation indices si of dolomite calcite gypsum and halite esm 1 displays confident relationships with the representative aquifer salinity fig 8a f the groundwater samples appointing the examined aquifer are plotted among the recharge seawater and rainwater samples indicating two mixing end members these anions and cations are existent in measurable quantities and govern their physical and chemical characteristics the water samples could be categorized into four individual groups fig 8 group i and group ii include groundwater samples with lower mg ca na and so4 in fig 8 groups i and ii are plotted close to the rainwater representing the groundwater developed due to leaching and dissolution procedures of the aquifer matrix with the meteoric recharge water in contrast groups iii and iv are plotted close to the gulf area due to mixing with the marine origin underneath the deep saline layer the ca2 and mg2 ions occur in co3 such as limestone and dolomite respectively the mg2 is abundant in rocks and soil containing limestone dolomites and gypsum comes from the eocene marine limestone and chert and miocene carbonate rocks extended alongside the gulf of suez in the study region fig 3a abdel latif and al temamy 2008 the relationships between ca and mg versus hco3 show the groundwater s ph values mainly control them where dissolution increased with higher ph values figs 8 a h the dissolved na and k ions in groundwater are generated from the silicate minerals orthoclase microcline and feldspars embedded in the extrusive basalt dolerite dykes upstream watershed fig 1b an aqueous explanation was generated by the netpath model plummer et al 1992 the saturation index si is extensively used as a pointer of hydrochemical procedures influencing water chemistry langmuir 1997 coetsiers and walraevens 2006 li et al 2010 the impacts of water rock interfaces and mixing with diverse waters were observed via computing the si values of carbonate minerals dolomite and calcite halite and sulfate mineral gypsum in figs 8 a h the si 0 line is highlighted by a red dashed color to distinct the saturated and unsaturated contour areas the outcomes display that almost all the water samples were oversaturated with calcite and dolomite indicating that more these minerals dissolve in a slightly acidic character where dissolution is mainly controlled with the ph value the saturation values of carbonate minerals are usually associated with increasing ca2 or mg2 and hco3 concentrations and ph value where co2 interacts with the rainwater to create the hco3 ions and leaching of co3 materials hem 1989 all groundwater samples are unsaturated with halite advising that their soluble constituent na and cl are not limited by mineral equilibrium the values of si show most groundwater samples 80 are unsaturated with sulfate mineral gypsum fig 8 a h the unsaturation is mostly ascribed to recharge replacements via the upstream watersheds of the studied aquifer therefore halite and gypsum s spatial distribution can give insights into the main salinization and recharge sources groundwater samples from the investigated aquifer at the downstream portions of sudr and wardan basins have relatively lower sis of halite and gypsum indicating replenishments and promising subsurface recharge from the upstream watersheds figs 9a and b lower saturation zones represent the thick brackish groundwater zones and coincide with the geophysical finding results indicated in figures 4 6 on the other hand higher sis values indicate the scarcest of recharge close to the coastal zone and the matarma basin due to mixing with deep saline groundwater and over pumping 3 3 3 hydrochemical facies piper diagram piper 1953 shows the comparative confirmation of groundwater in expressions of the cation anion combines related to the salinity category the major ion chemistry of water in the study region is revealed via the piper graph to estimate the chemical water types and the chemical character of natural waters the areas affected by mixing with a different water source fig 10a the chemical configuration of water samples gathered from the study area is categorized into four groups based on the major ion data group i ii and iii categorized as calcium chloride ca cl water kind and which signifies the most water samples in the study region excluding sites 37 is deliberated a subset of the group i categorized mainly as mg cl water type the ca cl and mg cl water types indicate leaching of the aquifer matrix of marine pledges of the eocene and miocene marine limestone and chert rock fragments embedded in the alluvial deposits group iv has na cl and mg cl water types located close to the coast and dominates scarce recharge areas located at the recharge zone terminals the rest of the water samples located in the section of alkaline elements surpasses alkaline earth and strong anions surpass weak acid anion replicating a sodium chloride na cl water kind na cl water type represents the northern matarma and southern portion of the investigated region due to the scarce natural recharge the impact of upwelling of deep saline water and mixing with underneath deep saline water has been recorded at shallow depth the tem and eri indicate a thin layer of brackish groundwater and shallow saline groundwater at these areas figs 4 6 reactions among water and aquifer minerals have an essential service on water excellence which is too beneficial to assess the origin of groundwater cederstorm 1946 as revealed previously groundwater chemistry in the investigated area is controlled via various procedures and mechanisms the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been utilized to examine the source of groundwater salinization in the study area fig 10b moreover processes controlling water chemistry dissolution evaporation and mixing were evaluated by the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 where water has schemed among the two end associates rainwater characterizes the highest recharge source for groundwater and seawater exemplifies groundwater mixing subsequently the study area involves an arid and semiarid circumstance therefore evaporation may also participate in water chemistry in the area under consideration in figure 10b groundwater samples group i and group ii that fall close to the rainwater sample and in the precipitation evaporation and rock dominance contrivances are located downstream of sudr and wardan basins close to the promising recharge zone group iii and group iv have been schemed nearly the seawater indicating seawater mixing 3 3 4 impact of rock water interaction and seawater intrusion ion molar ratio against is generally used to estimate seawater s impact on groundwater mthembu et al 2020 abu alnaeem et al 2018 seddique et al 2019 tiwari et al 2019 the na cl fraction closer to the seawater fraction 0 86 proposes that groundwater is polluted via seawater figure 11a showed that the na cl fraction varied from 0 49 to 2 1 with an average of 0 89 some groundwater samples fall nearby the seawater fraction owing to saline water mixing the majority of groundwater samples are schemed under and overhead the seawater fraction signifying that groundwater is affected by saline water the cl hco3 fraction is extensively utilized to observe groundwater salinization owing to seawater yohana et al 2013 kanagaraj et al 2018 the cl hco3 fraction can be categorized into three classes unaffected 0 5 moderately or slightly exaggerated 0 6 6 6 and strongly exaggerated 6 6 via salinization procedure revelle 1941 in the investigated region the cl hco3 ratio ranged from 1 to 136 with an average of 29 fig 11b this shows that all water samples are strongly affected by seawater intrusion a scheme of so4 cl against cl with values above 0 1 suggests that seawater does not influence groundwater and samples with values lower than 0 1 are affected by seawater intrusion in the investigated area the so4 cl proportion ranged from 0 23 to 1 99 with an average of 0 8 fig 11c all groundwater samples had so4 cl quantity superior to 0 1 proposing that they are not polluted by seawater completely water samples were mostly influenced by seawater interference the ec and cl br against cl s distribution graph indicates that all groundwater samples of group iii and group iv fall in the seawater zone fig 11d the van wirdum diagram provides a corresponding vision of the influence of water rock interfaces on groundwater mineralization besides the diverse salinization source geneses fig 11c this kind of graph tells the ionic fraction ir ca2 ca2 cl with concentricity stated in meq l schemed in contradiction of the tds mg l of the groundwater birke et al 2010 tanaskovic et al 2012 the ir showed the existence of ca2 amongst the cations and cl amongst the anions the groundwater samples can be categorized seeing two end associates recharge groundwater i e rainwater and seawater figure 11f displays that all groundwater samples have schemed among the recharged groundwater and seawater end associates those samples near the rainwater end member represent group i ii and iii that should be more influenced by the recharge meteoric water and evolution due to the rock water interaction at the downstream portion of delta sudr and wardan basins 4 conclusions in this research geophysical and geochemical techniques have been integrated to detect the promising zones for groundwater recharge in the arid coastal region the quaternary investigated aquifer located in the area between ras sudr and matarma is ill constraint hydrogeologic aquifer data therefore the property being measured are tem and 2deri related to the geochemical features in the quaternary coastal aquifer the performed geophysical measurements tem and 2deri are consistent with the geochemical finding results of the quaternary groundwater the geophysical data provided good insights into the higher resistive subsurface zones of good groundwater quality and detected the lower resistive seawater encroachment the geochemical results reveal that groundwater at the well field area in the downstream portion of sudr and wardan basins showed fresh brackish groundwater type the geophysical techniques configure the fresh brackish groundwater zone that appears as a lenticular shape of lower dense groundwater floating over deeper saline water this zone is characterized by higher resistivity lower groundwater salinity the groundwater has mainly evolved due to the water rock interaction and dissolution process the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer downstream of the matarma basin records lower resistivity and higher groundwater salinity the groundwater in this region is essentially deteriorated probably due to seawater intrusion it is concluded that the declining of the groundwater level 0 4 2 m is mainly due to the aridity of the study area coincided with the over groundwater withdrawal the current integrated approach reflects the vulnerability of groundwater and with the recent intensive expansion of groundwater excavation for agriculture and touristic purposes a continual monitoring program and modelling is highly recommended

11873,alluvial aquifers are highly vulnerable to contamination especially in areas with peri urban occupation and on site sanitation systems due to the importance of the quality of groundwater in those areas this article aims to understand hydrochemical characteristics and to evaluate groundwater quality using the water quality index wqi and heavy metal pollution index hpi seasonal sampling campaigns of 20 samples of groundwater in hand dug wells were done during wet and dry seasons the main hydrochemical facies determined in the piper diagram allowed to classify the waters as ca hco3 ca na hco3 and na ca hco3 during the wet season and ca hco3 na ca hco3 and na ca cl during dry season suggesting shallow waters and short residence time the groundwater in the study area is mostly controlled by the incongruous weathering of silicates and the process of ionic exchange as well as the anthropogenic sources that act as secondary contributions the saturation index results show a state of supersaturation si 0 for the following minerals goethite kaolinite and illite and subsaturation si 0 for the minerals calcite and dolomite the groundwaters were subsaturated in most of the samples and supersaturated in other samples related to the mineral phase fe oh 3 the significant correlations between no3 and cl allowed to conclude that the study area is contaminated by domestic septic tanks and that in the majority of the samplings natural iron rests above the limit for human consumption wqi and hpi indicate that the majority of the samples showed excellent indexes and are adequate for consumption however in this study those indexes presented limitations because they minimize some parameters that presents concentrations above the maximum value or evidences of contamination as seen with nitrate and iron respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords shallow aquifer hand dug wells peri urban area 1 introduction the assessment of groundwater quality is of high concern for humanity due to its direct relation to human life especially in the populations that are located in semi urban and rural areas of countries in development ibrahim et al 2019 groundwater of alluvial aquifer has been used more often in relation to deep groundwaters because they are more easily explored however they are more vulnerable to contamination that can occur through natural factors such as dissolution precipitation weathering and ionic exchanges and varied biologic processes and anthropogenic activities belkhiri et al 2018 the lithology of these aquifers is generally formed by unconsolidated sediments yoshinaga pereira and silva 1997 not only it allows the rapid flow of groundwater through pores but also permits the pollutant to migrate easily through the aquifers a small disturbance of natural processes or human activity can easily alter the chemical constituents and the quality of shallow groundwater li et al 2014b selvakumar et al 2017 due to those circumstances the extensive and continued monitoring of shallow groundwaters is fundamental to guarantee its sustainability in this context the situation described above is also seen in the peripheral neighborhood north of campinas sp where due to the lack of potable water supply the population resorts to groundwater from alluvial aquifers through shallow domestic wells for diverse domestic uses in this neighborhood however there is no sewerage collecting system and the residual waters are treated in situ through these domestic septic tanks the precariousness of the wells and septic tanks and the proximity between them constitutes the worry for a possible contamination of groundwater through leaking or domestic sewer infiltration many studies about hydrochemistry and the quality of shallow groundwater were made in different parts of the world as documented by ansari and umar 2019 belkhiri et al 2018 beyene et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2019 ismail et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 lakshmanan et al 2003 li et al 2014 reddy 2013 sefie et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 in addition to that the present research intends to understand the hydrochemical processes and to evaluate the quality of groundwater for human consumption using water quality index wqi and hpi heavy metal pollution index 2 location of the study area the study area is located at north of the county of campinas in the state of são paulo brazil and lies 34 km away from downtown as well as 17 km from the district of barão geraldo fig 1 it lies in the limits between the county of campinas jaguariuna n and paulinia nw and possesses a total area of approximately 1 km2 the area is integral part of the left margin of the alluvial plains of atibaia river with east west flow where many allotments were formed in the 1980 s with many small villages of houses and farmsteads there is no basic sanitation in the region the water collected for supply derives from domestic wells and deep tubular wells and the sewage is done through septic tanks muraro et al 2019 according to the koppen classification the county of campinas is situated in the predominance of cwa climate of tropical altitude with rainy

area constitutes of proterozoic crystalline basement composed by igneous and metamorphic rocks of the itapira complex and the granitic suites of morungaba and jaguariuna which tectonics contacts possess ne direction related to the shear zone campinas valinhos fig 2 the permian carboniferous sedimentary rocks of itarare subgroup from sedimentary basin of parana occur in the central portion and are characterized by medium to coarse sandstones massive diamictites lamites and sandy clayey silt or clayey silt rhythmites in the area intrusions of serra geral formation jurassic cretaceous in the form of dikes and sills of diabase also occur instituto geológico 2009 recent alluvium are generally formed by unconsolidated sediments varying from fine to coarse sands silt clayey sediments with fine to very fine micaceous sand lenses that develop along the quaternary plains of atibaia river instituto geológico 2009 muraro et al 2019 yoshinaga pereira and silva 1997 in hydrogeological terms the area presents an aquifer of porous type with high permeability anisotropic discontinuous of small extension with shallow water level the accumulation of water in this region is favored since the plains receive water from runoff of strands the recharge of rainwater and also from the atibaia river itself muraro et al 2019 4 materials and methods 4 1 registration the first step for the fulfilment of this research constituted of the registration of existing wells in the study area which took place in three registration campaigns in the periods november 9 and 10th december 13 and 14th of 2018 and march 11th of 2019 in this phase the registration constituted of data surveys of the construction characteristics of hand dug wells the type of groundwater usage during the registration the measurement of physicochemical in situ parameters was done such as temperature ph eh and electric conductivity ce through a multi parameter probe ysi pro plus and geographical coordinates of the wells were also obtained in total 46 wells in the study area were registered followed by the selection of the wells of interest for the groundwater sampling there were 20 interest points selected for the collection of groundwater for the hydrochemical studies the criteria for selections were based preferably in a pre evaluation of contamination suspicions due to the precariousness of the constructive characteristics and the conditions around the wells the distance between wells in relation to the septic tanks anomalous values of some of the physicochemical parameters such as ph and ce among others 4 2 sampling and filtration the sampling stage was done in two seasonal campaigns the first one happened in the month of april 2019 wet season and the second one in the month of august 2019 dry season there were 20 samplings of water in total to determine the hydrochemical parameters 18 of those samplings being groundwater belonging to domestic wells one of atibaia river and one of a paleomeander the sampling procedures including cleaning preservation and transportation were done following the standards proposed by apha 2005 water was collected using disposable plastic bailers the bailers were first rinsed three times with the well river paleomeander water after this a water sample was taken to measure ph temperature and electric conductivity with a multisensor ysi pro plus this water was also discarded and a new portion of water was then taken to fill two 50 ml and one 500 ml bottles the aliquot for determining the alkalinity were placed in bottles of polypropylene of 500 ml without filtration and filled completely until the top to avoid air contact the aliquots to determine cations and anions were immediately filtered in the field through a plastic syringe and a cellulose acetate membrane filter with 0 22 μm pore size they were stored in 50 ml low density polyethylene ldpe nalgene bottles at this moment the cation aliquots were acidified with 3 drops of the hno3 solution to 12 m until it reached a ph 2 all the aliquots were immediately preserved in the field after the filtering process in a temperature of approximately 4 c in styrofoam boxes filled with frozen gel bags chemical ice 4 3 laboratory analysis the alkalinity was determined in the laboratory of analytical geochemistry of unicamp where the procedures were done within 24 h after collection

season showed ph values under the minimum allowable value of potability recommended by who 2017 and by brazil 2017 the acidic groundwaters ph 6 are typical of shallow conditions and short periods of residence freeze and cherry 1979 hem 1985 being able to associate it to the decomposition of organic material mokhtar et al 2008 the total dissolved solids tds calculated from measured ec showed that all the samples showed tds values below the maximum allowable value recommended by who 2017 and by brazil 2017 the total hardness th calculated results show reduction of the contents of ions ca2 and mg2 in the dry season table 4 based on the standard limit permitted by who 2017 the water for both seasons is good and considered adequate for human consumption the water hardness is caused by a variety of polyvalent metallic dissolved ions predominantly cations calcium and magnesium who 2017 according to the potability standards presented by who 2017 and brazil 2017 there is no maximum allowable value for calcium and magnesium calcium occurs in groundwater as a result of weathering processes by igneous rocks especially of silicate minerals from the pyroxene amphibole and feldspars groups possibly being the result of the process of cation exchange hem 1985 in groundwater magnesium occurs as a result of the alteration of ferromagnesian minerals of darker colors present in igneous rocks as in olivine pyroxenes amphiboles and dark colored micas hem 1985 in both seasons samples showed sodium concentration below the maximum allowable value of potability recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 potassium presented low concentrations and permitted value in potable water was not specified by who 2017 nor by brazil 2017 table 4 the major cations show average value in the following decreasing order ca na mg k in the wet season and na ca mg k in the dry season there is a decrease in the calcium concentration and increase in the concentration of sodium in the dry season fact that can be associated with the processes of reverse cationic exchanges between groundwater and the clay minerals wu and sun 2016 the samples presented chloride concentration below the maximum allowable value of 250 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 the minerals that provide chloride in igneous rocks are not very common hem 1985 some of the sources of the presence of chloride in water include domestic sewers fertilizers and dissolution of magmatic rocks freeze and cherry 1979 furthermore some other source of chloride in the water involves meteoric water ibrahim et al 2019 kawo and karuppannan 2018 brazil 2017 and who 2017 have not specified the bicarbonate limit for potable water occurring in low concentration in both seasons the occurrence of bicarbonate ions in the water is a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere soil or aquatic organism respiration hem 1985 ibrahim et al 2019 moreover the chemical reaction between groundwater and silicate minerals also results in high concentration of hco3 in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 kawo and karuppannan 2018 in both seasons samples show sulfate concentrations below the maximum permitted value for potability of 250 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 products of anthropogenic activities such as the use of fertilizers and urban residues can be source of so4 2 in groundwater kawo and karuppannan 2018 the nitrogen compounds are present in groundwater in the study area in the form of ammonium ions nh4 showing a reduced form and nitrate as oxidized form and more stable resembling many researches the concentrations of nitrite obtained in this research are below the detection limit of the method in both seasons samples show ammonium concentration below the maximum potability value of 35 mg l recommended by who 2017 and was not defined by brazil 2017 the presence of ammonium in groundwater in the study area can indicate an active source of contamination valiela et al 1997 moreover during the transport part of nh4 can be lost due to the volatilization of ammonia and residual nh4 is transformed into no3 in the presence of oxygen by autotrophic bacteria zendehbad et al 2019 the maximum permitted nitrate no3 value in potable water is 50 and 45 mg l equivalent to 11 and 10 mg l of no3 n according to who 2017 and brazil 2017 respectively according to feitosa and manoel filho 2000 nitrate no3 contents above 22 5 mg l equivalent to 5 mg l of no3 n can indicate contamination of groundwater by anthropogenic activities thus the samples p14 p29 and p46 in the wet season and p10 p29 and p31 in the dry season presented values of nitrate above 22 5 mg l in the study area the anthropogenic contamination arises as a result of hydrolysis of urea in the domestic sewers residues in the process of nitrification of nh4 hem 1985 kawo and karuppannan 2018 sefie et al 2018 zendehbad et al 2019 nitrate can also naturally occur in groundwater resulting from the microbial degradation of nitrogenous organic material such as protein ibrahim et al 2019 who 2017 nitrate is extremely soluble and stable in water and can easily move through the soil to water supply wells for this reason no3 has been widely used as indicator of groundwater contamination in diverse studies huan et al 2020 lapworth et al 2017 samatya et al 2006 anions showed average values varying in the following decrescent order hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f in the rainy and drought seasons all samples showed fluoride concentrations below the maximum allowed value of water potability of 1 5 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 the maximum potability value according to who 2017 and brazil 2017 for iron is 0 3 mg l and according to these standards 9 samples p01 p16 p19 p27 p28 p39 p45 paleomeander and river in the wet season and 8 samples p04 p07 p16 p27 p31 p36 paleomeander and river in dry season showed iron values above the permitted which means that these waters are not adequate for domestic consumption the high concentration of iron suggests the presence of fine particles 0 22 μm which can be organic colloids or humid materials that give some of the waters a yellow or brown coloration hem 1985 manganese s maximum potability value permitted by who 2017 and brazil 2017 is 0 1 mg l and according to this 10 samples p01 p04 p12 p16 p19 p27 p28 p39 p45 e p46 in the wet season and 12 samples p04 p07 p12 p14 p16 p18 p27 p31 p36 p37 p39 e p46 in the dry season showed manganese value above permitted which means that the waters are not of good quality for domestic consumption manganese occurs as a minor constituent in many igneous and metamorphic rock minerals significant constituents of basalt minerals such as olivine pyroxene and amphibole can be highlighted hem 1985 the heavy metals as cd cr cu ni and zn showed concentrations below maximum allowable value established by who 2017 and brazil 2017 of 10 5 50 2 000 70 and 5000 μg l respectively ba showed contents above permitted of 700 μg l in one of the samples in the wet season p46 and one sample in the dry season p39 5 2 hydrochemical evolution and types of groundwater the trilinear diagram of piper 1953 reveals the most significant factors that involve the hydrochemical characteristics of the aquifer and also the water rock interaction therefore to classify the type of groundwater or hydrochemical facies of the alluvial aquifer in the study area the cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 were plotted in the trilinear diagram of piper according to figs 3 and 4 the groundwaters were classified in seven types for wet and dry seasons in the wet season groundwaters were classified as ca hco3 30 ca na hco3 25 na ca hco3 15 na ca cl 10 na cl 10 na cl hco3 5 and ca na hco3 so4 5 whereas in the dry season the waters were classified as na ca hco3 30 ca hco3 30 na ca cl 20 ca na hco3 5 na hco3 cl 5 na hco3 5 and na cl 5 the chemical composition of these waters indicates short time of residency the bicarbonate is a product of dissociation of carbonic acid from the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and of humic acids present in the soil hem 1985 in the domain of cations the groundwaters are enriched with calcium in the wet season and enriched with sodium in the dry season however the dominance of groundwaters of the type ca2 na hco3 indicates the contribution of igneous rocks minerals weathering and other silicate in the base of the alluvial aquifer the water type na hco3 indicates origins of sodium due to the process of reverse ionic exchange between ca2 and na in the surface of clay minerals and a part of sodium may originate from igneous rock minerals such as albite naalsi3o8 however the species that contain sodium and calcium are a little more susceptible to weathering appelo and postma 2005 hem 1985 voutsis et al 2015 concerning the domain of anions it is observed a hydrochemical evolution of bicarbonate to chlorinated water in the direction of groundwater flow which is northeast towards southeast in the wet season whereas in the dry season the water shows an evolution from bicarbonate to mixed in the competence of cations it was observed the evolution of calcium to sodic potassic water in both seasons chlorinated waters can indicate contamination through septic tanks situated closer to hand dug wells sampled 5 3 groundwater geochemical mechanisms generally the groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including the dominance of rock weathering or the interaction water rocks dominance of evaporation and dominance of atmospheric precipitation the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been widely utilized in many studies of groundwater or of shallow waters to evaluate dominant factors in the water hydrochemistry the groundwater samples of the area of study presents the gibbs ratios in the wet season varying from 0 17 to 0 88 with an average of 0 48 for cations and varying from 0 02 to 0 85 with an average of 0 34 for anions in the dry season the gibbs ratio varied from 0 18 to 0 79 with an average of 0 50 for cations and 0 02 to 0 63 with an average of 0 28 for anions fig 5 represents the gibbs diagrams used to explain the hydrochemical mechanics of groundwaters and the geochemical process in the study area at the left fig 5a is represented by the cations ratios na k na k ca2 and at the right fig 5b the anions ratios cl cl hco3 in function of total dissolved solids tds the gibbs diagram shows that in the wet season the hydrochemistry of the water is controlled by the domain of the water rock interaction with slight tendencies to the precipitation domain therefore in the dry season the diagram illustrates an increase in the average ratios of cations and anions reflecting the tendency of evolution of the rock domain to the precipitation domain it is possible to visualize that some of the points were plotted outside of the diagram as seen in cases such p14 and p46 in the cation diagram and p11 p14 and p46 in the anions diagram of the wet season and p29 and p31 in the cation diagram of the dry season according to mattos et al 2018 and selvakumar et al 2017 this behavior can be associated with the anthropogenic contamination 5 4 hydrochemical processes the relative abundance of ionic species in groundwater were evaluated using bivariate diagrams that illustrate the relation between constituents dissolved in groundwater that indicates the possible hydrochemical process in which the groundwater chemistry evolves the analyzed groundwater samples show that the molar ratio of na cl varies from 0 99 to 7 23 average 2 03 during the wet season while it varies from 0 80 to 4 65 average 1 52 during the dry season 95 and 90 of the samples in the wet and dry seasons show respectively the molar ratio na cl 1 and 5 and 10 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons show the molar ratio na cl 1 as illustrated in the graph na versus cl fig 6 a the samples that show molar ratio na cl 1 fall above the line 1 1 indicating the excess of na over cl associated with the mechanism of silicate weathering albite or anthropogenic contamination ansari and umar 2019 hem 1985 meybeck 1987 moreover the samples that show the ratio na cl 1 fall very closely to the 1 1 line indicating that the process of ionic exchange is responsible for the sodium reduction and relative enrichment of chloride respectively ansari and umar 2019 hem 1985 li et al 2014b the plot of the molar ratio of na cl versus ec fig 6b shows that the line tendency is slightly decreasing in the wet season whereas in the dry season the trend line shows slight growth indicating the influence of evaporation processes that contribute for the enrichment of the sodium and chloride in the groundwater of the study area lakshmanan et al 2003 reddy 2013 the diagram of dominance of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 6c presents the samples falling above and next to the 1 1 line in the wet season and below the 1 1 line in the dry season the samples that are below and next to the 1 1 line shows that the relatively high content of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater of the study area can be derivative of reactions of ionic exchange assuming that the study area is impoverished of carbonate minerals varol and davraz 2013 furthermore the alluvial deposits can contain some soluble minerals dissolved in groundwater under adequate conditions releasing calcium and magnesium li et al 2014a the samples below the 1 1 line confirm the role of silicate weathering as an important mechanics for the occurring of dissolved salts in groundwater lakshmanan et al 2003 varol and davraz 2013 the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 fig 6d shows that all of the samples of both seasons fall below the line 1 1 indicating a fraction of calcium and magnesium derived from non carbonated sources and suggest that the excess of alkalinity in the water was possibly balanced by cations na k ansari and umar 2019 varol and davraz 2013 moreover it can be observed that the majority of the samples of the wet season falls below the 2 1 line suggesting that the predominance of bicarbonates is attributed to the weathering of silicates with a contribution of infiltration of rainwater the representation of the molar ratio of ca mg fig 7 a shows that 60 and 50 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons respectively represents a ratio ca mg 2 indicating the role of silicate minerals in the contribution of calcium and magnesium in groundwater of the study area belkhiri et al 2018 moreover 30 and 35 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons respectively showed molar ratio of ca mg between 1 and 2 and even 10 and 15 of samples of the wet and dry season respectively shows molar ratio of ca mg 1 according to belkhiri et al 2018 the last two groups would be theoretically associated with the dissolution of calcite and dolomite respectively however it is known that carbonate rocks do not occur in the study area suggesting then that the process of cationic exchange is responsible for the calcium and magnesium supplies in groundwater of the study area fig 7b where the parameters of na versus hco3 are plotted shows that the majority of samples in both seasons are plotted below and next to the 1 1 line suggesting that weathering of silicates is the responsible process for the dominance of hco3 lakshmanan et al 2003 sunkari et al 2019 10 2 naalsi 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 9 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 2 hco 3 4 h 4 sio 4 albite kaolinite the excess of the concentration of hco3 could have emerged as byproduct of hydrolysis of k feldspar equation 11 and anorthite equation 12 as observed through the coefficient of significant correlations between k versus hco3 r 0 64 and r 0 60 in wet and dry seasons respectively and significative coefficient and correlations between ca2 versus hco3 r 0 97 and r 0 78 for wet and dry seasons respectively mortatti and enzweiler 2019 11 2 kalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3

both seasons falls below 1 1 lines emphasizing that the supplying of cations happens through the process of weathering of silicates and or through salts present in the soil ansari and umar 2019 varol and davraz 2013 the plot of ca2 versus so4 2 fig 7d shows that samples from both seasons are above the 1 1 line refuting the hypothesis of the influence of gypsum dissolution as origin of ions ca2 and so4 2 in the groundwaters of the study area sulfate occurs in higher concentration in the study area during wet season and according to mattos et al 2018 this result can be derived from the ion mobilization during pedogenic processes biogeochemical cycle of sulfur therefore ansari and umar 2019 corroborated by mattos et al 2018 add that the quantity of sulfate present in the groundwater can be attributed to anthropogenic activities 5 5 saturation index si and mineral balance the calculation of the saturation index si and of mineral balance are essential to evaluate and estimate the presence of mineral reactivity in the groundwater systems without the necessity of sample collection in solid phase or examining the mineralogy deutsch and siegel 1997 sefie et al 2018 for this research the saturation index was calculated for the following minerals calcite dolomite fluorite iron hydroxide goethite kaolinite and illite table 5 therefore the results shows that all the samples of both seasons were sub saturated si 0 in relation of the minerals calcite dolomite and fluorite whereas the samples were oversaturated is 0 for goethite kaolinite and illite iron hydroxide showed si 0 in the majority of samples of both seasons and is 0 in 3 and 6 samples of wet and dry seasons respectively a negative saturation index si 0 indicates conditions of the dissolution of mineral phase this value may reflect water characteristics of a formation with insufficient quantity of minerals for solution or short residence time hussien and faiyad 2016 the unsaturated state of minerals that contain calcium in the study area can be attributed to the weathering of silicates such as the anorthite the existence of supersaturated water samples relating to goethite kaolinite and illite suggest an abundance of minerals that contain iron and clay minerals from the incongruous dissolution of silicate singh et al 2012 therefore incapable of dissolving more minerals in the same physicochemical condition the mineral phase in balance may precipitate the presence of iron in the groundwaters of the study area was evidenced in some of the wells through the presence of red colored iron colloids showing oxidation state 5 6 principal components analysis pca the principal component analysis pca is a technique of variable transformation where each variable measured can be considered as an axis of variability usually correlated to other variables bernardi et al 2009 the pca of chemistry data of groundwater involved the combination of 14 parameters ph ce ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 nh4 no3 f fe and mn in table 6 is reported the results of the principal components analysis for the sampling parameters of wet and dry season including the auto value the variability and the accumulated variability value represented by the 3 most relevant factors values above 0 5 were considered significative the three 3 first factors of wet season explain 68 33 of the accumulated variability where factor 1 explains 31 22 and is associated with parameters ca mg k hco3 and f showing positive vectoral load that ranges from 0 79 to 0 93 according to fig 8 a this factor suggests the influence of weathering of silicate minerals as the dominant hydrochemical processes in the study area hem 1985 mattos et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 factor 2 explains 27 and is associated with parameters ce na cl so4 2 no3 showing positive vectoral load that vary between 0 50 and 0 86 and parameters fe and mn that show negative vectoral load of 0 59 and 0 60 respectively this factor suggests that the positive vectoral loads are associated with anthropogenic contamination through the septic tanks whereas the negative vectoral loads are associates with the presence of colloidal particles of iron oxides and hydroxides reddy 2013 factor 3 explains 10 11 and is only associated with parameter ph with negative vectoral load of 0 77 this factor indicates that ph does not correlate significantly with any other parameter suggesting that the chemical parameters derive from diverse sources in the dry season period the three 3 first factors explain 82 83 of the accumulated variability where factor 1 explains 47 90 and is associated with parameters ce ca mg na k cl hco3 so4 2 nh4 no3 and f showing positive vectoral loads that vary from 0 53 to 0 98 as shown in fig 8b this factor suggests the reverse ionic exchange between ca and na as the dominant hydrochemical process in the study area evidencing the influence of climatic seasonality in the hydrochemical behavior of the groundwater in the study area hem 1985 mattos et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 factor 2 explains 21 54 and is associated with parameters hco3 fe and mn with positive vectoral load of 0 59 0 63 and 0 79 respectively and parameters so4 2 and no3 with negative vectoral loads of 0 55 and 0 68 this factor suggests that the parameters with positive and negative vectoral loads have different origins where the first case derives from colloids of organic complexes and iron oxides and hydroxides and the latter case derives from anthropogenic contamination and organic material decomposition hem 1985 lastly factor 3 explains 13 39 and is associated with parameters fe and mn with positive vectoral loads of 0 64 and 0 50 respectively and parameters ph and ca with vectoral charges of 0 69 and 0 51 respectively this factor suggests that the water ph is controlled by silicate weathering 5 7 anthropogenic impacts the linear regression graph fig 9 shows a significative correlation between no3 and cl r 0 73 for wet season r 0 88 for dry season indicating a common origin like an anthropogenic source ismail et al 2020 therefore according to fig 9a and b two samples groups can be observed where the first group is constituted by samples along the chloride axis where nitrate is practically absent no3 0 these samples indicate that the domain of chloride is associated with waters from rain infiltration with contribution of the dissolution of salts present in the soil reddy 2013 and the low concentration of existing nitrates is attribute to natural sources for instance the decomposition of organic material the second group of samples constituted by p11 p12 p14 p18 p19 p29 and p46 in the wet season and p10 p14 p29 p31 p38 p46 and river in the dry season shows that the content of chloride increases proportionally with the nitrate content showing contamination of anthropogenic origins through the septic tank s sewers ismail et al 2020 moreover the many reasons that can be shown for the nitrate contamination in the study area point for the precariousness of the characteristics of construction of septic wells in a phreatic level next to the soil surface in addition to animal excrement therefore in the absence of no3 in the first group does not indicate the absence of contamination because the reduction conditions of groundwaters in the aquifers can quickly remove no3 during recharge mcarthur et al 2012 5 8 water quality index wqi to evaluate the water quality for domestic consumption in the study area the calculation of water quality index wqi used the parameters ph std ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 cl no3 and f the calculated wqi varied from 6 19 to 28 75 with average of 15 85 during wet season and 5 48 to 33 94 with an average of 12 53 in the dry season indicating that all of the samples 100 analyzed in the two seasons were classified as adequate for human consumption considering the concentration of the principal ions of groundwater table 7 although the results of wqi classify the waters in the study area as excellent some of the wells receive contamination from domestic sewerage systems rendering these waters inadequate for consumption fig 10 and fig 11 show that the samples with higher nitrate content present the highest wqi values demonstrating that the parameter nitrate has a significative influence over wqi notwithstanding it does not influence the wqi classification even though it is above the permissible value of potability for human consumption brazil 2017 who 2017 5 9 heavy metal pollution index the heavy metal pollution index hpi in the study area were calculated using few selected metals such as as ba cd cr cu fe mn ni and zn the calculated hpi values varied from 46 to 230 97 with an average of 73 03 in the wet season and 47 72 to 227 07 with an average of 70 41 in the dry season the averages of hpi previously presented were calculated using average concentration of heavy metals according to tables 2 and 3 and they are below the critical value of pollution index of 100 proposed by mohan et al 1996 for potable water the individual results indicate that the majority of samples 90 in the wet season and 90 in the dry season classified as adequate for consumption and 10 of samples of the wet season p28 p39 and 10 of the dry season samples p19 p29 were classified as inadequate for consumption table 5 the calculated hpi present significative correlation with iron r 0 97 and r 0 99 in rainy and drought period respectively indicating that iron is the metal with most contribution for the hpi value as shown in the spatial distribution maps of fe and hpi in figs 12 and 13 respectively 6 conclusions the groundwaters of the alluvial plains of atibaia river show dominant hydrochemical facies calcium bicarbonate ca2 hco3 and sodium bicarbonate na hco3 referring to wet and dry seasons respectively controlled by water rock interaction domain the significative correlation between no3 and cl in the study area is affected by contamination of the domestic effluent infiltration from septic tanks and cesspools the water quality index wqi and the heavy metal pollution index hpi however evaluated the majority of waters as adequate for consumption and that the drought season samples present better quality than the rainy season samples the elevated values of nitrate in some wells above potability standard influenced the wqi index but the concentrations were not sufficient to render the waters as inadequate according to this index in the hpi index the iron concentration modified the quality index however waters with concentration of fe and mn above the potability standard for human consumption 0 3 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively showed hpi indexes of good quality the reason for this is that parameters such as ph ce tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 hco3 cl and f and heavy metals such as as ba cd cr cu ni and zn showed concentrations below the maximum allowable value the studied alluvial plain shows promptly waters with anthropic contamination nitrate generally in areas with a higher concentration of occupation nearby houses and wells with construction problems the presence of iron and manganese of geogenic origin in flood plains are also considered quality problems for human consumption the study showed that the analysis of water quality has to use many analysis tools and needs to be treated and interpreted in an integrated manner

11873,alluvial aquifers are highly vulnerable to contamination especially in areas with peri urban occupation and on site sanitation systems due to the importance of the quality of groundwater in those areas this article aims to understand hydrochemical characteristics and to evaluate groundwater quality using the water quality index wqi and heavy metal pollution index hpi seasonal sampling campaigns of 20 samples of groundwater in hand dug wells were done during wet and dry seasons the main hydrochemical facies determined in the piper diagram allowed to classify the waters as ca hco3 ca na hco3 and na ca hco3 during the wet season and ca hco3 na ca hco3 and na ca cl during dry season suggesting shallow waters and short residence time the groundwater in the study area is mostly controlled by the incongruous weathering of silicates and the process of ionic exchange as well as the anthropogenic sources that act as secondary contributions the saturation index results show a state of supersaturation si 0 for the following minerals goethite kaolinite and illite and subsaturation si 0 for the minerals calcite and dolomite the groundwaters were subsaturated in most of the samples and supersaturated in other samples related to the mineral phase fe oh 3 the significant correlations between no3 and cl allowed to conclude that the study area is contaminated by domestic septic tanks and that in the majority of the samplings natural iron rests above the limit for human consumption wqi and hpi indicate that the majority of the samples showed excellent indexes and are adequate for consumption however in this study those indexes presented limitations because they minimize some parameters that presents concentrations above the maximum value or evidences of contamination as seen with nitrate and iron respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords shallow aquifer hand dug wells peri urban area 1 introduction the assessment of groundwater quality is of high concern for humanity due to its direct relation to human life especially in the populations that are located in semi urban and rural areas of countries in development ibrahim et al 2019 groundwater of alluvial aquifer has been used more often in relation to deep groundwaters because they are more easily explored however they are more vulnerable to contamination that can occur through natural factors such as dissolution precipitation weathering and ionic exchanges and varied biologic processes and anthropogenic activities belkhiri et al 2018 the lithology of these aquifers is generally formed by unconsolidated sediments yoshinaga pereira and silva 1997 not only it allows the rapid flow of groundwater through pores but also permits the pollutant to migrate easily through the aquifers a small disturbance of natural processes or human activity can easily alter the chemical constituents and the quality of shallow groundwater li et al 2014b selvakumar et al 2017 due to those circumstances the extensive and continued monitoring of shallow groundwaters is fundamental to guarantee its sustainability in this context the situation described above is also seen in the peripheral neighborhood north of campinas sp where due to the lack of potable water supply the population resorts to groundwater from alluvial aquifers through shallow domestic wells for diverse domestic uses in this neighborhood however there is no sewerage collecting system and the residual waters are treated in situ through these domestic septic tanks the precariousness of the wells and septic tanks and the proximity between them constitutes the worry for a possible contamination of groundwater through leaking or domestic sewer infiltration many studies about hydrochemistry and the quality of shallow groundwater were made in different parts of the world as documented by ansari and umar 2019 belkhiri et al 2018 beyene et al 2019 ibrahim et al 2019 ismail et al 2020 kumar et al 2009 lakshmanan et al 2003 li et al 2014 reddy 2013 sefie et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 in addition to that the present research intends to understand the hydrochemical processes and to evaluate the quality of groundwater for human consumption using water quality index wqi and hpi heavy metal pollution index 2 location of the study area the study area is located at north of the county of campinas in the state of são paulo brazil and lies 34 km away from downtown as well as 17 km from the district of barão geraldo fig 1 it lies in the limits between the county of campinas jaguariuna n and

are characterized by medium to coarse sandstones massive diamictites lamites and sandy clayey silt or clayey silt rhythmites in the area intrusions of serra geral formation jurassic cretaceous in the form of dikes and sills of diabase also occur instituto geológico 2009 recent alluvium are generally formed by unconsolidated sediments varying from fine to coarse sands silt clayey sediments with fine to very fine micaceous sand lenses that develop along the quaternary plains of atibaia river instituto geológico 2009 muraro et al 2019 yoshinaga pereira and silva 1997 in hydrogeological terms the area presents an aquifer of porous type with high permeability anisotropic discontinuous of small extension with shallow water level the accumulation of water in this region is favored since the plains receive water from runoff of strands the recharge of rainwater and also from the atibaia river itself muraro et al 2019 4 materials and methods 4 1 registration the first step for the fulfilment of this research constituted of the registration of existing wells in the study area which took place in three registration campaigns in the periods november 9 and 10th december 13 and 14th of 2018 and march 11th of 2019 in this phase the registration constituted of data surveys of the construction characteristics of hand dug wells the type of groundwater usage during the registration the measurement of physicochemical in situ parameters was done such as temperature ph eh and electric conductivity ce through a multi parameter probe ysi pro plus and geographical coordinates of the wells were also obtained in total 46 wells in the study area were registered followed by the selection of the wells of interest for the groundwater sampling there were 20 interest points selected for the collection of groundwater for the hydrochemical studies the criteria for selections were based preferably in a pre evaluation of contamination suspicions due to the precariousness of the constructive characteristics and the conditions around the wells the distance between wells in relation to the septic tanks anomalous values of some of the physicochemical parameters such as ph and ce among others 4 2 sampling and filtration the sampling stage was done in two seasonal campaigns the first one happened in the month of april 2019 wet season and the second one in the month of august 2019 dry season there were 20 samplings of water in total to determine the hydrochemical parameters 18 of those samplings being groundwater belonging to domestic wells one of atibaia river and one of a paleomeander the sampling procedures including cleaning preservation and transportation were done following the standards proposed by apha 2005 water was collected using disposable plastic bailers the bailers were first rinsed three times with the well river paleomeander water after this a water sample was taken to measure ph temperature and electric conductivity with a multisensor ysi pro plus this water was also discarded and a new portion of water was then taken to fill two 50 ml and one 500 ml bottles the aliquot for determining the alkalinity were placed in bottles of polypropylene of 500 ml without filtration and filled completely until the top to avoid air contact the aliquots to determine cations and anions were immediately filtered in the field through a plastic syringe and a cellulose acetate membrane filter with 0 22 μm pore size they were stored in 50 ml low density polyethylene ldpe nalgene bottles at this moment the cation aliquots were acidified with 3 drops of the hno3 solution to 12 m until it reached a ph 2 all the aliquots were immediately preserved in the field after the filtering process in a temperature of approximately 4 c in styrofoam boxes filled with frozen gel bags chemical ice 4 3 laboratory analysis the alkalinity was determined in the laboratory of analytical geochemistry of unicamp where the procedures were done within 24 h after collection the parameter was determined using the 2320 b method proposed by apha 1992 which procedures consists of digital burette titration of a known volume of the non filtered sampling with standardized solution of hcl 0 01 mol l the analysis of the principal anions f cl no2 so4 2 no3 e po4 3 was done in the laboratory of hydrogeology and hydrochemistry of the institute of geosciences and exact sciences são paulo state university unesp campus rio claro using the ionic chromatography technique ic dionex ics 2500 according to the method epa 300 0 300 1 proposed by usepa 1993 the analysis of the cations was done in the laboratory of isotopic geology in the institute of geosciences university of campinas unicamp applying the mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma icp ms technique and the device of model xseriesii thermo equipped with cct collision cell technology according to the method 6020 b proposed by usepa 2014 the river water reference material slrs 5 nrcc canada was analyzed together with the water samples to ensure the reliability of the results of the icp ms analysis the obtained and compiled ree values for slrs 5 yeghicheyan et al 2013 were in acceptable agreement 4 4 processing and analysis of data the calculation of the balance of charge between cations and anions in which the ionic balance was within 10 logan 1965 were determined using

multivariate pca statistical analysis were performed using the software xl stat version 2020 1 3 4 5 water quality index the water quality index wqi is an essential parameter to evaluate the quality of groundwater and its adequacy for consuming purposes avvannavar and shrihari 2008 belkhiri et al 2018 to calculate wqi in this study the parameters ph std ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 cl no3 and f were used for each parameter of water quality different weights were attributed wi according to its relative importance in the general quality of water for domestic consume and its implications to health when found in high concentrations in groundwater belkhiri et al 2018 the maximum weight of 5 was attributed to the parameters std no3 and f given their major importance in the evaluation of water quality and the minimum weight of 2 was attributed to k for its lesser importance table 1 equations 3 6 are involved in the determination of wqi 3 wi wi i n wi 4 qi c i c ip s i c ip x 100 5 s i i w i x q i 6

2016 mohan et al 1996 prasad and bose 2001 rezaei et al 2019 for this study the following parameters were used to calculate the hpi as ba cd cr cu fe mn ni and zn the calculation of hpi proposed is

metals in the 20 samplings of wet and dry season respectively the same procedures were applied for all samples individually 5 results and discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics the results of the physicochemical analysis of the 20 samples collected in the wet and dry season in the study area were presented in table 4 and the respective descriptive statistics and maximum allowable value recommended by the world health organization who 2017 and by the consolidation ordinance nº 5 2017 of the ministry of health brazil 2017 more than half of the wet season samples and some of the dry season showed ph values under the minimum allowable value of potability recommended by who 2017 and by brazil 2017 the acidic groundwaters ph 6 are typical of shallow conditions and short periods of residence freeze and cherry 1979 hem 1985 being able to associate it to the decomposition of organic material mokhtar et al 2008 the total dissolved solids tds calculated from measured ec showed that all the samples showed tds values below the maximum allowable value recommended by who 2017 and by brazil 2017 the total hardness th calculated results show reduction of the contents of ions ca2 and mg2 in the dry season table 4 based on the standard limit permitted by who 2017 the water for both seasons is good and considered adequate for human consumption the water hardness is caused by a variety of polyvalent metallic dissolved ions predominantly cations calcium and magnesium who 2017 according to the potability standards presented by who 2017 and brazil 2017 there is no maximum allowable value for calcium and magnesium calcium occurs in groundwater as a result of weathering processes by igneous rocks especially of silicate minerals from the pyroxene amphibole and feldspars groups possibly being the result of the process of cation exchange hem 1985 in groundwater magnesium occurs as a result of the alteration of ferromagnesian minerals of darker colors present in igneous rocks as in olivine pyroxenes amphiboles and dark colored micas hem 1985 in both seasons samples showed sodium concentration below the maximum allowable value of potability recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 potassium presented low concentrations and permitted value in potable water was not specified by who 2017 nor by brazil 2017 table 4 the major cations show average value in the following decreasing order ca na mg k in the wet season and na ca mg k in the dry season there is a decrease in the calcium concentration and increase in the concentration of sodium in the dry season fact that can be associated with the processes of reverse cationic exchanges between groundwater and the clay minerals wu and sun 2016 the samples presented chloride concentration below the maximum allowable value of 250 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 the minerals that provide chloride in igneous rocks are not very common hem 1985 some of the sources of the presence of chloride in water include domestic sewers fertilizers and dissolution of magmatic rocks freeze and cherry 1979 furthermore some other source of chloride in the water involves meteoric water ibrahim et al 2019 kawo and karuppannan 2018 brazil 2017 and who 2017 have not specified the bicarbonate limit for potable water occurring in low concentration in both seasons the occurrence of bicarbonate ions in the water is a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere soil or aquatic organism respiration hem 1985 ibrahim et al 2019 moreover the chemical reaction between groundwater and silicate minerals also results in high concentration of hco3 in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 kawo and karuppannan 2018 in both seasons samples show sulfate concentrations below the maximum permitted value for potability of 250 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 products of anthropogenic activities such as the use of fertilizers and urban residues can be source of so4 2 in groundwater kawo and karuppannan 2018 the nitrogen compounds are present in groundwater in the study area in the form of ammonium ions nh4 showing a reduced form and nitrate as oxidized form and more stable resembling many researches the concentrations of nitrite obtained in this research are below the detection limit of the method in both seasons samples show ammonium concentration below the maximum potability value of 35 mg l recommended by who 2017 and was not defined by brazil 2017 the presence of ammonium in groundwater in the study area can indicate an active source of contamination valiela et al 1997 moreover during the transport part of nh4 can be lost due to the volatilization of ammonia and residual nh4 is transformed into no3 in the presence of oxygen by autotrophic bacteria zendehbad et al 2019 the maximum permitted nitrate no3 value in potable water is 50 and 45 mg l equivalent to 11 and 10 mg l of no3 n according to who 2017 and brazil 2017 respectively according to feitosa and manoel filho 2000 nitrate no3 contents above 22 5 mg l equivalent to 5 mg l of no3 n can indicate contamination of groundwater by anthropogenic activities thus the samples p14 p29 and p46 in the wet season and p10 p29 and p31 in the dry season presented values of nitrate above 22 5 mg l in the study area the anthropogenic contamination arises as a result of hydrolysis of urea in the domestic sewers residues in the process of nitrification of nh4 hem 1985 kawo and karuppannan 2018 sefie et al 2018 zendehbad et al 2019 nitrate can also naturally occur in groundwater resulting from the microbial degradation of nitrogenous organic material such as protein ibrahim et al 2019 who 2017 nitrate is extremely soluble and stable in water and can easily move through the soil to water supply wells for this reason no3 has been widely used as indicator of groundwater contamination in diverse studies huan et al 2020 lapworth et al 2017 samatya et al 2006 anions showed average values varying in the following decrescent order hco3 cl no3 so4 2 f in the rainy and drought seasons all samples showed fluoride concentrations below the maximum allowed value of water potability of 1 5 mg l recommended by who 2017 and brazil 2017 the maximum potability value according to who 2017 and brazil 2017 for iron is 0 3 mg l and according to these standards 9 samples p01 p16 p19 p27 p28 p39 p45 paleomeander and river in the wet season and 8 samples p04 p07 p16 p27 p31 p36 paleomeander and river in dry season showed iron values above the permitted which means that these waters are not adequate for domestic consumption the high concentration of iron suggests the presence of fine particles 0 22 μm which can be organic colloids or humid materials that give some of the waters a yellow or brown coloration hem 1985 manganese s maximum potability value permitted by who 2017 and brazil 2017 is 0 1 mg l and according to this 10 samples p01 p04 p12 p16 p19 p27 p28 p39 p45 e p46 in the wet season and 12 samples p04 p07 p12 p14 p16 p18 p27 p31 p36 p37 p39 e p46 in the dry season showed manganese value above permitted which means that the waters are not of good quality for domestic consumption manganese occurs as a minor constituent in many igneous and metamorphic rock minerals significant constituents of basalt minerals such as olivine pyroxene and amphibole can be highlighted hem 1985 the heavy metals as cd cr cu ni and zn showed concentrations below maximum allowable value established by who 2017 and brazil 2017 of 10 5 50 2 000 70 and 5000 μg l respectively ba showed contents above permitted of 700 μg l in one of the samples in the wet season p46 and one sample in the dry season p39 5 2 hydrochemical evolution and types of groundwater the trilinear diagram of piper 1953 reveals the most significant factors that involve the hydrochemical characteristics of the aquifer and also the water rock interaction therefore to classify the type of groundwater or hydrochemical facies of the alluvial aquifer in the study area the cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 were plotted in the trilinear diagram of piper according to figs 3 and 4 the groundwaters were classified in seven types for wet and dry seasons in the wet season groundwaters were classified as ca hco3 30 ca na hco3 25 na ca hco3 15 na ca cl 10 na cl 10 na cl hco3 5 and ca na hco3 so4 5 whereas in the dry season the waters were classified as na ca hco3 30 ca hco3 30 na ca cl 20 ca na hco3 5 na hco3 cl 5 na hco3 5 and na cl 5 the chemical composition of these waters indicates short time of residency the bicarbonate is a product of dissociation of carbonic acid from the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and of humic acids present in the soil hem 1985 in the domain of cations the groundwaters are enriched with calcium in the wet season and enriched with sodium in the dry season however the dominance of groundwaters of the type ca2 na hco3 indicates the contribution of igneous rocks minerals weathering and other silicate in the base of the alluvial aquifer the water type na hco3 indicates origins of sodium due to the process of reverse ionic exchange between ca2 and na in the surface of clay minerals and a part of sodium may originate from igneous rock minerals such as albite naalsi3o8 however the species that contain sodium and calcium are a little more susceptible to weathering appelo and postma 2005 hem 1985 voutsis et al 2015 concerning the domain of anions it is observed a hydrochemical evolution of bicarbonate to chlorinated water in the direction of groundwater flow which is northeast towards southeast in the wet season whereas in the dry season the water shows an evolution from bicarbonate to mixed in the competence of cations it was observed the evolution of calcium to sodic potassic water in both seasons chlorinated waters can indicate contamination through septic tanks situated closer to hand dug wells sampled 5 3 groundwater geochemical mechanisms generally the groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including the dominance of rock weathering or the interaction water rocks dominance of evaporation and dominance of atmospheric precipitation the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 has been widely utilized in many studies of groundwater or of shallow waters to evaluate dominant factors in the water hydrochemistry the groundwater samples of the area of study presents the gibbs ratios in the wet season varying from 0 17 to 0 88 with an average of 0 48 for cations and varying from 0 02 to 0 85 with an average of 0 34 for anions in the dry season the gibbs ratio varied from 0 18 to 0 79 with an average of 0 50 for cations and 0 02 to 0 63 with an average of 0 28 for anions fig 5 represents the gibbs diagrams used to explain the hydrochemical mechanics of groundwaters and the geochemical process in the study area at the left fig 5a is represented by the cations ratios na k na k ca2 and at the right fig 5b the anions ratios cl cl hco3 in function of total dissolved solids tds the gibbs diagram shows that in the wet season the hydrochemistry of the water is controlled by the domain of the water rock interaction with slight tendencies to the precipitation domain therefore in the dry season the diagram illustrates an increase in the average ratios of cations and anions reflecting the tendency of evolution of the rock domain to the precipitation domain it is possible to visualize that some of the points were plotted outside of the diagram as seen in cases such p14 and p46 in the cation diagram and p11 p14 and p46 in the anions diagram of the wet season and p29 and p31 in the cation diagram of the dry season according to mattos et al 2018 and selvakumar et al 2017 this behavior can be associated with the anthropogenic contamination 5 4 hydrochemical processes the relative abundance of ionic species in groundwater were evaluated using bivariate diagrams that illustrate the relation between constituents dissolved in groundwater that indicates the possible hydrochemical process in which the groundwater chemistry evolves the analyzed groundwater samples show that the molar ratio of na cl varies from 0 99 to 7 23 average 2 03 during the wet season while it varies from 0 80 to 4 65 average 1 52 during the dry season 95 and 90 of the samples in the wet and dry seasons show respectively the molar ratio na cl 1 and 5 and 10 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons show the molar ratio na cl 1 as illustrated in the graph na versus cl fig 6 a the samples that show molar ratio na cl 1 fall above the line 1 1 indicating the excess of na over cl associated with the mechanism of silicate weathering albite or anthropogenic contamination ansari and umar 2019 hem 1985 meybeck 1987 moreover the samples that show the ratio na cl 1 fall very closely to the 1 1 line indicating that the process of ionic exchange is responsible for the sodium reduction and relative enrichment of chloride respectively ansari and umar 2019 hem 1985 li et al 2014b the plot of the molar ratio of na cl versus ec fig 6b shows that the line tendency is slightly decreasing in the wet season whereas in the dry season the trend line shows slight growth indicating the influence of evaporation processes that contribute for the enrichment of the sodium and chloride in the groundwater of the study area lakshmanan et al 2003 reddy 2013 the diagram of dominance of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 6c presents the samples falling above and next to the 1 1 line in the wet season and below the 1 1 line in the dry season the samples that are below and next to the 1 1 line shows that the relatively high content of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater of the study area can be derivative of reactions of ionic exchange assuming that the study area is impoverished of carbonate minerals varol and davraz 2013 furthermore the alluvial deposits can contain some soluble minerals dissolved in groundwater under adequate conditions releasing calcium and magnesium li et al 2014a the samples below the 1 1 line confirm the role of silicate weathering as an important mechanics for the occurring of dissolved salts in groundwater lakshmanan et al 2003 varol and davraz 2013 the plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 fig 6d shows that all of the samples of both seasons fall below the line 1 1 indicating a fraction of calcium and magnesium derived from non carbonated sources and suggest that the excess of alkalinity in the water was possibly balanced by cations na k ansari and umar 2019 varol and davraz 2013 moreover it can be observed that the majority of the samples of the wet season falls below the 2 1 line suggesting that the predominance of bicarbonates is attributed to the weathering of silicates with a contribution of infiltration of rainwater the representation of the molar ratio of ca mg fig 7 a shows that 60 and 50 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons respectively represents a ratio ca mg 2 indicating the role of silicate minerals in the contribution of calcium and magnesium in groundwater of the study area belkhiri et al 2018 moreover 30 and 35 of the samples of the wet and dry seasons respectively showed molar ratio of ca mg between 1 and 2 and even 10 and 15 of samples of the wet and dry season respectively shows molar ratio of ca mg 1 according to belkhiri et al 2018 the last two groups would be theoretically associated with the dissolution of calcite and dolomite respectively however it is known that carbonate rocks do not occur in the study area suggesting then that the process of cationic exchange is responsible for the calcium and magnesium supplies in groundwater of the study area fig 7b where the parameters of na versus hco3 are plotted shows that the majority of samples in both seasons are plotted below and next to the 1 1 line suggesting that weathering of silicates is the responsible process for the dominance of hco3 lakshmanan et al 2003 sunkari et al 2019 10 2 naalsi 3 o 8 2 h 2 co 3 9 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 na 2 hco 3 4 h 4 sio 4 albite kaolinite the excess of the concentration of hco3 could have emerged as byproduct of hydrolysis of k feldspar equation 11 and anorthite equation 12 as observed through the coefficient of significant correlations between k versus hco3 r 0 64 and r 0 60 in wet and dry seasons respectively and significative coefficient and correlations between ca2 versus hco3 r 0 97 and r 0 78 for wet and dry seasons respectively mortatti and enzweiler 2019 11 2 kalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3

both seasons falls below 1 1 lines emphasizing that the supplying of cations happens through the process of weathering of silicates and or through salts present in the soil ansari and umar 2019 varol and davraz 2013 the plot of ca2 versus so4 2 fig 7d shows that samples from both seasons are above the 1 1 line refuting the hypothesis of the influence of gypsum dissolution as origin of ions ca2 and so4 2 in the groundwaters of the study area sulfate occurs in higher concentration in the study area during wet season and according to mattos et al 2018 this result can be derived from the ion mobilization during pedogenic processes biogeochemical cycle of sulfur therefore ansari and umar 2019 corroborated by mattos et al 2018 add that the quantity of sulfate present in the groundwater can be attributed to anthropogenic activities 5 5 saturation index si and mineral balance the calculation of the saturation index si and of mineral balance are essential to evaluate and estimate the presence of mineral reactivity in the groundwater systems without the necessity of sample collection in solid phase or examining the mineralogy deutsch and siegel 1997 sefie et al 2018 for this research the saturation index was calculated for the following minerals calcite dolomite fluorite iron hydroxide goethite kaolinite and illite table 5 therefore the results shows that all the samples of both seasons were sub saturated si 0 in relation of the minerals calcite dolomite and fluorite whereas the samples were oversaturated is 0 for goethite kaolinite and illite iron hydroxide showed si 0 in the majority of samples of both seasons and is 0 in 3 and 6 samples of wet and dry seasons respectively a negative saturation index si 0 indicates conditions of the dissolution of mineral phase this value may reflect water characteristics of a formation with insufficient quantity of minerals for solution or short residence time hussien and faiyad 2016 the unsaturated state of minerals that contain calcium in the study area can be attributed to the weathering of silicates such as the anorthite the existence of supersaturated water samples relating to goethite kaolinite and illite suggest an abundance of minerals that contain iron and clay minerals from the incongruous dissolution of silicate singh et al 2012 therefore incapable of dissolving more minerals in the same physicochemical condition the mineral phase in balance may precipitate the presence of iron in the groundwaters of the study area was evidenced in some of the wells through the presence of red colored iron colloids showing oxidation state 5 6 principal components analysis pca the principal component analysis pca is a technique of variable transformation where each variable measured can be considered as an axis of variability usually correlated to other variables bernardi et al 2009 the pca of chemistry data of groundwater involved the combination of 14 parameters ph ce ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 nh4 no3 f fe and mn in table 6 is reported the results of the principal components analysis for the sampling parameters of wet and dry season including the auto value the variability and the accumulated variability value represented by the 3 most relevant factors values above 0 5 were considered significative the three 3 first factors of wet season explain 68 33 of the accumulated variability where factor 1 explains 31 22 and is associated with parameters ca mg k hco3 and f showing positive vectoral load that ranges from 0 79 to 0 93 according to fig 8 a this factor suggests the influence of weathering of silicate minerals as the dominant hydrochemical processes in the study area hem 1985 mattos et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 factor 2 explains 27 and is associated with parameters ce na cl so4 2 no3 showing positive vectoral load that vary between 0 50 and 0 86 and parameters fe and mn that show negative vectoral load of 0 59 and 0 60 respectively this factor suggests that the positive vectoral loads are associated with anthropogenic contamination through the septic tanks whereas the negative vectoral loads are associates with the presence of colloidal particles of iron oxides and hydroxides reddy 2013 factor 3 explains 10 11 and is only associated with parameter ph with negative vectoral load of 0 77 this factor indicates that ph does not correlate significantly with any other parameter suggesting that the chemical parameters derive from diverse sources in the dry season period the three 3 first factors explain 82 83 of the accumulated variability where factor 1 explains 47 90 and is associated with parameters ce ca mg na k cl hco3 so4 2 nh4 no3 and f showing positive vectoral loads that vary from 0 53 to 0 98 as shown in fig 8b this factor suggests the reverse ionic exchange between ca and na as the dominant hydrochemical process in the study area evidencing the influence of climatic seasonality in the hydrochemical behavior of the groundwater in the study area hem 1985 mattos et al 2018 voutsis et al 2015 factor 2 explains 21 54 and is associated with parameters hco3 fe and mn with positive vectoral load of 0 59 0 63 and 0 79 respectively and parameters so4 2 and no3 with negative vectoral loads of 0 55 and 0 68 this factor suggests that the parameters with positive and negative vectoral loads have different origins where the first case derives from colloids of organic complexes and iron oxides and hydroxides and the latter case derives from anthropogenic contamination and organic material decomposition hem 1985 lastly factor 3 explains 13 39 and is associated with parameters fe and mn with positive vectoral loads of 0 64 and 0 50 respectively and parameters ph and ca with vectoral charges of 0 69 and 0 51 respectively this factor suggests that the water ph is controlled by silicate weathering 5 7 anthropogenic impacts the linear regression graph fig 9 shows a significative correlation between no3 and cl r 0 73 for wet season r 0 88 for dry season indicating a common origin like an anthropogenic source ismail et al 2020 therefore according to fig 9a and b two samples groups can be observed where the first group is constituted by samples along the chloride axis where nitrate is practically absent no3 0 these samples indicate that the domain of chloride is associated with waters from rain infiltration with contribution of the dissolution of salts present in the soil reddy 2013 and the low concentration of existing nitrates is attribute to natural sources for instance the decomposition of organic material the second group of samples constituted by p11 p12 p14 p18 p19 p29 and p46 in the wet season and p10 p14 p29 p31 p38 p46 and river in the dry season shows that the content of chloride increases proportionally with the nitrate content showing contamination of anthropogenic origins through the septic tank s sewers ismail et al 2020 moreover the many reasons that can be shown for the nitrate contamination in the study area point for the precariousness of the characteristics of construction of septic wells in a phreatic level next to the soil surface in addition to animal excrement therefore in the absence of no3 in the first group does not indicate the absence of contamination because the reduction conditions of groundwaters in the aquifers can quickly remove no3 during recharge mcarthur et al 2012 5 8 water quality index wqi to evaluate the water quality for domestic consumption in the study area the calculation of water quality index wqi used the parameters ph std ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 cl no3 and f the calculated wqi varied from 6 19 to 28 75 with average of 15 85 during wet season and 5 48 to 33 94 with an average of 12 53 in the dry season indicating that all of the samples 100 analyzed in the two seasons were classified as adequate for human consumption considering the concentration of the principal ions of groundwater table 7 although the results of wqi classify the waters in the study area as excellent some of the wells receive contamination from domestic sewerage systems rendering these waters inadequate for consumption fig 10 and fig 11 show that the samples with higher nitrate content present the highest wqi values demonstrating that the parameter nitrate has a significative influence over wqi notwithstanding it does not influence the wqi classification even though it is above the permissible value of potability for human consumption brazil 2017 who 2017 5 9 heavy metal pollution index the heavy metal pollution index hpi in the study area were calculated using few selected metals such as as ba cd cr cu fe mn ni and zn the calculated hpi values varied from 46 to 230 97 with an average of 73 03 in the wet season and 47 72 to 227 07 with an average of 70 41 in the dry season the averages of hpi previously presented were calculated using average concentration of heavy metals according to tables 2 and 3 and they are below the critical value of pollution index of 100 proposed by mohan et al 1996 for potable water the individual results indicate that the majority of samples 90 in the wet season and 90 in the dry season classified as adequate for consumption and 10 of samples of the wet season p28 p39 and 10 of the dry season samples p19 p29 were classified as inadequate for consumption table 5 the calculated hpi present significative correlation with iron r 0 97 and r 0 99 in rainy and drought period respectively indicating that iron is the metal with most contribution for the hpi value as shown in the spatial distribution maps of fe and hpi in figs 12 and 13 respectively 6 conclusions the groundwaters of the alluvial plains of atibaia river show dominant hydrochemical facies calcium bicarbonate ca2 hco3 and sodium bicarbonate na hco3 referring to wet and dry seasons respectively controlled by water rock interaction domain the significative correlation between no3 and cl in the study area is affected by contamination of the domestic effluent infiltration from septic tanks and cesspools the water quality index wqi and the heavy metal pollution index hpi however evaluated the majority of waters as adequate for consumption and that the drought season samples present better quality than the rainy season samples the elevated values of nitrate in some wells above potability standard influenced the wqi index but the concentrations were not sufficient to render the waters as inadequate according to this index in the hpi index the iron concentration modified the quality index however waters with concentration of fe and mn above the potability standard for human consumption 0 3 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively showed hpi indexes of good quality the reason for this is that parameters such as ph ce tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 hco3 cl and f and heavy metals such as as ba cd cr cu ni and zn showed concentrations below the maximum allowable value the studied alluvial plain shows promptly waters with anthropic contamination nitrate generally in areas with a higher concentration of occupation nearby houses and wells with construction problems the presence of iron and manganese of geogenic origin in flood plains are also considered quality problems for human consumption the study showed that the analysis of water quality has to use many analysis tools and needs to be treated and interpreted in an integrated manner

is not altered by the anthropogenic activities rajmohan et al 2017 mixed quality water appears in the intermediate zone guo et al 2020 shallow groundwater was also characterized by higher mn2 and fe2 concentrations relative to deep groundwater likely indicating more reducing conditions the cation exchange in the deepest part of the groundwater flow system led to changes in the water chemistry from one of predominantly ca2 hco3 chemistry to one of predominantly na hco3 chemistry dragon and gorski 2015 there is an increase in ph and hco3 concentrations from the top to the base of the aquifer and a substantial enrichment of na in the aquifer relative to cl the shallow and intermediate depths of the aquifer show a low na cl molar ratio which increases in the deep aquifer thus indicating that the rock is providing the water with na the increase in na followed by a decrease in ca2 and mg2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 molar ratios suggests the occurrence of a cation exchange reaction in the deeper parts of the aquifer bourotte et al 2009 according to rajmohan et al 2017 the molar ratio na cl 1 indicates the role of silicate weathering or cation exchange while the lower ratio na cl 1 exhibits the reverse ion exchange process the importance of using the results of chemical data in the evaluation of water quality in various aquifer hydraulic zones is presented by dragon and gorski 2015 which demonstrated in this way the connectivity between different aquifers furthermore the ratio of cr6 crtotal between 0 7 and 1 indicates that cr6 is the predominant form of dissolved chromium

water use on groundwater cr 6 levels in this work five neighboring aquifer systems of different geological background are simultaneously examined regarding their groundwater physicochemical characteristics in relation to cr6 concentration clusters aiming to identify the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones and the effect of water use on cr6 concentration correlation of separate clusters of cr6 concentration to representative groundwater ions or ion ratios from water rock interaction at different sampling periods has been applied for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geological background the study area includes five neighboring aquifer systems located in western macedonia greece fig 1 these aquifer systems are sarigkiol or south field subsystem of kozani 0906b porous subsystem of ptolemaida 0906a porous subsystem of xirolimni kozani 0907c karstic subsystem of northwest mt vermio 0908a and porous system of galatea emporio of kozani 0923 τhe composition of groundwater in each aquifer system depends on the influence of the maternal rocks which significantly differs in each of the studied aquifer systems as presented below sarigkiol or south field subsystem of kozani 0906b covers an area of approximately 47 km2 and is hosted within neogene and quaternary sediments which are composed of alternations of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays and cobbles with various composition and size these sediments have been fed by the geological formations of mt vermio which are mainly limestones and ultramafic rocks the area is characterized by multiple environmental pressures lignite mining power plant operation agriculture livestock farming porous subsystem of ptolemaida 0906a covers an area of approximately 163 km2 and expands mainly in quaternary sediments consisting of alternating beds of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays with a varied composition of cobbles depending on their maternal origin the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture and urban activities karstic subsystem of northwest mt vermio 0908a covers an area of approximately 530 km2 and a large part of it is covered by a large thickness of neogene and quaternary sediments in the tectonic basin of ptolemaida the triassic jurassic limestones are significant in the area because they develop in their mass a large secondary porosity where they can host karstic aquifers the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities porous system of galatea emporio of kozani 0923 expands mainly in quaternary sediments of alternating beds of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays with a varied composition of cobbles depending on their maternal origin the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities porous subsystem of xirolimni kozani 0907c it belongs to the drainage basin of aliakmon river it consists of successive semi confined aquifers the main supply source is from the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation the area is characterized by limited environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities as shown in fig 2 the sarigkiol 0906a ptolemaida 0906b and xirolimni 0907c aquifer systems have as a common feature their proximity to ophiolite formations and their aquifers consist of serpentinized ultramafic rocks and sediments sourced from ultramafic rocks 2 2 sampling and analysis a total of 366 samples from the five aquifer systems were collected in three sampling periods during 2018 2019 the first during the wet period of 2018 112 samples the second during the dry period of 2018 104 samples and the third during the wet period of 2019 150 samples 188 samples were obtained from subsystem 0906b 123 samples from subsystem 0906a 27 samples from system 0923 22 samples from subsystem 0908a and 6 samples from subsystem 0907c physicochemical parameters heavy metals ph no2 no3 cr6 hco3 cl ca2 so4 2 and na were analyzed at the accredited according the iso 7025 environmental chemistry water and waste water treatment laboratory of university of western macedonia greece by applying standard methods apha 2017 iso 10304 1 iso 14911 and using calibrated and certified equipment hexavalent chromium was measured using a modified spectrophotometric method based on apha 3500 cr b apha 2017 having a lowest detection limit of 3 μg l an ion chromatographer metrohm 881 compact ic pro and an atomic absorption spectrometer zeenit 700 were used for the measurement of no3 cl so4 2 total chromium crtotal mn and fe the measurement uncertainties of each applied analytical method had been calculated based on previously published methodological approach amanatidou et al 2012 trikilidou et al 2020 the average values and the value range of the measured physicochemical parameters in each aquifer system are presented in table 1 in this work the correlation of cr6 concentration to groundwater hydrochemical zones vadose shallow intermediate deep chemistry was performed more specifically the na cl molar ratios for all wells of the study area were calculated and correlated to cr6 ca2 hco3 molar ratios and nitrates in order to identify the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones additionally cr6 crtotal ratios were calculated to investigate the hydraulic zone equilibrium i e to investigate whether the process of cr6 formation via oxidation of cr3 by manganese oxides prevails finally cr6 correlation to major ions for all samples and for separated clusters of concentrations and sampling periods was performed to determine the effect of pumping ibm spss software was used for the statistical analysis the application of the normality tests kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk showed that the data do not follow a normal distribution however based on the sample size 35 322 data sets pearson s hypothesis tests parametric mcintyre and david 1938 frost 2019 was applied which is widely used on identifying the correlation on water quality parameters the correlations were considered significant if p 0 01 very strong correlation p 0 05 strong correlation p 0 1 weak correlation and insignificant if p 0 1 no correlation 3 results and discussion in the three out of the five studied aquifer systems sarigkiol xirolimni and a part of ptolemais basin high concentrations of naturally occurring cr6 are recorded in aquifers of serpentinized ultramafic rocks and sediments sourced from ultramafic rocks the concentrations of cr6 are proportional to the participation of ophiolite materials in the formation of the aquifer fig 2 approximately 55 out of the 366 analyzed samples i e 15 showed concentrations of total chromium higher or equal to the potability limit of 50 μg l while 43 out of these 55 samples i e 79 had cr6 concentrations also over 50 μg l the concentrations of cr6 presented a great degree of variation among different localities and different sampling periods in these regions with values ranging from 2 μg l to as high as 184 μg l for the requirements of this study the concentrations of cr6 50 μg l were considered low while the concentrations of cr6 50 μg l were considered high based on the crtotal permissible limit in drinking water according to world health organization who 2019 because no limit for cr6 in drinking water have been established 3 1 ion ratios and pumping depth based on literature bourotte et al 2009 the increase of the na cl molar ratio as well as the decrease of ca2 hco3 molar ratios suggest an increase of pumping depth consequently increasing the cr6 concentration alongside the na cl molar ratio rise or and the ca2 hco3 molar ratio reduction shows the geogenic origin of cr6 from the deeper zone of the aquifer therefore the na cl and ca2 hco3 molar ratios for all wells of the study area were calculated and correlation tests pearson test for 95 confidence interval were performed between the aforementioned ratios cr6 nitrates concentrations and other physicochemical parameters tables 2 and 3 the statistical interpretation was performed based on all well samples from wet and dry sampling periods table 2 statistical interpretation for all sampling periods on distinct data clusters based on the cr6 concentration values was also performed table 3 according to the obtained data from field measurements the mean value of the na cl molar ratios in the dry no irrigation period increased compared to the wet irrigation period 2 33 vs 2 24 this is because in the dry period equilibrium conditions prevail in deeper hydraulic zone while in the wet period disequilibration of this hydraulic zone occurs due to pumping leading in mixed quality water the na cl molar ratios of all samples during the irrigation wet period present strong positive correlation p 0 05 to cr6 concentrations implying that it originates from the intermediate and deeper zone of the aquifer moreover the strong and weak negative correlation of na cl to nitrates in both dry and wet period respectively p 0 01 and 0 05 confirms that nitrates originate from the shallow and intermediate zone of the aquifer finally the strong negative correlation of na cl molar ratios to ca2 hco3 ratio in dry period p 0 05 means that in the deeper zone of aquifer the ratio has lower values where equilibrium conditions prevail table 2 3 2 cr6 crtotal ratio and hydraulic zone equilibrium the disequilibration of the hydraulic zone is supported by the ratio of cr6 to total chromium concentrations crtotal according to literature cr6 to crtotal ratios higher than 0 90 indicate that hexavalent chromium is the predominant form of dissolved chromium in natural waters more than 90 of total chromium and that a relative redox equilibrium is obtained vasilatos 2010 in this study the cr6 to crtotal ratio for all samples is lower than the bibliographic values mean value 0 53 it should be noted that the cr6 to crtotal ratio shows the highest values in samples with high concentration 50 μg l of hexavalent chromium more specifically for cr6 50 μg l the cr6 crtotal ratio mean value was 0 48 no redox equilibrium in the aquifer system and fluctuations of concentration values may occur continuously the disturbance of this balance is caused by both the pumping and the enrichment of the aquifer for cr6 50 μg l the cr6 crtotal ratio received higher values mean value 0 81 oxidation and release of cr6 and relative redox equilibrium which can be observed at high depths robertson 1991 due to the increased contact time of water with rocks in addition this increased ratio can be attributed to the low solubility of cr3 compounds in contrast to the highly soluble cr6 compounds cr3 exhibits very low solubility in water less than 20 μg l in the ph range 7 0 10 0 while its lowest solubility approximately 1 μg l is reported at ph around 8 eary and rai 1987 frey et al 2004 mcneill et al 2012 3 3 cr6 correlation to major ions as graphically presented in fig 3 the correlation tests regarding all well samples of all sampling periods 366 samples showed a strong positive correlation of cr6 with ph p 0 01 which means that cr6 concentrations increase with increasing ph pearson tests also revealed strong negative correlation of cr6 and cl p 0 01 so4 2 p 0 01 hco3 p 0 01 and a weak negative correlation between cr6 and ca2 was obtained p 0 1 the negative correlation between cr6 and cl so4 2 hco3 and ca2 is indicative of their different origin with increasing cr6 the concentrations of these ions decrease namely in the deeper zones of aquifer lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 appear suggesting that the water chemistry is not altered by anthropogenic activities 3 4 cr6 clusters correlation to major ions the most significant results of the present study were obtained from the correlations between clusters of different cr6 concentration and the measured physicochemical parameters the clusters were grouped in two major categories clusters for concentrations of cr6 50 μg l and clusters for concentrations of cr6 50 μg l table 3 according to the negative correlation of the na cl molar ratio to the cluster of cr6 50 μg l presented in table 3 it seems that these relatively low concentrations of cr6 correspond to pumping from the shallow and intermediate zone a strong positive correlation between cr6 mn2 and fe2 for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l was observed which means that there is an increase in concentration of these ions with depth higher concentrations of cr6 correspond to the end of irrigation period and the beginning of the dry period when the aquifer level is low and the water is pumped mainly from the deeper zone where cation exchange reactions occur for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l a negative correlation between cr6 mn2 and fe2 cl and so4 2 was observed suggesting that there is a decrease of their concentration in the shallow zone as shown in table 3 and in table 4 a strong positive correlation appears p 0 01 between cr6 and no3 for all samples nevertheless this correlation fades out with the increase of cr6 concentration thus for different cr6 concentration clusters of higher concentrations a gradual decrease of the significant correlation with nitrate ions is observed this correlation becomes weak for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l p 0 1 and disappears in the cluster of cr6 60 μg l p 0 1 this means that high concentrations of cr6 may occur regardless the presence of no3 it is also important that no3 exhibits strong positive correlation only for low concentrations of cr6 which correspond in the shallow zones tables 3 and 4 this behavior is expected based on the effect of pumping depth and aquifer level drop these results are in alignment with the literature reports which state that in the deep aquifer hydraulic zone there is insignificant or null presence of nitrate ions and increased concentrations of cr6 are expected however in many studies cr6 is misleadingly positively correlated with nitrate ions the aforementioned correlation is interpreted as an indirect effect of nitrate ions on the oxidation of trivalent chromium guertin et al 2004 mills et al 2011 stamatis et al 2011 remoundaki et al 2016 in this study according to the analysis and the interpretation of all obtained data from a chemical geological and hydrogeological approach it is concluded that nitrate ions are not associated with high concentrations of cr6 the presence of nitrate ions is attributed to anthropogenic activities penetration of nitrate ions into the aquifer due to fertilization with nitrogen fertilizers while the increased presence of cr6 in deep aquifer zone is attributed to geological causes with the infiltration of water precipitations and irrigation return water nitrate ions accumulate in the shallow zone of the aquifer through the unsaturated zone in the unsaturated zone vadose zone of the aquifer the infiltration of water creates conditions for the oxidation of the trivalent chromium in its ophiolite sediments containing manganese oxides the association of no3 with cr6 especially in the upper layers of the aquifer near the unsaturated zone indicates the leaching of cr6 in the shallow zone which is produced in the unsaturated zone together with precipitated water and or high content in no3 return irrigation water mills et al 2011 as a result low concentrations of hexavalent chromium due to the short contact time and of nitrates at various concentrations appear in the shallow zone cr6 concentration clusters strong positive correlation to mn2 fe2 and no3 in relation to the pumping depth table 4 shows whether or not there is a strong positive correlation p 0 05 between cr6 concentration clusters and mn2 fe2 no3 ion concentration it is evident that there is a positive correlation between cr6 and fe2 ions for cr6 concentrations 10 μg l the presence of soluble iron fe2 species together with cr6 indicates that their formation takes place both in the unsaturated zone low concentrations and in the deeper layers of the aquifer higher concentrations at high concentrations of hexavalent chromium 50 μg l a positive correlation p 0 05 of cr6 to both mn2 and fe2 occurs the presence of soluble iron and manganese species together with cr6 indicates that the high concentrations of cr6 are mainly due to its formation and desorption in the ophiolite sediments of the deep aquifer where there is long contact time and absence of nitrate ions or low presence in the case of mixing with intermediate zone water moreover as can be seen table 4 in the higher cr6 concentration clusters 50 μg l low presence or absence of nitrate ions is observed mainly during pumping from the deeper zone of the aquifer attributed to its formation in the deep zone in which the contact time with the ophiolite sediments is longer the effect of intensive water use is also confirmed by the increasing trend of the cr6 maximum concentration values recorded from 2013 to 2019 in sarigkiol basin fig 4 the measurement data were obtained from this study and from similar studies regarding the specific aquifer systems auth 2016 ntua 2016 vasileiou et al 2019 the study offers a useful tool for assessing the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones and the effect of water use on cr6 concentration based on simple data and without the need of pumping depth measuring future work is to apply this methodological approach for similar groundwater assessment on other potentially toxic pollutants such as arsenic 4 conclusions the mean value of na cl molar ratios in the dry period increased compared to the wet period because of equilibrium conditions which prevail in the dry period in deeper hydraulic zone the strong positive correlation of cr6 to na cl molar ratios implies that originates from the intermediate and deeper zone of the aquifer lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 and higher concentrations of cr6 appear in the deeper zones of the aquifer suggesting that the water chemistry is not altered by the anthropogenic activities the presence of soluble iron and manganese together with high concentrations of cr6 indicates its geogenic formation in the ophiolite sediments of the deep aquifer where there is a long contact time relative redox equilibrium and higher values of cr6 crtotal ratio moreover higher concentrations 50 μg l of cr6 and absence or low presence of nitrate ions occurs mainly during pumping from the deeper zone of the aquifer lower concentrations of cr6 together with various concentrations of nitrate ions occur during pumping from the shallow and intermediate zone of the aquifer mixed water the low concentrations of cr6 in the shallow zone are attributed to its formation in the ophiolite sediments of the vadose zone where there is a short contact time with infiltrating water no redox equilibrium and lower values of cr6 crtotal ratio statistical interpretation showed that nitrates present strong positive correlation only with low concentrations of cr6 which correspond in the shallow zone of aquifer reinforcing the conclusion that nitrates are attributed to anthropogenic activities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was carried out with the financial support of the

is not altered by the anthropogenic activities rajmohan et al 2017 mixed quality water appears in the intermediate zone guo et al 2020 shallow groundwater was also characterized by higher mn2 and fe2 concentrations relative to deep groundwater likely indicating more reducing conditions the cation exchange in the deepest part of the groundwater flow system led to changes in the water chemistry from one of predominantly ca2 hco3 chemistry to one of predominantly na hco3 chemistry dragon and gorski 2015 there is an increase in ph and hco3 concentrations from the top to the base of the aquifer and a substantial enrichment of na in the aquifer relative to cl the shallow and intermediate depths of the aquifer show a low na cl molar ratio which increases in the deep aquifer thus indicating that the rock is providing the water with na the increase in na followed by a decrease in ca2 and mg2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 molar ratios suggests the occurrence of a cation exchange reaction in the deeper parts of the aquifer bourotte et al 2009 according to rajmohan et al 2017 the molar ratio na cl 1 indicates the role of silicate weathering or cation exchange while the lower ratio na cl 1 exhibits the reverse ion exchange process the importance of using the results of chemical data in the evaluation of water quality in various aquifer hydraulic zones is presented by dragon and gorski 2015 which demonstrated in this way the connectivity between different aquifers furthermore the ratio of cr6 crtotal between 0 7 and 1 indicates that cr6 is the predominant form of dissolved chromium in natural waters vasilatos et al 2010 which is in accordance with other studies ball and izbicki 2004 vengosh et al 2016 in greece high concentrations of cr6 in groundwater have been recorded in many basins economou eliopoulos et al 2013 vasileiou et al 2014 2019 understanding the factors that control geogenic cr 6 levels and its mobility is necessary to shape policy and evaluate the economic and health impacts for areas with cr rich geologic background chrysochoou et al 2016 therefore an assessment tool based on commonly measured parameters is necessary to estimate the effect of geology and water use on groundwater cr 6 levels in this work five neighboring aquifer systems of different geological background are simultaneously examined regarding their groundwater physicochemical characteristics in relation to cr6 concentration clusters aiming to identify the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones and the effect of water use on cr6 concentration correlation of separate clusters of cr6 concentration to representative groundwater ions or ion ratios from water rock interaction at different sampling periods has been applied for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and geological background the study area includes five neighboring aquifer systems located in western macedonia greece fig 1 these aquifer systems are sarigkiol or south field subsystem of kozani 0906b porous subsystem of ptolemaida 0906a porous subsystem of xirolimni kozani 0907c karstic subsystem of northwest mt vermio 0908a and porous system of galatea emporio of kozani 0923 τhe composition of groundwater in each aquifer system depends on the influence of the maternal rocks which significantly differs in each of the studied aquifer systems as presented below sarigkiol or south field subsystem of kozani 0906b covers an area of approximately 47 km2 and is hosted within neogene and quaternary sediments which are composed of alternations of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays and cobbles with various composition and size these sediments have been fed by the geological formations of mt vermio which are mainly limestones and ultramafic rocks the area is characterized by multiple environmental pressures lignite mining power plant operation agriculture livestock farming porous subsystem of ptolemaida 0906a covers an area of approximately 163 km2 and expands mainly in quaternary sediments consisting of alternating beds of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays with a varied composition of cobbles depending on their maternal origin the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture and urban activities karstic subsystem of northwest mt vermio 0908a covers an area of approximately 530 km2 and a large part of it is covered by a large thickness of neogene and quaternary sediments in the tectonic basin of ptolemaida the triassic jurassic limestones are significant in the area because they develop in their mass a large secondary porosity where they can host karstic aquifers the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities porous system of galatea emporio of kozani 0923 expands mainly in quaternary sediments of alternating beds of loose and massive conglomerates sandstones sands clays with a varied composition of cobbles depending on their maternal origin the area is characterized by environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities porous subsystem of xirolimni kozani 0907c it belongs to the drainage basin of aliakmon river it consists of successive semi confined aquifers the main supply source is from the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation the area is characterized by limited environmental pressures mainly from agriculture activities as shown in fig 2 the sarigkiol 0906a ptolemaida 0906b and xirolimni 0907c aquifer systems have as a common feature their proximity to ophiolite formations and their aquifers consist of serpentinized ultramafic rocks and sediments sourced from ultramafic rocks 2 2 sampling and analysis a total of 366 samples from the five aquifer systems were collected in three sampling periods during 2018 2019 the first during the wet period of 2018 112 samples the second during the dry period of 2018 104 samples and the third during the wet period of 2019 150 samples 188 samples were obtained from subsystem 0906b 123 samples from subsystem 0906a 27 samples from system 0923 22 samples from subsystem 0908a and 6 samples from subsystem 0907c physicochemical parameters heavy metals ph no2 no3 cr6 hco3 cl ca2 so4 2 and na were analyzed at the accredited according the iso 7025 environmental chemistry water and waste water treatment laboratory of university of western macedonia greece by applying standard methods apha 2017 iso 10304 1 iso 14911 and using calibrated and certified equipment hexavalent chromium was measured using a modified spectrophotometric method based on apha 3500 cr b apha 2017 having a lowest detection limit of 3 μg l an ion chromatographer metrohm 881 compact ic pro and an atomic absorption spectrometer zeenit 700 were used for the measurement of no3 cl so4 2 total chromium crtotal mn and fe the measurement uncertainties of each applied analytical method had been calculated based on previously published methodological approach amanatidou et al 2012 trikilidou et al 2020 the average values and the value range of the measured physicochemical parameters in each aquifer system are presented in table 1 in this work the correlation of cr6 concentration to groundwater hydrochemical zones vadose shallow intermediate deep chemistry was performed more specifically the na cl molar ratios for all wells of the study area were calculated and correlated to cr6 ca2 hco3 molar ratios and nitrates in order to identify the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones additionally cr6 crtotal ratios were calculated to investigate the hydraulic zone equilibrium i e to investigate whether the process of cr6 formation via oxidation of cr3 by manganese oxides prevails finally cr6 correlation to major ions for all samples and for separated clusters of concentrations and sampling periods was performed to determine the effect of pumping ibm spss software was used for the statistical analysis the application of the normality tests kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk showed that the data do not follow a normal distribution however based on the sample size 35 322 data sets pearson s hypothesis tests parametric mcintyre and david 1938 frost 2019 was applied which is widely used on identifying the correlation on water quality parameters the correlations were considered significant if p 0 01 very strong correlation p 0 05 strong correlation p 0 1 weak correlation and insignificant if p 0 1 no correlation 3 results and discussion in the three out of the five studied aquifer systems sarigkiol xirolimni and a part of ptolemais basin high concentrations of naturally occurring cr6 are recorded in aquifers of serpentinized ultramafic rocks and sediments sourced from ultramafic rocks the concentrations of cr6 are proportional to the participation of ophiolite materials in the formation of the aquifer fig 2 approximately 55 out of the 366 analyzed samples i e 15 showed concentrations of total chromium higher or equal to the potability limit of 50 μg l while 43 out of these 55 samples i e 79 had cr6 concentrations also over 50 μg l the concentrations of cr6 presented a great degree of variation among different localities and different sampling periods in these regions with values ranging from 2 μg l to as high as 184 μg l for the requirements of this study the concentrations of cr6 50 μg l were considered low while the concentrations of cr6 50 μg l were considered high based on the crtotal permissible limit in drinking water according to world health organization who 2019 because no limit for cr6 in drinking water have been established 3 1 ion ratios and pumping depth based on literature bourotte et al 2009 the increase of the na cl molar ratio as well as the decrease of ca2 hco3 molar ratios suggest an increase of pumping depth consequently increasing the cr6 concentration alongside the na cl molar ratio rise or and the ca2 hco3 molar ratio reduction shows the geogenic origin of cr6 from the deeper zone of the aquifer therefore the na cl and ca2 hco3 molar ratios for all wells of the study area were calculated and correlation tests pearson test for 95 confidence interval were performed between the aforementioned ratios cr6 nitrates concentrations and other physicochemical parameters tables 2 and 3 the statistical interpretation was performed based on all well samples from wet and dry sampling periods table 2 statistical interpretation for all sampling periods on distinct data clusters based on the cr6 concentration values was also performed table 3 according to the obtained data from field measurements the mean value of the na cl molar ratios in the dry no irrigation period increased compared to the wet irrigation period 2 33 vs 2 24 this is because in the dry period equilibrium conditions prevail in deeper hydraulic zone while in the wet period disequilibration of this hydraulic zone occurs due to pumping leading in mixed quality water the na cl molar ratios of all samples during the irrigation wet period present strong positive correlation p 0 05 to cr6 concentrations implying that it originates from the intermediate and deeper zone of the aquifer moreover the strong and weak negative correlation of na cl to nitrates in both dry and wet period respectively p 0 01 and 0 05 confirms that nitrates originate from the shallow and intermediate zone of the aquifer finally the strong negative correlation of na cl molar ratios to ca2 hco3 ratio in dry period p 0 05 means that in the deeper zone of aquifer the ratio has lower values where equilibrium conditions prevail table 2 3 2 cr6 crtotal ratio and hydraulic zone equilibrium the disequilibration of the hydraulic zone is supported by the ratio of cr6 to total chromium concentrations crtotal according to literature cr6 to crtotal ratios higher than 0 90 indicate that hexavalent chromium is the predominant form of dissolved chromium in natural waters more than 90 of total chromium and that a relative redox equilibrium is obtained vasilatos 2010 in this study the cr6 to crtotal ratio for all samples is lower than the bibliographic values mean value 0 53 it should be noted that the cr6 to crtotal ratio shows the highest values in samples with high concentration 50 μg l of hexavalent chromium more specifically for cr6 50 μg l the cr6 crtotal ratio mean value was 0 48 no redox equilibrium in the aquifer system and fluctuations of concentration values may occur continuously the disturbance of this balance is caused by both the pumping and the enrichment of the aquifer for cr6 50 μg l the cr6 crtotal ratio received higher values mean value 0 81 oxidation and release of cr6 and relative redox equilibrium which can be observed at high depths robertson 1991 due to the increased contact time of water with rocks in addition this increased ratio can be attributed to the low solubility of cr3 compounds in contrast to the highly soluble cr6 compounds cr3 exhibits very low solubility in water less than 20 μg l in the ph range 7 0 10 0 while its lowest solubility approximately 1 μg l is reported at ph around 8 eary and rai 1987 frey et al 2004 mcneill et al 2012 3 3 cr6 correlation to major ions as graphically presented in fig 3 the correlation tests regarding all well samples of all sampling periods 366 samples showed a strong positive correlation of cr6 with ph p 0 01 which means that cr6 concentrations increase with increasing ph pearson tests also revealed strong negative correlation of cr6 and cl p 0 01 so4 2 p 0 01 hco3 p 0 01 and a weak negative correlation between cr6 and ca2 was obtained p 0 1 the negative correlation between cr6 and cl so4 2 hco3 and ca2 is indicative of their different origin with increasing cr6 the concentrations of these ions decrease namely in the deeper zones of aquifer lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 appear suggesting that the water chemistry is not altered by anthropogenic activities 3 4 cr6 clusters correlation to major ions the most significant results of the present study were obtained from the correlations between clusters of different cr6 concentration and the measured physicochemical parameters the clusters were grouped in two major categories clusters for concentrations of cr6 50 μg l and clusters for concentrations of cr6 50 μg l table 3 according to the negative correlation of the na cl molar ratio to the cluster of cr6 50 μg l presented in table 3 it seems that these relatively low concentrations of cr6 correspond to pumping from the shallow and intermediate zone a strong positive correlation between cr6 mn2 and fe2 for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l was observed which means that there is an increase in concentration of these ions with depth higher concentrations of cr6 correspond to the end of irrigation period and the beginning of the dry period when the aquifer level is low and the water is pumped mainly from the deeper zone where cation exchange reactions occur for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l a negative correlation between cr6 mn2 and fe2 cl and so4 2 was observed suggesting that there is a decrease of their concentration in the shallow zone as shown in table 3 and in table 4 a strong positive correlation appears p 0 01 between cr6 and no3 for all samples nevertheless this correlation fades out with the increase of cr6 concentration thus for different cr6 concentration clusters of higher concentrations a gradual decrease of the significant correlation with nitrate ions is observed this correlation becomes weak for the cluster of cr6 50 μg l p 0 1 and disappears in the cluster of cr6 60 μg l p 0 1 this means that high concentrations of cr6 may occur regardless the presence of no3 it is also important that no3 exhibits strong positive correlation only for low concentrations of cr6 which correspond in the shallow zones tables 3 and 4 this behavior is expected based on the effect of pumping depth and aquifer level drop these results are in alignment with the literature reports which state that in the deep aquifer hydraulic zone there is insignificant or null presence of nitrate ions and increased concentrations of cr6 are expected however in many studies cr6 is misleadingly positively correlated with nitrate ions the aforementioned correlation is interpreted as an indirect effect of nitrate ions on the oxidation of trivalent chromium guertin et al 2004 mills et al 2011 stamatis et al 2011 remoundaki et al 2016 in this study according to the analysis and the interpretation of all obtained data from a chemical geological and hydrogeological approach it is concluded that nitrate ions are not associated with high concentrations of cr6 the presence of nitrate ions is attributed to anthropogenic activities penetration of nitrate ions into the aquifer due to fertilization with nitrogen fertilizers while the increased presence of cr6 in deep aquifer zone is attributed to geological causes with the infiltration of water precipitations and irrigation return water nitrate ions accumulate in the shallow zone of the aquifer through the unsaturated zone in the unsaturated zone vadose zone of the aquifer the infiltration of water creates conditions for the oxidation of the trivalent chromium in its ophiolite sediments containing manganese oxides the association of no3 with cr6 especially in the upper layers of the aquifer near the unsaturated zone indicates the leaching of cr6 in the shallow zone which is produced in the unsaturated zone together with precipitated water and or high content in no3 return irrigation water mills et al 2011 as a result low concentrations of hexavalent chromium due to the short contact time and of nitrates at various concentrations appear in the shallow zone cr6 concentration clusters strong positive correlation to mn2 fe2 and no3 in relation to the pumping depth table 4 shows whether or not there is a strong positive correlation p 0 05 between cr6 concentration clusters and mn2 fe2 no3 ion concentration it is evident that there is a positive correlation between cr6 and fe2 ions for cr6 concentrations 10 μg l the presence of soluble iron fe2 species together with cr6 indicates that their formation takes place both in the unsaturated zone low concentrations and in the deeper layers of the aquifer higher concentrations at high concentrations of hexavalent chromium 50 μg l a positive correlation p 0 05 of cr6 to both mn2 and fe2 occurs the presence of soluble iron and manganese species together with cr6 indicates that the high concentrations of cr6 are mainly due to its formation and desorption in the ophiolite sediments of the deep aquifer where there is long contact time and absence of nitrate ions or low presence in the case of mixing with intermediate zone water moreover as can be seen table 4 in the higher cr6 concentration clusters 50 μg l low presence or absence of nitrate ions is observed mainly during pumping from the deeper zone of the aquifer attributed to its formation in the deep zone in which the contact time with the ophiolite sediments is longer the effect of intensive water use is also confirmed by the increasing trend of the cr6 maximum concentration values recorded from 2013 to 2019 in sarigkiol basin fig 4 the measurement data were obtained from this study and from similar studies regarding the specific aquifer systems auth 2016 ntua 2016 vasileiou et al 2019 the study offers a useful tool for assessing the origin of cr6 in different aquifer hydrochemical zones and the effect of water use on cr6 concentration based on simple data and without the need of pumping depth measuring future work is to apply this methodological approach for similar groundwater assessment on other potentially toxic pollutants such as arsenic 4 conclusions the mean value of na cl molar ratios in the dry period increased compared to the wet period because of equilibrium conditions which prevail in the dry period in deeper hydraulic zone the strong positive correlation of cr6 to na cl molar ratios implies that originates from the intermediate and deeper zone of the aquifer lower concentrations of cl and so4 2 and higher concentrations of cr6 appear in the deeper zones of the aquifer suggesting that the water chemistry is not altered by the anthropogenic activities the presence of soluble iron and manganese together with high concentrations of cr6 indicates its geogenic formation in the ophiolite sediments of the deep aquifer where there is a long contact time relative redox equilibrium and higher values of cr6 crtotal ratio moreover higher concentrations 50 μg l of cr6 and absence or low presence of nitrate ions occurs mainly during pumping from the deeper zone of the aquifer lower concentrations of cr6 together with various concentrations of nitrate ions occur during pumping from the shallow and intermediate zone of the aquifer mixed water the low concentrations of cr6 in the shallow zone are attributed to its formation in the ophiolite sediments of the vadose zone where there is a short contact time with infiltrating water no redox equilibrium and lower values of cr6 crtotal ratio statistical interpretation showed that nitrates present strong positive correlation only with low concentrations of cr6 which correspond in the shallow zone of aquifer reinforcing the conclusion that nitrates are attributed to anthropogenic activities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was carried out with the financial support of the
