9235,soil moisture is an important precision agricultural variable that can be used to identify optimal growth conditions infer vegetation stress and maximize crop yield however obtaining soil moisture information with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for such applications remains a challenge the optical trapezoid model optram a shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance and normalized difference vegetation index str ndvi method has previously been used for retrieving soil moisture from optical remote sensing data however the capacity of optram for mapping the high resolution spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture at individual agricultural field scales has yet to be explored here we advance an approach for retrieving and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for individual fields using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery we also propose the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space for identification of irrigation events and crop growth stages such as irrigation start and end dates and dates of initial crop growth maturity and harvest pre existing optram parameterization schemes were evaluated for several crops maize carrot alfalfa and rhodes grass and a new scheme was proposed results show that the original optram model can derive surface soil moisture 1 cm in depth with acceptable coefficients of determination r2 0 43 and root mean square errors rmse 0 09 m3 m3 against ground measurements when uniform dry and wet edge parameters are applied for all crop types the proposed scheme produced improved soil moisture retrievals with an r2 0 65 and rmse 0 05 m3 m3 when the specific dry and wet edge parameters were applied for each specific crop type by analyzing time series of str ndvi we demonstrate that the dynamic str ndvi spaces not only traces the coevolution of surface processes but also quantifies the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and vegetation status thus the proposed dynamic str ndvi spaces based on the high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery can both advance and extend the application of optram and improve the interpretation of soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at agricultural field scales supporting efforts towards irrigation and crop growth monitoring in precision agriculture keywords high resolution remote sensing soil moisture variability precision agriculture optical trapezoid approach sentinel 2 crops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential climate variable central to a range of disciplines including hydrology fares et al 2013 jackson et al 2009 vereecken et al 2008 ecology rasmussen et al 2020 agriculture blango et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 and meteorology and climatology entekhabi et al 2010 maclean 2020 with the increasing influences of climate change depleting freshwater resources and growing populations effective monitoring of soil moisture has become increasingly important in terms of maximizing agricultural production and optimizing water use lu et al 2021 sadri et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 soil moisture monitoring is particularly important for quantifying agricultural irrigation consumption since irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of freshwater resources worldwide with 70 of water withdrawn being used for agricultural irrigation jalilvand et al 2019 thus improved monitoring of agricultural soil moisture can help to advance the goals of both water and food security informing effective agricultural water management decisions and enhancing the sustainable use of water resources mdemu et al 2020 both traditional and even more recent in situ approaches for soil moisture retrieval tend to be restricted to either point based measurements e g soil moisture probes or sample areas with slightly larger footprints from which an average measure of soil moisture is derived e g cosmic ray neutron sensing franz et al 2013 kohli et al 2015 zreda et al 2008 as such obtaining information on the spatial heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture generally precludes the use of in situ measuring methods particularly for capturing variation across large agricultural areas to overcome the inherent limitations of in situ measurements correlations between soil moisture and electromagnetic observations in the visible to near infrared sadeghi et al 2017 wang et al 2018 thermal infrared kang et al 2017 leng et al 2017 ma et al 2013 and microwave kerr et al 2001 wagner et al 1999 zhao et al 2020 spectrum provide an opportunity to infer or estimate soil moisture variability for example satellite based microwave remote sensing has delivered considerable insights through mapping regional to global soil moisture with efforts exploiting a number of dedicated soil moisture satellite missions that have been launched over several decades i e the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 other microwave satellite platforms such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e kawanishi et al 2003 mccabe et al 2005 mladenova et al 2011 amsr2 imaoka et al 2012 and aquarius bindlish et al 2015 lagerloef et al 2013 have also delivered soil moisture related products however given the physics based constraints of passive microwave sensing these remote sensing soil moisture products are unable to resolve intra field information due to their coarse spatial resolution on the other hand active microwave remote sensors have been employed to retrieve region to field scale soil moisture due to their higher spatial resolution for example the european space agency s environmental sattellite advanced synthetic aperture radar envisat asar and sentinel 1 c band sar have driven numerous soil moisture retrieval efforts bauer marschallinger et al 2018 baup et al 2007 ma et al 2020 paloscia et al 2013 pathe et al 2009 however sar based soil moisture retrievals still face many challenges including issues associated with the estimation of surface roughness park et al 2009 shi et al 1997 and the parameterization of vegetation water content huang et al 2015 ma et al 2020 to overcome the influences of vegetation and surface roughness on active microwave sensors as well as the resolution constraint of passive microwave based approaches optical and thermal infrared remote sensing has been used to provide detailed spatial information on soil moisture under cloud free atmospheric conditions such approaches often combine optical and thermal indices with examples including the vegetation temperature condition index goward et al 2002 wang et al 2001 soil water deficit index martinez fernandez et al 2015 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi zhao et al 2017 indeed many of these methods are based on the use of land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or fractional vegetation cover fvc to form a trapezoid or triangle space of pixels and can be broadly categorized as lst ndvi or lst fvc space based methods petropoulos et al 2009 another type of optical thermal method is the apparent thermal inertia kang et al 2017 qin et al 2013 and real thermal inertia liu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 approaches which use the principle that wetter soils have a higher thermal inertia than dry soil however both the lst ndvi lst fvc and thermal inertia based methods require near coincident thermal and optical data which obviously precludes the application of data from satellites that do not provide thermal information such as sentinel 2 or more recent high resolution cubesat data mccabe et al 2017 additionally continued calibration of the lst ndvi methods is often required to obtain updated parameters caused by variations of lst ambrosone et al 2020 chen et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 a recent study presented a pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc methods in which the edges of the trapezoid were determined by a surface energy balance approach leng et al 2022 the work overcame limitations of previous approaches by using statistical regression to determine the trapezoid boundaries enhancing the compatibilities of soil moisture retrieval for pixels over a study region building upon past efforts an optical trapezoid model optram was proposed by sadeghi et al 2017 to estimate soil moisture the model is based on the pixel distribution space formed by the shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance str and ndvi avoiding the need for concurrent optical and thermal data which is beneficial for employing high resolution satellite imagery to obtain detail at agricultural field scales several previous applications of optram ambrosone et al 2020 babaeian et al 2018 chen et al 2020 have focused on the use of high to moderate resolution data over agricultural fields for instance chen et al 2020 and babaeian et al 2018 used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images at 500 m resolution while ambrosone et al 2020 used sentinel 2 images at 10 m resolution with all demonstrating that optram could estimate soil moisture with reasonable accuracy supporting irrigation scheduling yao et al 2022 or agricultural drought monitoring mananze et al 2019 in addition the str ndvi space was generally formed by pixels collected over mixed land surfaces such as forest grassland and shrub babaeian et al 2018 collected from across an extensive study period e g 2010 2017 in babaeian et al 2018 as such they did not consider the impacts of different crops or growth stages in the formation of the str ndvi space different crops at different growing stages are likely to present a range of ndvi and str values ouzemou et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 hence leading to various str ndvi spaces and corresponding dry and wet edge parameters thus it is important to explore the impact of crop type on the formation of both the str ndvi space and on subsequent soil moisture retrievals driven in part by the opportunities of remote sensing to provide precision agricultural advances high resolution soil moisture has been applied towards delivering numerous agricultural insights including the detection of irrigation signals dari et al 2022 ma et al 2022 detection and mapping of irrigated areas bousbih et al 2018 quantification of irrigation water jalilvand et al 2019 and development of irrigation water management models shin and jung 2014 remotely sensed soil moisture has also been applied to reduce the uncertainty in irrigation estimation nie et al 2022 more recently an estimation of global irrigation water use was conducted through integrating multiple remote sensing products of soil moisture and precipitation which provided an improved quantification of irrigation water compared to those obtained from individual satellite observations zhang et al 2022 however most previous studies have tended to utilize moderate to coarse spatial resolution soil moisture products to estimate irrigation water or map the irrigated areas at watershed or regional global scales rather than to assess intra field variability in soil moisture and irrigation dynamics while uncertainties caused by parameter sensitivity forward modeling and retrieval algorithms are some of the most challenging issues in remote sensing of soil moisture beck et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 gruber et al 2020 spatial heterogeneity and representativeness error are the major sources of these uncertainties at the individual pixel scale jin et al 2017 li 2014 since the pixels used to form the str ndvi space are collected from a certain areal extent and temporal range the surfaces they cover are generally heterogeneous in terms of soil moisture and vegetation high resolution sensors such as sentinel 2 provide an improved opportunity to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural fields through analysis of the shape and temporal dynamics of the str ndvi space an aspect that has not been the focus of previous studies thus quantification of the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture using the str ndvi space may improve our understanding of dynamics and uncertainty in soil moisture measurements at the agricultural field scale in this paper we aim to explore knowledge gaps through retrieving soil moisture and quantifying its spatial heterogeneity within individual agricultural fields using high resolution sentinel 2 imagery based on optram an evaluation of the existing optram approach was first performed with an updated scheme subsequently implemented to parameterize the dry and wet edges of str ndvi space the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space was proposed and used to analyze both the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of str and ndvi high resolution soil moisture was retrieved based on the use of the updated parameterization of optram and the spatial heterogeneity of individual agricultural fields and analyzed accordingly the proposed methods and the results presented herein provide a mechanism for farmers and land managers to assess intra field variability in soil moisture and to facilitate management action to maximize production and optimize water use for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site for which moisture retrievals were derived was located in an irrigated desert farmland in al kharj saudi arabia fig 1 the farm consists of more than 40 center pivot fields each with a diameter of between 400 and 800 m the site was selected as it allowed the collection of a dense time series of cloud free sentinel 2 images for detailed assessment of surface process dynamics another reason for selecting the study site was the availability of farming records of planting events and long term soil moisture and irrigation precipitation data to support the validation of soil moisture retrievals the climate of the study area is characterized as extremely dry and hot el kenawy and mccabe 2017 according to the precipitation records during the study period january 2016 to december 2018 there were no rainfall events with amounts over 10 mm detected apart from events on april 10 and november 10 2018 with depths of 24 9 mm and 30 5 mm respectively the average daytime air temperature of the region varies from approximately 19 in january to 42 in the summer months houborg and mccabe 2018b maize alfalfa carrot and rhodes grass were the major crops planted in the farmland from january 2016 to december 2018 some fields were continuously planted with one crop type while other fields alternated between crops 2 2 ground measurements of soil moisture and farming records two automatic weather stations were established in 2015 at the study site and operated throughout the duration of the experiment except june december 2018 for one of the stations one station was placed in the center of a center pivot field aws te10 while the other was located on bare surface aws desert adjacent to another center pivot field see fig 1 the stations measured several key weather variables including radiation precipitation wind speed and direction air temperature pressure and humidity soil moisture temperature and heat flux precipitation recorded by aws te10 predominantly captures field irrigation activity through comparison with precipitation recorded at the aws desert site irrigation and precipitation events could be discriminated all measurements were recorded at 10 min intervals soil moisture and temperature were measured with two stevens hydra probes stevens water monitoring systems inc at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm the soil moisture measurements and precipitation records at aws te10 in january 2016 to may 2018 the station was removed after may 18 2018 were collected for validation of image derived soil moisture retrievals in this study the collected soil moisture measurements at a depth of 5 cm recorded by aws te10 were utilized to calculate normalized soil moisture i e soil moisture normalized by maximum soil moisture θ wet and minimum soil moisture θ dry in the time series in addition to recording the crop type and sowing and harvest dates the irrigation records provided the average monthly irrigation time in hours and the total amount of applied water the recorded number of irrigation hours were used to determine the start and end dates of irrigation and estimate the relative wetness of the soil detailed information on field ids and corresponding crops grown between january 2016 and december 2018 are shown in fig s1 and table s1 of the supplementary material these data were used to identify the specific crop type planted within a specific period and hence to help generate the str ndvi space for the different crops from the remote sensing data the harmonized world soil dataset was collected from www databasin org to retrieve soil properties including soil texture soil porosity and other needed soil parameters see details in table s2 of the supplementary material 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data the sentinel 2 mission drusch et al 2012 gascon 2018 is a constellation of two identical satellites launched on june 23 2015 2 a and march 7 2017 2b that carry multispectral imaging instruments a total of 99 l1c orthorectiﬁed top of atmosphere reﬂectance images over al kharj were collected through the copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home between january 2016 and december 2018 the images only tile t38qrm was used as it covered the full extent of the farm between january 9 and december 4 2016 and between may 23 and june 12 2017 had an interval of 10 days while those between july 2017 and december 2018 had a 5 day interval due to the availability of additional images from the launch of sentinel 2b no data for tile t38qrm were available between december 5 2016 23 may 2017 and between june 12 and july 1 2017 the l1c products were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor plugin louis et al 2016 of the sentinel application platform software to produce l2a bottom of atmosphere reﬂectance products the l2a products had a spatial resolution of 10 m for bands 2 4 and 8 20 m for bands 5 7 8 a 11 and 12 and 60 m for bands 1 9 and 10 bands 8 a and 11 with center wavelength at 865 nm and 1610 nm respectively were resampled from a resolution of 20 10 m using nearest neighbor resampling together with band 4 665 nm 10 m these data were then used to compute ndvi and str see details below 2 3 2 leaf area index estimates to help interpret crop dynamics at a high temporal resolution of the al kharj farmland site an existing lai time series produced by houborg and mccabe 2018a was used the retrieval of lai was validated by houborg and mccabe 2018b and proven to be reliable in this paper the lai products had a spatial resolution of 30 m and included 16 acquisition dates spanning from mid august to late december 2017 with temporal intervals of 7 or 9 days depending on the availability of landsat 8 modis and cubesat images to match the spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 data the lai estimates were resampled to a spatial resolution of 10 m using a nearest neighbor resampling technique with a focus on lai estimates within the te10 field the mean value and standard deviation on each date were computed and applied to help interpret the variation of the str ndvi space 2 4 optical trapezoid model and parameterization 2 4 1 overview of optram the optical trapezoid model optram was initially proposed by sadeghi et al 2017 and has been used for soil moisture retrieval based on optical remote sensing data in the optram the soil moisture was computed by 1 rsm θ θ dry θ wet θ dry str str dry str wet str dry where θ dry and θ wet are soil moisture content θ in unit of m3 m3 at completely dry and saturated states respectively relative soil moisture rsm dimensionless represent the soil moisture content normalized by θ dry and θ wet and str is the transformed reflectance of the shortwave infrared ρ swir band with the following formulation 2 str 1 ρ swir 2 2 ρ swir str wet and str dry represent the str at saturated and dry states respectively here we use the original work of sadeghi et al 2017 to derive str wet and str dry using an assumed linear relationship between soil water content and vegetation water content with the dry and wet edges of the trapezoid formed between the str ndvi spaces defined as 3 str dry i dry s dry ndvi 4 str wet i wet s wet ndvi where i dry and s dry represent the intercept and slope of the dry edge respectively with i wet being the intercept and s wet being the slope of the wet edge and ndvi calculated by deering 1978 5 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρ nir and ρ r are the reflectance of the near infrared nir and red bands respectively introducing eqs 3 and 4 into 1 derives the following equation which we used to calculate normalized soil moisture 6 rsm i dry s dry ndvi str i dry i wet s dry s wet ndvi recently ambrosone et al 2020 found a non linear trend in the dry and wet edges shown in the str ndvi space and modelled the dry and wet edge parameters using the following exponential functions 7 str dry i dry e s dry ndvi 8 str wet i wet e s wet ndvi in addition to the linear functions we also applied the exponential functions to derive normalized soil moisture by introducing eqs 7 and 8 into 1 9 rsm i dry e s dry ndvi str i dry e s dry ndvi i wet e s wet ndvi additionally we proposed an updated scheme in which the dry edge was parameterized using a piecewise function see eq 10 based on the visualization of the pixel distribution and parameterization of the edges using the data of our research area 10 str dry i dry s dry ndvi ndvi d 0 str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 ndvi d 0 where d 0 is the value of ndvi at which the bare surface and vegetation is discriminated i e the surface can be regarded as bare surface if the ndvi value is smaller than d 0 and otherwise the surface can be regarded as vegetated a is the coefficient of the quadratic term both d 0 and a were determined through parameterizing the edges of the str ndvi space introducing eq 10 into 1 derives 11 rsm i dry s dry ndvi str i dry i wet s dry s wet ndvi ndvi d 0 str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 str str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 i wet s wet ndvi ndvi d 0 eqs 6 9 and 11 represent three different schemes for parameterizing the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space to differentiate between the three schemes eq 6 is referred to as original eq 9 as the revised and eq 11 as the new parameterization scheme finally the retrievals of rsm were transformed into soil moisture by multiplying by the soil porosity n that is calculated based on the bulk density and specific gravity ρ s 2 66 g cm 3 of soil with n 1 ρ b ρ s and where ρ b 1 54 g cm 3 2 4 2 parameterization of optram parameterizing the model i e computing the edge parameters i dry s dry i wet and s wet d 0 and a is the key to retrieving soil moisture using the optram babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 this was done by mapping the pixel distribution within the str ndvi space with the edge parameters determined by visual inspection of the str ndvi space so that the majority of the pixels were surrounded by the trapezoid following sadeghi et al 2017 who suggested that visual matching was better than the least square regression we utilized the visual matching in our parameterization of optram to omit points outside the main point cloud of the trapezoid the str ndvi spaces of four crops over the al kharj site were produced and their parameters were calculated and compared to analyze differences in the str ndvi space for different crops to do this we first selected all the center pivot fields with the same crop e g maize identified the pixels inside these fields and then mapped the pixel distribution within the str ndvi space not all pixels inside each center pivot field were extracted for visualizing the pixel distribution because of the following considerations 1 the near boundary portion of the field may not be planted with crops and 2 edge pixels along the boundary of adjoining fields may represent a different class of crops thus instead of including all pixels with a center pivot field we only extracted the pixels within the maximum square inscribing the cycle which not only avoided the overlapping at the junction of two fields but also represented the majority of pixels inside each field as most of the center pivot fields had a diameter of 800 m an inscribing square covering approximately 566 566 m i e 57 57 pixels was extracted from each field extracted pixels of all available center pivot fields planted with a specific crop type over the 3 year time series of sentinel 2 images were deemed sufficient to form a representative str ndvi space that covers various surface conditions and crop growth stages including no growth seasons of the same crop type comparing and analyzing the differences in str ndvi space for different crop types allowed an assessment of the str ndvi crop dependency here we introduce the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space by constructing an str ndvi time series with each str ndvi space representing a single date image the dynamic str ndvi space provides an opportunity to identify the spatial heterogeneity in irrigation and crop status by observing an individual str ndvi space on a specific acquisition date analyzing the time series of str ndvi space also revealed different surface conditions bare surface without irrigation bare surface with irrigation vegetated surface with irrigation etc and key dates of agronomic events or crop growth stages e g start and finish dates of irrigation and the elongation mature and withered stage importantly it is worth noting that the str ndvi space based on a single day image is inefficient to parameterize the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space because it cannot embrace the temporal variability of str and ndvi 2 4 3 quantification of spatial heterogeneity several statistical metrics including the mean value standard deviation skewness and kurtosis coefficients were used to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of ndvi str and the soil moisture retrievals the mean value represents the spatial average of all pixels within a field for which soil moisture was retrieved the temporal variation of the mean values can trace the changes in soil wetness in responding to the irrigation and soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration the standard deviation reveals the degree of dispersion from the mean value the skewness coefficient represents the asymmetry of the soil moisture distribution and the kurtosis coefficient characterizes the degree of soil moisture values converging to the mean value a skewness coefficient of zero means that the soil moisture values are symmetrically distributed and centered on the mean value a negative skewness coefficient indicates that most soil moisture values are distributed on the left side of the mean value i e the majority of pixels have smaller values than the mean value while a positive skewness coefficient indicates that the majority of soil moisture values are distributed at the right side of the mean value a small standard deviation and a large kurtosis coefficient would indicate that most values of soil moisture are distributed in a narrow range close to the mean value which demonstrates low spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture across the fields the kurtosis coefficient can also quantitatively reveal the probability distribution mode with kurtosis 3 displaying a gaussian distribution and kurtosis 1 6 indicating a uniform distribution 3 results 3 1 optram parameters while previous applications of optram have tended to focus on various woody and non woody vegetation types at watershed scales babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 the str ndvi approach presented here were produced from high resolution sentinel 2 image time series over non woody vegetation at the agricultural field scale here pixel distributions within the str ndvi space were explored for different surface conditions including four individual crops bare surface and mixed crops over the center pivot fields of al kharj fig 2 the density of the scatters in fig 2 suggests that most pixels fell into the lower ndvi and str value ranges of the str ndvi space which means that most of the pixels are from bare and dry soil surfaces corresponding to the fallow periods not all pixels represented vegetation and irrigated surfaces even during the growing seasons as pixels with bare surface may occur within a heterogeneous field while the shape of the str ndvi space for different crops were similar i e they closely formed a trapezoid which in consistent with previous findings babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 some subtle differences were noted for example the maximum value of str for maize is close to 3 while that for rhodes grass is less than 2 another difference was observed in both the str and ndvi over bare soil and planted fields where both str and ndvi over bare surfaces were much smaller than when derived from the planted fields from these results we established that the str ndvi spaces were likely to be crop type dependent indicating a need to construct a separate str ndvi space for each crop furthermore both the original eqs 3 and 4 and revised parameterizations eqs 7 and 8 were first applied to fit the dry and wet edges for individual and mixed multiple crops and hence determine the i dry s dry i wet and s wet parameters the fitted dry and wet edge parameters listed in table 1 quantitatively describe the differences in the str ndvi space e g maize showed a larger slope of the wet edge swet than the other crops thus the edge parameters quantitatively demonstrated the difference in str ndvi space for different crop types the determination of the edge parameters in the new scheme was based on the slope of the wet edge sdry for all surface conditions each of the four crops all crops combined and bare surface and its proximity to 0 for lower ndvi values i e ndvi 0 18 with the value of d 0 0 18 being close to the maximum value of ndvi for bare surfaces fig 2e the sdry increases when ndvi values become larger than d0 a is the coefficient of the 2nd order power function which is fitted by the str ndvi space based on our newly proposed scheme see table 1 the new dry edge shown in fig 2 is represented by a solid red line when ndvi is less than d 0 see eq 10 and a dashed red line when nidvi is greater than d 0 providing a better fit with the pixel distribution over the dry edge the newly proposed scheme was applied to retrieve soil moisture together with the original eq 6 and revised schemes eq 9 table 1 the dry and wet edge parameters of the original eqs 3 and 4 revised eqs 7 and 8 and new eqs 4 and 10 parameterization schemes of optram obtained from high spatial resolution sentinel 2 images for different surface conditions i e four different types of crops all crops combined and the bare soil surface 3 2 dynamics of str ndvi space 3 2 1 tracing temporal variation a time series of the str ndvi space that spanned the period from august 31 to december 24 2017 with a 5 day interval for almost the entire time series and covered the te10 field planted with maize september to december was selected to analyze the dynamics of the str ndvi space as can be seen in fig 3 considerable change can be observed in the str ndvi space time series of the selected maize field for the second growing season in 2017 specifically the variation in str vertical direction represents the changes in moisture drying or wetting while the variation in ndvi horizontal direction characterizes the changes in vegetation status these changes in str and ndvi may be helpful to identify the irrigation events and crop growth stages such as irrigation start and end dates and dates of initial crop growth maturity and harvest on august 31 the str ndvi space showed that both str and ndvi had low values which were similar to those of bare unirrigated surface however increased str values although with low ndvi values were observed on september 5 indicating that irrigation had started between august 31 and september 5 subsequently an increasing trend in str values can be seen until the maximum value was reached in early november signifying increasing soil moisture possibly because of increasing irrigation amounts in response to plant growth str values remained high until the end of november the irrigating time was gradually reduced towards the end of november 398 h based on farming records and finally stopped in december 40 h reflected by a drop in str values a small discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements the top panel of fig 3 was attributed to the relative location of the two sensors since the soil moisture sensors and the precipitation sensor were installed 4 m apart the soil moisture sensors were installed near the boundary of the center pivot field where only a small proportion of irrigation water reaches while the precipitation sensor was installed in the field where the sprinkler equipment frequently passed by this discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements may also be attributed to the surface crop growth stage and irrigation events for instance intensive irrigation started from early september early stage of crop growth to ensure enough water supply for crop growth from early october to late november stable and continuous irrigation was applied with part of the water being intercepted by the crop canopy resulting in low recordings of irrigation values by the precipitation sensor however continuous irrigation stable water supply and a reduction in evaporation water loss due to gradually cooler temperatures increased the soil moisture to a relatively high level in november overall the discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements does not alter the fact that the variation of str in the str ndvi time series captured the irrigation events and soil moisture dynamics well approximately two weeks after the irrigation started september 15 the ndvi values gradually increased indicating the beginning of the vegetative stages of maize as can be observed from the right panel of fig 3 the average lai the horizontal bar started to increase around the same time and reached the maximum value on november 5 almost at the same time as ndvi reached its maximum after october 15 most pixels occurred with high ndvi values well above 0 5 indicating the surface was fully covered by maize crops between december 14 and 19 ndvi decreased sharply indicating that harvest occurred within this time interval the decrease in ndvi values corresponds with both the remotely sensed lai measurements and the ground based farming records which showed that harvesting occurred on december 12 14 a sudden decline in lai between december 7 and 16 was observed which was consistent with the decrease in ndvi between november 29 and december 14 further decreases in both ndvi and lai from mid december were observed possibly due to drying of stubble remaining in the field after harvest overall the variations of str and ndvi in the time series of the str ndvi space were supported by the ground measurements of soil moisture and irrigation and remotely sensed lai retrievals 3 2 2 characterizing spatial heterogeneity of ndvi and str in addition to illustrating the dynamic variation of soil moisture and crop growth status in the temporal domain the str ndvi space on a specific day can depict the spatial heterogeneity within a field of soil wetness and crop status which is reflected by the ranges the distance between minimum and maximum values of str and ndvi fig 3 the larger the range the more significant the heterogeneity for example on august 31 pixels presented with small str and ndvi ranges on the contrary an increasing range of str values was observed from september 5 onwards with multiple high density point locations in the str ndvi spaces by september 5 most parts of the field were irrigated except a small dry part with low str values a continuous increase in the ndvi range was observed from september 15 until october 15 when maize grew to cover the majority of the soil surface the large range in ndvi values indicates that the field had patches with either bare surface and slower growing plants where the maize plants had not yet reached their maximum leaf area once the surface was fully covered by the maize plant canopy from october 20 the heterogeneity in ndvi decreased and the range of ndvi values became smaller with most pixels presenting high ndvi values well above 0 5 after irrigation was halted and harvesting was completed the surface became dry november 29 december 14 and gradually bare december 19 december 24 exhibited by a small range of str values and a medium range of ndvi values the spatial heterogeneity of ndvi and its temporal variation can be inferred via the error bars in the lai retrievals which represent the standard deviation of 3600 pixels the ranges of ndvi and spatial variability of lai are well matched for the entire growing season theoretically if the fields are fully homogenous in terms of soil wetness and vegetation growth status the str ndvi as well values of all pixels should be converged to a single value at least densely distributed in a very small range such as those on august 31 however fig 3 shows that both str and ndvi present increasing ranges from september 15 the larger values of str and ndvi indicate that some pixels are from wet parts of the surface covered by vegetation while the smaller values indicate that some pixels represent drier patches with sparser vegetation this variation in str and ndvi values reflects the heterogeneity of the field thus we demonstrated that the dynamic str ndvi space could not only trace the temporal dynamics of soil wetness and crop growth status but also identify their spatial heterogeneity within individual fields 3 3 soil moisture retrieval the soil moisture retrievals over the al kharj farmland site were evaluated based on the ground measurements of soil moisture between january 2016 and may 2018 to test the impact of crop type on soil moisture retrievals rsm was estimated based on 1 the edge parameters for mixed crops i e without considering the crop type and 2 crop specific edge parameters in the second scenario parameters for alfalfa maize and bare surfaces see table 1 were used in different growth cycles the estimated rsm was converted to volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 by multiplication with the soil porosity with retrievals then validated against the ground measurements fig 4a and b show the comparison between sentinel 2 derived soil moisture retrievals and ground measurements under the two scenarios respectively generally the crop type specific retrievals provided better results r2 0 60 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 than those combining the crop types r2 0 46 and rmse 0 09 m3 m3 based on the performance of the optrams with the three different parameterization schemes they all showed good correlations indicating that the optram can capture the overall variation of soil moisture at the agricultural field scale comparatively when combining all crop types the retrievals from the original optram were marginally better r2 0 46 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 than the revised and new optrams r2 0 43 0 44 and rmse 0 07 0 09 m3 m3 when taking crop type into account the new optram produced the best soil moisture retrievals with r2 0 65 and rmse 0 05 m3 m3 while the revised and original optrams both produced r2 0 60 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 these results indicate that crop specific edge parameters improve moisture retrievals compared to the use of edge parameters computed based on multiple combined crops an underestimation of soil moisture is observed in the retrievals which may be attributed to the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space as well as to the sensing depth of the optical sensors the newly proposed optram parameterization scheme was applied to generate a time series of soil moisture maps based on the available sentinel 2 images over the al kharj farmland site a time series of soil moisture maps over the te10 field covering the second growing season of maize in 2017 showed the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture from august 31 to december 24 fig 5 the start of the irrigation in preparation for planting can be identified between august 31 and september 5 and the halt of irrigating after harvest from the end of november to early december can be clearly observed via a significant decrease in mapped soil moisture for individual dates soil moisture retrievals present detailed spatial distribution patterns in relation to irrigation the mapped soil moisture between september 5 and october 5 clearly shows the circular irrigation pattern from the sprinklers attached to the wheeled trusses rotating around the field recently irrigated sections in green can be seen in fig 5 with the location of the sprinklers appearing with particularly high soil moisture in blue the month between october 30 and november 29 had the highest soil moisture retrievals which coincided with the highest ndvi values fig 3 3 4 spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture distribution the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture over the maize field te10 was quantified using a histogram fig 6 and four statistical measures fig 7 i e mean standard deviation and the skewness and kurtosis coefficients during the growing season soil moisture not only showed significant temporal variation but also obvious spatial variation within individual fields from august 31 to december 24 the average soil moisture per field exhibited an increasing trend until the beginning of november with a maximum of 0 24 m3 m3 followed by a decrease to a minimum of 0 06 m3 m3 consistent with figs 3 and 5 the soil moisture on august 31 before irrigation starting and december 19 and 24 after halting irrigation showed low mean values and standard deviations fig 7 at the same times i e before and after irrigation the skewness coefficients were slightly smaller than zero and the kurtosis coefficient was close to a value of 3 which indicated that the soil moisture of natural surfaces without irrigation were close to a normal distribution with low spatial heterogeneity on september 5 two peaks were seen in the histogram fig 6 indicating that the soil moisture distribution within the field was heterogeneous a sharp increase in mean values and standard deviation and a decrease in the kurtosis coefficient fig 7 of soil moisture were observed on the same date further confirming the observation in fig 6 irrigation caused an increase in the overall soil moisture of the field but as the field did not have an even moisture status e g some parts that were previously irrigated had dried out again at the time of image capture because irrigating the whole field for one center pivot round may take several days the spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture increased an increase in skewness from slightly negative on august 31 to slightly positive on september 5 indicated that the wet pixels became more dominant than the dry pixels within the field from september 5 to october 20 the average soil moisture of the field remained stable but spatially heterogonous for example the skewness decreased from positive on september 15 to negative on october 20 more significantly there were almost two identical peaks in soil moisture on september 20 25 and 30 fig 6 and the associated kurtosis coefficients were close to those of a normal distribution fig 7 soil moisture on october 15 and 20 were also close to a normal distribution with smaller spatial heterogeneity compared to the observations in september from october 20 to november 9 both the average values and kurtosis coefficients fig 7 of soil moisture witnessed a distinct increase while the standard deviations were relatively low in the same period the skewness coefficient significantly decreased towards the negative direction this observation indicated that the intensity or speed of the irrigation increased significantly resulting in an increase in the spatial heterogeneity with a low number of irrigated pixels presenting extremely high soil moisture values from november 9 to the end of that month both the average soil moisture and kurtosis coefficients remained high while skewness coefficients reached the largest negative values i e the pixels with smaller compared to the mean value soil moisture values dominated the field continuous irrigation with large amounts of water ensured a stable water supply and decreasing air temperature towards november reduced evapotranspiration potentially causing soil moisture to be distributed within a narrow range with high values 4 discussion we retrieved soil moisture at the agricultural field scale using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 images based on a newly parameterized optical trapezoid model optram three specific objectives were examined 1 the original and a revised scheme for parameterizing the dry and wet edges in the optram approach were evaluated using high resolution sentinel 2 data with a new scheme for dry edge parameterization also proposed 2 the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space was explored to analyze the temporal dynamics of soil moisture and vegetation status and 3 the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture of individual agricultural fields was quantified in the following paragraphs several key issues regarding the use of the optram and quantification of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture are discussed 4 1 performance of optram and parameterization the optram approach has previously demonstrated the capacity for inferring soil moisture from optical remote sensing sadeghi et al 2017 2015 however the details of the method have been modified in several studies for example ambrosone et al 2020 modeled the relations between str and ndvi for dry and wet edges with an exponential function while babaeian et al 2019 and hassanpour et al 2020 replaced ndvi with the soil adjusted vegetation index savi the evaluation presented herein has shown that both the original linear scheme of sadeghi et al 2017 and the revised exponential scheme of ambrosone et al 2020 for str ndvi space parametrization can lead to acceptable soil moisture retrievals in agricultural fields our newly proposed parameterization scheme which modeled the dry edge with a combination of linear and power functions based on sentinel 2 images over an irrigated field yielded improved soil moisture retrievals over maize and alfalfa fields compared to the original and revised schemes overall both the replacement of ndvi by savi babaeian et al 2019 hassanpour et al 2020 and parameterization of str ndvi space ambrosone et al 2020 produced satisfactory soil moisture retrievals demonstrating the feasibility of modifying the parameterization of the method for agricultural fields results show that the key to achieve accurate soil moisture retrievals based on the opatram and its variants is to estimate the parameters correctly both linear and nonlinear models were feasible as long as they fit the pixel distribution of the str ndvi spaces 4 2 impact of crop type on optram parametrization to the best of our knowledge this work is the first application of the optram to consider the impact of crop type on the construction of str ndvi space and estimation of the dry and wet edge parameters our results showed that the edge parameters of str ndvi space constructed by pixels from different crops differed from each other when the crop specific edge parameters were used in optram the accuracy of the soil moisture retrievals improved compared to the use of edge parameters of mixed crops the differences in soil moisture from the three original revised and new parameterizations were smaller than the difference between the two scenarios considering crop type or not see fig 4 fundamentally the optram assumes that surface soil moisture is correlated with the root zone soil moisture via the spectral response of the crop canopy to soil moisture deficit in the root zone sadeghi et al 2017 while the extent of the root zone depends on the crop type santos et al 2014 thus the impact of soil moisture on vegetation spectral characteristics is vegetation type dependent the soil moisture retrievals will likely be improved if accurate vegetation classification data can be integrated into the optram to estimate vegetation type dependent parameters of the str ndvi space hassanpour et al 2020 4 3 dynamic str ndvi spaces for time series analysis and spatial heterogeneity quantification similar to the dynamic variation of str ndvi space constructed from modis data in chen et al 2020 our str ndvi space constructed using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 data showed dynamic variation between different acquisition dates the dynamic variation reflected the agricultural processes such as the soil wetness variation and crop growth development different to the curve based time series of soil moisture or vegetation descriptors e g ndvi lai the dynamic str ndvi spaces can simultaneously show the variation of each individual process and their coevolution using 2 d scatterplots this point is especially important for revealing the coevolution of soil wetness and crop growth within irrigated agricultural fields and to identify the key events and stages of crop growth and their relations as they affect the timing and scheduling of management inputs zelikova et al 2015 through analysis of the dynamic str ndvi spaces various surface conditions e g the irrigated and non irrigated bare and vegetated can be discriminated and the key agronomic events and crop growth stages e g start and halt of irrigation crop emergence and maturity and time of harvesting can be identified for example the obvious increase in str see fig 3 indicated the application of irrigation and the start of a new planting and growth cycle while the increase in ndvi and lai approximately two weeks later indicated the start of crop growth thus given the high temporal resolution features of the sentinel 2 data we can see that the coevolution of str and ndvi depicted by the dynamic str ndvi spaces reveals the general process of irrigated agriculture in arid regions in addition to tracing the coevolution of soil wetness and crop growth an important aspect of the dynamic str ndvi space is to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and crop growth neither the curved based time series analysis nor the previous static str ndvi space are feasible the spatial heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of soil moisture which is correlated with the spatial scale of the imagery used for mapping li et al 2017 the spatial heterogeneity of continuous variables e g soil moisture can be quantified based on analyzing the degree of departure from randomness and that of categorical variables e g landscape can be quantified by using landscape and ecological features jin et al 2017 for example garrigues et al 2006 quantified the spatial heterogeneity of landscape vegetation cover using modeling of a variogram of high spatial resolution ndvi data while foster et al 2019 assessed the landscape scale heterogeneity of irrigation water by jointly using high resolution remote sensing and in situ observations thus we can see that the quantification of spatial heterogeneity of land surface variables continuous and categorical relies on the availability of high resolution observations based on the high spatial resolution sentinel 2 observations we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture by combining dynamic str ndvi spaces and statistical methods in addition to the str ndvi space the histogram of soil moisture and four statistical measures mean value standard deviation skewness and kurtosis coefficients of all pixels within an individual field quantitatively estimated the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture which not only traced the temporal dynamics but also quantified the spatial distribution pattern of soil moisture caused by the irrigation water supply and evapotranspiration water loss finally it is worth emphasizing that a single str ndvi space from a single day cannot be used to parameterize the wet and dry edges because of limited representativeness although the dynamic str ndvi spaces consisting of a time series of str ndvi spaces are useful for analyzing the coevolution of surface processes and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity varying crop growth status cannot be assessed from just a single image thus a time series of all images that covers at least a complete growing cycle should be applied to construct a complete str ndvi space for estimating the wet and dry edge parameters then the dynamic str ndvi spaces can be used to analyze the coevolution of surface processes quantify the spatial heterogeneity of fields and provide retrospective metrics for evaluation of crop activities to inform management decisions for future growing seasons 4 4 limitations and further investigation although an acceptable accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was obtained several critical issues in terms of transferability of the optram approach to other regions remain to be addressed and will require further investigations the first issue is the availability of data with limited or no cloud contamination it is worth noting that the presented work was conducted over a region where the sentinel 2 images were mainly cloud free which enabled the availability of a high quality image time series that was well suited for the parameterization of the dry and wet edges of the trapezoid sadeghi et al 2017 hence we were able to obtain high density sentinel 2 image time series that could capture the temporal variability in both crop growth and irrigation practices however in many agricultural regions especially with rainfed agriculture strong atmospheric convection leads to frequent occurrence of cloudy and rainy weather douglas et al 2009 making it difficult to obtain high quality data to support the development of the optram method to address this issue several potential solutions might be applicable 1 to obtain cloud free images via a longer time series to capture as much detail as possible on crop growth and surface changes 2 to refine the cloud detection and reduction algorithms to improve the quality of the remote sensing images 3 explore imagery with denser time series or higher resolution data e g cubesat data aragon et al 2018 johansen et al 2022 or 4 generate gap filled time sequences that dynamically update the underlying surface conditions mariethoz et al 2012 yin et al 2017 another issue is the model formulation and edge parameterizations we have shown that the formulation of the optram edges can for example be linear exponential or a power function thus improving the edge parameterization by trying additional formulations could potentially enhance the performance of the optram method and accuracy of soil moisture retrieval sadeghi et al 2017 5 conclusions through a combination of high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery and the optical trapezoid model optram this paper systematically evaluated different parameterization schemes under varying land surface cover and conditions four individual crops mixed crops and bare surface and proposed an improved scheme for targeted agricultural application our evaluation verified that the original version of optram can infer soil moisture in an agricultural setting with an acceptable accuracy r2 0 43 and rmse 0 09 m3 m3 however when integrating crop specific information into the optram and estimating the dry and wet edge parameters from str ndvi space using a more tailored parameterization scheme soil moisture estimates were improved considerably 0 60 r2 0 65 and 0 05 rmse 0 06 m3 m3 likewise the piecewise function scheme that was proposed for calculating the dry edge resulted in improved soil moisture retrieval compared to the retrievals with the original and revised schemes tracing the coevolution of surface processes advances the application in precision agriculture allowing an enhanced spatial representation of high resolution optical remote sensing based soil moisture retrievals apart from providing an improved characterization of landscape scale processes the approach may facilitate an improved understanding of the spatial distribution of soil moisture within individual agricultural fields providing precision instructions for irrigation management and crop growth monitoring funding the

9235,soil moisture is an important precision agricultural variable that can be used to identify optimal growth conditions infer vegetation stress and maximize crop yield however obtaining soil moisture information with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for such applications remains a challenge the optical trapezoid model optram a shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance and normalized difference vegetation index str ndvi method has previously been used for retrieving soil moisture from optical remote sensing data however the capacity of optram for mapping the high resolution spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture at individual agricultural field scales has yet to be explored here we advance an approach for retrieving and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for individual fields using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery we also propose the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space for identification of irrigation events and crop growth stages such as irrigation start and end dates and dates of initial crop growth maturity and harvest pre existing optram parameterization schemes were evaluated for several crops maize carrot alfalfa and rhodes grass and a new scheme was proposed results show that the original optram model can derive surface soil moisture 1 cm in depth with acceptable coefficients of determination r2 0 43 and root mean square errors rmse 0 09 m3 m3 against ground measurements when uniform dry and wet edge parameters are applied for all crop types the proposed scheme produced improved soil moisture retrievals with an r2 0 65 and rmse 0 05 m3 m3 when the specific dry and wet edge parameters were applied for each specific crop type by analyzing time series of str ndvi we demonstrate that the dynamic str ndvi spaces not only traces the coevolution of surface processes but also quantifies the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and vegetation status thus the proposed dynamic str ndvi spaces based on the high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery can both advance and extend the application of optram and improve the interpretation of soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at agricultural field scales supporting efforts towards irrigation and crop growth monitoring in precision agriculture keywords high resolution remote sensing soil moisture variability precision agriculture optical trapezoid approach sentinel 2 crops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture is an essential climate variable central to a range of disciplines including hydrology fares et al 2013 jackson et al 2009 vereecken et al 2008 ecology rasmussen et al 2020 agriculture blango et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 and meteorology and climatology entekhabi et al 2010 maclean 2020 with the increasing influences of climate change depleting freshwater resources and growing populations effective monitoring of soil moisture has become increasingly important in terms of maximizing agricultural production and optimizing water use lu et al 2021 sadri et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 soil moisture monitoring is particularly important for quantifying agricultural irrigation consumption since irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of freshwater resources worldwide with 70 of water withdrawn being used for agricultural irrigation jalilvand et al 2019 thus improved monitoring of agricultural soil moisture can help to advance the goals of both water and food security informing effective agricultural water management decisions and enhancing the sustainable use of water resources mdemu et al 2020 both traditional and even more recent in situ approaches for soil moisture retrieval tend to be restricted to either point based measurements e g soil moisture probes or sample areas with slightly larger footprints from which an average measure of soil moisture is derived e g cosmic ray neutron sensing franz et al 2013 kohli et al 2015 zreda et al 2008 as such obtaining information on the spatial heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture generally precludes the use of in situ measuring methods particularly for capturing variation across large agricultural areas to overcome the inherent limitations of in situ measurements correlations between soil moisture and electromagnetic observations in the visible to near infrared sadeghi et al 2017 wang et al 2018 thermal infrared kang et al 2017 leng et al 2017 ma et al 2013 and microwave kerr et al 2001 wagner et al 1999 zhao et al 2020 spectrum provide an opportunity to infer or estimate soil moisture variability for example satellite based microwave remote sensing has delivered considerable insights through mapping regional to global soil moisture with efforts exploiting a number of dedicated soil moisture satellite missions that have been launched over several decades i e the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 other microwave satellite platforms such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e kawanishi et al 2003 mccabe et al 2005 mladenova et al 2011 amsr2 imaoka et al 2012 and aquarius bindlish et al 2015 lagerloef et al 2013 have also delivered soil moisture related products however given the physics based constraints of passive microwave sensing these remote sensing soil moisture products are unable to resolve intra field information due to their coarse spatial resolution on the other hand active microwave remote sensors have been employed to retrieve region to field scale soil moisture due to their higher spatial resolution for example the european space agency s environmental sattellite advanced synthetic aperture radar envisat asar and sentinel 1 c band sar have driven numerous soil moisture retrieval efforts bauer marschallinger et al 2018 baup et al 2007 ma et al 2020 paloscia et al 2013 pathe et al 2009 however sar based soil moisture retrievals still face many challenges including issues associated with the estimation of surface roughness park et al 2009 shi et al 1997 and the parameterization of vegetation water content huang et al 2015 ma et al 2020 to overcome the influences of vegetation and surface roughness on active microwave sensors as well as the resolution constraint of passive microwave based approaches optical and thermal infrared remote sensing has been used to provide detailed spatial information on soil moisture under cloud free atmospheric conditions such approaches often combine optical and thermal indices with examples including the vegetation temperature condition index goward et al 2002 wang et al 2001 soil water deficit index martinez fernandez et al 2015 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi zhao et al 2017 indeed many of these methods are based on the use of land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or fractional vegetation cover fvc to form a trapezoid or triangle space of pixels and can be broadly categorized as lst ndvi or lst fvc space based methods petropoulos et al 2009 another type of optical thermal method is the apparent thermal inertia kang et al 2017 qin et al 2013 and real thermal inertia liu et al 2020 ma et al 2013 approaches which use the principle that wetter soils have a higher thermal inertia than dry soil however both the lst ndvi lst fvc and thermal inertia based methods require near coincident thermal and optical data which obviously precludes the application of data from satellites that do not provide thermal information such as sentinel 2 or more recent high resolution cubesat data mccabe et al 2017 additionally continued calibration of the lst ndvi methods is often required to obtain updated parameters caused by variations of lst ambrosone et al 2020 chen et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2017 a recent study presented a pixel to pixel scheme of the lst fvc methods in which the edges of the trapezoid were determined by a surface energy balance approach leng et al 2022 the work overcame limitations of previous approaches by using statistical regression to determine the trapezoid boundaries enhancing the compatibilities of soil moisture retrieval for pixels over a study region building upon past efforts an optical trapezoid model optram was proposed by sadeghi et al 2017 to estimate soil moisture the model is based on the pixel distribution space formed by the shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance str and ndvi avoiding the need for concurrent optical and thermal data which is beneficial for employing high resolution satellite imagery to obtain detail at agricultural field scales several previous applications of optram ambrosone et al 2020 babaeian et al 2018 chen et al 2020 have focused on the use of high to moderate resolution data over agricultural fields for instance chen et al 2020 and babaeian et al 2018 used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images at 500 m resolution while ambrosone et al 2020 used sentinel 2 images at 10 m resolution with all demonstrating that optram could estimate soil moisture with reasonable accuracy supporting irrigation scheduling yao et al 2022 or agricultural drought monitoring mananze et al 2019 in addition the str ndvi space was generally formed by pixels collected over mixed land surfaces such as forest grassland and shrub babaeian et al 2018 collected from across an extensive study period e g 2010 2017 in babaeian et al 2018 as such they did not consider the impacts of different crops or growth stages in the formation of the str ndvi space different crops at different growing stages are likely to present a range of ndvi and str values ouzemou et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 hence leading to various str ndvi spaces and corresponding dry and wet edge parameters thus it is important to explore the impact of crop type on the formation of both the str ndvi space and on subsequent soil moisture retrievals driven in part by the opportunities of remote sensing to provide precision agricultural advances high resolution soil moisture has been applied towards delivering numerous agricultural insights including the detection of irrigation signals dari et al 2022 ma et al 2022 detection and mapping of irrigated areas bousbih et al 2018 quantification of irrigation water jalilvand et al 2019 and development of irrigation water management models shin and jung 2014 remotely sensed soil moisture has also been applied to reduce the uncertainty in irrigation estimation nie et al 2022 more recently an estimation of global irrigation water use was conducted through integrating multiple remote sensing products of soil moisture and precipitation which provided an improved quantification of irrigation water compared to those obtained from individual satellite observations zhang et al 2022 however most previous studies have tended to utilize moderate to coarse spatial resolution soil moisture products to estimate irrigation water or map the irrigated areas at watershed or regional global scales rather than to assess intra field variability in soil moisture and irrigation dynamics while uncertainties caused by parameter sensitivity forward modeling and retrieval algorithms are some of the most challenging issues in remote sensing of soil moisture beck et al 2021 dorigo et al 2021 gruber et al 2020 spatial heterogeneity and representativeness error are the major sources of these uncertainties at the individual pixel scale jin et al 2017 li 2014 since the pixels used to form the str ndvi space are collected from a certain areal extent and temporal range the surfaces they cover are generally heterogeneous in terms of soil moisture and vegetation high resolution sensors such as sentinel 2 provide an improved opportunity to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of agricultural fields through analysis of the shape and temporal dynamics of the str ndvi space an aspect that has not been the focus of previous studies thus quantification of the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture using the str ndvi space may improve our understanding of dynamics and uncertainty in soil moisture measurements at the agricultural field scale in this paper we aim to explore knowledge gaps through retrieving soil moisture and quantifying its spatial heterogeneity within individual agricultural fields using high resolution sentinel 2 imagery based on optram an evaluation of the existing optram approach was first performed with an updated scheme subsequently implemented to parameterize the dry and wet edges of str ndvi space the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space was proposed and used to analyze both the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of str and ndvi high resolution soil moisture was retrieved based on the use of the updated parameterization of optram and the spatial heterogeneity of individual agricultural fields and analyzed accordingly the proposed methods and the results presented herein provide a mechanism for farmers and land managers to assess intra field variability in soil moisture and to facilitate management action to maximize production and optimize water use for irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site for which moisture retrievals were derived was located in an irrigated desert farmland in al kharj saudi arabia fig 1 the farm consists of more than 40 center pivot fields each with a diameter of between 400 and 800 m the site was selected as it allowed the collection of a dense time series of cloud free sentinel 2 images for detailed assessment of surface process dynamics another reason for selecting the study site was the availability of farming records of planting events and long term soil moisture and irrigation precipitation data to support the validation of soil moisture retrievals the climate of the study area is characterized as extremely dry and hot el kenawy and mccabe 2017 according to the precipitation records during the study period january 2016 to december 2018 there were no rainfall events with amounts over 10 mm detected apart from events on april 10 and november 10 2018 with depths of 24 9 mm and 30 5 mm respectively the average daytime air temperature of the region varies from approximately 19 in january to 42 in the summer months houborg and mccabe 2018b maize alfalfa carrot and rhodes grass were the major crops planted in the farmland from january 2016 to december 2018 some fields were continuously planted with one crop type while other fields alternated between crops 2 2 ground measurements of soil moisture and farming records two automatic weather stations were established in 2015 at the study site and operated throughout the duration of the experiment except june december 2018 for one of the stations one station was placed in the center of a center pivot field aws te10 while the other was located on bare surface aws desert adjacent to another center pivot field see fig 1 the stations measured several key weather variables including radiation precipitation wind speed and direction air temperature pressure and humidity soil moisture temperature and heat flux precipitation recorded by aws te10 predominantly captures field irrigation activity through comparison with precipitation recorded at the aws desert site irrigation and precipitation events could be discriminated all measurements were recorded at 10 min intervals soil moisture and temperature were measured with two stevens hydra probes stevens water monitoring systems inc at depths of 5 cm and 10 cm the soil moisture measurements and precipitation records at aws te10 in january 2016 to may 2018 the station was removed after may 18 2018 were collected for validation of image derived soil moisture retrievals in this study the collected soil moisture measurements at a depth of 5 cm recorded by aws te10 were utilized to calculate normalized soil moisture i e soil moisture normalized by maximum soil moisture θ wet and minimum soil moisture θ dry in the time series in addition to recording the crop type and sowing and harvest dates the irrigation records provided the average monthly irrigation time in hours and the total amount of applied water the recorded number of irrigation hours were used to determine the start and end dates of irrigation and estimate the relative wetness of the soil detailed information on field ids and corresponding crops grown between january 2016 and december 2018 are shown in fig s1 and table s1 of the supplementary material these data were used to identify the specific crop type planted within a specific period and hence to help generate the str ndvi space for the different crops from the remote sensing data the harmonized world soil dataset was collected from www databasin org to retrieve soil properties including soil texture soil porosity and other needed soil parameters see details in table s2 of the supplementary material 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 sentinel 2 data the sentinel 2 mission drusch et al 2012 gascon 2018 is a constellation of two identical satellites launched on june 23 2015 2 a and march 7 2017 2b that carry multispectral imaging instruments a total of 99 l1c orthorectiﬁed top of atmosphere reﬂectance images over al kharj were collected through the copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu dhus home between january 2016 and december 2018 the images only tile t38qrm was used as it covered the full extent of the farm between january 9 and december 4 2016 and between may 23 and june 12 2017 had an interval of 10 days while those between july 2017 and december 2018 had a 5 day interval due to the availability of additional images from the launch of sentinel 2b no data for tile t38qrm were available between december 5 2016 23 may 2017 and between june 12 and july 1 2017 the l1c products were atmospherically corrected using the sen2cor plugin louis et al 2016 of the sentinel application platform software to produce l2a bottom of atmosphere reﬂectance products the l2a products had a spatial resolution of 10 m for bands 2 4 and 8 20 m for bands 5 7 8 a 11 and 12 and 60 m for bands 1 9 and 10 bands 8 a and 11 with center wavelength at 865 nm and 1610 nm respectively were resampled from a resolution of 20 10 m using nearest neighbor resampling together with band 4 665 nm 10 m these data were then used to compute ndvi and str see details below 2 3 2 leaf area index estimates to help interpret crop dynamics at a high temporal resolution of the al kharj farmland site an existing lai time series produced by houborg and mccabe 2018a was used the retrieval of lai was validated by houborg and mccabe 2018b and proven to be reliable in this paper the lai products had a spatial resolution of 30 m and included 16 acquisition dates spanning from mid august to late december 2017 with temporal intervals of 7 or 9 days depending on the availability of landsat 8 modis and cubesat images to match the spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 data the lai estimates were resampled to a spatial resolution of 10 m using a nearest neighbor resampling technique with a focus on lai estimates within the te10 field the mean value and standard deviation on each date were computed and applied to help interpret the variation of the str ndvi space 2 4 optical trapezoid model and parameterization 2 4 1 overview of optram the optical trapezoid model optram was initially proposed by sadeghi et al 2017 and has been used for soil moisture retrieval based on optical remote sensing data in the optram the soil moisture was computed by 1 rsm θ θ dry θ wet θ dry str str dry str wet str dry where θ dry and θ wet are soil moisture content θ in unit of m3 m3 at completely dry and saturated states respectively relative soil moisture rsm dimensionless represent the soil moisture content normalized by θ dry and θ wet and str is the transformed reflectance of the shortwave infrared ρ swir band with the following formulation 2 str 1 ρ swir 2 2 ρ swir str wet and str dry represent the str at saturated and dry states respectively here we use the original work of sadeghi et al 2017 to derive str wet and str dry using an assumed linear relationship between soil water content and vegetation water content with the dry and wet edges of the trapezoid formed between the str ndvi spaces defined as 3 str dry i dry s dry ndvi 4 str wet i wet s wet ndvi where i dry and s dry represent the intercept and slope of the dry edge respectively with i wet being the intercept and s wet being the slope of the wet edge and ndvi calculated by deering 1978 5 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρ nir and ρ r are the reflectance of the near infrared nir and red bands respectively introducing eqs 3 and 4 into 1 derives the following equation which we used to calculate normalized soil moisture 6 rsm i dry s dry ndvi str i dry i wet s dry s wet ndvi recently ambrosone et al 2020 found a non linear trend in the dry and wet edges shown in the str ndvi space and modelled the dry and wet edge parameters using the following exponential functions 7 str dry i dry e s dry ndvi 8 str wet i wet e s wet ndvi in addition to the linear functions we also applied the exponential functions to derive normalized soil moisture by introducing eqs 7 and 8 into 1 9 rsm i dry e s dry ndvi str i dry e s dry ndvi i wet e s wet ndvi additionally we proposed an updated scheme in which the dry edge was parameterized using a piecewise function see eq 10 based on the visualization of the pixel distribution and parameterization of the edges using the data of our research area 10 str dry i dry s dry ndvi ndvi d 0 str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 ndvi d 0 where d 0 is the value of ndvi at which the bare surface and vegetation is discriminated i e the surface can be regarded as bare surface if the ndvi value is smaller than d 0 and otherwise the surface can be regarded as vegetated a is the coefficient of the quadratic term both d 0 and a were determined through parameterizing the edges of the str ndvi space introducing eq 10 into 1 derives 11 rsm i dry s dry ndvi str i dry i wet s dry s wet ndvi ndvi d 0 str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 str str d 0 a ndvi d 0 2 i wet s wet ndvi ndvi d 0 eqs 6 9 and 11 represent three different schemes for parameterizing the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space to differentiate between the three schemes eq 6 is referred to as original eq 9 as the revised and eq 11 as the new parameterization scheme finally the retrievals of rsm were transformed into soil moisture by multiplying by the soil porosity n that is calculated based on the bulk density and specific gravity ρ s 2 66 g cm 3 of soil with n 1 ρ b ρ s and where ρ b 1 54 g cm 3 2 4 2 parameterization of optram parameterizing the model i e computing the edge parameters i dry s dry i wet and s wet d 0 and a is the key to retrieving soil moisture using the optram babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 this was done by mapping the pixel distribution within the str ndvi space with the edge parameters determined by visual inspection of the str ndvi space so that the majority of the pixels were surrounded by the trapezoid following sadeghi et al 2017 who suggested that visual matching was better than the least square regression we utilized the visual matching in our parameterization of optram to omit points outside the main point cloud of the trapezoid the str ndvi spaces of four crops over the al kharj site were produced and their parameters were calculated and compared to analyze differences in the str ndvi space for different crops to do this we first selected all the center pivot fields with the same crop e g maize identified the pixels inside these fields and then mapped the pixel distribution within the str ndvi space not all pixels inside each center pivot field were extracted for visualizing the pixel distribution because of the following considerations 1 the near boundary portion of the field may not be planted with crops and 2 edge pixels along the boundary of adjoining fields may represent a different class of crops thus instead of including all pixels with a center pivot field we only extracted the pixels within the maximum square inscribing the cycle which not only avoided the overlapping at the junction of two fields but also represented the majority of pixels inside each field as most of the center pivot fields had a diameter of 800 m an inscribing square covering approximately 566 566 m i e 57 57 pixels was extracted from each field extracted pixels of all available center pivot fields planted with a specific crop type over the 3 year time series of sentinel 2 images were deemed sufficient to form a representative str ndvi space that covers various surface conditions and crop growth stages including no growth seasons of the same crop type comparing and analyzing the differences in str ndvi space for different crop types allowed an assessment of the str ndvi crop dependency here we introduce the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space by constructing an str ndvi time series with each str ndvi space representing a single date image the dynamic str ndvi space provides an opportunity to identify the spatial heterogeneity in irrigation and crop status by observing an individual str ndvi space on a specific acquisition date analyzing the time series of str ndvi space also revealed different surface conditions bare surface without irrigation bare surface with irrigation vegetated surface with irrigation etc and key dates of agronomic events or crop growth stages e g start and finish dates of irrigation and the elongation mature and withered stage importantly it is worth noting that the str ndvi space based on a single day image is inefficient to parameterize the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space because it cannot embrace the temporal variability of str and ndvi 2 4 3 quantification of spatial heterogeneity several statistical metrics including the mean value standard deviation skewness and kurtosis coefficients were used to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of ndvi str and the soil moisture retrievals the mean value represents the spatial average of all pixels within a field for which soil moisture was retrieved the temporal variation of the mean values can trace the changes in soil wetness in responding to the irrigation and soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration the standard deviation reveals the degree of dispersion from the mean value the skewness coefficient represents the asymmetry of the soil moisture distribution and the kurtosis coefficient characterizes the degree of soil moisture values converging to the mean value a skewness coefficient of zero means that the soil moisture values are symmetrically distributed and centered on the mean value a negative skewness coefficient indicates that most soil moisture values are distributed on the left side of the mean value i e the majority of pixels have smaller values than the mean value while a positive skewness coefficient indicates that the majority of soil moisture values are distributed at the right side of the mean value a small standard deviation and a large kurtosis coefficient would indicate that most values of soil moisture are distributed in a narrow range close to the mean value which demonstrates low spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture across the fields the kurtosis coefficient can also quantitatively reveal the probability distribution mode with kurtosis 3 displaying a gaussian distribution and kurtosis 1 6 indicating a uniform distribution 3 results 3 1 optram parameters while previous applications of optram have tended to focus on various woody and non woody vegetation types at watershed scales babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 the str ndvi approach presented here were produced from high resolution sentinel 2 image time series over non woody vegetation at the agricultural field scale here pixel distributions within the str ndvi space were explored for different surface conditions including four individual crops bare surface and mixed crops over the center pivot fields of al kharj fig 2 the density of the scatters in fig 2 suggests that most pixels fell into the lower ndvi and str value ranges of the str ndvi space which means that most of the pixels are from bare and dry soil surfaces corresponding to the fallow periods not all pixels represented vegetation and irrigated surfaces even during the growing seasons as pixels with bare surface may occur within a heterogeneous field while the shape of the str ndvi space for different crops were similar i e they closely formed a trapezoid which in consistent with previous findings babaeian et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2017 some subtle differences were noted for example the maximum value of str for maize is close to 3 while that for rhodes grass is less than 2 another difference was observed in both the str and ndvi over bare soil and planted fields where both str and ndvi over bare surfaces were much smaller than when derived from the planted fields from these results we established that the str ndvi spaces were likely to be crop type dependent indicating a need to construct a separate str ndvi space for each crop furthermore both the original eqs 3 and 4 and revised parameterizations eqs 7 and 8 were first applied to fit the dry and wet edges for individual and mixed multiple crops and hence determine the i dry s dry i wet and s wet parameters the fitted dry and wet edge parameters listed in table 1 quantitatively describe the differences in the str ndvi space e g maize showed a larger slope of the wet edge swet than the other crops thus the edge parameters quantitatively demonstrated the difference in str ndvi space for different crop types the determination of the edge parameters in the new scheme was based on the slope of the wet edge sdry for all surface conditions each of the four crops all crops combined and bare surface and its proximity to 0 for lower ndvi values i e ndvi 0 18 with the value of d 0 0 18 being close to the maximum value of ndvi for bare surfaces fig 2e the sdry increases when ndvi values become larger than d0 a is the coefficient of the 2nd order power function which is fitted by the str ndvi space based on our newly proposed scheme see table 1 the new dry edge shown in fig 2 is represented by a solid red line when ndvi is less than d 0 see eq 10 and a dashed red line when nidvi is greater than d 0 providing a better fit with the pixel distribution over the dry edge the newly proposed scheme was applied to retrieve soil moisture together with the original eq 6 and revised schemes eq 9 table 1 the dry and wet edge parameters of the original eqs 3 and 4 revised eqs 7 and 8 and new eqs 4 and 10 parameterization schemes of optram obtained from high spatial resolution sentinel 2 images for different surface conditions i e four different types of crops all crops combined and the bare soil surface 3 2 dynamics of str ndvi space 3 2 1 tracing temporal variation a time series of the str ndvi space that spanned the period from august 31 to december 24 2017 with a 5 day interval for almost the entire time series and covered the te10 field planted with maize september to december was selected to analyze the dynamics of the str ndvi space as can be seen in fig 3 considerable change can be observed in the str ndvi space time series of the selected maize field for the second growing season in 2017 specifically the variation in str vertical direction represents the changes in moisture drying or wetting while the variation in ndvi horizontal direction characterizes the changes in vegetation status these changes in str and ndvi may be helpful to identify the irrigation events and crop growth stages such as irrigation start and end dates and dates of initial crop growth maturity and harvest on august 31 the str ndvi space showed that both str and ndvi had low values which were similar to those of bare unirrigated surface however increased str values although with low ndvi values were observed on september 5 indicating that irrigation had started between august 31 and september 5 subsequently an increasing trend in str values can be seen until the maximum value was reached in early november signifying increasing soil moisture possibly because of increasing irrigation amounts in response to plant growth str values remained high until the end of november the irrigating time was gradually reduced towards the end of november 398 h based on farming records and finally stopped in december 40 h reflected by a drop in str values a small discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements the top panel of fig 3 was attributed to the relative location of the two sensors since the soil moisture sensors and the precipitation sensor were installed 4 m apart the soil moisture sensors were installed near the boundary of the center pivot field where only a small proportion of irrigation water reaches while the precipitation sensor was installed in the field where the sprinkler equipment frequently passed by this discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements may also be attributed to the surface crop growth stage and irrigation events for instance intensive irrigation started from early september early stage of crop growth to ensure enough water supply for crop growth from early october to late november stable and continuous irrigation was applied with part of the water being intercepted by the crop canopy resulting in low recordings of irrigation values by the precipitation sensor however continuous irrigation stable water supply and a reduction in evaporation water loss due to gradually cooler temperatures increased the soil moisture to a relatively high level in november overall the discrepancy between the observed soil moisture and irrigation measurements does not alter the fact that the variation of str in the str ndvi time series captured the irrigation events and soil moisture dynamics well approximately two weeks after the irrigation started september 15 the ndvi values gradually increased indicating the beginning of the vegetative stages of maize as can be observed from the right panel of fig 3 the average lai the horizontal bar started to increase around the same time and reached the maximum value on november 5 almost at the same time as ndvi reached its maximum after october 15 most pixels occurred with high ndvi values well above 0 5 indicating the surface was fully covered by maize crops between december 14 and 19 ndvi decreased sharply indicating that harvest occurred within this time interval the decrease in ndvi values corresponds with both the remotely sensed lai measurements and the ground based farming records which showed that harvesting occurred on december 12 14 a sudden decline in lai between december 7 and 16 was observed which was consistent with the decrease in ndvi between november 29 and december 14 further decreases in both ndvi and lai from mid december were observed possibly due to drying of stubble remaining in the field after harvest overall the variations of str and ndvi in the time series of the str ndvi space were supported by the ground measurements of soil moisture and irrigation and remotely sensed lai retrievals 3 2 2 characterizing spatial heterogeneity of ndvi and str in addition to illustrating the dynamic variation of soil moisture and crop growth status in the temporal domain the str ndvi space on a specific day can depict the spatial heterogeneity within a field of soil wetness and crop status which is reflected by the ranges the distance between minimum and maximum values of str and ndvi fig 3 the larger the range the more significant the heterogeneity for example on august 31 pixels presented with small str and ndvi ranges on the contrary an increasing range of str values was observed from september 5 onwards with multiple high density point locations in the str ndvi spaces by september 5 most parts of the field were irrigated except a small dry part with low str values a continuous increase in the ndvi range was observed from september 15 until october 15 when maize grew to cover the majority of the soil surface the large range in ndvi values indicates that the field had patches with either bare surface and slower growing plants where the maize plants had not yet reached their maximum leaf area once the surface was fully covered by the maize plant canopy from october 20 the heterogeneity in ndvi decreased and the range of ndvi values became smaller with most pixels presenting high ndvi values well above 0 5 after irrigation was halted and harvesting was completed the surface became dry november 29 december 14 and gradually bare december 19 december 24 exhibited by a small range of str values and a medium range of ndvi values the spatial heterogeneity of ndvi and its temporal variation can be inferred via the error bars in the lai retrievals which represent the standard deviation of 3600 pixels the ranges of ndvi and spatial variability of lai are well matched for the entire growing season theoretically if the fields are fully homogenous in terms of soil wetness and vegetation growth status the str ndvi as well values of all pixels should be converged to a single value at least densely distributed in a very small range such as those on august 31 however fig 3 shows that both str and ndvi present increasing ranges from september 15 the larger values of str and ndvi indicate that some pixels are from wet parts of the surface covered by vegetation while the smaller values indicate that some pixels represent drier patches with sparser vegetation this variation in str and ndvi values reflects the heterogeneity of the field thus we demonstrated that the dynamic str ndvi space could not only trace the temporal dynamics of soil wetness and crop growth status but also identify their spatial heterogeneity within individual fields 3 3 soil moisture retrieval the soil moisture retrievals over the al kharj farmland site were evaluated based on the ground measurements of soil moisture between january 2016 and may 2018 to test the impact of crop type on soil moisture retrievals rsm was estimated based on 1 the edge parameters for mixed crops i e without considering the crop type and 2 crop specific edge parameters in the second scenario parameters for alfalfa maize and bare surfaces see table 1 were used in different growth cycles the estimated rsm was converted to volumetric soil moisture content m3 m3 by multiplication with the soil porosity with retrievals then validated against the ground measurements fig 4a and b show the comparison between sentinel 2 derived soil moisture retrievals and ground measurements under the two scenarios respectively generally the crop type specific retrievals provided better results r2 0 60 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 than those combining the crop types r2 0 46 and rmse 0 09 m3 m3 based on the performance of the optrams with the three different parameterization schemes they all showed good correlations indicating that the optram can capture the overall variation of soil moisture at the agricultural field scale comparatively when combining all crop types the retrievals from the original optram were marginally better r2 0 46 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 than the revised and new optrams r2 0 43 0 44 and rmse 0 07 0 09 m3 m3 when taking crop type into account the new optram produced the best soil moisture retrievals with r2 0 65 and rmse 0 05 m3 m3 while the revised and original optrams both produced r2 0 60 and rmse 0 06 m3 m3 these results indicate that crop specific edge parameters improve moisture retrievals compared to the use of edge parameters computed based on multiple combined crops an underestimation of soil moisture is observed in the retrievals which may be attributed to the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi space as well as to the sensing depth of the optical sensors the newly proposed optram parameterization scheme was applied to generate a time series of soil moisture maps based on the available sentinel 2 images over the al kharj farmland site a time series of soil moisture maps over the te10 field covering the second growing season of maize in 2017 showed the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture from august 31 to december 24 fig 5 the start of the irrigation in preparation for planting can be identified between august 31 and september 5 and the halt of irrigating after harvest from the end of november to early december can be clearly observed via a significant decrease in mapped soil moisture for individual dates soil moisture retrievals present detailed spatial distribution patterns in relation to irrigation the mapped soil moisture between september 5 and october 5 clearly shows the circular irrigation pattern from the sprinklers attached to the wheeled trusses rotating around the field recently irrigated sections in green can be seen in fig 5 with the location of the sprinklers appearing with particularly high soil moisture in blue the month between october 30 and november 29 had the highest soil moisture retrievals which coincided with the highest ndvi values fig 3 3 4 spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture distribution the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture over the maize field te10 was quantified using a histogram fig 6 and four statistical measures fig 7 i e mean standard deviation and the skewness and kurtosis coefficients during the growing season soil moisture not only showed significant temporal variation but also obvious spatial variation within individual fields from august 31 to december 24 the average soil moisture per field exhibited an increasing trend until the beginning of november with a maximum of 0 24 m3 m3 followed by a decrease to a minimum of 0 06 m3 m3 consistent with figs 3 and 5 the soil moisture on august 31 before irrigation starting and december 19 and 24 after halting irrigation showed low mean values and standard deviations fig 7 at the same times i e before and after irrigation the skewness coefficients were slightly smaller than zero and the kurtosis coefficient was close to a value of 3 which indicated that the soil moisture of natural surfaces without irrigation were close to a normal distribution with low spatial heterogeneity on september 5 two peaks were seen in the histogram fig 6 indicating that the soil moisture distribution within the field was heterogeneous a sharp increase in mean values and standard deviation and a decrease in the kurtosis coefficient fig 7 of soil moisture were observed on the same date further confirming the observation in fig 6 irrigation caused an increase in the overall soil moisture of the field but as the field did not have an even moisture status e g some parts that were previously irrigated had dried out again at the time of image capture because irrigating the whole field for one center pivot round may take several days the spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture increased an increase in skewness from slightly negative on august 31 to slightly positive on september 5 indicated that the wet pixels became more dominant than the dry pixels within the field from september 5 to october 20 the average soil moisture of the field remained stable but spatially heterogonous for example the skewness decreased from positive on september 15 to negative on october 20 more significantly there were almost two identical peaks in soil moisture on september 20 25 and 30 fig 6 and the associated kurtosis coefficients were close to those of a normal distribution fig 7 soil moisture on october 15 and 20 were also close to a normal distribution with smaller spatial heterogeneity compared to the observations in september from october 20 to november 9 both the average values and kurtosis coefficients fig 7 of soil moisture witnessed a distinct increase while the standard deviations were relatively low in the same period the skewness coefficient significantly decreased towards the negative direction this observation indicated that the intensity or speed of the irrigation increased significantly resulting in an increase in the spatial heterogeneity with a low number of irrigated pixels presenting extremely high soil moisture values from november 9 to the end of that month both the average soil moisture and kurtosis coefficients remained high while skewness coefficients reached the largest negative values i e the pixels with smaller compared to the mean value soil moisture values dominated the field continuous irrigation with large amounts of water ensured a stable water supply and decreasing air temperature towards november reduced evapotranspiration potentially causing soil moisture to be distributed within a narrow range with high values 4 discussion we retrieved soil moisture at the agricultural field scale using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 images based on a newly parameterized optical trapezoid model optram three specific objectives were examined 1 the original and a revised scheme for parameterizing the dry and wet edges in the optram approach were evaluated using high resolution sentinel 2 data with a new scheme for dry edge parameterization also proposed 2 the concept of a dynamic str ndvi space was explored to analyze the temporal dynamics of soil moisture and vegetation status and 3 the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture of individual agricultural fields was quantified in the following paragraphs several key issues regarding the use of the optram and quantification of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture are discussed 4 1 performance of optram and parameterization the optram approach has previously demonstrated the capacity for inferring soil moisture from optical remote sensing sadeghi et al 2017 2015 however the details of the method have been modified in several studies for example ambrosone et al 2020 modeled the relations between str and ndvi for dry and wet edges with an exponential function while babaeian et al 2019 and hassanpour et al 2020 replaced ndvi with the soil adjusted vegetation index savi the evaluation presented herein has shown that both the original linear scheme of sadeghi et al 2017 and the revised exponential scheme of ambrosone et al 2020 for str ndvi space parametrization can lead to acceptable soil moisture retrievals in agricultural fields our newly proposed parameterization scheme which modeled the dry edge with a combination of linear and power functions based on sentinel 2 images over an irrigated field yielded improved soil moisture retrievals over maize and alfalfa fields compared to the original and revised schemes overall both the replacement of ndvi by savi babaeian et al 2019 hassanpour et al 2020 and parameterization of str ndvi space ambrosone et al 2020 produced satisfactory soil moisture retrievals demonstrating the feasibility of modifying the parameterization of the method for agricultural fields results show that the key to achieve accurate soil moisture retrievals based on the opatram and its variants is to estimate the parameters correctly both linear and nonlinear models were feasible as long as they fit the pixel distribution of the str ndvi spaces 4 2 impact of crop type on optram parametrization to the best of our knowledge this work is the first application of the optram to consider the impact of crop type on the construction of str ndvi space and estimation of the dry and wet edge parameters our results showed that the edge parameters of str ndvi space constructed by pixels from different crops differed from each other when the crop specific edge parameters were used in optram the accuracy of the soil moisture retrievals improved compared to the use of edge parameters of mixed crops the differences in soil moisture from the three original revised and new parameterizations were smaller than the difference between the two scenarios considering crop type or not see fig 4 fundamentally the optram assumes that surface soil moisture is correlated with the root zone soil moisture via the spectral response of the crop canopy to soil moisture deficit in the root zone sadeghi et al 2017 while the extent of the root zone depends on the crop type santos et al 2014 thus the impact of soil moisture on vegetation spectral characteristics is vegetation type dependent the soil moisture retrievals will likely be improved if accurate vegetation classification data can be integrated into the optram to estimate vegetation type dependent parameters of the str ndvi space hassanpour et al 2020 4 3 dynamic str ndvi spaces for time series analysis and spatial heterogeneity quantification similar to the dynamic variation of str ndvi space constructed from modis data in chen et al 2020 our str ndvi space constructed using high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 data showed dynamic variation between different acquisition dates the dynamic variation reflected the agricultural processes such as the soil wetness variation and crop growth development different to the curve based time series of soil moisture or vegetation descriptors e g ndvi lai the dynamic str ndvi spaces can simultaneously show the variation of each individual process and their coevolution using 2 d scatterplots this point is especially important for revealing the coevolution of soil wetness and crop growth within irrigated agricultural fields and to identify the key events and stages of crop growth and their relations as they affect the timing and scheduling of management inputs zelikova et al 2015 through analysis of the dynamic str ndvi spaces various surface conditions e g the irrigated and non irrigated bare and vegetated can be discriminated and the key agronomic events and crop growth stages e g start and halt of irrigation crop emergence and maturity and time of harvesting can be identified for example the obvious increase in str see fig 3 indicated the application of irrigation and the start of a new planting and growth cycle while the increase in ndvi and lai approximately two weeks later indicated the start of crop growth thus given the high temporal resolution features of the sentinel 2 data we can see that the coevolution of str and ndvi depicted by the dynamic str ndvi spaces reveals the general process of irrigated agriculture in arid regions in addition to tracing the coevolution of soil wetness and crop growth an important aspect of the dynamic str ndvi space is to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and crop growth neither the curved based time series analysis nor the previous static str ndvi space are feasible the spatial heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of soil moisture which is correlated with the spatial scale of the imagery used for mapping li et al 2017 the spatial heterogeneity of continuous variables e g soil moisture can be quantified based on analyzing the degree of departure from randomness and that of categorical variables e g landscape can be quantified by using landscape and ecological features jin et al 2017 for example garrigues et al 2006 quantified the spatial heterogeneity of landscape vegetation cover using modeling of a variogram of high spatial resolution ndvi data while foster et al 2019 assessed the landscape scale heterogeneity of irrigation water by jointly using high resolution remote sensing and in situ observations thus we can see that the quantification of spatial heterogeneity of land surface variables continuous and categorical relies on the availability of high resolution observations based on the high spatial resolution sentinel 2 observations we quantified the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture by combining dynamic str ndvi spaces and statistical methods in addition to the str ndvi space the histogram of soil moisture and four statistical measures mean value standard deviation skewness and kurtosis coefficients of all pixels within an individual field quantitatively estimated the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture which not only traced the temporal dynamics but also quantified the spatial distribution pattern of soil moisture caused by the irrigation water supply and evapotranspiration water loss finally it is worth emphasizing that a single str ndvi space from a single day cannot be used to parameterize the wet and dry edges because of limited representativeness although the dynamic str ndvi spaces consisting of a time series of str ndvi spaces are useful for analyzing the coevolution of surface processes and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity varying crop growth status cannot be assessed from just a single image thus a time series of all images that covers at least a complete growing cycle should be applied to construct a complete str ndvi space for estimating the wet and dry edge parameters then the dynamic str ndvi spaces can be used to analyze the coevolution of surface processes quantify the spatial heterogeneity of fields and provide retrospective metrics for evaluation of crop activities to inform management decisions for future growing seasons 4 4 limitations and further investigation although an acceptable accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was obtained several critical issues in terms of transferability of the optram approach to other regions remain to be addressed and will require further investigations the first issue is the availability of data with limited or no cloud contamination it is worth noting that the presented work was conducted over a region where the sentinel 2 images were mainly cloud free which enabled the availability of a high quality image time series that was well suited for the parameterization of the dry and wet edges of the trapezoid sadeghi et al 2017 hence we were able to obtain high density sentinel 2 image time series that could capture the temporal variability in both crop growth and irrigation practices however in many agricultural regions especially with rainfed agriculture strong atmospheric convection leads to frequent occurrence of cloudy and rainy weather douglas et al 2009 making it difficult to obtain high quality data to support the development of the optram method to address this issue several potential solutions might be applicable 1 to obtain cloud free images via a longer time series to capture as much detail as possible on crop growth and surface changes 2 to refine the cloud detection and reduction algorithms to improve the quality of the remote sensing images 3 explore imagery with denser time series or higher resolution data e g cubesat data aragon et al 2018 johansen et al 2022 or 4 generate gap filled time sequences that dynamically update the underlying surface conditions mariethoz et al 2012 yin et al 2017 another issue is the model formulation and edge parameterizations we have shown that the formulation of the optram edges can for example be linear exponential or a power function thus improving the edge parameterization by trying additional formulations could potentially enhance the performance of the optram method and accuracy of soil moisture retrieval sadeghi et al 2017 5 conclusions through a combination of high spatiotemporal resolution sentinel 2 imagery and the optical trapezoid model optram this paper systematically evaluated different parameterization schemes under varying land surface cover and conditions four individual crops mixed crops and bare surface and proposed an improved scheme for targeted agricultural application our evaluation verified that the original version of optram can infer soil moisture in an agricultural setting with an acceptable accuracy r2 0 43 and rmse 0 09 m3 m3 however when integrating crop specific information into the optram and estimating the dry and wet edge parameters from str ndvi space using a more tailored parameterization scheme soil moisture estimates were improved considerably 0 60 r2 0 65 and 0 05 rmse 0 06 m3 m3 likewise the piecewise function scheme that was proposed for calculating the dry edge resulted in improved soil moisture retrieval compared to the retrievals with the original and revised schemes tracing the coevolution of surface processes advances the application in precision agriculture allowing an enhanced spatial representation of high resolution optical remote sensing based soil moisture retrievals apart from providing an improved characterization of landscape scale processes the approach may facilitate an improved understanding of the spatial distribution of soil moisture within individual agricultural fields providing precision instructions for irrigation management and crop growth monitoring funding the

objective function in the future period is found to be small about 1 it is mainly due to the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months the results show that with the application of the proposed hedging policy the objective function msi in the historical period and also in the scenario of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is improved by 45 21 3 and 25 7 respectively compared to the standard operation policy sop method also with the application of the hedging policy the vulnerability of the system has been greatly improved in both the historical and future periods compared to the sop method system vulnerability decreases from 0 64 to 0 24 in the historical period while it changes from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios keywords drought early warning system reservoir operation hedging rule effective warning storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dam reservoirs play a significant role in the management of water resources during periods of high river flow reservoirs store excess water while during low flow times it is released to provide a wide range of needs adeloye and dau 2019 using historical runoff data is the best way to plan a reservoir which is usually available at the reservoir site but when operational runoff differs from planning this can cause complications as an example climate change may decrease reservoir inflows and increase its changes in many parts of the world ipcc 2007 evaluating management policies is one way to overcome the problem of water scarcity and to contribute to the sustainable development of water resources systems and decision making at the macro level in recent decades the use of various systems analysis methods in both simulation and optimization as an effective tool in water resources management has played a vital role in overcoming the challenges in this field ashrafi et al 2020 for example carmona et al 2011 molina et al 2010 sperotto et al 2019 and zazo et al 2022 utilized genetic algorithm and bayesian network for simulation and optimization of water resources management climatic change and civil engineering issues the use of optimization methods in solving water resources management problems and especially the optimal operation of reservoirs has a prominent place in previous studies so that different models have been developed in the evolution of optimization methods in this field ashrafi and dariane 2017 in optimization methods the effect of applying different policies on the performance of the water resources system can be evaluated according to the objective functions and the set of response points as decision support tools hydrologic indices are useful in management and conservation of water resources because they are straightforward to interpret the streamflow drought index sdi is one of these indices which is used to assess the availability of water in the watershed djebou 2019 in hydrology drought is deficit of water in comparison with normal conditions mera 2018 the drought is one of the most difficult and complicated natural disasters mera 2018 human society and natural ecosystems are often affected by drought in a variety of ways vicente serrano et al 2012 it is sometimes impossible to reverse the effects of drought and those effects can last a long time djebou 2017 there is no accurate way to predict the occurrence and severity of droughts deo et al 2017 mishra and desai 2006 numerous types of droughts have so far been identified by researchers among the various types of droughts streamflow drought can have particular implications for aquaculture ecosystems as surface water availability directly impacts those ecosystems smakhtin 2001 whenever the discharge falls below certain thresholds given by the probability density function of the streamflow it is called a streamflow drought vicente serrano et al 2012 hence the period when the discharge is below a certain level is referred to as the streamflow drought period however streamflow drought index sdi is better suited to studying this type of drought as it quantifies the severity of the drought in a more practical way tabari et al 2013 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 iran is also among the arid and semi arid countries of the world due to low rainfall and its inappropriate temporal and spatial distribution and is highly vulnerable in this regard due to climate change various parts of the country have experienced anomalous rainfall in recent years in khuzestan province located in the southwest of iran due to high temperature and low altitude the amount of rainfall is low compared to other provinces of the country and its amount is far less than the average rainfall in the country therefore drought studies are very important in this province reservoir dams play an important role in the management of water distribution systems and it is possible to reduce the adverse effects of droughts as much as possible by using optimal operation policies the managers of a water resource system prefer a sequence of smaller deficits than one potential catastrophic one spiliotis et al 2016 the use of hedging rules reduces the impact of droughts and the distribution of deficiencies in water supply enhances the efficiency of reservoir operation shih and revelle 1994 mostaghimzadeh et al 2022 profits from water releases and the value of water stored in the reservoir are effective in adopting the best rationing policy draper and lund 2004 reservoir operations can mitigate drought through hedging rules that balance the reliability of water supplies both now and in the future ashrafi 2021 chang et al 2019 the decision to ration usually depends on the availability of water you and cai 2008 huang and yuan 2004 and huang and chou 2005 developed an early warning system dews for reservoirs to be used for drought mitigation in their study fuzzy logic method was used to determine the rules of joint operation of reservoirs as well as an index to evaluate droughts in real time cañón et al 2009 implemented multi reservoir system operations in drought conditions using drought frequency index dfi as an indicator and trigger mechanism as a result of the inclusion of the dfi both reservoirs and water deliveries to users become more reliable during periods of drought it has been shown that mega reservoir helps watershed cope with drought according to study by guo et al 2021 in the study they examined how dam construction affects drought spread and compared it with conditions prior to construction in addition a novel drought spread threshold model was developed which determined the levels of drought based on cumulative precipitation deficit cpd thresholds in a study carried out by ding et al 2021 standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index were applied to investigate the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought since meteorological and hydrological droughts exhibit short term responses the propagation time was regarded as being between 1 and 12 months in a basin with a number of reservoirs ren et al 2021 examined the interactions between natural processes and human activities to determine how to operate the reservoir to reduce the effects of floods and droughts in this study the results show that cascade reservoirs change the pattern of streamflow variability of the river and change the downstream runoff in a cumulative way previous advances have not resulted in a systematic approach for determining hedging rules based on drought information chang et al 2019 the main purpose of this research is to improve the conventional discrete rationing model by connecting it to a drought early warning system dews and applying the effect of streamflow drought index sdi on reservoir operation using a new concept called effective warning storage es the parameters of the model for a historical period are calculated and the results of this model in the historical period and the projected future period are investigated by considering climate change under two different scenarios jarreh dam reservoir is used as a case study in this study which is located in southwest iran using the objective function which is the modified shortage index msi and the indicators of reliability vulnerability and reversibility a comparison was made between the performance of the standard operation policy sop and the improved hedging model in the two predicted future situations the novelties of the developed hedging model are this model reacts earlier to periods of drought and starts rationing earlier the application of this model is simple and can be used for areas with little meteorological and hydrometric data such as zard river basin and many watersheds in developing countries lack of data makes it difficult to use complex models for example chang et al 2019 used meteorological hydrometric and agricultural data such as precipitation flow discharge and potential evaporation they used sdi standardized precipitation index spi and relative moisture index rmi while this study uses sdi alone this model can adjust large shortages and distribute them in normal periods this model takes into account changes in the drought situation in future periods while most previous studies such as chang et al 2019 have not considered this issue the objectives of this study are as follows i introducing the es q type rationing model and using a drought early warning system ii extracting of hedging rule curves for operation of jarreh dam reservoir in the historical period iii studying the effect of climate change on temperature and precipitation in the future period 2022 2051 and its effect on inflow to the reservoir in the future period iv evaluating the efficiency of the obtained hedging rule curves in conditions of future climate change and determining the reservoir performance indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the jarreh reservoir water supply system in khuzestan province south west iran was selected as the case study the reservoir has a capacity of 261 mcm and is located at the outlet of the zard river basin with an area of about 841 km2 to meet the agricultural water needs of the ramhormoz plain as one of the most significant plains in khuzestan province this region covers an area of 21400 ha and has improved the welfare and economic level of the residents the geographical situation of the study area is illustrated in fig 1 the average monthly distribution of the annual inflow into the jarreh reservoir and irrigation demands which are related to a 34 year period 1975 2009 are used the mean annual net evaporation depth is 2 011 m and its monthly pattern is presented in table 1 in this region several places were considered for the construction of a reservoir dam and after carrying out studies the jarreh dam was finally built the zard river watershed is located in an arid and semi arid region and in recent years water supply to the region by the dam has been accompanied by problems the aim of this study is development of an es q type model to determine the hedging rule curve in this dam by this curve the performance of the dam will be improved to meet the agricultural water demands of the ramhormoz plain in the downstream of the dam in the historical baseline and future periods the developed model is a simple and practical model to adjust the effects of drought 2 2 temperature and precipitation downscaling and rainfall runoff processing one of the most important challenges facing agriculture and water resources is the climate change phenomenon and its effects general circulation models gcms can give an important information about the response of the atmosphere to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations downscaling the output data of gcms is needed because the outputs of gcms do not have sufficient accuracy in spatially and temporally so as to study the climate change effects on hydrological systems for this purpose in this research the statistical downscaling model sdsm has been used wilby et al 2002 also to assess climate change the second generation version of the canadian earth system model canesm2 obtained from the 5th evaluation report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc under two representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios were applied the climatic change studies considered rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios and rcp 2 6 emission scenario is very optimistic this study used rcp 2 6 but its results were not satisfactory based on observed climatic changes in recent years because future climate change will affect rainfall runoff processes daily average temperature and rainfall data have been used to project these effects for this purpose the daily average temperature data of baghmalek and mashin meteorological stations and daily precipitation data of malagha baghmalek mashin and jokanak stations located in the zard river basin in the period of 1975 2009 were used and after determining the weight of each station using thiessen polygon the mean values of temperature and precipitation of the basin area are calculated daily inflow of jarreh reservoir is also accumulated from mashin hydrometric station in the mentioned period daily temperature and precipitation values are also projected for a future 30 year period 2022 2051 then using ihacres software jakeman and hornberger 1993 and based on temperature precipitation and discharge data in the historical period 1975 2009 the model was calibrated and validated and finally the hydrological simulation of the basin was performed and then reservoir s inflow was generated for the future period 2022 2051 under two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 based on projected temperature and precipitation time series 2 3 drought index determination in the present study the streamflow drought index sdi has been used which details of its calculation are provided by nalbantis 2008 the sdi reflects drought or wet intensity over time if the sdi value is below zero it indicates low streamflow and drought the runs theory was used to determine drought events in this study to detect droughts sdi 0 is used as a threshold the sdi 0 shows wet period and sdi 0 shows the drought period for wet periods it is not necessary to use es and es is equal to the actual storage volume this study used a model to determine the sdi threshold and sdi threshold was considered as the decision variable this model showed that the optimal value for the sdi threshold is zero as shown in fig 2 sharafati et al 2020 lotfirad et al 2022 the duration d peak p and severity s of each drought event are extracted the fig 2 shows d as the number of consecutive months in which sdi is below zero p as the maximum intensity of each drought event and s as the sum of the sdi values of each drought event these are the formulas for calculating p and s 1 p min sdi d 2 s i 1 d sdi i various orders or timescales can be used to compute sdi values e g sdi1 sdi3 sdi6 and sdi9 as an example sdi3 refers to the application of the 3 month moving average ma to the initial streamflow time series the present study estimates the sdi values for three different orders sdi3 sdi6 and sdi12 these time scales can indicate short term medium term and long term hydrological droughts respectively the obtained results for sdi1 and sdi3 are similar and the obtained results for sdi12 and sdi24 are similar too sdi3 can detect seasonal droughts the most seasonal droughts occur in the summer season in the zard river watershed sdi6 can detect semi annual droughts the most semi annual droughts occur in summer and autumn in the zard river watershed the hedging rule curves rationing factors α 1 and α 2 as well as es related coefficients α 3 are extracted for 12 months then sdi12 should be considered to detect droughts corresponding to these curves and coefficients the runs theory is then used to identify the features s p and d of each drought event for this purpose the natural flow regime at the site of jarreh dam has been studied and its drought parameters number of events duration intensity and peak of drought have been estimated for different time periods also the effects of two types of reservoir operation policies sop and hedging on the mentioned parameters have been investigated the same calculations are repeated for a future 30 year period according to the predictions made by climate change models and the drought parameters are predicted at the dam site and downstream 2 4 introducing the es q type rationing model by implementing rationing policy for reservoir operation a small shortage of water is accepted in the current period in order to avoid severe shortages in the future draper and lund 2004 for the operation of dam reservoirs various rationing methods have been developed and used shih and revelle 1995 first introduced continuous hedging rule and further research led to the development of discrete hedging rule shih and revelle 1995 one or more curves are used to represent the relationship between available water inflow plus reservoir storage and reservoir release for continuous rationing shih and revelle 1994 according to the discrete rationing method each zone of the overall storage space has an operation policy with predefined rationing coefficients chang et al 2005 tu et al 2008 ashrafi 2021 by the continuous method the start time of the ration and the reduction of output during the ration period are answered simultaneously therefore in order to maximize flexibility each question needs to be answered individually tu et al 2008 due to this discrete rationing is more appropriate for real time reservoir operation in this case the first question is answered with the amount of reservoir storage plus projected inflow hedging rule curves and the second question is answered by rationing factors this has been achieved by optimizing trigger volumes as well as rationing factors simultaneously tu et al 2003 2008 a study conducted by shiau and lee 2005 investigated two different hedging mechanisms in the first case water availability is taken into consideration while in the second the possibility of a future water shortage is considered in previous research the hedging rule curves has usually determined the percentage of downstream water supply based on the amount of reservoir storage plus inflow therefore in months when the amount of reservoir storage is high even if the inflow to the reservoir is low rationing is not usually applied while drought may occur in the future months despite sufficient water in the reservoir therefore in this study the conventional discrete hedging model is connected to a drought early warning system dews consequently three parameters were effective in releasing water from the reservoir each month the parameters are the streamflow drought index sdi corresponding to the months leading up to the operation period the amount of reservoir storage and the projected monthly inflow in this model a new concept called effective warning storage es has been used in this method the monthly trigger volumes are introduced to start rationing which include vectors v1 and v2 for the upper and lower rule curves and each has 12 values for monthly operation rule curves are a guide for water users and managers and as shown in fig 3 the trigger volumes of the rule curves may vary monthly or seasonally the position of this monthly trigger volumes depends on the hydrology of the inflow and the amount of stored water due to rationing in this model two upper and lower rule curves and two rationing factors for each of these were used α 2 α 1 1 also to develop a drought early warning system and apply the effect of streamflow drought index in the rationing model 3 month moving average of sdi values sdi3 with a vector of effective warning storage coefficients including 12 monthly values is used in this way the values of this vector α 3 which are between 0 and 1 are multiplied by the sdi3 values of the months that have negative sdi3 and according to the amount obtained for each month β the effective warning storage is determined and applied in the model instead of the actual reservoir storage accordingly in periods when the water in the reservoir is high but the sdi of the months leading up to this period indicates the occurrence of a drought the proposed model starts rationing earlier than conventional models and it will better avoid severe water shortage during future drought periods the objective function of this model is to minimize the severity of the water shortage during operation according to this model whenever in month t 1 2 12 within the year the sum of effective warning storage and projected inflow to the reservoir is above the upper rule curve zone 1 all the monthly demand dt are met when this summation is between the lower and upper rule curves zone 2 water is released to meet the α 1 fraction of demand α 1 d t for severe droughts when the sum of effective warning storage and projected inflow to the reservoir is below the lower rule curve zone 3 the reservoir releases less water to meet the α 2 0 α 2 α 1 1 fraction of demand α 2 d t the model can be characterized as 3 if sdi 3 0 β sdi 3 4 if sdi 3 0 β 0 5 if v 1 s t 1 α 3 β q t r t d t 6 if v 2 s t 1 α 3 β q t v 1 r t α 1 d t 7 if s t 1 α 3 β q t v 2 r t α 2 d t the term s t 1 α 3 β in the above equations actually is the effective warning storage es which is calculated at each month according to the effective warning storage coefficient 3 month moving average of sdi values sdi3 and the amount of reservoir storage at the beginning of the month 2 5 objective function and constraints of the problem in water supply systems the purpose of operation is often to minimize the damage caused by the system s ability to meet the total demands however due to the difficulty in estimation of damage due to deficits which are not yet observed in general other goals that are easier to evaluate are used including the minimization of the maximum expected deficit and distribution of deficits to minimize the amount of deficit and distribution of it in consumption demands the modified shortage index msi which presented by hsu and cheng 2002 can be used by considering economic and social aspects chang et al 2005 8 msi 100 n t 1 n d t r t d t 2 where n is the number of periods n 12 months number of years i e n 12 34 408 during time period t dt and rt are respectively the amount of agricultural demand and actual releases dt rt dt also indicates the relative deficit in period t by using power 2 in this function higher penalties apply to more severe deficiencies and deficiencies are better distributed on the other hand by placing the demand of each period in the denominator of the fraction the model seeks to minimize relative deficiencies not absolute deficiencies in other words the amount of absolute deficit in one period does not have the same penalty as the same deficit in another period but in the period when the demand is less the penalty is more to evaluate the operation of the reservoir system the continuity equation is used 9 s t 1 s t q t r t spill t e t according to this equation in each time step t month the volume of water storage in the reservoir at the end of the period t 1 can be calculated in eq 9 st and st 1 refer the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of time period t qt rt and spillt respectively indicate the inflow actual release and spill during the same time period and et is the evaporation from the reservoir surface at time t spillt and et are calculated using the following equations 10 if s t 1 s max spill t s t 1 s max 11 if s t 1 s max spill t 0 12 e t e t a t 13 a t a t a t 1 2 where smax and smin are minimum and maximum available storage in reservoir et and at refer the depth of evaporation and the average area of reservoir at time t and at and at 1 are reservoir areas at the beginning and the end of time period t also to calculate the area of reservoir in each month considering the non linear relationship between the area and volume of water in the reservoir a linear approximate relationship with high accuracy is used as follows 14 a t 0 029 s t 1 0305 additionally reservoir storage is constrained by 15 s min s t s max 2 6 integration of simulation and optimization models in this study a simulation model is used in conjunction with an optimization method to simultaneously find optimal threshold values of reservoir rule curves to start rationing in each month and rationing factors α 1 and α 2 as well as es related coefficients α 3 for this purpose a genetic algorithm is connected to a simulation model the first step in genetic algorithms is to randomly generate several strings to the problem this set of strings is called initial population each string called chromosome in genetic algorithm after selecting the chromosomes they are combined and a mutation is applied finally a new population is generated using mutation similar to natural selection the best fitting strings according to the objective function which is evaluated based on the string s elements have the best chance of survival in future generations adeloye and dau 2019 in the present study by genetic algorithm a population of strings or chromosomes is generated as decision variables which include the monthly values of rule curves 24 variables rationing factors 2 variables and effective warning storage coefficients 12 variables the system simulation is then performed by calling the simulator model to evaluate the system performance having set of chromosomes and the release from the reservoir is calculated based on these chromosomes and also by considering other equations such as calculations of evaporation from the reservoir surface continuity equation and observing other constraints of the problem accordingly by calculating the value of the objective function per chromosome these values are returned to the optimizer model to continue the optimization process then during a process of gradual evolution by applying selection crossover and mutation operators and generating good chromosomes the optimal solution and the superior generation are produced 2 7 evaluation of operational policies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various reservoir policies the following four key performance indicators namely time based reliability volume based reliability resiliency and vulnerability were used indicators under study are described as follows sandoval soils et al 2011 16 re t n s n 17 re v t 1 n r t t 1 n d t where n is the total number of simulation months ns is the number of months in which all demand dt was met ret is the time based reliability rev is the volume based reliability 18 φ f s f d 0 φ 1 where fs is the number of consecutive failure periods fd is the total number of failure months i e fd n ns φ is the resiliency 19 η t 1 f d d t r t d t f d t f d where η is the vulnerability and all other symbols refer to the previous definition 3 results and discussion in this study reservoir inflow of the jarreh dam has been used for a 34 years period 1975 2009 which is considered as the historical period the number of decision variables is 38 which includes 12 monthly numbers for each rule curve two rationing factors for agricultural demands and 12 coefficients for effective warning storage volume the range of 0 5 0 9 is considered to determine the rationing factors of both α 1 and α 2 because according to the climatic and agricultural situation of the study area supplying agricultural water with percentages below 50 will actually cause a waste of agricultural products and reduce the efficiency of the desired rationing model the real value coding was preferred over binary coding for the genetic algorithm because the former has been shown to be more efficient for rule curve optimization chang et al 2005 bessaou and siarry 2001 as a result the following real value coding parameters are used population size 240 crossover fraction 0 5 mutation rate 0 015 the most common type of crossover in real representations is blend crossover shopova and vaklieva bancheva 2006 al aqeeli et al 2016 due to this the blx α is selected as the crossover function and used to combine the genetic information of parents and produce the new generation it is determined that α 0 5 is a good balance between exploration and exploitation abido 2003 using the mentioned values the evolution process in the ga started by calling the simulator model and finally the optimal rule curves were determined the optimal values of effective warning storage coefficients are given in table 2 the operating rule curves of the jarreh dam divide the volume of reservoir into three zones in each month if the sum of effective warning storage at the beginning of month and projected inflow to the reservoir is above the upper rule curve urc all the monthly demands dt are met when this summation is below the urc and above the lower rule curve lrc mild rationing begins and if it is below the lrc severe rationing starts based on the simulation based optimization model the rationing factors α 1 and α 2 are equal to 0 83 and 0 5 respectively in this model unlike conventional rationing models the reservoir storage at the beginning of month and inflow to the reservoir will not determine the release from reservoir individually but 3 month drought index of reservoir inflow sdi3 is also effective in operation of the reservoir in fact a drought early warning system dews has joined the conventional rationing model for this purpose in the months when sdi3 was negative it indicates the occurrence of drought and therefore the effective warning storage is calculated based on the es coefficient α 3 sdi3 and the reservoir storage at the beginning of the month and then entered in the rationing model instead of the actual reservoir storage accordingly as mentioned earlier in months when the amount of reservoir storage is high but the drought index of the months leading up to this month indicates the occurrence of a drought the proposed model starts rationing earlier than conventional models and will better prevent future severe deficiencies after running the model and determining the optimal operating rules es coefficients and rationing factors the value of the optimal objective function msi obtained in the proposed hedging model is compared with the corresponding value in standard operating policy sop the sop permits releasing water as needed and storing excess water for future use if possible you and cai 2008 chang et al 2019 sop is considered as a common method for evaluating the performance of water resources systems karamouz et al 2012 adeloye et al 2016 therefore in this study the water resources system of jarreh reservoir has also been simulated with this policy to evaluate the efficiency of the new rationing method according to this policy in any situation the total water in the reservoir can be used to meet demand up to the dead storage level dsl and there is no approach to maintain the reservoir storage by adjusting or reducing the need therefore using sop the number of deficiencies in the system is minimized but there is no control over the severity of deficiencies additionally the conventional dual discrete rationing model has been implemented to assess the efficiency of the proposed rationing method in the following the effect of climate change on inflow into the jarreh reservoir for a 30 year period 2022 2051 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios is projected for this purpose the data of general circulation model canesm2 is extracted from the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and using statistical downscaling method and sdsm software temperature and precipitation data is projected and downscaled then using ihacres software and based on temperature precipitation and discharge data in the historical period 1975 2009 the desired model is calibrated and validated and finally the hydrological simulation of the basin is performed and based on the projected temperature and precipitation values in the future period 2022 2051 under climate change the daily discharge values is calculated results from ihacres for rainfall runoff simulations showed satisfactory results for the calibration period r2 0 65 and r bias 0 03 and verification period r2 0 57 and r bias 0 28 climatic conditions are expected to become increasingly warm and to become drier in the future and accordingly in most months the inflow to the reservoir will be significantly reduced during the winter and spring seasons the reservoir will experience the greatest decrease in inflow also the precipitation distribution in both scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 will change a lot and while the average rainfall decreases the peak of monthly precipitation will be moved from winter to early autumn and mid spring under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios average annual temperature increased by 1 2 c and 1 5 c and average annual precipitation decreased by 27 5 and 24 6 respectively which will reduce the mean annual reservoir inflow by about 45 2 under rcp4 5 and 31 7 under rcp8 5 given that the jarreh dam was constructed to provide water for agricultural needs in ramhormoz plain with the trend in reservoir inflow decreasing water allocation and system operation could be seriously affected under future climatic conditions as mentioned after the implementation of the es q type rationing model the conventional rationing model s q type has also been implemented in the historical period a comparison is also made between the results of the proposed hedging rule and the sop method in the historical period then the same calculations were repeated for the future period under two climate change scenarios table 3 compares the objective function msi for the s q type and es q type rationing for historical and future periods during the historical period the objective function obtained from s q type and es q type rationing was 4 83 and 4 55 respectively as can be seen the objective function in the proposed novel method is better optimized about 6 compared to the conventional method for the historical period this shows the efficiency of the new method in mitigating severe shortages and better meeting agricultural needs during droughts the impact of the proposed method on the objective function will be small for the future period only about 1 it is mainly due to the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months fig 4 shows the results of sop and es q type rationing during the historical and future periods as shown in fig 4 applying hedging policy the value of the objective function msi in the historical period 1975 2009 has decreased by about 45 compared to the sop method which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling and mitigating severe deficiencies in the baseline according to fig 4 the values of the objective function in the future period 2022 2051 have a significant increase in both 4 5rcp and 8 5rcp scenarios this is caused by the reduction of long term river discharge due to rising temperatures and reduced rainfall in the face of climate change which indicates the unfavorable conditions for meeting the needs in the future these climate changes will affect the reliability of the system in the future period and there will be a significant reduction in both sop and hedging methods so that using the sop method the volume based reliability of the system in rc54 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios is reduced by 38 8 and 29 2 respectively compared to the historical period by using the sop method the reduction in time based reliability is greater than the volume base reliability so that this index is decreased by 53 3 and 40 4 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical period which indicates a significant increase in the number of drought months in the future period due to climate change as a result of comparing the hedging policy with the sop volume based reliability is similar but the time based reliability of the hedging method is lower than that of the sop method in both the historical and future periods because of sop s inherent nature this outcome is justified as with sop hedging reduces future reliability of the system volume based reliability decreases by 37 8 and 28 6 compared to the historical period for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the values of this reduction for time based reliability are 81 6 and 50 5 for both scenarios respectively however under the same unfavorable conditions due to climate change the proposed hedging method will decrease the objective function by 21 3 and 25 7 compared to the sop method for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively according to fig 4 both in the historical and future periods using the proposed hedging policy the vulnerability of the water source system of the jarreh dam will be significantly improved compared to the sop method so that it will decrease from 0 64 to 0 24 in the historical period whereas it will change from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these results show the advantage of using rationing in normal periods to moderate drought intensities in deficient periods using the hedging rule the resilience of the system is reduced compared to the sop method in both the historical and future periods this is because using rationing the severity of deficiencies decreases but the length of periods of continuous deficiency increases given the importance of agricultural water supply in periods when crops need irrigation and given the drought situation in southwestern iran under future climatic conditions it is crucial to review and reform water allocation policies in addition to the above calculations drought events have been identified using runs theory for this purpose the natural inflow regime in historical period 1975 2009 at the site of jarreh dam has been studied and its drought features number of events duration intensity and peak of drought in different time periods have been estimated also the effects of two types of reservoir operation policies sop and proposed hedging method on the mentioned featured have been investigated the same calculations are repeated for the future period 2022 2051 under two climate change scenarios and the drought features such as severity s duration d and peak p are extracted at the dam site and downstream as shown in fig 5 to fig 7 the number of drought events especially 3 month periods in the historical period is higher than in the future period in both climate change scenarios and the duration of these events is shorter in fact in the historical period the system recovers more quickly from failure if it is in the deficit period considering fig 4 it is clear that the resilience of the water resources system of jarreh dam in the historical period is much higher than in future period this is caused by the decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature due to climate change and the decrease in river discharge at the dam site in the future which in many months will not be able to fully meet the downstream needs fig 6 also considering fig 5 to fig 7 it can be concluded that the use of es q type hedging policy in both the historical and future periods in both scenarios has reduced the severity of drought s compared to the sop in the 3 and 6 month periods the peak value of the drought p in the historical period as well as in the rcp8 5 scenario in the future period has also been adjusted by applying the hedging rule and the impact of this policy has been well demonstrated in the rcp4 5 scenario however no changes are seen in most cases 3 6 and 12 month periods the performance of the hedging method in the rcp8 5 scenario is better than the rcp4 5 ahmadianfar and zamani 2020 used hedging policy in the jarreh reservoir dam and considered climatic changes in future periods they used rcp 8 5 emission scenario alone and showed that precipitation flow discharge will reduce and temperature will increase in future similar to results of this study they observed that the time based reliability resiliency and vulnerability of the hedging method were less than sop method similar to results of this study the value of reduction of vulnerability was 24 under rcp 8 5 emission scenario ahmadianfar and zamani 2020 while in this study the values of reduction of vulnerability are 29 and 32 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios respectively these values shows superiority of developed hedging model in this study 4 conclusion it is necessary to examine how climate change affects hydrological cycle to ensure optimal water resource management there is a growing demand for water resources in water scarce areas such as iran where industrialization and population growth have been accompanied by rise in temperature these issues have attracted the attention of managers and operators to manage water resources under future climate changes in southwestern iran water and agriculture have a significant impact on living conditions thus assessment of the jarreh reservoir s performance in supplying agricultural water as well as the evaluation of a novel method for deriving reservoir operation policy based on hedging rules has taken place under conditions of climate change in this method by using a drought early warning system dews and using a new concept called effective warning storage es in addition to the monthly inflow water and reservoir storage volume at the beginning of each month the drought status of previous months is also included in hedging model the advantage of this method over conventional hedging models is that it responds earlier to drought periods and starts rationing earlier by implementing the new rationing model the objective function modified shortage index msi is better optimized in the historical period about 6 than the conventional rationing method thus superiority of new method in the adjustment of large deficiencies and its distribution in other normal periods was justified the impact of the proposed method on the objective function was found to be very small about 1 it was found that the main reason for this is the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this implies that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months the results showed that with the application of the proposed hedging method the objective function msi in the historical period and also in the scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively decreased by 45 21 3 and 25 7 compared to the sop method also with the application of the hedging policy the vulnerability of the system in both the historical and future periods has been greatly improved from 0 64 to 0 24 compared to the sop method in the historical period and it has changed from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 in the climate change scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the results indicated an increase in average annual temperature by 1 2 c and 1 5 c and a decrease in average annual precipitation by 27 5 and 24 6 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this will reduce the mean annual reservoir inflow by about 45 2 and 31 7 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios therefore due to climate change and increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall in future periods the advantage of using such models in order to reduce the impact of droughts and reduce the damage to crops becomes more apparent water has a primary importance in human life and it should be carefully managed especially in the semi arid or arid regions according to the editorial published in nature 2022 climate change or global warming is not seriously taken into account by the authorities however the related studies clearly show its impact on the hydro climatic variables and this affect can be more clearly observed in the countries where water scarcity is a main problem like iran water scarcity will be much more important in future because of climate change and this necessitates careful management of available water resources and this can be possible by using new efficient methods in operating reservoirs and in mitigating drought duration the proposed method can be applied to other places where necessary data are available formatting of funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

9236,the conventional discrete hedging model is connected to a drought early warning system dews and a new concept called effective warning storage es to prepare the desired model an optimization model genetic algorithm method is connected to a simulation model to simultaneously search for threshold values rule curves and rationing coefficients as well as es related coefficients in the reservoir system of the jarreh dam located on the zard river in southwestern iran the advantage of this method over conventional hedging models is that it responds earlier to drought periods and starts rationing earlier with the application of the proposed rationing model the objective function i e modified shortage index msi in the historical period is better optimized about 6 than the conventional rationing method which shows the superiority of the new model in adjustment of large deficiencies and its distribution in other normal periods the impact of the proposed method on the objective function in the future period is found to be small about 1 it is mainly due to the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months the results show that with the application of the proposed hedging policy the objective function msi in the historical period and also in the scenario of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is improved by 45 21 3 and 25 7 respectively compared to the standard operation policy sop method also with the application of the hedging policy the vulnerability of the system has been greatly improved in both the historical and future periods compared to the sop method system vulnerability decreases from 0 64 to 0 24 in the historical period while it changes from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios keywords drought early warning system reservoir operation hedging rule effective warning storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dam reservoirs play a significant role in the management of water resources during periods of high river flow reservoirs store excess water while during low flow times it is released to provide a wide range of needs adeloye and dau 2019 using historical runoff data is the best way to plan a reservoir which is usually available at the reservoir site but when operational runoff differs from planning this can cause complications as an example climate change may decrease reservoir inflows and increase its changes in many parts of the world ipcc 2007 evaluating management policies is one way to overcome the problem of water scarcity and to contribute to the sustainable development of water resources systems and decision making at the macro level in recent decades the use of various systems analysis methods in both simulation and optimization as an effective tool in water resources management has played a vital role in overcoming the challenges in this field ashrafi et al 2020 for example carmona et al 2011 molina et al 2010 sperotto et al 2019 and zazo et al 2022 utilized genetic algorithm and bayesian network for simulation and optimization of water resources management climatic change and civil engineering issues the use of optimization methods in solving water resources management problems and especially the optimal operation of reservoirs has a prominent place in previous studies so that different models have been developed in the evolution of optimization methods in this field ashrafi and dariane 2017 in optimization methods the effect of applying different policies on the performance of the water resources system can be evaluated according to the objective functions and the set of response points as decision support tools hydrologic indices are useful in management and conservation of water resources because they are straightforward to interpret the streamflow drought index sdi is one of these indices which is used to assess the availability of water in the watershed djebou 2019 in hydrology drought is deficit of water in comparison with normal conditions mera 2018 the drought is one of the most difficult and complicated natural disasters mera 2018 human society and natural ecosystems are often affected by drought in a variety of ways vicente serrano et al 2012 it is sometimes impossible to reverse the effects of drought and those effects can last a long time djebou 2017 there is no accurate way to predict the occurrence and severity of droughts deo et al 2017 mishra and desai 2006 numerous types of droughts have so far been identified by researchers among the various types of droughts streamflow drought can have particular implications for aquaculture ecosystems as surface water availability directly impacts those ecosystems smakhtin 2001 whenever the discharge falls below certain thresholds given by the probability density function of the streamflow it is called a streamflow drought vicente serrano et al 2012 hence the period when the discharge is below a certain level is referred to as the streamflow drought period however streamflow drought index sdi is better suited to studying this type of drought as it quantifies the severity of the drought in a more practical way tabari et al 2013 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 iran is also among the arid and semi arid countries of the world due to low rainfall and its inappropriate temporal and spatial distribution and is highly vulnerable in this regard due to climate change various parts of the country have experienced anomalous rainfall in recent years in khuzestan province located in the southwest of iran due to high temperature and low altitude the amount of rainfall is low compared to other provinces of the country and its amount is far less than the average rainfall in the country therefore drought studies are very important in this province reservoir dams play an important role in the management of water distribution systems and it is possible to reduce the adverse effects of droughts as much as possible by using optimal operation policies the managers of a water resource system prefer a sequence of smaller deficits than one potential catastrophic one spiliotis et al 2016 the use of hedging rules reduces the impact of droughts and the distribution of deficiencies in water supply enhances the efficiency of reservoir operation shih and revelle 1994 mostaghimzadeh et al 2022 profits from water releases and the value of water stored in the reservoir are effective in adopting the best rationing policy draper and lund 2004 reservoir operations can mitigate drought through hedging rules that balance the reliability of water supplies both now and in the future ashrafi 2021 chang et al 2019 the decision to ration usually depends on the availability of water you and cai 2008 huang and yuan 2004 and huang and chou 2005 developed an early warning system dews for reservoirs to be used for drought mitigation in their study fuzzy logic method was used to determine the rules of joint operation of reservoirs as well as an index to evaluate droughts in real time cañón et al 2009 implemented multi reservoir system operations in drought conditions using drought frequency index dfi as an indicator and trigger mechanism as a result of the inclusion of the dfi both reservoirs and water deliveries to users become more reliable during periods of drought it has been shown that mega reservoir helps watershed cope with drought according to study by guo et al 2021 in the study they examined how dam construction affects drought spread and compared it with conditions prior to construction in addition a novel drought spread threshold model was developed which determined the levels of drought based on cumulative precipitation deficit cpd thresholds in a study carried out by ding et al 2021 standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index were applied to investigate the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought since meteorological and hydrological droughts exhibit short term responses the propagation time was regarded as being between 1 and 12 months in a basin with a number of reservoirs ren et al 2021 examined the interactions between natural processes and human activities to determine how to operate the reservoir to reduce the effects of floods and droughts in this study the results show that cascade reservoirs change the pattern of streamflow variability of the river and change the downstream runoff in a cumulative way previous advances have not resulted in a systematic approach for determining hedging rules based on drought information chang et al 2019 the main purpose of this research is to improve the conventional discrete rationing model by connecting it to a drought early warning system dews and applying the effect of streamflow drought index sdi on reservoir operation using a new concept called effective warning storage es the parameters of the model for a historical period are calculated and the results of this model in the historical period and the projected future period are investigated by considering climate change under two different scenarios jarreh dam reservoir is used as a case study in this study which is located in southwest iran using the objective function which is the modified shortage index msi and the indicators of reliability vulnerability and reversibility a comparison was made between the performance of the standard operation policy sop and the improved hedging model in the two predicted future situations the novelties of the developed hedging model are this model reacts earlier to periods of drought and starts rationing earlier the application of this model is simple and can be used for areas with little meteorological and hydrometric data such as zard river basin and many watersheds in developing countries lack of data makes it difficult to use complex models for example chang et al 2019 used meteorological hydrometric and agricultural data such as precipitation flow discharge and potential evaporation they used sdi standardized precipitation index spi and relative moisture index rmi while this study uses sdi alone this model can adjust large shortages and distribute them in normal periods this model takes into account changes in the drought situation in future periods while most previous studies such as chang et al 2019 have not considered this issue the objectives of this study are as follows i introducing the es q type rationing model and using a drought early warning system ii extracting of hedging rule curves for operation of jarreh dam reservoir in the historical period iii studying the effect of climate change on temperature and precipitation in the future period 2022 2051 and its effect on inflow to the reservoir in the future period iv evaluating the efficiency of the obtained hedging rule curves in conditions of future climate change and determining the reservoir performance indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the jarreh reservoir water supply system in khuzestan province south west iran was selected as the case study the reservoir has a capacity of 261 mcm and is located at the outlet of the zard river basin with an area of about 841 km2 to meet the agricultural water needs of the ramhormoz plain as one of the most significant plains in khuzestan province this region covers an area of 21400 ha and has improved the welfare and economic level of the residents the geographical situation of the study area is illustrated in fig 1 the average monthly distribution of the annual inflow into the jarreh reservoir and irrigation demands which are related to a 34 year period 1975 2009 are used the mean annual net evaporation depth is 2 011 m and its monthly pattern is presented in table 1 in this region several places were considered for the construction of a reservoir dam and after carrying out studies the jarreh dam was finally built the zard river watershed is located in an arid and semi arid region and in recent years water supply to the region by the dam has been accompanied by problems the aim of this study is development of an es q type model to determine the hedging rule curve in this dam by this curve the performance of the dam will be improved to meet the agricultural water demands of the ramhormoz plain in the downstream of the dam in the historical baseline and future periods the developed model is a simple and practical model to adjust the effects of drought 2 2 temperature and precipitation downscaling and rainfall runoff processing one of the most important challenges facing agriculture and water resources is the climate change phenomenon and its effects general circulation models gcms can give an important information about the response of the atmosphere to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations downscaling the output data of gcms is needed because the outputs of gcms do not have sufficient accuracy in spatially and temporally so as to study the climate change effects on hydrological systems for this purpose in this research the statistical downscaling model sdsm has been used wilby et al 2002 also to assess climate change the second generation version of the canadian earth system model canesm2 obtained from the 5th evaluation report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc under two representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios were applied the climatic change studies considered rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios and rcp 2 6 emission scenario is very optimistic this study used rcp 2 6 but its results were not satisfactory based on observed climatic changes in recent years because future climate change will affect rainfall runoff processes daily average temperature and rainfall data have been used to project these effects for this purpose the daily average temperature data of baghmalek and mashin meteorological stations and daily precipitation data of malagha baghmalek mashin and jokanak stations located in the zard river basin in the period of 1975 2009 were used and after determining the weight of each station using thiessen polygon the mean values of temperature and precipitation of the basin area are calculated daily inflow of jarreh reservoir is also accumulated from mashin hydrometric station in the mentioned period daily temperature and precipitation values are also projected for a future 30 year period 2022 2051 then using ihacres software jakeman and hornberger 1993 and based on temperature precipitation and discharge data in the historical period 1975 2009 the model was calibrated and validated and finally the hydrological simulation of the basin was performed and then reservoir s inflow was generated for the future period 2022 2051 under two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 based on projected temperature and precipitation time series 2 3 drought index determination in the present study the streamflow drought index sdi has been used which details of its calculation are provided by nalbantis 2008 the sdi reflects drought or wet intensity over time if the sdi value is below zero it indicates low streamflow and drought the runs theory was used to determine drought events in this study to detect droughts sdi 0 is used as a threshold the sdi 0 shows wet period and sdi 0 shows the drought period for wet periods it is not necessary to use es and es is equal to the actual storage volume this study used a model to determine the sdi threshold and sdi threshold was considered as the decision variable this model showed that the optimal value for the sdi threshold is zero as shown in fig 2 sharafati et al 2020 lotfirad et al 2022 the duration d peak p and severity s of each drought event are extracted the fig 2 shows d as the number of consecutive months in which sdi is below zero p as the maximum intensity of each drought event and s as the sum of the sdi values of each drought event these are the formulas for calculating p and s 1 p min sdi d 2 s i 1 d sdi i various orders or timescales can be used to compute sdi values e g sdi1 sdi3 sdi6 and sdi9 as an example sdi3 refers to the application of the 3 month moving average ma to the initial streamflow time series the present study estimates the sdi values for three different orders sdi3 sdi6 and sdi12 these time scales can indicate short term medium term and long term hydrological droughts respectively the obtained results for sdi1 and sdi3 are similar and the obtained results for sdi12 and sdi24 are similar too sdi3 can detect seasonal droughts the most seasonal droughts occur in the summer season in the zard river watershed sdi6 can detect semi annual droughts the most semi annual droughts occur in summer and autumn in the zard river watershed the hedging rule curves rationing factors α 1 and α 2 as well as es related coefficients α 3 are extracted for 12 months then sdi12 should be considered to detect droughts corresponding to these curves and coefficients the runs theory is then used to identify the features s p and d of each drought event for this purpose the natural flow regime at the site of jarreh dam has been studied and its drought parameters number of events duration intensity and peak of drought have been estimated for different time periods also the effects of two types of reservoir operation policies sop and hedging on the mentioned parameters have been investigated the same calculations are repeated for a future 30 year period according to the predictions made by climate change models and the drought parameters are predicted at the dam site and downstream 2 4 introducing the es q type rationing model by implementing rationing policy for reservoir operation a small shortage of water is accepted in the current period in order to avoid severe shortages in the future draper and lund 2004 for the operation of dam reservoirs various rationing methods have been developed and used shih and revelle 1995 first introduced continuous hedging rule and further research led to the development of discrete hedging rule shih and revelle 1995 one or more curves are used to represent the relationship between available water inflow plus reservoir storage and reservoir release for continuous rationing shih and revelle 1994 according to the discrete rationing method each zone of the overall storage space has an operation policy with predefined rationing coefficients chang et al 2005 tu et al 2008 ashrafi 2021 by the continuous method the start time of the ration and the reduction of output during the ration period are answered simultaneously therefore in order to maximize flexibility each question needs to be answered individually tu et al 2008 due to this discrete rationing is more appropriate for real time reservoir operation in this case the first question is answered with the amount of reservoir storage plus projected inflow hedging rule curves and the second question is answered by rationing factors this has been achieved by optimizing trigger volumes as well as rationing factors simultaneously tu et al 2003 2008 a study conducted by shiau and lee 2005 investigated two different hedging mechanisms in the first case water availability is taken into consideration while in the second the possibility of a future water shortage is considered in previous research the hedging rule curves has usually determined the percentage of downstream water supply based on the amount of reservoir storage plus inflow therefore in months when the amount of reservoir storage is high even if the inflow to the reservoir is low rationing is not usually applied while drought may occur in the future months despite sufficient water in the reservoir therefore in this study the conventional discrete hedging model is connected to a drought early warning system dews consequently three parameters were effective in releasing water from the reservoir each month the parameters are the streamflow drought index sdi corresponding to the months leading up to the operation period the amount of reservoir storage and the projected monthly inflow in this model a new concept called effective warning storage es has been used in this method the monthly trigger volumes are introduced to start rationing which include vectors v1 and v2 for the upper and lower rule curves and each has 12 values for monthly operation rule curves are a guide for water users and managers and as shown in fig 3 the trigger volumes of the rule curves may vary monthly or seasonally the position of this monthly trigger volumes depends on the hydrology of the inflow and the amount of stored water due to rationing in this model two upper and lower rule curves and two rationing factors for each of these were used α 2 α 1 1 also to develop a drought early warning system and apply the effect of streamflow drought index in the rationing model 3 month moving average of sdi values sdi3 with a vector of effective warning storage coefficients including 12 monthly values is used in this way the values of this vector α 3 which are between 0 and 1 are multiplied by the sdi3 values of the months that have negative sdi3 and according to the amount obtained for each month β the effective warning storage is determined and applied in the model instead of the actual reservoir storage accordingly in periods when the water in the reservoir is high but the sdi of the months leading up to this period indicates the occurrence of a drought the proposed model starts rationing earlier than conventional models and it will better avoid severe water shortage during future drought periods the objective function of this model is to minimize the severity of the water shortage during operation according to this model whenever in month t 1 2 12 within the year the sum of effective warning storage and projected inflow to the reservoir is above the upper rule curve zone 1 all the monthly demand dt are met when this summation is between the lower and upper rule curves zone 2 water is released to meet the α 1 fraction of demand α 1 d t for severe droughts when the sum of effective warning storage and projected inflow to the reservoir is below the lower rule curve zone 3 the reservoir releases less water to meet the α 2 0 α 2 α 1 1 fraction of demand α 2 d t the model can be characterized as 3 if sdi 3 0 β sdi 3 4 if sdi 3 0 β 0 5 if v 1 s t 1 α 3 β q t r t d t 6 if v 2 s t 1 α 3 β q t v 1 r t α 1 d t 7 if s t 1 α 3 β q t v 2 r t α 2 d t the term s t 1 α 3 β in the above equations actually is the effective warning storage es which is calculated at each month according to the effective warning storage coefficient 3 month moving average of sdi values sdi3 and the amount of reservoir storage at the beginning of the month 2 5 objective function and constraints of the problem in water supply systems the purpose of operation is often to minimize the damage caused by the system s ability to meet the total demands however due to the difficulty in estimation of damage due to deficits which are not yet observed in general other goals that are easier to evaluate are used including the minimization of the maximum expected deficit and distribution of deficits to minimize the amount of deficit and distribution of it in consumption demands the modified shortage index msi which presented by hsu and cheng 2002 can be used by considering economic and social aspects chang et al 2005 8 msi 100 n t 1 n d t r t d t 2 where n is the number of periods n 12 months number of years i e n 12 34 408 during time period t dt and rt are respectively the amount of agricultural demand and actual releases dt rt dt also indicates the relative deficit in period t by using power 2 in this function higher penalties apply to more severe deficiencies and deficiencies are better distributed on the other hand by placing the demand of each period in the denominator of the fraction the model seeks to minimize relative deficiencies not absolute deficiencies in other words the amount of absolute deficit in one period does not have the same penalty as the same deficit in another period but in the period when the demand is less the penalty is more to evaluate the operation of the reservoir system the continuity equation is used 9 s t 1 s t q t r t spill t e t according to this equation in each time step t month the volume of water storage in the reservoir at the end of the period t 1 can be calculated in eq 9 st and st 1 refer the reservoir storages at the beginning and the end of time period t qt rt and spillt respectively indicate the inflow actual release and spill during the same time period and et is the evaporation from the reservoir surface at time t spillt and et are calculated using the following equations 10 if s t 1 s max spill t s t 1 s max 11 if s t 1 s max spill t 0 12 e t e t a t 13 a t a t a t 1 2 where smax and smin are minimum and maximum available storage in reservoir et and at refer the depth of evaporation and the average area of reservoir at time t and at and at 1 are reservoir areas at the beginning and the end of time period t also to calculate the area of reservoir in each month considering the non linear relationship between the area and volume of water in the reservoir a linear approximate relationship with high accuracy is used as follows 14 a t 0 029 s t 1 0305 additionally reservoir storage is constrained by 15 s min s t s max 2 6 integration of simulation and optimization models in this study a simulation model is used in conjunction with an optimization method to simultaneously find optimal threshold values of reservoir rule curves to start rationing in each month and rationing factors α 1 and α 2 as well as es related coefficients α 3 for this purpose a genetic algorithm is connected to a simulation model the first step in genetic algorithms is to randomly generate several strings to the problem this set of strings is called initial population each string called chromosome in genetic algorithm after selecting the chromosomes they are combined and a mutation is applied finally a new population is generated using mutation similar to natural selection the best fitting strings according to the objective function which is evaluated based on the string s elements have the best chance of survival in future generations adeloye and dau 2019 in the present study by genetic algorithm a population of strings or chromosomes is generated as decision variables which include the monthly values of rule curves 24 variables rationing factors 2 variables and effective warning storage coefficients 12 variables the system simulation is then performed by calling the simulator model to evaluate the system performance having set of chromosomes and the release from the reservoir is calculated based on these chromosomes and also by considering other equations such as calculations of evaporation from the reservoir surface continuity equation and observing other constraints of the problem accordingly by calculating the value of the objective function per chromosome these values are returned to the optimizer model to continue the optimization process then during a process of gradual evolution by applying selection crossover and mutation operators and generating good chromosomes the optimal solution and the superior generation are produced 2 7 evaluation of operational policies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of various reservoir policies the following four key performance indicators namely time based reliability volume based reliability resiliency and vulnerability were used indicators under study are described as follows sandoval soils et al 2011 16 re t n s n 17 re v t 1 n r t t 1 n d t where n is the total number of simulation months ns is the number of months in which all demand dt was met ret is the time based reliability rev is the volume based reliability 18 φ f s f d 0 φ 1 where fs is the number of consecutive failure periods fd is the total number of failure months i e fd n ns φ is the resiliency 19 η t 1 f d d t r t d t f d t f d where η is the vulnerability and all other symbols refer to the previous definition 3 results and discussion in this study reservoir inflow of the jarreh dam has been used for a 34 years period 1975 2009 which is considered as the historical period the number of decision variables is 38 which includes 12 monthly numbers for each rule curve two rationing factors for agricultural demands and 12 coefficients for effective warning storage volume the range of 0 5 0 9 is considered to determine the rationing factors of both α 1 and α 2 because according to the climatic and agricultural situation of the study area supplying agricultural water with percentages below 50 will actually cause a waste of agricultural products and reduce the efficiency of the desired rationing model the real value coding was preferred over binary coding for the genetic algorithm because the former has been shown to be more efficient for rule curve optimization chang et al 2005 bessaou and siarry 2001 as a result the following real value coding parameters are used population size 240 crossover fraction 0 5 mutation rate 0 015 the most common type of crossover in real representations is blend crossover shopova and vaklieva bancheva 2006 al aqeeli et al 2016 due to this the blx α is selected as the crossover function and used to combine the genetic information of parents and produce the new generation it is determined that α 0 5 is a good balance between exploration and exploitation abido 2003 using the mentioned values the evolution process in the ga started by calling the simulator model and finally the optimal rule curves were determined the optimal values of effective warning storage coefficients are given in table 2 the operating rule curves of the jarreh dam divide the volume of reservoir into three zones in each month if the sum of effective warning storage at the beginning of month and projected inflow to the reservoir is above the upper rule curve urc all the monthly demands dt are met when this summation is below the urc and above the lower rule curve lrc mild rationing begins and if it is below the lrc severe rationing starts based on the simulation based optimization model the rationing factors α 1 and α 2 are equal to 0 83 and 0 5 respectively in this model unlike conventional rationing models the reservoir storage at the beginning of month and inflow to the reservoir will not determine the release from reservoir individually but 3 month drought index of reservoir inflow sdi3 is also effective in operation of the reservoir in fact a drought early warning system dews has joined the conventional rationing model for this purpose in the months when sdi3 was negative it indicates the occurrence of drought and therefore the effective warning storage is calculated based on the es coefficient α 3 sdi3 and the reservoir storage at the beginning of the month and then entered in the rationing model instead of the actual reservoir storage accordingly as mentioned earlier in months when the amount of reservoir storage is high but the drought index of the months leading up to this month indicates the occurrence of a drought the proposed model starts rationing earlier than conventional models and will better prevent future severe deficiencies after running the model and determining the optimal operating rules es coefficients and rationing factors the value of the optimal objective function msi obtained in the proposed hedging model is compared with the corresponding value in standard operating policy sop the sop permits releasing water as needed and storing excess water for future use if possible you and cai 2008 chang et al 2019 sop is considered as a common method for evaluating the performance of water resources systems karamouz et al 2012 adeloye et al 2016 therefore in this study the water resources system of jarreh reservoir has also been simulated with this policy to evaluate the efficiency of the new rationing method according to this policy in any situation the total water in the reservoir can be used to meet demand up to the dead storage level dsl and there is no approach to maintain the reservoir storage by adjusting or reducing the need therefore using sop the number of deficiencies in the system is minimized but there is no control over the severity of deficiencies additionally the conventional dual discrete rationing model has been implemented to assess the efficiency of the proposed rationing method in the following the effect of climate change on inflow into the jarreh reservoir for a 30 year period 2022 2051 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios is projected for this purpose the data of general circulation model canesm2 is extracted from the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and using statistical downscaling method and sdsm software temperature and precipitation data is projected and downscaled then using ihacres software and based on temperature precipitation and discharge data in the historical period 1975 2009 the desired model is calibrated and validated and finally the hydrological simulation of the basin is performed and based on the projected temperature and precipitation values in the future period 2022 2051 under climate change the daily discharge values is calculated results from ihacres for rainfall runoff simulations showed satisfactory results for the calibration period r2 0 65 and r bias 0 03 and verification period r2 0 57 and r bias 0 28 climatic conditions are expected to become increasingly warm and to become drier in the future and accordingly in most months the inflow to the reservoir will be significantly reduced during the winter and spring seasons the reservoir will experience the greatest decrease in inflow also the precipitation distribution in both scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 will change a lot and while the average rainfall decreases the peak of monthly precipitation will be moved from winter to early autumn and mid spring under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios average annual temperature increased by 1 2 c and 1 5 c and average annual precipitation decreased by 27 5 and 24 6 respectively which will reduce the mean annual reservoir inflow by about 45 2 under rcp4 5 and 31 7 under rcp8 5 given that the jarreh dam was constructed to provide water for agricultural needs in ramhormoz plain with the trend in reservoir inflow decreasing water allocation and system operation could be seriously affected under future climatic conditions as mentioned after the implementation of the es q type rationing model the conventional rationing model s q type has also been implemented in the historical period a comparison is also made between the results of the proposed hedging rule and the sop method in the historical period then the same calculations were repeated for the future period under two climate change scenarios table 3 compares the objective function msi for the s q type and es q type rationing for historical and future periods during the historical period the objective function obtained from s q type and es q type rationing was 4 83 and 4 55 respectively as can be seen the objective function in the proposed novel method is better optimized about 6 compared to the conventional method for the historical period this shows the efficiency of the new method in mitigating severe shortages and better meeting agricultural needs during droughts the impact of the proposed method on the objective function will be small for the future period only about 1 it is mainly due to the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months fig 4 shows the results of sop and es q type rationing during the historical and future periods as shown in fig 4 applying hedging policy the value of the objective function msi in the historical period 1975 2009 has decreased by about 45 compared to the sop method which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling and mitigating severe deficiencies in the baseline according to fig 4 the values of the objective function in the future period 2022 2051 have a significant increase in both 4 5rcp and 8 5rcp scenarios this is caused by the reduction of long term river discharge due to rising temperatures and reduced rainfall in the face of climate change which indicates the unfavorable conditions for meeting the needs in the future these climate changes will affect the reliability of the system in the future period and there will be a significant reduction in both sop and hedging methods so that using the sop method the volume based reliability of the system in rc54 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios is reduced by 38 8 and 29 2 respectively compared to the historical period by using the sop method the reduction in time based reliability is greater than the volume base reliability so that this index is decreased by 53 3 and 40 4 in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively compared to the historical period which indicates a significant increase in the number of drought months in the future period due to climate change as a result of comparing the hedging policy with the sop volume based reliability is similar but the time based reliability of the hedging method is lower than that of the sop method in both the historical and future periods because of sop s inherent nature this outcome is justified as with sop hedging reduces future reliability of the system volume based reliability decreases by 37 8 and 28 6 compared to the historical period for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the values of this reduction for time based reliability are 81 6 and 50 5 for both scenarios respectively however under the same unfavorable conditions due to climate change the proposed hedging method will decrease the objective function by 21 3 and 25 7 compared to the sop method for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively according to fig 4 both in the historical and future periods using the proposed hedging policy the vulnerability of the water source system of the jarreh dam will be significantly improved compared to the sop method so that it will decrease from 0 64 to 0 24 in the historical period whereas it will change from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these results show the advantage of using rationing in normal periods to moderate drought intensities in deficient periods using the hedging rule the resilience of the system is reduced compared to the sop method in both the historical and future periods this is because using rationing the severity of deficiencies decreases but the length of periods of continuous deficiency increases given the importance of agricultural water supply in periods when crops need irrigation and given the drought situation in southwestern iran under future climatic conditions it is crucial to review and reform water allocation policies in addition to the above calculations drought events have been identified using runs theory for this purpose the natural inflow regime in historical period 1975 2009 at the site of jarreh dam has been studied and its drought features number of events duration intensity and peak of drought in different time periods have been estimated also the effects of two types of reservoir operation policies sop and proposed hedging method on the mentioned featured have been investigated the same calculations are repeated for the future period 2022 2051 under two climate change scenarios and the drought features such as severity s duration d and peak p are extracted at the dam site and downstream as shown in fig 5 to fig 7 the number of drought events especially 3 month periods in the historical period is higher than in the future period in both climate change scenarios and the duration of these events is shorter in fact in the historical period the system recovers more quickly from failure if it is in the deficit period considering fig 4 it is clear that the resilience of the water resources system of jarreh dam in the historical period is much higher than in future period this is caused by the decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature due to climate change and the decrease in river discharge at the dam site in the future which in many months will not be able to fully meet the downstream needs fig 6 also considering fig 5 to fig 7 it can be concluded that the use of es q type hedging policy in both the historical and future periods in both scenarios has reduced the severity of drought s compared to the sop in the 3 and 6 month periods the peak value of the drought p in the historical period as well as in the rcp8 5 scenario in the future period has also been adjusted by applying the hedging rule and the impact of this policy has been well demonstrated in the rcp4 5 scenario however no changes are seen in most cases 3 6 and 12 month periods the performance of the hedging method in the rcp8 5 scenario is better than the rcp4 5 ahmadianfar and zamani 2020 used hedging policy in the jarreh reservoir dam and considered climatic changes in future periods they used rcp 8 5 emission scenario alone and showed that precipitation flow discharge will reduce and temperature will increase in future similar to results of this study they observed that the time based reliability resiliency and vulnerability of the hedging method were less than sop method similar to results of this study the value of reduction of vulnerability was 24 under rcp 8 5 emission scenario ahmadianfar and zamani 2020 while in this study the values of reduction of vulnerability are 29 and 32 under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios respectively these values shows superiority of developed hedging model in this study 4 conclusion it is necessary to examine how climate change affects hydrological cycle to ensure optimal water resource management there is a growing demand for water resources in water scarce areas such as iran where industrialization and population growth have been accompanied by rise in temperature these issues have attracted the attention of managers and operators to manage water resources under future climate changes in southwestern iran water and agriculture have a significant impact on living conditions thus assessment of the jarreh reservoir s performance in supplying agricultural water as well as the evaluation of a novel method for deriving reservoir operation policy based on hedging rules has taken place under conditions of climate change in this method by using a drought early warning system dews and using a new concept called effective warning storage es in addition to the monthly inflow water and reservoir storage volume at the beginning of each month the drought status of previous months is also included in hedging model the advantage of this method over conventional hedging models is that it responds earlier to drought periods and starts rationing earlier by implementing the new rationing model the objective function modified shortage index msi is better optimized in the historical period about 6 than the conventional rationing method thus superiority of new method in the adjustment of large deficiencies and its distribution in other normal periods was justified the impact of the proposed method on the objective function was found to be very small about 1 it was found that the main reason for this is the drastic reduction of inflow to the reservoir in the future period both in scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this implies that the needs won t be fully met in most of the months the results showed that with the application of the proposed hedging method the objective function msi in the historical period and also in the scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively decreased by 45 21 3 and 25 7 compared to the sop method also with the application of the hedging policy the vulnerability of the system in both the historical and future periods has been greatly improved from 0 64 to 0 24 compared to the sop method in the historical period and it has changed from 0 62 to 0 44 and from 0 6 to 0 41 in the climate change scenarios of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the results indicated an increase in average annual temperature by 1 2 c and 1 5 c and a decrease in average annual precipitation by 27 5 and 24 6 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively this will reduce the mean annual reservoir inflow by about 45 2 and 31 7 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios therefore due to climate change and increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall in future periods the advantage of using such models in order to reduce the impact of droughts and reduce the damage to crops becomes more apparent water has a primary importance in human life and it should be carefully managed especially in the semi arid or arid regions according to the editorial published in nature 2022 climate change or global warming is not seriously taken into account by the authorities however the related studies clearly show its impact on the hydro climatic variables and this affect can be more clearly observed in the countries where water scarcity is a main problem like iran water scarcity will be much more important in future because of climate change and this necessitates careful management of available water resources and this can be possible by using new efficient methods in operating reservoirs and in mitigating drought duration

9237,land degradation is primarily caused by accelerated soil erosion rate which results in a loss in soil fertility and agricultural production an improved understanding of the effect of soil bund spacing is a precondition for sustainable land management practices on sloping highlands we examined the effects of bund spacing on soil loss runoff and soil water content on teff eragrostis tef zucc trotter cropland in an area of 9 slope on luvisol soil in the aba gerima micro watershed of the lake tana basin ethiopia we measured these parameters during 2018 and 2019 on five adjoining runoff plots each 30 m long 3 m wide separated by metal sheets 0 35 m high we used a plot with no bunds as a control in the other four plots we installed bunds at spacings of 27 2 12 7 7 87 and 5 45 m both runoff and soil loss were considerably higher in the control plot than in the plots with bunds narrower bund spacings resulted in substantial reductions of runoff and soil loss the two year average runoff depths in the control 27 2 12 7 8 97 and 5 45 m bund spacing plots were 517 454 365 306 and 243 mm respectively average soil loss for the control plot was 25 7 ton ha 1 whereas it was 17 9 11 8 6 5 and 4 ton ha 1 for the 27 2 12 7 8 97 and 5 45 m bund spacing plots respectively the efficiency of soil bunds in enhancing soil water content increased with reduced soil bund spacing over the course of the measurement period average soil water levels for soil bund spacings of 27 2 12 7 8 78 and 5 45 m were 0 30 kg kg 1 0 31 kg kg 1 0 32 kg kg 1 and 0 32 kg kg 1 respectively further cost

1997 therefore in this study we investigated the influence of soil bund spacing on runoff soil loss and soil water content in the lake tana basin of ethiopia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we selected the aba gerima watershed for our study because its agro ecological environment is typical of the midlands of the upper blue nile basin the watershed covers an area of 426 ha in the lake tana sub basin 11 38 51 n to 11 40 34 n 37 29 35 e to 37 30 52 e of the basin fig 1 slopes in the watershed are from 0 to 36 and altitude ranges from 1946 to 2222 m above sea level according to the koppen geiger climate classification system the climate of the study area is a tropical savannah climate aw climate peel et al 2007 where the mean monthly temperature range is 17 6 22 5 c the area receives most of its rainfall 84 between june and september with an annual mean of 1463 8 mm fig 2 the major land uses are cultivation 52 plantations 9 grazing 3 and other land use categories 36 abebe et al 2020 the dominant soil types in the watershed are luvisols and leptosols wrb 2015 agriculture is the backbone of the economy with cereal crops occupying about 60 of the watershed area twelve years ago the ecology of the landscape was threatened by the conversion of natural vegetation areas to cropland and pasture and ongoing land degradation has affected the livelihood of farmers traditional swc measures such as drainage ditches stone bunds crop rotation intercropping multiple cropping and agroforestry practices were implemented by the local farmers since 2012 a program of voluntary community investment in improved swc technologies such as soil bunds fanya juu stone faced soil bund vegetative hedgerows drainage channels check dams exclosures and in situ moisture harvesting structures has been implemented in aba gerima the voluntary participation of farmers in the construction of swc measures was key to the greening of the watershed each farmer implemented on average five meters of soil bund per day following a community mobilization campaign in 2012 community bylaws played an important role in the construction and management of swc structures and also in the control of free grazing after these measures vegetation cover significantly increased with an increase in the rehabilitation of degraded areas 2 2 experimental setup and data collection 2 2 1 experimental setup five hydrologically isolated experimental runoff plots each 3 m 30 m fig 3 with an average slope of 9 were established in june 2018 on farmland near the southwestern corner of the aba gerima watershed fig 1 one of the plots was a control plot without sb each of the other four plots had a different number of bunds at different spacings 1 bund 27 2 m from the top of the plot 2 bunds at 12 7 m spacing 3 bunds at 8 97 m spacing and 4 bunds at 5 45 m spacing to prevent the inflow and outflow of surface runoff waterproof metal sheets each 0 35 m high were positioned between each plot and across the upper end of each plot with their bases buried 0 15 m deep in the soil at the lower end of each plot we excavated a 1 m deep trapezoidal runoff collection trench fig 4 with a bottom area of 3 m 1 m and a top area of 4 m 2 m the trenches were lined with a thick geomembrane plastic sheet we estimated the capacity of each trench to be 5 5 m3 large enough to accommodate runoff from extreme rainfall events the sbs were constructed according to the technical guidelines of the amhara region location on fig 1 bureau of agriculture and development desta et al 2005 use the following dimensions of soil bund embankment top width 0 3 m embedment bottom width 1 1 m embankment height 0 6 m channel depth 0 5 m channel top width 0 6 m channel bottom width 0 5 m and berm 0 1 m fig s1 2 2 2 runoff and soil loss measurements we recorded runoff volumes for each plot for all 2018 2019 rainfall events that produced runoff runoff volumes were calculated by measuring the volume of water in the runoff collection trenches daily at 8 00 am using a 10 l bucket and 1 l jug for each plot the number of buckets and jugs of water collected gave us the total daily runoff volume before the daily measurements of runoff volume we thoroughly stirred the water collected in each trench and then took a 0 5 l sample in a plastic bottle we used the sediment concentrations in these samples to calculate soil loss the samples were taken to the laboratory and filtered using whatman no 1 filter paper the filter paper was then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h weighed and the sediment concentration g l 1 was determined by subtracting the weight of a clean filter paper from that of the oven dried filter paper daily runoff volumes and soil losses were converted to seasonal and annual data to allow us to consider the effectiveness of sb spacing in reducing runoff and soil loss daily rainfall data were also collected from automatic and manual rain gauges near our experimental plots runoff depth mm was calculated as the ratio of runoff volume m3 to plot area 90 m2 multiplied by 1000 adimassu et al 2019 the runoff coefficient rc which represents the percentage of runoff from rainfall was calculated using eq 1 belayneh et al 2020 1 rc runoff depth mm rainfall depth mm 100 sediment loss per plot was estimated using eq 2 ngetich et al 2014 and then multiplied by 100 to convert to ton ha 1 2 sediment loss g m 2 sediment concentration g l 1 runoff l plot plot area 90 m2 the effectiveness of sb spacing in reducing soil loss was determined by comparing the soil loss for the control plot with those of each of the plots with bunds by using eq 3 tenge and sterk 2011 3 effectiveness 100 a b a where a represent the measured data sediment concentration runoff and soil loss from the control plot while b represents measured data in the treated plots 2 2 3 soil water measurements the amount of water in the soil can be measured as either volumetric water content or gravimetric water content in this experiment gravimetric soil water content was measured at different depths 0 0 60 m with 0 10 m intervals of the soil profile for the control plot and 1 sb plot we collected samples at locations 8 m upslope from the runoff collection trenches see fig 3 for the 2 sb to 4 sb plots we took samples midway between the two bunds that were farthest downslope to observe the effects of sampling location between sbs for the 2 sb plot only additional samples were taken from the top 0 5 m below the bund embankment and 0 5 m above the bund trench channel fig 3 for all experimental plots soil samples were collected by inserting an auger to the required soil depth immediately after collection all samples were weighed with digital balance 0 001 g precision and then oven dried at 105 c for about 24 h a total of 366 soil samples each 250 g were collected biweekly from november 2019 to february 2020 gravimetric soil water content gswc was calculated as 4 gswc wet weight of sampled soil dry weight of sampled soil dry weight of sampled soil 2 2 4 agronomic practices the experimental plots were conducted on a farmer s field before our study the area had been covered in teff for two consecutive years one of the most common crops in the study area teff requires extensive land preparation the farmer plowed his land using oxen four times in one cropping season which is the conventional practice in the study area the field was physically harvested at ground level with hand sickles and the straw was used as animal feed following crop harvest free grazing occurs frequently in the research area in the 2018 and 2019 cropping seasons during mid july teff eragrostis tef zucc trotter seed was broadcasted at a rate of 25 kg ha 1 fertilizer was applied uniformly to all plots in the form of urea at a rate of 46 kg n ha 1 and 17 6 kg p ha 1 as npsb blended fertilizer tillage occurred five times each cropping season once in march twice in june once in early july and mid july at the time of sowing due to the small plot size and the need to avoid damage all tillage activities were done manually with a hoe to a depth of 0 15 m leveling of plot surface and trampling were done immediately before planting weeding occurred twice during the crop season 2 3 data analysis microsoft office excel 2019 and statistical package for social sciences spss v 26 software were used to analyze the data descriptive statistics parameters mean standard deviation coefficients of variation percentage were used to summarize repeatedly measured data on runoff soil loss sediment concentration and soil water from treated and untreated plots runoff soil loss and soil water data from treated and untreated experimental plots were compared using the paired t test repeated measures analysis was used to test soil and runoff losses and sediment concentration at p 0 001 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bund spacing on runoff and soil loss 3 1 1 effect of bund spacing on runoff depth the highest daily and monthly runoff depths occurred in july and august the months of maximum rainfall in the study area fig s2 the differences of annual surface runoff depth for the five experimental plots were statistically significant in both 2018 and 2019 paired t test p 0 001 fig 5c d the two year average annual runoff depths during the study period were 517 454 365 306 and 243 mm in the control 1 sb 2 sb 3 sb and 4 sb plots respectively we attributed these differences due to differences in bund spacing runoff depths decreased with decreasing bund spacing we observed that narrow bund spacing was sufficient to impending surface runoff in the channels of bunds and increased the infiltration rates of the surface runoff water the maximum annual runoff depths recorded were those of the control plot 543 mm in 2018 473 mm in 2019 whereas the minimum runoff depths were those of the 4 sb plot 229 mm in 2018 232 mm in 2019 fig 5c d the two year average runoff depth of the control plot was 2 2 times greater than that of the 4 sb plot the amount of runoff from our experimental plots increased with increasing bund spacing zougmore et al 2000 and liu et al 2000 also found that runoff depth increased significantly with increasing space between consecutive swc structures belayneh et al 2020 reported that soil bunds reduced runoff depth because they provide a physical barrier to runoff and decrease runoff velocity according to melaku et al 2018 watersheds without swc measures in place generate 18 8 more runoff than those with swc measures several other studies have reported the successful use of swc measures to reduce runoff depth wolka et al 2018 the percentage of annual rainfall lost as surface runoff runoff coefficient fig 5a b from our experimental plots ranged from 20 1 to 47 6 in 2018 and from 19 1 to 36 5 in 2019 on average 33 7 and 27 5 of total precipitation was lost as surface runoff in 2018 and 2019 respectively the lower runoff coefficients in 2019 likely reflect stabilization of the bund structures one year after their installation and the consequent reduced disturbance of runoff plots our experiment clearly showed that runoff coefficient decreased with decreasing bund spacing this result agrees well with those of zougmore et al 2000 who found that runoff volume increased with increasing space between swc structures other scientific studies have also reported that the use of swc structures lowered runoff adimassu et al 2019 haregeweyn et al 2015 3 1 2 effect of bund spacing on soil loss the spacing between consecutive bunds had a significant effect on soil loss with the exception of the comparison of the 2 sb and 3 sb plots in 2019 soil loss decreased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing bund spacing fig 6a b on average soil losses of 25 7 17 9 11 9 6 5 and 4 0 ton ha 1 were recorded for slope lengths i e bund spacings of 30 27 2 12 7 7 87 and 5 45 m respectively fig 6a b the 4 sb plot 5 45 m spacing reduced soil loss by a factor of 6 4 84 4 relative to the control plot sultan et al 2017 also reported greater soil retention for narrower bund spacings our experiments showed that soil loss was influenced by both bund spacing and bund age we noticed that in 2019 both sediment concentrations in runoff and the amount of soil loss were considerably lower than in 2018 table s1 we attributed these differences to aging of the bunds in 2018 the bunds especially embankments were susceptible to erosion because the soil from which they were constructed had not yet become stabilized and lacked grass cover in 2019 the bunds had become stabilized and vegetation cover began to grow on the embankments of the bunds ebabu et al 2018 also observed that soil disturbance during plot installation and bund construction led to an initial increase of soil loss in contrast jemberu et al 2017 reported negligible soil loss in the year following soil bund construction because the channel of bunds were sufficient to reduce the energy of incoming runoff and provided storage for sediment loaded runoff water for each of the runoff generating months of 2018 and 2019 june to october fig s3 the greatest soil loss was from the control plot and the lowest was from the 4 sb plot narrowest bund spacing the highest soil loss 93 6 96 7 value was measured in the three months june july and august and decreased during september and october fig s3 these trends reflect both decreasing rainfall depth at the approach of the end of the rainy season fig s2 and decreased soil detachment and runoff due to more extensive crop cover during the rainy season the highest concentrations of sediment in runoff water occurred at the beginning of the rainy season after which they progressively decreased fig s4 early in the rainy season soils in the study area are susceptible to detachment because of trampling by animals low vegetation cover and rarely wind erosion similar studies in ethiopia have reported less soil erosion in september due to soil compaction and the formation of soil aggregates as a result of stabilization by vegetation cover and roots belayneh et al 2020 ebabu et al 2018 3 1 3 effectiveness of bund spacing bund efficacy with respect to soil loss runoff and sediment concentration ranged widely among our experimental plots fig 6c d on average the narrowest bund spacing 5 45 m 4 sb plot provided the greatest reductions of runoff water 53 soil loss 85 and sediment concentrations in runoff 85 these reductions decreased with increasing bund spacing because the narrower spaces between bunds reduced runoff velocity and promoted infiltration of runoff water into the soil between bunds the effectiveness of bund spacing was generally higher for soil loss and sediment concentration reduction than for runoff reduction this might be due to the bund channels having limited storage capacity for infiltration of excess rainfall our results are consistent with those of gashaw et al 2020 who reported less water erosion in areas where slope lengths are short and those of koomson et al 2020 and xu et al 2009 who showed that both sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss decrease as slope length decreases similarly effective uses of swc structures to reduce runoff and sediment yield have been reported in other studies in ethiopia e g addis et al 2019 lemann et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 the coefficients of variation of daily runoff depth soil loss and sediment concentration in runoff during our study table s2 were extremely high owing to the highly variable daily rainfall fig s2 and slope length bund spacing differences the coefficients of variation for runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff water and soil loss were highest in the 4 sb plot and lowest in the control plot in the plots with narrower bund spacings surface runoff sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss were effectively reduced controlled for small and medium rainfall events notably the means and standard deviations for runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss were highest in the control plot and lowest in the 4 sb plot runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss had significant differences p 0 001 among experimental plots 3 2 effect of soil bunds on soil water content 3 2 1 effects of bund spacing on soil water content soil water content increased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing bund spacing fig 7a average soil water contents over the entire measurement period were 0 30 kg kg 1 0 31 kg kg 1 0 32 kg kg 1 and 0 32 kg kg 1 for bund spacings of 27 2 12 7 8 78 and 5 45 m respectively table s3 soil water content increased with decreasing bund spacing i e slope distance these results reflect increased infiltration between bunds because of the decreased water flow velocity and delayed onset of runoff provided by the embankment and channel that constitute a bund soil bunds are acts as barriers due to the creation of obstacles against the downslope movement of surface runoff the major barriers are embankments and channels of the structures used to impound excess water and slow down water runoff by reducing slope length and enhancing the infiltration rate of runoff water our results are consistent with those of zougmore et al 2000 who obtained higher soil water with more narrowly spaced barriers to runoff flow and those of chen et al 2020 who reported that terracing can regulate hydrological processes by shortening slope lengths and lowering slope gradients other studies have also demonstrated that swc measures in ethiopia have enhanced water conservation wolka et al 2018 in contrast lemann et al 2016 showed no difference in soil water content for plots with and without soil bunds during low rainfall periods and the dry season the average soil water content in shallow soil layers was obviously lower than in deeper soil layers fig 7b shallow soil layer especially at the top 0 0 10 m we observed the highest soil water content variability at each sampling date this layer is sensitive to daily rainfall and air temperature variations but precipitation is the most important factor influencing the temporal variability of soil water content the relationships between soil water content and controlling variables were clearly temporal scale dependent the maximum daily increase in soil water content wetting up period and decrease drying down period the mean seasonal change of air temperature was small compared with precipitation ranging from 17 6 to 22 5 c fig 2 similarly yang et al 2012 found low spatio temporal variations of soil water content in the lower soil profile and increased near to surface soil profile the daily fluctuation of soil water in the surface soil layer 0 1 m depends on soil hydraulic conductivity yu et al 2016 a wide array of ecological hydrological geotechnical and meteorological processes romano 2014 3 2 2 downslope changes of soil water content between bunds the locations of our depth profiles of soil water content between bunds in the 2 sb plot are shown in fig 3 we obtained the highest average soil water content 0 33 kg kg 1 in the upslope profile top and the lowest 0 31 kg kg 1 in the downslope profile bottom table s4 although there was no significant difference between the upslope and middle soil water profiles there was a significant difference p 0 05 fig 8 between the middle profile average 0 32 kg kg 1 and the downslope profile these results clearly show a progressive downslope decrease of soil water content between bunds possibly related to the downslope movement of ponded runoff water from the 0 50 m deep channel immediately upslope from the downslope bund zougmore et al 2000 observed the highest soil water content upslope from a stone bund which is consistent with our results our results differed from those of alemayehu et al 2020 and klik et al 2018 who found the highest soil water content in the deposition zone of the soil bund shiferaw et al 2020 however found that the highest soil water contents close to swc structures were on the downslope and upslope sides of structures 4 conclusions our investigation showed that soil bunds can be effectively used to reduce surface runoff sediment concentration in runoff water and soil loss and to enhance soil water content enhancement of water infiltration retention of soil water and reduction of runoff and soil loss are dependent not only on the presence of bunds but also on the slope length between consecutive soil bunds i e bund spacing our data showed that the greatest reduction of both runoff and soil loss was achieved with the narrowest bund spacing the 4 sb plot in this study however drawbacks associated with narrow bund spacing include the cost of construction and other socio economic aspects e g inconvenience to farmers and other land users and reduction of the available cropping area providing rigid recommendations for the spacing of soil bunds is difficult the interests of land users the possible effect on crop yield and cost benefit analyses e g the availability and cost of labor should also be considered to determine the optimal soil bund spacing in any region requires exploration

spacing is a precondition for sustainable land management practices on sloping highlands we examined the effects of bund spacing on soil loss runoff and soil water content on teff eragrostis tef zucc trotter cropland in an area of 9 slope on luvisol soil in the aba gerima micro watershed of the lake tana basin ethiopia we measured these parameters during 2018 and 2019 on five adjoining runoff plots each 30 m long 3 m wide separated by metal sheets 0 35 m high we used a plot with no bunds as a control in the other four plots we installed bunds at spacings of 27 2 12 7 7 87 and 5 45 m both runoff and soil loss were considerably higher in the control plot than in the plots with bunds narrower bund spacings resulted in substantial reductions of runoff and soil loss the two year average runoff depths in the control 27 2 12 7 8 97 and 5 45 m bund spacing plots were 517 454 365 306 and 243 mm respectively average soil loss for the control plot was 25 7 ton ha 1 whereas it was 17 9 11 8 6 5 and 4 ton ha 1 for the 27 2 12 7 8 97 and 5 45 m bund spacing plots respectively the efficiency of soil bunds in enhancing soil water content increased with reduced soil bund spacing over the course of the measurement period average soil water levels for soil bund spacings of 27 2 12 7 8 78 and 5 45 m were 0 30 kg kg 1 0 31 kg kg 1 0 32 kg kg 1 and 0 32 kg kg 1 respectively further cost

with and without soil bunds they did not consider the effects of different bund spacings because slope length strongly influences both soil erosion and runoff koomson et al 2020 bund spacing may also be an important factor in swc projects understanding the effects of slope length on runoff and soil erosion is therefore important for the selection of effective swc methods for erosion management lal 1997 therefore in this study we investigated the influence of soil bund spacing on runoff soil loss and soil water content in the lake tana basin of ethiopia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we selected the aba gerima watershed for our study because its agro ecological environment is typical of the midlands of the upper blue nile basin the watershed covers an area of 426 ha in the lake tana sub basin 11 38 51 n to 11 40 34 n 37 29 35 e to 37 30 52 e of the basin fig 1 slopes in the watershed are from 0 to 36 and altitude ranges from 1946 to 2222 m above sea level according to the koppen geiger climate classification system the climate of the study area is a tropical savannah climate aw climate peel et al 2007 where the mean monthly temperature range is 17 6 22 5 c the area receives most of its rainfall 84 between june and september with an annual mean of 1463 8 mm fig 2 the major land uses are cultivation 52 plantations 9 grazing 3 and other land use categories 36 abebe et al 2020 the dominant soil types in the watershed are luvisols and leptosols wrb 2015 agriculture is the backbone of the economy with cereal crops occupying about 60 of the watershed area twelve years ago the ecology of the landscape was threatened by the conversion of natural vegetation areas to cropland and pasture and ongoing land degradation has affected the livelihood of farmers traditional swc measures such as drainage ditches stone bunds crop rotation intercropping multiple cropping and agroforestry practices were implemented by the local farmers since 2012 a program of voluntary community investment in improved swc technologies such as soil bunds fanya juu stone faced soil bund vegetative hedgerows drainage channels check dams exclosures and in situ moisture harvesting structures has been implemented in aba gerima the voluntary participation of farmers in the construction of swc measures was key to the greening of the watershed each farmer implemented on average five meters of soil bund per day following a community mobilization campaign in 2012 community bylaws played an important role in the construction and management of swc structures and also in the control of free grazing after these measures vegetation cover significantly increased with an increase in the rehabilitation of degraded areas 2 2 experimental setup and data collection 2 2 1 experimental setup five hydrologically isolated experimental runoff plots each 3 m 30 m fig 3 with an average slope of 9 were established in june 2018 on farmland near the southwestern corner of the aba gerima watershed fig 1 one of the plots was a control plot without sb each of the other four plots had a different number of bunds at different spacings 1 bund 27 2 m from the top of the plot 2 bunds at 12 7 m spacing 3 bunds at 8 97 m spacing and 4 bunds at 5 45 m spacing to prevent the inflow and outflow of surface runoff waterproof metal sheets each 0 35 m high were positioned between each plot and across the upper end of each plot with their bases buried 0 15 m deep in the soil at the lower end of each plot we excavated a 1 m deep trapezoidal runoff collection trench fig 4 with a bottom area of 3 m 1 m and a top area of 4 m 2 m the trenches were lined with a thick geomembrane plastic sheet we estimated the capacity of each trench to be 5 5 m3 large enough to accommodate runoff from extreme rainfall events the sbs were constructed according to the technical guidelines of the amhara region location on fig 1 bureau of agriculture and development desta et al 2005 use the following dimensions of soil bund embankment top width 0 3 m embedment bottom width 1 1 m embankment height 0 6 m channel depth 0 5 m channel top width 0 6 m channel bottom width 0 5 m and berm 0 1 m fig s1 2 2 2 runoff and soil loss measurements we recorded runoff volumes for each plot for all 2018 2019 rainfall events that produced runoff runoff volumes were calculated by measuring the volume of water in the runoff collection trenches daily at 8 00 am using a 10 l bucket and 1 l jug for each plot the number of buckets and jugs of water collected gave us the total daily runoff volume before the daily measurements of runoff volume we thoroughly stirred the water collected in each trench and then took a 0 5 l sample in a plastic bottle we used the sediment concentrations in these samples to calculate soil loss the samples were taken to the laboratory and filtered using whatman no 1 filter paper the filter paper was then oven dried at 105 c for 24 h weighed and the sediment concentration g l 1 was determined by subtracting the weight of a clean filter paper from that of the oven dried filter paper daily runoff volumes and soil losses were converted to seasonal and annual data to allow us to consider the effectiveness of sb spacing in reducing runoff and soil loss daily rainfall data were also collected from automatic and manual rain gauges near our experimental plots runoff depth mm was calculated as the ratio of runoff volume m3 to plot area 90 m2 multiplied by 1000 adimassu et al 2019 the runoff coefficient rc which represents the percentage of runoff from rainfall was calculated using eq 1 belayneh et al 2020 1 rc runoff depth mm rainfall depth mm 100 sediment loss per plot was estimated using eq 2 ngetich et al 2014 and then multiplied by 100 to convert to ton ha 1 2 sediment loss g m 2 sediment concentration g l 1 runoff l plot plot area 90 m2 the effectiveness of sb spacing in reducing soil loss was determined by comparing the soil loss for the control plot with those of each of the plots with bunds by using eq 3 tenge and sterk 2011 3 effectiveness 100 a b a where a represent the measured data sediment concentration runoff and soil loss from the control plot while b represents measured data in the treated plots 2 2 3 soil water measurements the amount of water in the soil can be measured as either volumetric water content or gravimetric water content in this experiment gravimetric soil water content was measured at different depths 0 0 60 m with 0 10 m intervals of the soil profile for the control plot and 1 sb plot we collected samples at locations 8 m upslope from the runoff collection trenches see fig 3 for the 2 sb to 4 sb plots we took samples midway between the two bunds that were farthest downslope to observe the effects of sampling location between sbs for the 2 sb plot only additional samples were taken from the top 0 5 m below the bund embankment and 0 5 m above the bund trench channel fig 3 for all experimental plots soil samples were collected by inserting an auger to the required soil depth immediately after collection all samples were weighed with digital balance 0 001 g precision and then oven dried at 105 c for about 24 h a total of 366 soil samples each 250 g were collected biweekly from november 2019 to february 2020 gravimetric soil water content gswc was calculated as 4 gswc wet weight of sampled soil dry weight of sampled soil dry weight of sampled soil 2 2 4 agronomic practices the experimental plots were conducted on a farmer s field before our study the area had been covered in teff for two consecutive years one of the most common crops in the study area teff requires extensive land preparation the farmer plowed his land using oxen four times in one cropping season which is the conventional practice in the study area the field was physically harvested at ground level with hand sickles and the straw was used as animal feed following crop harvest free grazing occurs frequently in the research area in the 2018 and 2019 cropping seasons during mid july teff eragrostis tef zucc trotter seed was broadcasted at a rate of 25 kg ha 1 fertilizer was applied uniformly to all plots in the form of urea at a rate of 46 kg n ha 1 and 17 6 kg p ha 1 as npsb blended fertilizer tillage occurred five times each cropping season once in march twice in june once in early july and mid july at the time of sowing due to the small plot size and the need to avoid damage all tillage activities were done manually with a hoe to a depth of 0 15 m leveling of plot surface and trampling were done immediately before planting weeding occurred twice during the crop season 2 3 data analysis microsoft office excel 2019 and statistical package for social sciences spss v 26 software were used to analyze the data descriptive statistics parameters mean standard deviation coefficients of variation percentage were used to summarize repeatedly measured data on runoff soil loss sediment concentration and soil water from treated and untreated plots runoff soil loss and soil water data from treated and untreated experimental plots were compared using the paired t test repeated measures analysis was used to test soil and runoff losses and sediment concentration at p 0 001 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bund spacing on runoff and soil loss 3 1 1 effect of bund spacing on runoff depth the highest daily and monthly runoff depths occurred in july and august the months of maximum rainfall in the study area fig s2 the differences of annual surface runoff depth for the five experimental plots were statistically significant in both 2018 and 2019 paired t test p 0 001 fig 5c d the two year average annual runoff depths during the study period were 517 454 365 306 and 243 mm in the control 1 sb 2 sb 3 sb and 4 sb plots respectively we attributed these differences due to differences in bund spacing runoff depths decreased with decreasing bund spacing we observed that narrow bund spacing was sufficient to impending surface runoff in the channels of bunds and increased the infiltration rates of the surface runoff water the maximum annual runoff depths recorded were those of the control plot 543 mm in 2018 473 mm in 2019 whereas the minimum runoff depths were those of the 4 sb plot 229 mm in 2018 232 mm in 2019 fig 5c d the two year average runoff depth of the control plot was 2 2 times greater than that of the 4 sb plot the amount of runoff from our experimental plots increased with increasing bund spacing zougmore et al 2000 and liu et al 2000 also found that runoff depth increased significantly with increasing space between consecutive swc structures belayneh et al 2020 reported that soil bunds reduced runoff depth because they provide a physical barrier to runoff and decrease runoff velocity according to melaku et al 2018 watersheds without swc measures in place generate 18 8 more runoff than those with swc measures several other studies have reported the successful use of swc measures to reduce runoff depth wolka et al 2018 the percentage of annual rainfall lost as surface runoff runoff coefficient fig 5a b from our experimental plots ranged from 20 1 to 47 6 in 2018 and from 19 1 to 36 5 in 2019 on average 33 7 and 27 5 of total precipitation was lost as surface runoff in 2018 and 2019 respectively the lower runoff coefficients in 2019 likely reflect stabilization of the bund structures one year after their installation and the consequent reduced disturbance of runoff plots our experiment clearly showed that runoff coefficient decreased with decreasing bund spacing this result agrees well with those of zougmore et al 2000 who found that runoff volume increased with increasing space between swc structures other scientific studies have also reported that the use of swc structures lowered runoff adimassu et al 2019 haregeweyn et al 2015 3 1 2 effect of bund spacing on soil loss the spacing between consecutive bunds had a significant effect on soil loss with the exception of the comparison of the 2 sb and 3 sb plots in 2019 soil loss decreased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing bund spacing fig 6a b on average soil losses of 25 7 17 9 11 9 6 5 and 4 0 ton ha 1 were recorded for slope lengths i e bund spacings of 30 27 2 12 7 7 87 and 5 45 m respectively fig 6a b the 4 sb plot 5 45 m spacing reduced soil loss by a factor of 6 4 84 4 relative to the control plot sultan et al 2017 also reported greater soil retention for narrower bund spacings our experiments showed that soil loss was influenced by both bund spacing and bund age we noticed that in 2019 both sediment concentrations in runoff and the amount of soil loss were considerably lower than in 2018 table s1 we attributed these differences to aging of the bunds in 2018 the bunds especially embankments were susceptible to erosion because the soil from which they were constructed had not yet become stabilized and lacked grass cover in 2019 the bunds had become stabilized and vegetation cover began to grow on the embankments of the bunds ebabu et al 2018 also observed that soil disturbance during plot installation and bund construction led to an initial increase of soil loss in contrast jemberu et al 2017 reported negligible soil loss in the year following soil bund construction because the channel of bunds were sufficient to reduce the energy of incoming runoff and provided storage for sediment loaded runoff water for each of the runoff generating months of 2018 and 2019 june to october fig s3 the greatest soil loss was from the control plot and the lowest was from the 4 sb plot narrowest bund spacing the highest soil loss 93 6 96 7 value was measured in the three months june july and august and decreased during september and october fig s3 these trends reflect both decreasing rainfall depth at the approach of the end of the rainy season fig s2 and decreased soil detachment and runoff due to more extensive crop cover during the rainy season the highest concentrations of sediment in runoff water occurred at the beginning of the rainy season after which they progressively decreased fig s4 early in the rainy season soils in the study area are susceptible to detachment because of trampling by animals low vegetation cover and rarely wind erosion similar studies in ethiopia have reported less soil erosion in september due to soil compaction and the formation of soil aggregates as a result of stabilization by vegetation cover and roots belayneh et al 2020 ebabu et al 2018 3 1 3 effectiveness of bund spacing bund efficacy with respect to soil loss runoff and sediment concentration ranged widely among our experimental plots fig 6c d on average the narrowest bund spacing 5 45 m 4 sb plot provided the greatest reductions of runoff water 53 soil loss 85 and sediment concentrations in runoff 85 these reductions decreased with increasing bund spacing because the narrower spaces between bunds reduced runoff velocity and promoted infiltration of runoff water into the soil between bunds the effectiveness of bund spacing was generally higher for soil loss and sediment concentration reduction than for runoff reduction this might be due to the bund channels having limited storage capacity for infiltration of excess rainfall our results are consistent with those of gashaw et al 2020 who reported less water erosion in areas where slope lengths are short and those of koomson et al 2020 and xu et al 2009 who showed that both sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss decrease as slope length decreases similarly effective uses of swc structures to reduce runoff and sediment yield have been reported in other studies in ethiopia e g addis et al 2019 lemann et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 the coefficients of variation of daily runoff depth soil loss and sediment concentration in runoff during our study table s2 were extremely high owing to the highly variable daily rainfall fig s2 and slope length bund spacing differences the coefficients of variation for runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff water and soil loss were highest in the 4 sb plot and lowest in the control plot in the plots with narrower bund spacings surface runoff sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss were effectively reduced controlled for small and medium rainfall events notably the means and standard deviations for runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss were highest in the control plot and lowest in the 4 sb plot runoff depth sediment concentration in runoff and soil loss had significant differences p 0 001 among experimental plots 3 2 effect of soil bunds on soil water content 3 2 1 effects of bund spacing on soil water content soil water content increased significantly p 0 05 with decreasing bund spacing fig 7a average soil water contents over the entire measurement period were 0 30 kg kg 1 0 31 kg kg 1 0 32 kg kg 1 and 0 32 kg kg 1 for bund spacings of 27 2 12 7 8 78 and 5 45 m respectively table s3 soil water content increased with decreasing bund spacing i e slope distance these results reflect increased infiltration between bunds because of the decreased water flow velocity and delayed onset of runoff provided by the embankment and channel that constitute a bund soil bunds are acts as barriers due to the creation of obstacles against the downslope movement of surface runoff the major barriers are embankments and channels of the structures used to impound excess water and slow down water runoff by reducing slope length and enhancing the infiltration rate of runoff water our results are consistent with those of zougmore et al 2000 who obtained higher soil water with more narrowly spaced barriers to runoff flow and those of chen et al 2020 who reported that terracing can regulate hydrological processes by shortening slope lengths and lowering slope gradients other studies have also demonstrated that swc measures in ethiopia have enhanced water conservation wolka et al 2018 in contrast lemann et al 2016 showed no difference in soil water content for plots with and without soil bunds during low rainfall periods and the dry season the average soil water content in shallow soil layers was obviously lower than in deeper soil layers fig 7b shallow soil layer especially at the top 0 0 10 m we observed the highest soil water content variability at each sampling date this layer is sensitive to daily rainfall and air temperature variations but precipitation is the most important factor influencing the temporal variability of soil water content the relationships between soil water content and controlling variables were clearly temporal scale dependent the maximum daily increase in soil water content wetting up period and decrease drying down period the mean seasonal change of air temperature was small compared with precipitation ranging from 17 6 to 22 5 c fig 2 similarly yang et al 2012 found low spatio temporal variations of soil water content in the lower soil profile and increased near to surface soil profile the daily fluctuation of soil water in the surface soil layer 0 1 m depends on soil hydraulic conductivity yu et al 2016 a wide array of ecological hydrological geotechnical and meteorological processes romano 2014 3 2 2 downslope changes of soil water content between bunds the locations of our depth profiles of soil water content between bunds in the 2 sb plot are shown in fig 3 we obtained the highest average soil water content 0 33 kg kg 1 in the upslope profile top and the lowest 0 31 kg kg 1 in the downslope profile bottom table s4 although there was no significant difference between the upslope and middle soil water profiles there was a significant difference p 0 05 fig 8 between the middle profile average 0 32 kg kg 1 and the downslope profile these results clearly show a progressive downslope decrease of soil water content between bunds possibly related to the downslope movement of ponded runoff water from the 0 50 m deep channel immediately upslope from the downslope bund zougmore et al 2000 observed the highest soil water content upslope from a stone bund which is consistent with our results our results differed from those of alemayehu et al 2020 and klik et al 2018 who found the highest soil water content in the deposition zone of the soil bund shiferaw et al 2020 however found that the highest soil water contents close to swc structures were on the downslope and upslope sides of structures 4 conclusions our investigation showed that soil bunds can be effectively used to reduce surface runoff sediment concentration in runoff water and soil loss and to enhance soil water content enhancement of water infiltration retention of soil water and reduction of runoff and soil loss are dependent not only on the presence of bunds but also on the slope length between consecutive soil bunds i e bund spacing our data showed that the greatest reduction of both runoff and soil loss was achieved with the narrowest bund spacing the 4 sb plot in this study however drawbacks associated with narrow bund spacing include the cost of construction and other socio economic aspects e

9238,thermal sensing provides rapid and accurate estimation of crop water stress through canopy temperature data canopy temperature is highly dependent on the transpiration rate of the leaves it is usually assumed that any reduction in crop evapotranspiration et leads to crop yield loss as a result an increase in canopy temperature due to a decrease in crop et would indicate crop yield loss this research evaluated the hypothesis that crop water stress could be detected using canopy temperature measurements increased leaf temperature from infrared thermometers irts before incurring crop yield loss this would be possible in a narrow range when the photosynthesis rate and carbon assimilation is limited by solar radiation energy limiting water stress while the leaf has abundant carbon dioxide for photosynthesis once photosynthesis becomes limited by carbon dioxide carbon dioxide limiting water stress then yield reduction would occur in this field experiment measured response variables included the integrated crop water stress index icwsi et and crop yield for maize and soybean during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the irrigation was applied at four different refill levels rainfed 0 deficit 50 full 100 and over 150 the irrigation depth was prescribed using four different irrigation methods the field was irrigated with a center pivot irrigation system which was also used as a platform to mount irt sensors the icwsi thresholds required for irrigation management were determined using the icwsi dataset collected in 2020 the low medium and high icwsi thresholds were 120 150 and 180 respectively for maize and 110 130 and 150 respectively for soybean these thresholds should be updated with icwsi data from future studies in this region to increase the credibility of the thresholds for irrigation management the mean icwsi values for consecutive days after a wetting event substantially increased with time for each irrigation level and a larger range in icwsi values was observed among the irrigation levels after three days from a wetting event the seasonal icwsi for different levels were found to be negatively correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration for both years the correlations between seasonal et and crop yield were significant with the rainfed and deficit levels for maize p value 0 001 and soybean p value 0 04 in 2020 the icwsi and yield data for the fully watered plots indicated that thermal stress was detected using the sensing system without incurring yield loss i e energy limiting water stress the et and yield data for 2021 indicated that reduction in seasonal crop et did not result in yield loss which also supported the hypothesis future studies should investigate whether this phenomenon of detecting crop water stress in an early stage without yield loss is observed in other climates and locations keywords crop water stress1 evapotranspiration2 irrigation3 thermal sensing4 maize5 soybean6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with increased pressure on freshwater resources irrigation management focuses on maximizing crop water productivity to produce optimal yield with reduced water application researchers have studied the relationships between crop water stress crop water use irrigation and crop yield for different cropping systems climate and locations djaman and irmak 2012 eck 1986 hanks 1974 ko and piccinni 2009 musick and dusek 1978 these relationships inform the irrigation scheduling methods to achieve maximum productivity heat stress as a result of high ambient temperatures is another form of crop stress which affects crop physiology growth and reproduction lobell et al 2015 crop water stress information is crucial for developing various deficit irrigation strategies for improved productivity fereres and soriano 2007 kullberg et al 2017 crop biomass and yield are directly affected by the incidence of crop water stress han et al 2016 o shaughnessy et al 2017 the plants react to crop water stress by reducing transpiration through the leaves dejonge et al 2015 the timing and duration of crop water stress determines both the quantity and quality of crop yield aladenola and madramootoo 2014 payero et al 2006 rossini et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 crop yield is found to be linearly related to crop water use or et in a majority of studies garrity et al 1982 payero et al 2006 schneekloth et al 1991 the slope of this linear relationship is dependent on irrigation management soil and residue management climate soil texture hybrid characteristics plant population and disease pressure irmak 2015 the linear relationship between crop yield and et does not indicate direct proportional relation among the two variables in fact some reduction in et may not affect crop yield if the plant has adequate concentration of carbon dioxide required for carrying out photosynthesis crop yield is produced as a result of photosynthesis and crop transpiration accounts for majority of et following canopy closure results from loss of water through stomata these are two different processes which are independent of each other and are not directly affected by each other the rate of change in photosynthesis with crop transpiration is highly dependent on the leaf air vapor pressure difference under natural conditions bierhuizen and slatyer 1965 the water transpired by a crop and the amount of biomass accumulated during the same time are strongly connected by photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy monteith 1986 we hypothesize that a crop can experience some water stress with a reduction in transpiration causing increased leaf temperature which can be detected for irrigation management without a reduction in photosynthesis the common phenomena that affect both photosynthesis and et is stomatal conductance stomatal guard cells present in crop leaves regulate the flux of water vapor lost by the leaf and the carbon dioxide entering the stomata medlyn et al 2011 stomatal conductance during the day is a function of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and soil water content zhang et al 2021b with reduction in the stomatal conductance the mass flux of water vapor leaving the leaf surface and the mass flux of carbon dioxide entering the leaf decreases hence the changes to stomatal conductance instantly affect the crop et through changes in the mass flow rate of water vapor the decrease in the loss of water by transpiration results in an increase of the leaf temperature which can be detected by thermal sensors the rate of photosynthesis is mainly driven by carbon dioxide present in the leaf and or light energy from the sun in a subhumid climate in the absence of water stress photosynthesis is often energy limited at the onset of water stress reduced transpiration rate when there is only a small decrease in stomatal conductance the rate of photosynthesis and production of crop biomass may not be affected if the rate of photosynthesis is still energy limited with only a small reduction in stomatal conductance the carbon dioxide concentration gradient across the stomate may increase enough to result in the same influx of carbon dioxide to the leaf and the leaf has adequate supply of carbon to carry out photosynthesis at the optimal level along with other carbon related processes this stage of crop water stress in which the plant still has enough carbon for photosynthesis i e energy limited photosynthesis will be referred to as energy limiting water stress we summarize this concept in fig 1 carbon is sequestered by the plant at an optimal rate similar to the rate with no crop water stress during the energy limiting stage of the photosynthesis with continued reduction in the stomatal conductance below a critical level the carbon dioxide flux rate in the leaf decreases leading to a decrease in the photosynthetic rate this will result in a reduction in the rate of carbon assimilation and biomass produced by the crop this stage will be referred to as the carbon dioxide limiting water stress the photosynthesis at this stage is limited by the amount of carbon present in the leaf and not by the energy available to the leaf thermal sensing is widely used in research to quantify crop water stress through canopy temperature measurements berni et al 2009 kullberg et al 2017 lena et al 2020 masseroni et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2013 osroosh et al 2016 singh et al 2021 canopy temperature data obtained using thermal sensing is used to determine changes to crop et at a particular net energy zhang et al 2021a crop water stress is commonly expressed using various thermal indices including crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 water deficit index wdi moran et al 1994 and temperature time threshold ttt upchurch et al 1996 canopy temperature data required to compute these indices are usually collected using irts installed at remote locations of the field payero and irmak 2006 taghvaeian et al 2012 wanjura et al 1995 mounting crop canopy sensors on a center pivot irrigation system provides an opportunity to utilize the pivot lateral as a moving platform for data acquisition across the field o shaughnessy et al 2020 stone et al 2020 vories et al 2020 new center pivot systems are available with a high speed drive allowing the pivot lateral to make a complete revolution in a commercial scale field e g 125 ha in only 4 h this is significant because 1 data can be collected without irrigating minimizing interference from water on the canopy yet only needing to stop irrigation for 4 h and 2 data can be collected on the entire field at the time when detecting stress is most likely approximately 1 h before solar noon to three hours after solar noon a scaling algorithm peters and evett 2004 is used to estimate canopy temperature during the daylight hours for each remote location the spatiotemporal canopy temperature data is used to compute integrated crop water stress index icwsi evett et al 2014 the icwsi was used as a thermal index in this study to detect crop water stress and trigger irrigation the icwsi integrates canopy temperature measurements throughout the day and is better at representing daily crop water stress as compared to indices using single time of day measurement of canopy temperature the plants with high crop water stress will correspond to high icwsi values and higher water application depth in contrast the plants with lower crop water stress will correspond to lower icwsi values and requiring either no irrigation or lower application depth o shaughnessy et al 2020 the irrigation scheduling supervisory control and data acquisition isscada evett et al 2020 system computes the spatial icwsi maps and is capable of managing site specific irrigation without user input irrigation management using thermal sensing relies primarily on leaf temperature changes that are related to transpiration rate before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress there is limited research on canopy thermal sensing that focuses on studying crop et and crop water stress before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress the notion of inducing crop water stress with no reduction in potential yield is not widely investigated the detection of crop water stress in an early phase should be further explored in different locations and climates to understand the crop physiology during this phase the moving platform for thermal sensing of crops should also be researched in the context of practical irrigation management this research investigated the detection of crop water stress using irt sensors in an early phase of water stress with energy limited photosynthesis without incurring crop yield loss the icwsi was used to determine the crop water stress the findings from this study will also inform about the effectiveness of the irrigation scheduling methods developed on canopy temperature based thermal indices the analyses involved evaluation of the relationships between crop yield et and crop water stress for maize and soybean during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the specific objectives of the study included 1 studying the trends in icwsi and crop yield among four different irrigation levels ranging from high stress to no stress 2 computation of icwsi based irrigation thresholds for maize and soybean in the sub humid climate of eastern nebraska and 3 evaluating the correlations between crop yield et and icwsi for different irrigation levels 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and design a 58 ha research field situated at the university of nebraska s eastern nebraska research extension and education center enreec near mead nebraska centered at 41 172445 n 96 478248 w was used for this experiment during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the field was divided in two halves which were rotated between maize and soybean each year the experiment included data from soybean in the north half in 2020 maize in the south half in 2020 maize in the north half in 2021 and soybean in the south half in 2021 the soils in the field were classified as silt loam and silty clay loam gssurgo soil survey staff 2018 which were nearly equally distributed between the north and south halves the field was irrigated using a speed control enabled center pivot irrigation system model valley irrigation 8000 valmont valley ne and fitted with high speed x tec center drive motors the field area under spans six and seven of the center pivot system were used for this study the area was divided into four radial zones and 24 arc wise plot boundaries defining 96 plots which were divided equally among the north and south halves fig 2 the area of the plots ranged between 1870 m2 and 2630 m2 the four radial rings were managed using four different levels of irrigation rainfed deficit full and over rainfed plots were applied with no irrigation deficit plots were applied with 50 of the full amount full plots were applied with 100 of the prescribed irrigation and over plots were applied with 150 of the full amount the irrigation amount applied in the full level plots were determined using four different irrigation methods plant feedback isscada hybrid isscada common practice and spatial evapotranspiration model setmi neale et al 2012 2 2 experimental data infrared thermometers irts sapip irt dynamax inc houston tx were mounted on the pivot lateral and stationary posts to monitor canopy temperature these irts had a field of view fov of 20 the irts were programmed to sense canopy temperature every five seconds and average these readings over one minute two irts were mounted for each radial zone totaling eight irts on the center pivot lateral these irts were installed at a spacing of 6 1 m from the edges of the radial zone the paired irt sensors on the pivot lateral were positioned such that the fov is pointing towards the center of the respective radial zone a stationary irt was installed at one full irrigated plot for each crop fig 2 the stationary irt was positioned to have a nadir view of the canopy the height of the stationary irt was adjusted at least once every month to maintain a constant height of 1 m above the crop canopy more details on the position and orientation of irts can be found in bhatti et al 2022 soil water data from two neutron probes model 503 elite hydroprobe cpn concord ca were collected at 48 locations with a frequency of about three weeks these 48 locations included rainfed and full irrigated plots with 24 locations in each crop a local calibration from a nearby field 3 km from the study site with same soil types were used to calibrate the first neutron probe the second neutron probe was cross calibrated using the first neutron probe the slope and intercept from the calibration were 0 2738 and 0 0991 m3 m 3 respectively for the first probe and 0 2766 and 0 1189 m3 m 3 respectively for the second probe the data were acquired at depths of 15 45 76 and 107 cm the soil water content representing 122 cm deep root zone was computed using depth weighted average of neutron probe readings from the four depths soil water data was also monitored using acclima soil water sensors acclima inc meridian id at one location for each crop these sensors were installed horizontally at depths of 15 30 46 and 76 cm for each location weather data for the isscada system including air temperature wind speed wind direction rainfall relative humidity and solar radiation were obtained using an agsense weather station valmont industries inc huron sd these weather variables were recorded at a frequency of 5 min the weather station was installed just west of the field in an open area with grass the cup anemometer was installed at a height of 3 m for the setmi model weather data from memphis 5 n station nebraska mesonet were used at hourly and daily time step this station was about 5 km away from the field remote sensing imagery from planetscope planet labs inc san francisco ca was used in setmi the resolution of the imagery was 3 m and was acquired at a daily time step images were inspected for cloud cover using arcmap 10 4 1 esri redlands ca and images having cloud cover over or around the field were not included in the model the red and near infrared bands of the imagery were used in the model to compute the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 2 3 irrigation management the irrigation was managed using four irrigation scheduling methods applied at four different irrigation levels the isscada system was used to prescribe two methods plant feedback and hybrid the plant feedback method used irts on the center pivot and the stationary posts along with weather data to compute spatial icwsi maps the icwsi data were used to schedule irrigation for the plant feedback method in addition to icwsi data the hybrid method also used soil water data acquired from acclima soil water sensors the third method was the common practice which included soil sampling using a soil probe and using the hand feel method on the sampled soil to make an irrigation recommendation the fourth method was scheduled using the setmi model which used planetscope imagery and soil water data from neutron probe the setmi model was used for irrigation recommendations similar to bhatti et al 2020 this model computed spatial soil water balance at 3 m pixel resolution and recommended irrigation at a sub field scale experimental plots the irrigation recommendations obtained from these four methods were applied at four levels 0 or rainfed 50 or deficit 100 or full and 150 or over this study focused on the differences in response variables found among different levels of irrigation the evaporation loss during irrigation applications was expected to be larger in the deficit level since the irrigation depth was smaller in deficit as compared to the other irrigated levels there were 10 11 irrigation events applied in 2020 and 4 5 irrigation events applied in 2021 for both crops the mean seasonal irrigation depth prescribed for the four levels are given in table 1 2 4 computation of response variables 2 4 1 integrated crop water stress index the crop water stress was represented using icwsi computed by the isscada system the icwsi is more descriptive of the cumulative crop water stress during a day as compared to other thermal indices utilizing only single measurement of canopy temperature the thermal data from the irt sensors on the stationary post and pivot lateral were used to compute the icwsi the center pivot was moved to complete a revolution without running water dry scan during the daylight hours for data collection from the pivot mounted irts in total there were 16 dry scans conducted in 2020 and 19 dry scans conducted in 2021 table 2 a temperature scaling algorithm peters and evett 2004 was used to estimate canopy temperature for each remote location on a diurnal basis the algorithm also used data from the stationary irts installed at the full level plots in both crops the icwsi was computed by integrating the crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 over peak daylight hours 9 00 am to 7 00 pm at a time step of 1 min the icwsi at a given location was computed as mentioned in o shaughnessy et al 2017 eq 1 1 icwsi i 1 n t c t a t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where i is the ith time step n is total number of one minute steps between 9 00 am and 7 00 pm t c is canopy temperature estimated using scaling algorithm t a is ambient air temperature t c t a ll represents the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature differential and t c t a ul represents the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature differential the lower and upper limits of the temperature difference between canopy and air were computed using the theoretical cwsi approach jackson et al 1981 the icwsi computed for each location was used to produce spatial crop water stress maps for the field on a given day the gps data from the pivot were used to georeference the icwsi data the isscada system outputs the icwsi maps at a resolution of 2 the icwsi values for locations lying within a radial zone were averaged to compute a representative value of icwsi for that zone 2 4 2 setmi modeled evapotranspiration setmi was used to model spatial et using planetscope satellite imagery the dual crop coefficient approach was used to compute crop et allen et al 1998 the model computed savi values were used to compute reflectance based crop coefficients campos et al 2017 the alfalfa based reference et was computed using the asce standardized tall reference evapotranspiration equation asce ewri 2005 the reference et was computed at hourly time step and added up to daily time step the weather data for reference et was acquired from the memphis 5 n station nebraska mesonet the setmi modeled et was computed for all four irrigation level plots the field capacity for the plots were estimated using the first neutron probe soil water measurement taken on june 12 2020 observational field capacity the field received rainfall of about 10 mm two days prior to the measurement day the model was not updated with soil water data when computing modeled et since there were no soil water data for the deficit and over plots 2 4 3 measured evapotranspiration soil water balance adjusted with neutron probe measurements in setmi was also used to compute seasonal crop et these et values computed from soil water balance were referred to as measured et since soil water data were used to update the water balance setmi was used to output seasonal deep percolation and runoff the soil water storage term on a seasonal basis was computed from the difference between first and last neutron probe measurements the neutron probe data was used to represent a root zone depth of 122 cm during the 2020 season it was possible that the rainfed crop may have extracted some water from depths greater than 122 cm which were not accounted for in the measured et the measurement period first and last neutron probe measurement day used to represent seasonal et for each crop is shown in table 3 this measurement period was used for representing the seasonal et for each crop year the measured et was only computed for the rainfed and full level plots since soil water data was only measured in these plots 2 4 4 crop yield the crop yield data were recorded using yield monitoring equipment model john deere 2630 yield monitor system with rtk gps accuracy on the combine harvesters model john deere s650 the combine yield monitors were calibrated at the beginning of each season following original equipment manufacturer procedure the yield monitors have an expected accuracy range of 3 and were recalibrated if the error was higher than the expected range similar yield monitoring equipment were utilized in barker et al 2018 bhatti et al 2020 the yield data were processed and filtered using the yield editor software version 2 0 agricultural research service united states department of agriculture the processed yield was compared to the weighing grain cart readings to validate the processed data the grain moisture was removed to compute dry grain during yield processing and the dry yield was used to conduct the analysis the plot yield for each crop was computed by averaging the yield points within the plot using arcgis 10 4 software esri redlands ca 2 5 data analysis the response variables used for analyses included crop yield icwsi and crop et these variables were correlated to study the type and strength of correlation an inner buffer of 6 1 m around the edges of each plot was used to remove boundary effects from adjacent plots the data collected from the buffer area of each plot were excluded from the analyses the icwsi data collected between august 4 and 20 were used for maize and soybean in 2020 for 2021 the icwsi data used for maize were collected between july 2 and august 24 and for soybean were collected between july 20 and august 24 the soil had significant interference in the icwsi data for soybean before july 20 2021 since the canopy was not completely covering the soil these measurement periods for icwsi represented fully grown crop with canopy closure before the onset of crop senescence the icwsi data for different analyses were compared among the four irrigation refill levels the icwsi data collected from the dry scans were averaged under different scenarios these scenarios included combined all data sunny days cloudy days more than two days from a wetting event more than three days from a wetting event and within 2 days of a wetting event the classification of cloud cover on a certain day was determined using the incoming solar radiation data collected by the agsense weather station the radiation data were investigated for the periods during a day when there was a significant decrease in solar radiation from its upper limit the day was classified as cloudy if the incoming solar radiation was lower than the upper potential limit for more than 25 of the time during the daylight hours further the icwsi data collected in 2020 were used to define thresholds for irrigation scheduling in 2021 a total of three thresholds were computed to indicate low medium and high stress the icwsi data collected between august 4 and august 20 were used to compute these thresholds there were total of nine dry scans conducted between these days the icwsi data collected only from the full irrigated plots were used for the computation of these thresholds the high threshold was computed by averaging the icwsi data collected after two or more days from a wetting event rainfall or irrigation the low threshold was computed by averaging the icwsi data acquired within two days of a wetting event the average value of the high and low thresholds was used for computing the medium threshold the relation between icwsi and wetting events was investigated using data acquired on consecutive days after a wetting event there were two instances in 2020 where icwsi data were collected successively for four days after a wetting event however there was only one instance in 2021 where icwsi data were collected during 7 13 days after a wetting event the icwsi data for this analysis were averaged for each irrigation level plots and differences in icwsi values among the different levels were also discussed the seasonal crop et was computed for the respective neutron probe measurement period for each case table 3 the daily values of et were added for all days within the measurement period to compute the seasonal et the modeled et computed from setmi and the measured et computed from water balance were compared on a seasonal basis since the neutron probe data was not available for the deficit and over levels the setmi model was not updated with neutron probe data during the modeling of seasonal et the coefficient of determination r2 along with the regression equation were determined this comparison was made using rainfed and full irrigated plots the icwsi and et data were correlated for both crops in 2020 and 2021 the icwsi data acquired after two or more days from a wetting event were used for this analysis table 5 the data for each irrigation level were then averaged over the selected dry scan days to get a single average icwsi value for each level there were total of 12 plots that were used to average icwsi data for each irrigation level in each crop the seasonal et was also averaged among the plots for each level the measurement period mentioned in table 3 was used for computing the seasonal et the plot averaged seasonal measured et and icwsi were correlated for the rainfed and full level plots the seasonal modeled et and icwsi correlation was investigated for all four levels the crop yield and seasonal et were also correlated at plot scale for both years the correlation used with measured et was conducted for rainfed and fully irrigated plots the correlation used with modeled et was conducted for all four levels for the modeled et analysis two regressions were computed the first regression between the rainfed and deficit plots and the second regression between the full and over level plots it was investigated whether the first regression yielded a positive slope and the second regression had a zero slope statistical t tests were conducted at a 5 significance level to investigate if the slope of the correlations were different from zero the r2 linear regression analysis root mean square error rmse and statistical tests were conducted using the microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa the least squares method was used to select the linear regression model the rmse was computed using the following equation 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where s i are predicted values o i are observations and n are number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean weather conditions the weather variables presented for both study years were computed between june 1 and september 30 table 4 the average daily maximum and minimum temperature were similar for 2020 and 2021 the total rainfall depth in 2020 was smaller than half of the total rainfall depth received in 2021 a weather station mead 6 s national centers for environmental information close to the field 6 5 km reported a historic average rainfall 1991 2020 of 381 mm between the months of june and september hence the 2020 growing season was extremely dry for this region the average wind speed relative humidity vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation were computed for daylight hours from 9 am to 7 pm 3 2 seasonal water inputs and crop water stress the seasonal icwsi rainfall and irrigation data for the four crop year scenarios in common practice plots were shown using fig 3 the rainfall events among the two seasons were observed to be different primarily in terms of rainfall depth the rainfall in the second half of the 2021 growing season experienced substantially larger rainfall events as compared with 2020 there were seven rainfall events larger than 25 mm in 2021 as compared to only one in 2020 the seasonal irrigation depth applied in 2020 was larger as compared with 2021 table 1 the icwsi data for 2020 had higher values on average as compared to 2021 the icwsi data from mid may to mid june in 2021 indicated high crop water stress because of small canopy cover and significant soil interference in the background for both crops crop water stress was also high in 2020 towards the end of the season which could be attributed to the effects of senescence on crop physiology the icwsi data were averaged for the sunny days cloudy days all measurement days or certain number of days from a wetting event to study how these conditions affect the crop water stress the averaged icwsi values for all four crop years are listed in table 5 in 2020 the average icwsi values ranged between 118 observed in over and 254 observed in rainfed for maize the soybean icwsi values ranged between 109 observed in over and 201 observed in rainfed the icwsi among the irrigation levels increased in the order of over full deficit and rainfed for both crops this observation was consistent with kashyap 2021 in which high frequency unmanned aircraft flights were conducted to acquire thermal imagery of soybean at this field site on august 26 2020 he found that the difference in canopy and air temperature followed a clear diurnal pattern and the canopy temperature for the full level was consistently higher than the canopy temperature for the over level throughout the day in 2021 the average icwsi values ranged between 48 observed in full and 130 observed in over for maize the icwsi values ranged between 30 observed in full and 100 observed in rainfed for soybean it is evident that average icwsi values in 2020 were nearly double than that observed in 2021 for both crops the reason for higher crop water stress in 2020 could be attributed to smaller rainfall depth and larger available energy i e higher average solar radiation than 2021 table 4 further it was observed that the over level experienced similar crop water stress as rainfed crop in 2021 as indicated by average icwsi data shown in table 5 the high crop water stress observed in over could be due to anaerobic conditions and low oxygen in the root zone as a result of over application of water pezeshki 2001 wu et al 2018 the icwsi values observed for sunny days were consistently lower than for the cloudy days this observation could be attributed to more diffused radiation available on cloudy days than on sunny days durand et al 2021 the average icwsi values for full irrigated plots were used for defining the low medium and high icwsi thresholds since the full irrigated plots were managed to experience crop water stress without incurring yield loss the thresholds were computed only using these plots the data from the full irrigated plots on a given dry scan day were averaged to compute a single averaged value of icwsi the icwsi values obtained by averaging data collected after two or more days from a wetting event were 180 for maize and 150 for soybean which were used as the high threshold the icwsi values obtained by averaging data collected within two days of a wetting event were 120 for maize and 110 for soybean which were used as the low threshold the mean of the respective low and high thresholds was used for the medium threshold for both crops in summary the low medium and high thresholds for maize were 120 150 and 180 respectively and for soybean were 110 130 and 150 respectively these values corresponded to different irrigation depths prescribed by the isscada system 12 7 mm for the low threshold 19 mm for the medium threshold and 25 4 mm for the high threshold crop exposure to water stress during the early vegetative stages will reduce the vegetative cover and during the reproductive stages will impact the grain yield prolonged icwsi readings above the low threshold for several days will likely result in crop yield loss from the potential crop yield for the season the high icwsi threshold denotes higher crop water stress as compared to low or medium threshold and indicates immediate need to irrigate the crop to avoid crop yield loss it is expected that these icwsi thresholds used for isscada system should be transferrable to locations with similar climate in the central great plains these icwsi thresholds were used for managing irrigation for the isscada methods in 2021 the crop yield observed in the isscada plots were not significantly different from other irrigation methods in 2021 since 2021 was significantly wetter than 2020 these thresholds should be further tested for irrigation management of maize and soybean to evaluate the suitability of these thresholds over multiple seasons with varying weather conditions the 2021 icwsi data were not used for computing the final thresholds since significant crop water stress was not observed during this season and there were small differences in crop water stress between the irrigation levels it is recommended to incorporate icwsi data from two more seasons in the computed thresholds these icwsi thresholds could still be used for implementation of the isscada system in this region and could be further updated with data from additional seasons 3 3 crop water stress after a wetting event in 2020 icwsi data from two intervals were used for investigating the trend between icwsi and wetting events the two intervals included icwsi data from august 9 12 fig 4a and b and august 17 20 figs 4c and 4d the wetting events before these two intervals were 8 mm rainfall on august 9 and 18 mm rainfall on august 16 the rainfall event on august 9 occurred between 5 30 and 8 30 am which was before the data collection from the pivot mounted sensors on that day it was observed that the icwsi increased for all levels with each day after the wetting events for both crops fig 4 an exception to this observation was found for data on august 9 and 10 where icwsi values decreased on the next measurement day the rainfall event on august 9 had occurred just two hours before the dry scan was conducted the decrease in icwsi on august 10 may be attributed to the delay in response of the crop canopy to the added water in the soil root zone through the rainfall event the variability in icwsi among the four levels also increased with each day after the wetting events for the data between august 17 and 20 the range of average icwsi among the four levels increased from 14 during day 1 67 during day 4 after the wetting event for maize and from 6 during day 1 95 during day 4 after the wetting event for soybean the rainfed crop had the largest icwsi values among the four levels for each measurement day the average dry maize yield observed for the rainfed deficit full and over levels were 11 8 13 1 13 6 and 13 7 mg ha 1 respectively the average dry soybean yield observed for rainfed deficit full and over levels were 4 4 4 4 4 and 4 5 mg ha 1 respectively the rainfed maize and rainfed soybean had significantly lower yield than the respective irrigated crops therefore the icwsi values obtained for the rainfed crop indicated carbon dioxide limiting water stress however the icwsi values obtained for the full and over levels indicated the energy limiting water stress these results show that the crop water stress could be detected before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress and could be used for real time irrigation scheduling in 2021 the icwsi data was not available immediately following a wetting event the icwsi data collected between july 2 and 8 following a rainfall event of 38 mm on june 25 was presented for both crops similar to 2020 the icwsi values for all levels increased from 7 day to 13 days after the wetting event fig 5 the soybean icwsi values were much larger than maize icwsi for this case this was due to the low canopy cover in soybean 60 canopy cover and significant interference from the soil surface the range in icwsi values among the four levels increased from 3 to 12 for maize and 5 24 for soybean the average dry maize yield observed for the rainfed deficit full and over levels were 14 6 14 8 15 0 and 14 8 mg ha 1 respectively the average dry soybean yield observed for rainfed deficit full and over levels were 5 0 4 9 4 9 and 5 0 mg ha 1 respectively the maize and soybean yield obtained in 2021 were not significantly different among the different irrigation levels since the yields were similar among the four levels it can be implied that the icwsi values computed for the four levels predominantly detected the energy limiting water stress in 2021 in summary the icwsi data indicated considerable differences among the irrigation levels but there were no differences observed in crop yield among the levels therefore the icwsi data could be effectively used to detect stress signals for scheduling irrigation without incurring any yield loss 3 4 modeled and measured evapotranspiration the seasonal modeled and measured et were compared for all four crop year cases fig 6 the plots from the rainfed and full levels were used for this comparison since the soil water data was only available from these plots the range of measured et among the different plots for maize were 299 mm as compared to 217 mm estimated by modeled et in 2020 the range of soybean et was also larger for measured et 183 mm as compared with modeled et 151 mm it was found that the linear correlations between the measured and modeled et were strong for both crops in 2020 the r2 observed for these correlations was 0 90 and 0 88 for maize and soybean respectively the rmse obtained for maize was 38 mm and for soybean was 32 mm the linear correlations were close to the 1 1 line fig 6 the modeled et were able to capture about 88 of the variability observed in measured et the range of measured et among the plots for maize was 299 mm and for soybean was 183 mm in 2020 in contrast the range of modeled et was about 217 mm and 151 mm for maize and soybean respectively the larger range observed in measured et was primarily due to variability in the soil water storage term of the water balance computed using neutron probe data the neutron probe data was used to represent the root zone to a depth of 122 cm since 2020 was a dry year it is possible that rainfed crop had used soil water from depths larger than 122 cm and may have induced some uncertainty in measured et for rainfed plots the two source energy balance approach of the setmi model was not implemented for modeling et due to logistical time constraints and unavailability of thermal imagery this approach could also capture the variability in the crop et among the different plots in 2021 the range of modeled et 91 mm for maize and 77 mm for soybean was comparable to that observed for measured et 109 mm for maize and 92 mm for soybean for both crops the linear correlations were not as strong as was observed in 2020 the r2 observed for both crops in 2021 was between 0 42 and 0 49 the rmse obtained for maize and soybean was 75 and 52 mm respectively the weaker correlation in 2021 as compared with 2020 could be attributed to differences in surface runoff between the two years the runoff estimated by the model was 3 mm in 2020 and 58 mm in 2021 further the measured et was directly affected by the computed runoff value as measured et was estimated from the water balance equation however the modeled et was primarily computed from the dual crop coefficient approach and may not account for runoff explicitly further the root zone depletion adjustment using the mean difference method and neutron probe data bhatti et al 2020 was tested to improve modeled et results however the adjusted modeled et had high rmse and lower r2 when compared to the model results without the adjustment and was not used for analysis it was concluded that neutron probe data for all plots was required as an input to the model for improved results in conclusion the variability in crop et captured by the measured et was larger as compared to the modeled et for all four crop year combinations there were larger differences in crop et observed among rainfed and irrigated crops using both measured and modeled methods in 2020 as compared to 2021 the 2020 season had less rainfall which caused the rainfed plots to have substantially lower crop et in 2020 3 5 crop water stress evapotranspiration and crop yield the average icwsi was correlated with seasonal et for the different irrigation levels the seasonal et was modeled for all four levels however the measured et obtained from the water balance could only be computed for the rainfed and full levels the mean icwsi in 2020 ranged from 168 in over to 225 in rainfed for maize and 135 in over to 201 in rainfed for soybean the icwsi range was smaller for both crops in 2021 between 77 and 98 the crop water stress is known to increase with a decrease in stomatal conductance and crop et dejonge et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b this relation was found to be consistent for both crops during both growing seasons negative linear correlations were observed among all levels for maize and soybean in both years fig 7 the mean icwsi for rainfed was significantly higher from the other irrigated levels in 2020 since the confidence interval of icwsi for rainfed was larger than that of the other levels the standard error in icwsi ranged between 8 and 10 for 2020 and between 6 and 8 for 2021 an anomaly to this relationship was found in the over level in 2021 the over irrigation level had the largest seasonal crop et among the levels but the mean icwsi was found to be larger than deficit and full levels for both crops the over application in the over level plots could have negatively impacted the crop due to waterlogging issues and or leaching of nutrients in 2020 the mean icwsi was larger for deficit as compared to full for both crops even with no significant differences in yield and noticeable differences in crop et 55 mm for maize and 26 mm for soybean on average in 2021 the mean icwsi data were different among the irrigation levels indicating that the irts were able to sense differences among the treatments even when there were no yield differences observed for both crops crop yield was correlated with seasonal et modeled using setmi for maize and soybean fig 7 the data points computed using the average crop yield and seasonal et for each refill level were also shown in the figure for each crop year the data points for rainfed and deficit were used to compute one regression and the data points for full and over were used to compute the second regression it was investigated if the first regression had a positive slope between rainfed and deficit and the second regression had a zero slope between full and over a positive slope indicated an increase in yield with an increase in et a zero slope will indicate no increase in yield with an increase in et there were significant positive correlations observed between rainfed and deficit for both maize p value 0 001 and soybean p value 0 04 in 2020 in all other cases the slopes of correlations were no different than zero p value 0 05 the correlations observed in 2021 were found to be no different than zero for both crops depicting that reduction in seasonal et for the different irrigation levels did not result in a yield loss it can be observed from fig 8 that there was more separation between data points for each level for 2020 as compared with data from 2021 the data points for each level had more overlap in 2021 this overlap in data was caused by the variability in prescribed irrigation within a level the range of prescribed irrigation for the full irrigation plots was about 39 mm in 2020 and about 73 mm in 2021 although the range of irrigation in the full irrigated plots was larger in 2021 mean irrigation applied in 2020 was substantially larger than in 2021 table 1 in summary a significant positive increase in crop yield with crop et was found for the rainfed and deficit levels for both crops in 2020 further the mean seasonal modeled et increased from rainfed to full by 59 mm in maize and 29 mm in soybean in 2021 this increase in et on average from rainfed to full using the measured data neutron probe data with seasonal water balance was 44 mm in maize and 36 mm in soybean in 2021 while a considerable increase in crop et was observed from rainfed to full there were no significant differences in yield found in 2021 between the irrigation levels this also demonstrated that the reduction in et for rainfed did not result in loss of carbon assimilation and hence similar crop yield among the rainfed and irrigated methods it is evident from the data presented in the previous sections that larger seasonal crop et did not result in improved crop yield for all cases additionally the crop water stress was detected using irts in cases where there were no yield losses and considerable reductions in crop et as compared to the full irrigation level this observation was true for rainfed and deficit irrigation levels in 2021 since there were no yield differences among the levels the seasonal icwsi et and crop yield data from soybean in 2020 were used to demonstrate the different stages of crop water stress table 6 it can be observed from the table that the mean icwsi is increasing with higher crop water stress mean et is reducing with higher crop water stress and crop yield is similar between the well watered and low crop water stress cases hence the data from the study supports the hypothesis that the irts can be used to detect crop water stress by sensing increased canopy temperature before the onset of yield limiting or carbon dioxide limiting water stress the study highlighted that the reduction in stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration does not result in loss of carbon assimilation and crop yield instantaneously this inference is crucial for using thermal sensors irts for full irrigation management to achieve maximum crop yield thermal sensors rely on sensing increased canopy temperature as a signal for crop water stress this study presented the case that the increased canopy temperature due to partial stomatal closure does not result in yield loss during the early phase hence the thermal sensors can be effective for irrigation management in the well watered crop previous research studies have confirmed that the rate of stomatal conductance is reduced at a faster rate as compared with reduction in the carbon assimilation under water deficit conditions chaves and oliveira 2004 water consumption by plants can be reduced by manipulating stomatal functioning without affecting plant functioning and growth loveys and davies 2004 on the contrary many studies assume instantaneous yield reduction with the development of crop water stress holzman et al 2018 peters and evett 2008 zhang et al 2021b future studies should investigate whether the concept of energy limiting water stress is observed in other climates and provide recommendations on management of irrigation using thermal sensing this research presented data from two growing seasons and computed icwsi thresholds for the sub humid climate of eastern nebraska therefore these results are representative of the corn soybean producing fields in sub humid portion of the central great plains since the crop water stress in 2021 was observed to be mild on most days data from only the 2020 growing season was used in computing the icwsi irrigation thresholds the thresholds computed do not include year to year variability in weather and crop water stress hence data from at least two additional seasons should be incorporated to strengthen the representativeness of these thresholds further these thresholds may not be applicable in other geographic locations particularly in drier climates the absence of a zone control variable rate irrigation system restricted the randomization of different irrigation refill level plots across the field this study utilized a speed control system since this system was more commonly used by producers and was lower cost than a zone control system future research can include a zone control system to distribute treatments with more flexibility across the field and improve the randomization of treatments additional research is warranted to investigate the transition from the energy limiting water stress to the carbon dioxide limiting water stress and the factors affecting the timing of this transition this study draws conclusions about stomatal conductance from the measured evapotranspiration data future studies could incorporate direct measurement of stomatal conductance when studying effects of varying levels of water stress on evapotranspiration yield and carbon assimilation 4 conclusions this two year study evaluated the use of pivot mounted irts for the detection of crop water stress in maize and soybean this research was successful in detecting crop water stress from thermal sensors in fully irrigated plots without incurring crop yield loss i e detecting energy limiting water stress before carbon dioxide limiting water stress occurs contrary to the common assumption a reduction in seasonal crop et did not always result in lower crop yield mild crop water stress for a short period of time may not lead to crop yield loss this finding is fundamental for management of full irrigation using thermal sensing to achieve potential yield significant et yield correlations were observed only with rainfed and deficit levels in 2020 the mean icwsi and seasonal et for each level was found to be negatively related for both 2020 and 2021 it was found that the icwsi substantially increased after two days from a wetting event the low medium and high icwsi thresholds for irrigation management were determined as 120 150 and 180 respectively for maize and 110 130 and 150 respectively for soybean these thresholds are applicable for the sub humid climate of the central great plains it is proposed that two more seasons of icwsi data from this region should be incorporated into the developed thresholds to account for variability among the seasons future research should implement the developed icwsi thresholds for management of irrigation and validate their use for the sub humid climate declaration of competing interest the authors

9238,thermal sensing provides rapid and accurate estimation of crop water stress through canopy temperature data canopy temperature is highly dependent on the transpiration rate of the leaves it is usually assumed that any reduction in crop evapotranspiration et leads to crop yield loss as a result an increase in canopy temperature due to a decrease in crop et would indicate crop yield loss this research evaluated the hypothesis that crop water stress could be detected using canopy temperature measurements increased leaf temperature from infrared thermometers irts before incurring crop yield loss this would be possible in a narrow range when the photosynthesis rate and carbon assimilation is limited by solar radiation energy limiting water stress while the leaf has abundant carbon dioxide for photosynthesis once photosynthesis becomes limited by carbon dioxide carbon dioxide limiting water stress then yield reduction would occur in this field experiment measured response variables included the integrated crop water stress index icwsi et and crop yield for maize and soybean during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the irrigation was applied at four different refill levels rainfed 0 deficit 50 full 100 and over 150 the irrigation depth was prescribed using four different irrigation methods the field was irrigated with a center pivot irrigation system which was also used as a platform to mount irt sensors the icwsi thresholds required for irrigation management were determined using the icwsi dataset collected in 2020 the low medium and high icwsi thresholds were 120 150 and 180 respectively for maize and 110 130 and 150 respectively for soybean these thresholds should be updated with icwsi data from future studies in this region to increase the credibility of the thresholds for irrigation management the mean icwsi values for consecutive days after a wetting event substantially increased with time for each irrigation level and a larger range in icwsi values was observed among the irrigation levels after three days from a wetting event the seasonal icwsi for different levels were found to be negatively correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration for both years the correlations between seasonal et and crop yield were significant with the rainfed and deficit levels for maize p value 0 001 and soybean p value 0 04 in 2020 the icwsi and yield data for the fully watered plots indicated that thermal stress was detected using the sensing system without incurring yield loss i e energy limiting water stress the et and yield data for 2021 indicated that reduction in seasonal crop et did not result in yield loss which also supported the hypothesis future studies should investigate whether this phenomenon of detecting crop water stress in an early stage without yield loss is observed in other climates and locations keywords crop water stress1 evapotranspiration2 irrigation3 thermal sensing4 maize5 soybean6 data availability data will be made

strategies for improved productivity fereres and soriano 2007 kullberg et al 2017 crop biomass and yield are directly affected by the incidence of crop water stress han et al 2016 o shaughnessy et al 2017 the plants react to crop water stress by reducing transpiration through the leaves dejonge et al 2015 the timing and duration of crop water stress determines both the quantity and quality of crop yield aladenola and madramootoo 2014 payero et al 2006 rossini et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 crop yield is found to be linearly related to crop water use or et in a majority of studies garrity et al 1982 payero et al 2006 schneekloth et al 1991 the slope of this linear relationship is dependent on irrigation management soil and residue management climate soil texture hybrid characteristics plant population and disease pressure irmak 2015 the linear relationship between crop yield and et does not indicate direct proportional relation among the two variables in fact some reduction in et may not affect crop yield if the plant has adequate concentration of carbon dioxide required for carrying out photosynthesis crop yield is produced as a result of photosynthesis and crop transpiration accounts for majority of et following canopy closure results from loss of water through stomata these are two different processes which are independent of each other and are not directly affected by each other the rate of change in photosynthesis with crop transpiration is highly dependent on the leaf air vapor pressure difference under natural conditions bierhuizen and slatyer 1965 the water transpired by a crop and the amount of biomass accumulated during the same time are strongly connected by photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy monteith 1986 we hypothesize that a crop can experience some water stress with a reduction in transpiration causing increased leaf temperature which can be detected for irrigation management without a reduction in photosynthesis the common phenomena that affect both photosynthesis and et is stomatal conductance stomatal guard cells present in crop leaves regulate the flux of water vapor lost by the leaf and the carbon dioxide entering the stomata medlyn et al 2011 stomatal conductance during the day is a function of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and soil water content zhang et al 2021b with reduction in the stomatal conductance the mass flux of water vapor leaving the leaf surface and the mass flux of carbon dioxide entering the leaf decreases hence the changes to stomatal conductance instantly affect the crop et through changes in the mass flow rate of water vapor the decrease in the loss of water by transpiration results in an increase of the leaf temperature which can be detected by thermal sensors the rate of photosynthesis is mainly driven by carbon dioxide present in the leaf and or light energy from the sun in a subhumid climate in the absence of water stress photosynthesis is often energy limited at the onset of water stress reduced transpiration rate when there is only a small decrease in stomatal conductance the rate of photosynthesis and production of crop biomass may not be affected if the rate of photosynthesis is still energy limited with only a small reduction in stomatal conductance the carbon dioxide concentration gradient across the stomate may increase enough to result in the same influx of carbon dioxide to the leaf and the leaf has adequate supply of carbon to carry out photosynthesis at the optimal level along with other carbon related processes this stage of crop water stress in which the plant still has enough carbon for photosynthesis i e energy limited photosynthesis will be referred to as energy limiting water stress we summarize this concept in fig 1 carbon is sequestered by the plant at an optimal rate similar to the rate with no crop water stress during the energy limiting stage of the photosynthesis with continued reduction in the stomatal conductance below a critical level the carbon dioxide flux rate in the leaf decreases leading to a decrease in the photosynthetic rate this will result in a reduction in the rate of carbon assimilation and biomass produced by the crop this stage will be referred to as the carbon dioxide limiting water stress the photosynthesis at this stage is limited by the amount of carbon present in the leaf and not by the energy available to the leaf thermal sensing is widely used in research to quantify crop water stress through canopy temperature measurements berni et al 2009 kullberg et al 2017 lena et al 2020 masseroni et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2013 osroosh et al 2016 singh et al 2021 canopy temperature data obtained using thermal sensing is used to determine changes to crop et at a particular net energy zhang et al 2021a crop water stress is commonly expressed using various thermal indices including crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 water deficit index wdi moran et al 1994 and temperature time threshold ttt upchurch et al 1996 canopy temperature data required to compute these indices are usually collected using irts installed at remote locations of the field payero and irmak 2006 taghvaeian et al 2012 wanjura et al 1995 mounting crop canopy sensors on a center pivot irrigation system provides an opportunity to utilize the pivot lateral as a moving platform for data acquisition across the field o shaughnessy et al 2020 stone et al 2020 vories et al 2020 new center pivot systems are available with a high speed drive allowing the pivot lateral to make a complete revolution in a commercial scale field e g 125 ha in only 4 h this is significant because 1 data can be collected without irrigating minimizing interference from water on the canopy yet only needing to stop irrigation for 4 h and 2 data can be collected on the entire field at the time when detecting stress is most likely approximately 1 h before solar noon to three hours after solar noon a scaling algorithm peters and evett 2004 is used to estimate canopy temperature during the daylight hours for each remote location the spatiotemporal canopy temperature data is used to compute integrated crop water stress index icwsi evett et al 2014 the icwsi was used as a thermal index in this study to detect crop water stress and trigger irrigation the icwsi integrates canopy temperature measurements throughout the day and is better at representing daily crop water stress as compared to indices using single time of day measurement of canopy temperature the plants with high crop water stress will correspond to high icwsi values and higher water application depth in contrast the plants with lower crop water stress will correspond to lower icwsi values and requiring either no irrigation or lower application depth o shaughnessy et al 2020 the irrigation scheduling supervisory control and data acquisition isscada evett et al 2020 system computes the spatial icwsi maps and is capable of managing site specific irrigation without user input irrigation management using thermal sensing relies primarily on leaf temperature changes that are related to transpiration rate before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress there is limited research on canopy thermal sensing that focuses on studying crop et and crop water stress before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress the notion of inducing crop water stress with no reduction in potential yield is not widely investigated the detection of crop water stress in an early phase should be further explored in different locations and climates to understand the crop physiology during this phase the moving platform for thermal sensing of crops should also be researched in the context of practical irrigation management this research investigated the detection of crop water stress using irt sensors in an early phase of water stress with energy limited photosynthesis without incurring crop yield loss the icwsi was used to determine the crop water stress the findings from this study will also inform about the effectiveness of the irrigation scheduling methods developed on canopy temperature based thermal indices the analyses involved evaluation of the relationships between crop yield et and crop water stress for maize and soybean during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the specific objectives of the study included 1 studying the trends in icwsi and crop yield among four different irrigation levels ranging from high stress to no stress 2 computation of icwsi based irrigation thresholds for maize and soybean in the sub humid climate of eastern nebraska and 3 evaluating the correlations between crop yield et and icwsi for different irrigation levels 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and design a 58 ha research field situated at the university of nebraska s eastern nebraska research extension and education center enreec near mead nebraska centered at 41 172445 n 96 478248 w was used for this experiment during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons the field was divided in two halves which were rotated between maize and soybean each year the experiment included data from soybean in the north half in 2020 maize in the south half in 2020 maize in the north half in 2021 and soybean in the south half in 2021 the soils in the field were classified as silt loam and silty clay loam gssurgo soil survey staff 2018 which were nearly equally distributed between the north and south halves the field was irrigated using a speed control enabled center pivot irrigation system model valley irrigation 8000 valmont valley ne and fitted with high speed x tec center drive motors the field area under spans six and seven of the center pivot system were used for this study the area was divided into four radial zones and 24 arc wise plot boundaries defining 96 plots which were divided equally among the north and south halves fig 2 the area of the plots ranged between 1870 m2 and 2630 m2 the four radial rings were managed using four different levels of irrigation rainfed deficit full and over rainfed plots were applied with no irrigation deficit plots were applied with 50 of the full amount full plots were applied with 100 of the prescribed irrigation and over plots were applied with 150 of the full amount the irrigation amount applied in the full level plots were determined using four different irrigation methods plant feedback isscada hybrid isscada common practice and spatial evapotranspiration model setmi neale et al 2012 2 2 experimental data infrared thermometers irts sapip irt dynamax inc houston tx were mounted on the pivot lateral and stationary posts to monitor canopy temperature these irts had a field of view fov of 20 the irts were programmed to sense canopy temperature every five seconds and average these readings over one minute two irts were mounted for each radial zone totaling eight irts on the center pivot lateral these irts were installed at a spacing of 6 1 m from the edges of the radial zone the paired irt sensors on the pivot lateral were positioned such that the fov is pointing towards the center of the respective radial zone a stationary irt was installed at one full irrigated plot for each crop fig 2 the stationary irt was positioned to have a nadir view of the canopy the height of the stationary irt was adjusted at least once every month to maintain a constant height of 1 m above the crop canopy more details on the position and orientation of irts can be found in bhatti et al 2022 soil water data from two neutron probes model 503 elite hydroprobe cpn concord ca were collected at 48 locations with a frequency of about three weeks these 48 locations included rainfed and full irrigated plots with 24 locations in each crop a local calibration from a nearby field 3 km from the study site with same soil types were used to calibrate the first neutron probe the second neutron probe was cross calibrated using the first neutron probe the slope and intercept from the calibration were 0 2738 and 0 0991 m3 m 3 respectively for the first probe and 0 2766 and 0 1189 m3 m 3 respectively for the second probe the data were acquired at depths of 15 45 76 and 107 cm the soil water content representing 122 cm deep root zone was computed using depth weighted average of neutron probe readings from the four depths soil water data was also monitored using acclima soil water sensors acclima inc meridian id at one location for each crop these sensors were installed horizontally at depths of 15 30 46 and 76 cm for each location weather data for the isscada system including air temperature wind speed wind direction rainfall relative humidity and solar radiation were obtained using an agsense weather station valmont industries inc huron sd these weather variables were recorded at a frequency of 5 min the weather station was installed just west of the field in an open area with grass the cup anemometer was installed at a height of 3 m for the setmi model weather data from memphis 5 n station nebraska mesonet were used at hourly and daily time step this station was about 5 km away from the field remote sensing imagery from planetscope planet labs inc san francisco ca was used in setmi the resolution of the imagery was 3 m and was acquired at a daily time step images were inspected for cloud cover using arcmap 10 4 1 esri redlands ca and images having cloud cover over or around the field were not included in the model the red and near infrared bands of the imagery were used in the model to compute the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 2 3 irrigation management the irrigation was managed using four irrigation scheduling methods applied at four different irrigation levels the isscada system was used to prescribe two methods plant feedback and hybrid the plant feedback method used irts on the center pivot and the stationary posts along with weather data to compute spatial icwsi maps the icwsi data were used to schedule irrigation for the plant feedback method in addition to icwsi data the hybrid method also used soil water data acquired from acclima soil water sensors the third method was the common practice which included soil sampling using a soil probe and using the hand feel method on the sampled soil to make an irrigation recommendation the fourth method was scheduled using the setmi model which used planetscope imagery and soil water data from neutron probe the setmi model was used for irrigation recommendations similar to bhatti et al 2020 this model computed spatial soil water balance at 3 m pixel resolution and recommended irrigation at a sub field scale experimental plots the irrigation recommendations obtained from these four methods were applied at four levels 0 or rainfed 50 or deficit 100 or full and 150 or over this study focused on the differences in response variables found among different levels of irrigation the evaporation loss during irrigation applications was expected to be larger in the deficit level since the irrigation depth was smaller in deficit as compared to the other irrigated levels there were 10 11 irrigation events applied in 2020 and 4 5 irrigation events applied in 2021 for both crops the mean seasonal irrigation depth prescribed for the four levels are given in table 1 2 4 computation of response variables 2 4 1 integrated crop water stress index the crop water stress was represented using icwsi computed by the isscada system the icwsi is more descriptive of the cumulative crop water stress during a day as compared to other thermal indices utilizing only single measurement of canopy temperature the thermal data from the irt sensors on the stationary post and pivot lateral were used to compute the icwsi the center pivot was moved to complete a revolution without running water dry scan during the daylight hours for data collection from the pivot mounted irts in total there were 16 dry scans conducted in 2020 and 19 dry scans conducted in 2021 table 2 a temperature scaling algorithm peters and evett 2004 was used to estimate canopy temperature for each remote location on a diurnal basis the algorithm also used data from the stationary irts installed at the full level plots in both crops the icwsi was computed by integrating the crop water stress index cwsi jackson et al 1981 over peak daylight hours 9 00 am to 7 00 pm at a time step of 1 min the icwsi at a given location was computed as mentioned in o shaughnessy et al 2017 eq 1 1 icwsi i 1 n t c t a t c t a ll t c t a ul t c t a ll where i is the ith time step n is total number of one minute steps between 9 00 am and 7 00 pm t c is canopy temperature estimated using scaling algorithm t a is ambient air temperature t c t a ll represents the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature differential and t c t a ul represents the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature differential the lower and upper limits of the temperature difference between canopy and air were computed using the theoretical cwsi approach jackson et al 1981 the icwsi computed for each location was used to produce spatial crop water stress maps for the field on a given day the gps data from the pivot were used to georeference the icwsi data the isscada system outputs the icwsi maps at a resolution of 2 the icwsi values for locations lying within a radial zone were averaged to compute a representative value of icwsi for that zone 2 4 2 setmi modeled evapotranspiration setmi was used to model spatial et using planetscope satellite imagery the dual crop coefficient approach was used to compute crop et allen et al 1998 the model computed savi values were used to compute reflectance based crop coefficients campos et al 2017 the alfalfa based reference et was computed using the asce standardized tall reference evapotranspiration equation asce ewri 2005 the reference et was computed at hourly time step and added up to daily time step the weather data for reference et was acquired from the memphis 5 n station nebraska mesonet the setmi modeled et was computed for all four irrigation level plots the field capacity for the plots were estimated using the first neutron probe soil water measurement taken on june 12 2020 observational field capacity the field received rainfall of about 10 mm two days prior to the measurement day the model was not updated with soil water data when computing modeled et since there were no soil water data for the deficit and over plots 2 4 3 measured evapotranspiration soil water balance adjusted with neutron probe measurements in setmi was also used to compute seasonal crop et these et values computed from soil water balance were referred to as measured et since soil water data were used to update the water balance setmi was used to output seasonal deep percolation and runoff the soil water storage term on a seasonal basis was computed from the difference between first and last neutron probe measurements the neutron probe data was used to represent a root zone depth of 122 cm during the 2020 season it was possible that the rainfed crop may have extracted some water from depths greater than 122 cm which were not accounted for in the measured et the measurement period first and last neutron probe measurement day used to represent seasonal et for each crop is shown in table 3 this measurement period was used for representing the seasonal et for each crop year the measured et was only computed for the rainfed and full level plots since soil water data was only measured in these plots 2 4 4 crop yield the crop yield data were recorded using yield monitoring equipment model john deere 2630 yield monitor system with rtk gps accuracy on the combine harvesters model john deere s650 the combine yield monitors were calibrated at the beginning of each season following original equipment manufacturer procedure the yield monitors have an expected accuracy range of 3 and were recalibrated if the error was higher than the expected range similar yield monitoring equipment were utilized in barker et al 2018 bhatti et al 2020 the yield data were processed and filtered using the yield editor software version 2 0 agricultural research service united states department of agriculture the processed yield was compared to the weighing grain cart readings to validate the processed data the grain moisture was removed to compute dry grain during yield processing and the dry yield was used to conduct the analysis the plot yield for each crop was computed by averaging the yield points within the plot using arcgis 10 4 software esri redlands ca 2 5 data analysis the response variables used for analyses included crop yield icwsi and crop et these variables were correlated to study the type and strength of correlation an inner buffer of 6 1 m around the edges of each plot was used to remove boundary effects from adjacent plots the data collected from the buffer area of each plot were excluded from the analyses the icwsi data collected between august 4 and 20 were used for maize and soybean in 2020 for 2021 the icwsi data used for maize were collected between july 2 and august 24 and for soybean were collected between july 20 and august 24 the soil had significant interference in the icwsi data for soybean before july 20 2021 since the canopy was not completely covering the soil these measurement periods for icwsi represented fully grown crop with canopy closure before the onset of crop senescence the icwsi data for different analyses were compared among the four irrigation refill levels the icwsi data collected from the dry scans were averaged under different scenarios these scenarios included combined all data sunny days cloudy days more than two days from a wetting event more than three days from a wetting event and within 2 days of a wetting event the classification of cloud cover on a certain day was determined using the incoming solar radiation data collected by the agsense weather station the radiation data were investigated for the periods during a day when there was a significant decrease in solar radiation from its upper limit the day was classified as cloudy if the incoming solar radiation was lower than the upper potential limit for more than 25 of the time during the daylight hours further the icwsi data collected in 2020 were used to define thresholds for irrigation scheduling in 2021 a total of three thresholds were computed to indicate low medium and high stress the icwsi data collected between august 4 and august 20 were used to compute these thresholds there were total of nine dry scans conducted between these days the icwsi data collected only from the full irrigated plots were used for the computation of these thresholds the high threshold was computed by averaging the icwsi data collected after two or more days from a wetting event rainfall or irrigation the low threshold was computed by averaging the icwsi data acquired within two days of a wetting event the average value of the high and low thresholds was used for computing the medium threshold the relation between icwsi and wetting events was investigated using data acquired on consecutive days after a wetting event there were two instances in 2020 where icwsi data were collected successively for four days after a wetting event however there was only one instance in 2021 where icwsi data were collected during 7 13 days after a wetting event the icwsi data for this analysis were averaged for each irrigation level plots and differences in icwsi values among the different levels were also discussed the seasonal crop et was computed for the respective neutron probe measurement period for each case table 3 the daily values of et were added for all days within the measurement period to compute the seasonal et the modeled et computed from setmi and the measured et computed from water balance were compared on a seasonal basis since the neutron probe data was not available for the deficit and over levels the setmi model was not updated with neutron probe data during the modeling of seasonal et the coefficient of determination r2 along with the regression equation were determined this comparison was made using rainfed and full irrigated plots the icwsi and et data were correlated for both crops in 2020 and 2021 the icwsi data acquired after two or more days from a wetting event were used for this analysis table 5 the data for each irrigation level were then averaged over the selected dry scan days to get a single average icwsi value for each level there were total of 12 plots that were used to average icwsi data for each irrigation level in each crop the seasonal et was also averaged among the plots for each level the measurement period mentioned in table 3 was used for computing the seasonal et the plot averaged seasonal measured et and icwsi were correlated for the rainfed and full level plots the seasonal modeled et and icwsi correlation was investigated for all four levels the crop yield and seasonal et were also correlated at plot scale for both years the correlation used with measured et was conducted for rainfed and fully irrigated plots the correlation used with modeled et was conducted for all four levels for the modeled et analysis two regressions were computed the first regression between the rainfed and deficit plots and the second regression between the full and over level plots it was investigated whether the first regression yielded a positive slope and the second regression had a zero slope statistical t tests were conducted at a 5 significance level to investigate if the slope of the correlations were different from zero the r2 linear regression analysis root mean square error rmse and statistical tests were conducted using the microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa the least squares method was used to select the linear regression model the rmse was computed using the following equation 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where s i are predicted values o i are observations and n are number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean weather conditions the weather variables presented for both study years were computed between june 1 and september 30 table 4 the average daily maximum and minimum temperature were similar for 2020 and 2021 the total rainfall depth in 2020 was smaller than half of the total rainfall depth received in 2021 a weather station mead 6 s national centers for environmental information close to the field 6 5 km reported a historic average rainfall 1991 2020 of 381 mm between the months of june and september hence the 2020 growing season was extremely dry for this region the average wind speed relative humidity vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation were computed for daylight hours from 9 am to 7 pm 3 2 seasonal water inputs and crop water stress the seasonal icwsi rainfall and irrigation data for the four crop year scenarios in common practice plots were shown using fig 3 the rainfall events among the two seasons were observed to be different primarily in terms of rainfall depth the rainfall in the second half of the 2021 growing season experienced substantially larger rainfall events as compared with 2020 there were seven rainfall events larger than 25 mm in 2021 as compared to only one in 2020 the seasonal irrigation depth applied in 2020 was larger as compared with 2021 table 1 the icwsi data for 2020 had higher values on average as compared to 2021 the icwsi data from mid may to mid june in 2021 indicated high crop water stress because of small canopy cover and significant soil interference in the background for both crops crop water stress was also high in 2020 towards the end of the season which could be attributed to the effects of senescence on crop physiology the icwsi data were averaged for the sunny days cloudy days all measurement days or certain number of days from a wetting event to study how these conditions affect the crop water stress the averaged icwsi values for all four crop years are listed in table 5 in 2020 the average icwsi values ranged between 118 observed in over and 254 observed in rainfed for maize the soybean icwsi values ranged between 109 observed in over and 201 observed in rainfed the icwsi among the irrigation levels increased in the order of over full deficit and rainfed for both crops this observation was consistent with kashyap 2021 in which high frequency unmanned aircraft flights were conducted to acquire thermal imagery of soybean at this field site on august 26 2020 he found that the difference in canopy and air temperature followed a clear diurnal pattern and the canopy temperature for the full level was consistently higher than the canopy temperature for the over level throughout the day in 2021 the average icwsi values ranged between 48 observed in full and 130 observed in over for maize the icwsi values ranged between 30 observed in full and 100 observed in rainfed for soybean it is evident that average icwsi values in 2020 were nearly double than that observed in 2021 for both crops the reason for higher crop water stress in 2020 could be attributed to smaller rainfall depth and larger available energy i e higher average solar radiation than 2021 table 4 further it was observed that the over level experienced similar crop water stress as rainfed crop in 2021 as indicated by average icwsi data shown in table 5 the high crop water stress observed in over could be due to anaerobic conditions and low oxygen in the root zone as a result of over application of water pezeshki 2001 wu et al 2018 the icwsi values observed for sunny days were consistently lower than for the cloudy days this observation could be attributed to more diffused radiation available on cloudy days than on sunny days durand et al 2021 the average icwsi values for full irrigated plots were used for defining the low medium and high icwsi thresholds since the full irrigated plots were managed to experience crop water stress without incurring yield loss the thresholds were computed only using these plots the data from the full irrigated plots on a given dry scan day were averaged to compute a single averaged value of icwsi the icwsi values obtained by averaging data collected after two or more days from a wetting event were 180 for maize and 150 for soybean which were used as the high threshold the icwsi values obtained by averaging data collected within two days of a wetting event were 120 for maize and 110 for soybean which were used as the low threshold the mean of the respective low and high thresholds was used for the medium threshold for both crops in summary the low medium and high thresholds for maize were 120 150 and 180 respectively and for soybean were 110 130 and 150 respectively these values corresponded to different irrigation depths prescribed by the isscada system 12 7 mm for the low threshold 19 mm for the medium threshold and 25 4 mm for the high threshold crop exposure to water stress during the early vegetative stages will reduce the vegetative cover and during the reproductive stages will impact the grain yield prolonged icwsi readings above the low threshold for several days will likely result in crop yield loss from the potential crop yield for the season the high icwsi threshold denotes higher crop water stress as compared to low or medium threshold and indicates immediate need to irrigate the crop to avoid crop yield loss it is expected that these icwsi thresholds used for isscada system should be transferrable to locations with similar climate in the central great plains these icwsi thresholds were used for managing irrigation for the isscada methods in 2021 the crop yield observed in the isscada plots were not significantly different from other irrigation methods in 2021 since 2021 was significantly wetter than 2020 these thresholds should be further tested for irrigation management of maize and soybean to evaluate the suitability of these thresholds over multiple seasons with varying weather conditions the 2021 icwsi data were not used for computing the final thresholds since significant crop water stress was not observed during this season and there were small differences in crop water stress between the irrigation levels it is recommended to incorporate icwsi data from two more seasons in the computed thresholds these icwsi thresholds could still be used for implementation of the isscada system in this region and could be further updated with data from additional seasons 3 3 crop water stress after a wetting event in 2020 icwsi data from two intervals were used for investigating the trend between icwsi and wetting events the two intervals included icwsi data from august 9 12 fig 4a and b and august 17 20 figs 4c and 4d the wetting events before these two intervals were 8 mm rainfall on august 9 and 18 mm rainfall on august 16 the rainfall event on august 9 occurred between 5 30 and 8 30 am which was before the data collection from the pivot mounted sensors on that day it was observed that the icwsi increased for all levels with each day after the wetting events for both crops fig 4 an exception to this observation was found for data on august 9 and 10 where icwsi values decreased on the next measurement day the rainfall event on august 9 had occurred just two hours before the dry scan was conducted the decrease in icwsi on august 10 may be attributed to the delay in response of the crop canopy to the added water in the soil root zone through the rainfall event the variability in icwsi among the four levels also increased with each day after the wetting events for the data between august 17 and 20 the range of average icwsi among the four levels increased from 14 during day 1 67 during day 4 after the wetting event for maize and from 6 during day 1 95 during day 4 after the wetting event for soybean the rainfed crop had the largest icwsi values among the four levels for each measurement day the average dry maize yield observed for the rainfed deficit full and over levels were 11 8 13 1 13 6 and 13 7 mg ha 1 respectively the average dry soybean yield observed for rainfed deficit full and over levels were 4 4 4 4 4 and 4 5 mg ha 1 respectively the rainfed maize and rainfed soybean had significantly lower yield than the respective irrigated crops therefore the icwsi values obtained for the rainfed crop indicated carbon dioxide limiting water stress however the icwsi values obtained for the full and over levels indicated the energy limiting water stress these results show that the crop water stress could be detected before the onset of carbon dioxide limiting water stress and could be used for real time irrigation scheduling in 2021 the icwsi data was not available immediately following a wetting event the icwsi data collected between july 2 and 8 following a rainfall event of 38 mm on june 25 was presented for both crops similar to 2020 the icwsi values for all levels increased from 7 day to 13 days after the wetting event fig 5 the soybean icwsi values were much larger than maize icwsi for this case this was due to the low canopy cover in soybean 60 canopy cover and significant interference from the soil surface the range in icwsi values among the four levels increased from 3 to 12 for maize and 5 24 for soybean the average dry maize yield observed for the rainfed deficit full and over levels were 14 6 14 8 15 0 and 14 8 mg ha 1 respectively the average dry soybean yield observed for rainfed deficit full and over levels were 5 0 4 9 4 9 and 5 0 mg ha 1 respectively the maize and soybean yield obtained in 2021 were not significantly different among the different irrigation levels since the yields were similar among the four levels it can be implied that the icwsi values computed for the four levels predominantly detected the energy limiting water stress in 2021 in summary the icwsi data indicated considerable differences among the irrigation levels but there were no differences observed in crop yield among the levels therefore the icwsi data could be effectively used to detect stress signals for scheduling irrigation without incurring any yield loss 3 4 modeled and measured evapotranspiration the seasonal modeled and measured et were compared for all four crop year cases fig 6 the plots from the rainfed and full levels were used for this comparison since the soil water data was only available from these plots the range of measured et among the different plots for maize were 299 mm as compared to 217 mm estimated by modeled et in 2020 the range of soybean et was also larger for measured et 183 mm as compared with modeled et 151 mm it was found that the linear correlations between the measured and modeled et were strong for both crops in 2020 the r2 observed for these correlations was 0 90 and 0 88 for maize and soybean respectively the rmse obtained for maize was 38 mm and for soybean was 32 mm the linear correlations were close to the 1 1 line fig 6 the modeled et were able to capture about 88 of the variability observed in measured et the range of measured et among the plots for maize was 299 mm and for soybean was 183 mm in 2020 in contrast the range of modeled et was about 217 mm and 151 mm for maize and soybean respectively the larger range observed in measured et was primarily due to variability in the soil water storage term of the water balance computed using neutron probe data the neutron probe data was used to represent the root zone to a depth of 122 cm since 2020 was a dry year it is possible that rainfed crop had used soil water from depths larger than 122 cm and may have induced some uncertainty in measured et for rainfed plots the two source energy balance approach of the setmi model was not implemented for modeling et due to logistical time constraints and unavailability of thermal imagery this approach could also capture the variability in the crop et among the different plots in 2021 the range of modeled et 91 mm for maize and 77 mm for soybean was comparable to that observed for measured et 109 mm for maize and 92 mm for soybean for both crops the linear correlations were not as strong as was observed in 2020 the r2 observed for both crops in 2021 was between 0 42 and 0 49 the rmse obtained for maize and soybean was 75 and 52 mm respectively the weaker correlation in 2021 as compared with 2020 could be attributed to differences in surface runoff between the two years the runoff estimated by the model was 3 mm in 2020 and 58 mm in 2021 further the measured et was directly affected by the computed runoff value as measured et was estimated from the water balance equation however the modeled et was primarily computed from the dual crop coefficient approach and may not account for runoff explicitly further the root zone depletion adjustment using the mean difference method and neutron probe data bhatti et al 2020 was tested to improve modeled et results however the adjusted modeled et had high rmse and lower r2 when compared to the model results without the adjustment and was not used for analysis it was concluded that neutron probe data for all plots was required as an input to the model for improved results in conclusion the variability in crop et captured by the measured et was larger as compared to the modeled et for all four crop year combinations there were larger differences in crop et observed among rainfed and irrigated crops using both measured and modeled methods in 2020 as compared to 2021 the 2020 season had less rainfall which caused the rainfed plots to have substantially lower crop et in 2020 3 5 crop water stress evapotranspiration and crop yield the average icwsi was correlated with seasonal et for the different irrigation levels the seasonal et was modeled for all four levels however the measured et obtained from the water balance could only be computed for the rainfed and full levels the mean icwsi in 2020 ranged from 168 in over to 225 in rainfed for maize and 135 in over to 201 in rainfed for soybean the icwsi range was smaller for both crops in 2021 between 77 and 98 the crop water stress is known to increase with a decrease in stomatal conductance and crop et dejonge et al 2015 zhang et al 2021b this relation was found to be consistent for both crops during both growing seasons negative linear correlations were observed among all levels for maize and soybean in both years fig 7 the mean icwsi for rainfed was significantly higher from the other irrigated levels in 2020 since the confidence interval of icwsi for rainfed was larger than that of the other levels the standard error in icwsi ranged between 8 and 10 for 2020 and between 6 and 8 for 2021 an anomaly to this relationship was found in the over level in 2021 the over irrigation level had the largest seasonal crop et among the levels but the mean icwsi was found to be larger than deficit and full levels for both crops the over application in the over level plots could have negatively impacted the crop due to waterlogging issues and or leaching of nutrients in 2020 the mean icwsi was larger for deficit as compared to full for both crops even with no significant differences in yield and noticeable differences in crop et 55 mm for maize and 26 mm for soybean on average in 2021 the mean icwsi data were different among the irrigation levels indicating that the irts were able to sense differences among the treatments even when there were no yield differences observed for both crops crop yield was correlated with seasonal et modeled using setmi for maize and soybean fig 7 the data points computed using the average crop yield and seasonal et for each refill level were also shown in the figure for each crop year the data points for rainfed and deficit were used to compute one regression and the data points for full and over were used to compute the second regression it was investigated if the first regression had a positive slope between rainfed and deficit and the second regression had a zero slope between full and over a positive slope indicated an increase in yield with an increase in et a zero slope will indicate no increase in yield with an increase in et there were significant positive correlations observed between rainfed and deficit for both maize p value 0 001 and soybean p value 0 04 in 2020 in all other cases the slopes of correlations were no different than zero p value 0 05 the correlations observed in 2021 were found to be no different than zero for both crops depicting that reduction in seasonal et for the different irrigation levels did not result in a yield loss it can be observed from fig 8 that there was more separation between data points for each level for 2020 as compared with data from 2021 the data points for each level had more overlap in 2021 this overlap in data was caused by the variability in prescribed irrigation within a level the range of prescribed irrigation for the full irrigation plots was about 39 mm in 2020 and about 73 mm in 2021 although the range of irrigation in the full irrigated plots was larger in 2021 mean irrigation applied in 2020 was substantially larger than in 2021 table 1 in summary a significant positive increase in crop yield with crop et was found for the rainfed and deficit levels for both crops in 2020 further the mean seasonal modeled et increased from rainfed to full by 59 mm in maize and 29 mm in soybean in 2021 this increase in et on average from rainfed to full using the measured data neutron probe data with seasonal water balance was 44 mm in maize and 36 mm in soybean in 2021 while a considerable increase in crop et was observed from rainfed to full there were no significant differences in yield found in 2021 between the irrigation levels this also demonstrated that the reduction in et for rainfed did not result in loss of carbon assimilation and hence similar crop yield among the rainfed and irrigated methods it is evident from the data presented in the previous sections that larger seasonal crop et did not result in improved crop yield for all cases additionally the crop water stress was detected using irts in cases where there were no yield losses and considerable reductions in crop et as compared to the full irrigation level this observation was true for rainfed and deficit irrigation levels in 2021 since there were no yield differences among the levels the seasonal icwsi et and crop yield data from soybean in 2020 were used to demonstrate the different stages of crop water stress table 6 it can be observed from the table that the mean icwsi is increasing with higher crop water stress mean et is reducing with higher crop water stress and crop yield is similar between the well watered and low crop water stress cases hence the data from the study supports the hypothesis that the irts can be used to detect crop water stress by sensing increased canopy temperature before the onset of yield limiting or carbon dioxide limiting water stress the study highlighted that the reduction in stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration does not result in loss of carbon assimilation and crop yield instantaneously this inference is crucial for using thermal sensors irts for full irrigation management to achieve maximum crop yield thermal sensors rely on sensing increased canopy temperature as a signal for crop water stress this study presented the case that the increased canopy temperature due to partial stomatal closure does not result in yield loss during the early phase hence the thermal sensors can be effective for irrigation management in the well watered crop previous research studies have confirmed that the rate of stomatal conductance is reduced at a faster rate as compared with reduction in the carbon assimilation under water deficit conditions chaves and oliveira 2004 water consumption by plants can be reduced by manipulating stomatal functioning without affecting plant functioning and growth loveys and davies 2004 on the contrary many studies assume instantaneous yield reduction with the development of crop water stress holzman et al 2018 peters and evett 2008 zhang et al 2021b future studies should investigate whether the concept of energy limiting water stress is observed in other climates and provide recommendations on management of irrigation using thermal sensing this research presented data from two growing seasons and computed icwsi thresholds for the sub humid climate of eastern nebraska therefore these results are representative of the corn soybean producing fields in sub humid portion of the central great plains since the crop water stress in 2021 was observed to be mild on most days data from only the 2020 growing season was used in computing the icwsi irrigation thresholds the thresholds computed do not include year to year variability in weather and crop water stress hence data from at least two additional seasons should be incorporated to strengthen the representativeness of these thresholds further these thresholds may not be applicable in other geographic locations particularly in drier climates the absence of a zone control variable rate irrigation system restricted the randomization of different irrigation refill level plots across the field this study utilized a speed control system since this system was more commonly used by producers and was lower cost than a zone control system future research can include a zone control system to distribute treatments with more flexibility across the field and improve the randomization of treatments additional research is warranted to investigate the transition from the energy limiting water stress to the carbon dioxide limiting water stress and the factors affecting the timing of this transition this study draws conclusions about stomatal conductance from the measured evapotranspiration data future studies could incorporate direct measurement of stomatal conductance when studying effects of varying levels of water stress on evapotranspiration yield and carbon assimilation 4 conclusions this two year study evaluated the use of pivot mounted irts for the detection of crop water stress in maize and soybean this research was successful in detecting crop water stress from thermal sensors in fully irrigated plots without incurring crop yield loss i e detecting energy limiting water stress before carbon dioxide limiting water stress occurs contrary to the common assumption a reduction in seasonal crop et did not always result in lower crop yield mild crop water stress for a short period of time may not lead to crop yield loss this finding is fundamental for management of full irrigation using thermal sensing to achieve potential yield significant et yield correlations were observed only with rainfed and deficit levels in 2020 the mean icwsi and seasonal et for each level was found to be negatively related for both 2020 and 2021 it was found that the icwsi substantially increased after two days from a wetting event the low medium and high icwsi thresholds for irrigation management were determined as 120 150 and 180 respectively for maize and 110 130 and 150 respectively for soybean these thresholds are applicable for the sub humid climate of the central great plains it is proposed that two more seasons of icwsi data from this region should be incorporated into the developed thresholds to account for variability among the seasons future research should implement the developed icwsi thresholds for management of irrigation and validate their use for the sub humid climate declaration of competing interest the authors

9239,crop models can be combined with optimization algorithms in order to develop management tools however such model based tools are inherently affected by the imperfectness of the model on which they are based in this paper we describe a procedure in which data assimilation and partial re parametrization of the model embedded in the optimization procedure used to determine irrigation scheduling are performed before each optimization run furthermore sensitivity analysis is performed before performing data assimilation which ensures that only influential parameters are adjusted the procedure was tested via simulation with dssat cropgro for a hypothetical processing tomato crop in davis ca in 2010 2019 several scenarios that differed in terms of the measurements assumed to be available for assimilation leaf area index biomass and or soil water content were simulated the results were compared to a benchmark scenario involving a perfect model as well as a scenario in which data assimilation was not performed the analysis focused on the overall performance of the irrigation schedule yield vs irrigation amount derived using the model rather on the accuracy of the estimated model parameters assimilating weekly measurements of leaf area index led to overall performance that was within 3 of the benchmark performance adding weekly measurements of biomass or daily measurements of soil water content did not improve the performance on the other hand assimilating only daily soil water content measurements led to poorer results 5 decrease compared to benchmark and also affected the repeatability of the results defining dynamically the subset of parameters for calibration via sensitivity analysis rather than calibrating a fixed subset of parameters or all parameters was beneficial both in terms of overall performance and repeatability of the results overall concurrent data assimilation and model based optimization has potential to enhance irrigation

1 introduction climate change characterized by multi year droughts and population growth have put a lot of pressure on the finite fresh water resources on earth xue et al 2020 according to the world bank agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of all freshwater withdrawals globally there are urgent calls for agriculture to reduce its water footprint and to use water resources more sustainably one way to reduce consumptive water use in agriculture is to optimize irrigation scheduling which can be done using measurements of soil water content and crop status and or with the help of mathematical crop models irrigation scheduling refers to the scientific process of determining and optimizing the timing amount and location of water application in order to meet specific management goals e g optimizing profit maximizing ecosystem services or minimizing environmental impact adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling has remained low in many regions of the world giannakis et al 2016 taghvaeian et al 2020 for example in the us less than 15 of irrigated farmers use soil moisture sensors plant based sensing et based or computer simulation models aguilar et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2020 in europe giannakis et al 2016 identified lack of user friendliness of irrigation decision support tools water pricing and public policies among factors affecting irrigation scheduling adoption there is an urgent need to develop irrigation scheduling solutions that meet the direct needs of farmers in their paper on envisioning the next generation of irrigation schedulers hillyer and robinson 2010 noted that to enhance adoption irrigation scheduling tools should serve as optimization tools capable of in season prediction of outcomes of management decisions and have variable rate irrigation capabilities these tools should also be able to demonstrate economic benefits to growers opportunities exist to leverage advances in mathematical crop modeling data assimilation and optimization to develop irrigation scheduling tools capable of meeting grower needs mathematical models that describe soil crop atmosphere interactions in general and crop development in particular are useful tools for developing and investigating management strategies as well as for managing the application of inputs such as water or fertilizers however model based approaches are inherently affected by the imperfection of the models used clearly if historical data is available this data should be used to perform model calibration before the start of the season however in most practical situations the amount of historical data available and its quality is not sufficient to perform full model calibration and yield what can be considered as a reliable and robust model in such cases performing model adjustments during the season may be advantageous nowadays thanks to high internet connectivity and advances in the field of sensing in general and remote sensing rs in particular it is possible to obtain in real time information about the crop development and use this information to adjust the crop model during the season the crop characteristic most commonly used in studies that deal with this so called data assimilation is leaf area index lai or quite equivalently canopy cover cc e g dente et al 2008 jégo et al 2012 huang et al 2015 2016 he et al 2015 hu et al 2019 novelli et al 2019 tewes et al 2020 abi saab et al 2021 although lai is currently the crop characteristic estimated most accurately via rs kaplan and rozenstein 2021 kaplan et al 2021 sadeh et al 2021 assimilation of other rs products such as canopy structure height moisture content or total above ground biomass has also been considered e g claverie et al 2012 wiseman et al 2014 betbeder et al 2016 pichierri et al 2018 liu et al 2019 for yield prediction the latter is of special interest due to its close relation to yield and concurrent assimilation of lai or cc and biomass in various crop models has been investigated in several studies see review of jin et al 2018 jin et al 2020 ji et al 2022 clearly the concept of data assimilation is not restricted to remote sensing data but can be applied to measurements performed in situ such as for instance measurements of soil water content e g hu et al 2019 sima et al 2020 lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a model adjustment can take two main forms model re initialization restarting the model simulations using as initial conditions values corrected based on the observations or model re parametrization i e adjusting the values of some of the model s parameters strictly speaking the former approach does not yield an improved model but only hopefully improved predictions for the specific season considered therefore model re parametrization should be preferred when one wishes to re use the model for instance in the next season also it must be noted that model re initialization is possible only if the model implementation allows for so called hot starts i e starting the simulation at any point in time which is not the case for most commonly used crop models the goal of model re parametrization is to minimize or at least reduce the discrepancy between observations and model estimations the simplest approach consists of using an optimization algorithm to minimize a cost function that includes the discrepancy between the observed and estimated values e g dente et al 2008 claverie et al 2012 jégo et al 2012 huang et al 2015 novelli et al 2019 more complex approaches are based on the ensemble kalman filter e g curnel et al 2011 brandhorst et al 2017 hu et al 2019 lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 or particle filter e g chen and cournède 2014 jamal and linker 2020 which has the advantage of requiring less stringent assumptions a characteristic shared by such filters is that they rely on an ensemble of models i e a large number of models also called particles are simulated in parallel and each model is given a weight that reflects its accuracy working with an ensemble of models has advantages such as for instance allowing for the computation of confidence intervals for the predictions however it also has the major drawback of not providing a single calibrated model which can be used by other procedures or modules for instance model based optimization numerical model based optimization typically involves hundreds of runs of the model in such a framework replacing the single model by an ensemble consisting of hundreds or thousands of models and having to run all the models of the ensemble at each iteration in order to weight their predictions leads to an unacceptably high computation burden when considering model re parametrization a key decision is which parameters to adjust the subset of adjustable parameters is typically set a priori based on literature or previous knowledge or determined by performing sensitivity analysis using historical data e g chen and cournède 2014 jégo et al 2012 jin et al 2018 in either case the result is a fixed subset of parameters however crop models are strongly non linear and the influence of a specific parameter on the model outputs depends on the growing conditions ruget et al 2002 and may vary greatly throughout the season zhang et al 2021 in such situations considering a fixed subset of adjustable parameters may not be appropriate this was already noted by claverie et al 2012 who split the season into two phases and calibrated different parameters in each phase such an ad hoc approach has clear limitations as it requires deep insight on the process itself the crop developmental stages and the model alternatively sensitivity analysis can be performed beforehand i e prior to performing the calibration itself presumably using historical data so that the sensitivity index of each parameter for each day is determined a priori he et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 such an approach has limitations as well since there is no guarantee that the actual weather and crop state on any given day will be similar to the historical data which may lead to inappropriate parameters selection as detailed below in the present work we propose to perform sensitivity analysis in real time before each calibration step this ensures that only the parameters to which the model outputs are sensitive given the actual driving inputs are included in the calibration procedure regardless of the method used to update the crop model it is important to consider the ultimate purpose of this model most studies involving data assimilation focused on yield prediction i e predicting yield assuming that future weather and management decisions such as irrigation or fertilization are given in such cases it is natural to use yield prediction accuracy to quantify the model performance however when the crop model becomes part of a larger model based control scheme or decision support system the model performance in itself is no longer of primary interest but the model should rather be judged according to its usefulness how close is the outcome of the imperfect model based decisions to the ideal outcome i e the outcome that would have been achieved if the model had been perfect this basic question was at the core of the present study more specifically the objective of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of performing data assimilation of measurements of lai biomass and soil water content in a dssat cropgro tomato model embedded in a model based optimization scheme for irrigation scheduling the specific objectives were to develop a framework for real time adaptation re parameterization of the crop model used for optimizing the irrigation scheduling decisions to quantify the benefits of performing model adjustments in terms of decision making to investigate the contribution of various measurements lai biomass and soil water content towards improving the decisions of the concurrent data assimilation and model based optimization framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology a conceptual flowchart is shown in fig 1 by comparison to the straightforward model based optimization scheme described in linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 the difference is the addition of a model adaptation step prior to performing the optimization as noted above since the crop model includes a very large number of parameters and only very few measurements are available the calibration process must be restricted to a subset of parameters rather than determining this subset a priori it is proposed here to determine dynamically at each adjustment point in time the subset of parameters that can be safely adjusted using the data available accordingly the first step consists of performing sensitivity analysis in order to determine which parameters can be adjusted based on the available data step i this is followed by the calibration procedure itself step ii and finally determination of the optimal irrigation schedule using the updated model step iii each step is detailed below 2 1 1 step i sensitivity analysis the subset of identifiable parameters was determined according to the approach developed by ioslovich et al 2004 this approach is based on the fisher information matrix and yields the set of most influential parameters which are not inter correlated determination of the fisher information matrix requires estimation of the sensitivity of the model outputs of interest i e for which measurements are available due to changes in parameter values this is obtained by running the model with slightly perturbated parameter values and comparing these predictions with those obtained with the nominal parameter values this is a local rather than global sensitivity analysis procedure which is appropriate when one is interested in making relatively small changes around nominal values in terms of computing load such a procedure is much less demanding than a global one such as the popular sobol method e g nossent et al 2011 as suggested by ioslovich et al 2004 the number of identifiable i e influential and non correlated parameters was determined using 40 as cut off value for the condition number of the normalized fisher sub matrix 2 1 2 step ii model calibration model calibration was formulated as a multi objective optimization problem 1 min θ 1 θ 2 θ n s e 1 e 2 e n v c where n s denotes the number of identifiable parameters according to the sensitivity analysis θ 1 θ 2 θ n s denote these identifiable parameters n v is the number of variables for which measurements are available and e i quantifies the deviation between observations and model estimations for variable i 2 e i k 1 ψ i p i k o i k σ i k 2 where ψ i denotes the number of measurements available for variable i o i k and σ i k denote the mean and standard deviation of the observed values of variable d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 at the d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 sampling point and p i k denotes the corresponding model estimation the last term in eq 1 c denotes a cost function that quantifies the changes made in all parameters 3 c i 1 n s θ i θ ˆ i θ ˆ i 2 where θ ˆ i denote the initial before adjustment value of parameter d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 the inclusion of this term in the minimization criterion ensures that changes are made to parameter values only if these changes result in sufficient reduction of the differences between observations and estimations such a multi objective approach yields a set of optimal solutions pareto front from which it is necessary to select a single solution for implementation this was performed via to the topsis procedure which is based on the principle of compromise hwang et al 1993 zavadskas et al 2016 after defining a metric to measure the distance of a solution to the best and worst solutions in each dimension the solution chosen is the one which is as close as possible to the best solutions and as far as possible from the worst solutions conceptually the above formulation expresses mathematically the same idea as single objective formulations such as 4dvar dente et al 2008 he et al 2015 huang et al 2015 namely minimizing modeling errors differences between observations and predictions while avoiding unnecessary parameter changes the multi objective formulation introduced here has the advantage of not requiring explicit weighting of the various terms included in the objective function 2 1 3 step iii irrigation schedule optimization optimization of the irrigation schedule was done according to the procedure described in linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 the season was divided into seven management intervals and the soil water content at which irrigation was triggered during each interval was optimized assuming that the amount of water delivered at each irrigation event was as listed in table 1 note that these amounts could have been optimized as well as in linker and sylaios 2016 and linker et al 2016 but since previous investigations have shown that the improvements gained in this manner are typically this additional complexity was not introduced here sets of optimal thresholds were obtained by solving the multi objective problem 4 max t 1 t 2 t n p k k k i k y t 1 t 2 t n p where k k denotes the number of irrigation events during interval k i k mm denotes the amount of water applied at each irrigation event during interval k t k denotes the irrigation threshold for interval k and y t ha denotes the end of season yield predicted by the model the number of management intervals n p was initially equal to seven and decreased as the season progressed as detailed in linker and kisekka 2022 a depletion score that quantified the quality of the soil moisture content throughout the season was calculated for each irrigation schedule appendix a irrigation schedules for which this depletion score was beyond 0 1 were discarded as they were likely to cause undesirable effects such a soil cracking due to over mining of soil moisture the irrigation schedule selected for implementation was the one that maximized profit defined as 5 ϒ p y y p i k k k i k f where p y denotes the crop value t p i denotes the price of irrigation water mm ha and f denotes all operational costs that are assumed not to be influenced by irrigation 2 2 case study the procedure described above was tested via simulation of a drip irrigated processing tomato crop at davis ca as case study the water price crop value and fixed costs were set to 0 205 m3 70 5 ton fresh yield and 6780 ha respectively ten growing seasons 2010 2019 were simulated with dssat cropgro using the weather records available from the california irrigation management information system cimis https cimis water ca gov the transplanting date was set to may 1 for all years because of the mediterranean climate in davis ca precipitation during the growing seasons were typically very low cumulative precipitation below 20 mm with two notable exceptions in 2011 and 2019 in which cumulative precipitations in may june exceeded 75 mm seasonal cumulative potential evapotranspiration et0 ranged from 720 to 830 mm in this simulation based investigation the actual crop was replaced by a second dssat cropgro model called true crop model in the sequel which had crop and soil parameters different from the ones of the model into which data was assimilated and which was used to optimize the irrigation schedule the parameters of the two models are listed in tables 2 4 it should be noted that the soil definition differed not only in terms of parameter values but also in terms of the number of layers defined in the model this was done to avoid the overly simplistic assumption that the exact soil layer structure would be known the true crop model was used to generate the following virtual measurements by sampling the simulation output leaf area index biomass soil water content in the 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm layers in order to make the analysis somewhat more realistic data assimilation was performed using corrupted measurements denoted m which were created by adding noise to the virtual measurements 6 m m 1 b where m denotes the perfect measurement i e the outputs of the true crop model and b denotes a random bias uniformly distributed between 0 1 and 0 1 in addition the standard deviation of the measurements σ in eq 2 was assumed to be 7 σ max 0 1 α 0 1 η m where η is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation equal to 1 for lai and biomass α was set to 0 1 while for soil water content α was set to 0 15 to reflect the fact that these measurements tend to be more noisy since the main objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of monitoring and assimilating a specific variable in terms of decision making the following scenarios were investigated scenario 1 measurement of soil water content on day of transplanting and measurements of lai only every 5 days starting once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 2 measurement of soil water content on day of transplanting and measurements of lai and biomass every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 3 daily measurement of soil water content from day of transplanting and measurements of lai every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 4 daily measurement of soil water content only from day of transplanting fig 2 shows the sequence of the computations that were performed on an optimization day every 7 days in addition two benchmark scenarios were performed scenario 5 irrigation optimization using the true crop model parameters values listed in table 2 top row and 3 scenario 6 irrigation optimization using the initial crop model without any adjustment parameters values listed in table 2 bottom row and 4 finally in order to determine whether performing sensitivity analysis at each assimilation point was indeed advantageous the calibration optimization procedure was repeated while calibrating a fixed subset of parameters as suggested by he et al 2015 and zhang et al 2021 scenario 7 and using all parameters scenario 8 only lai assimilation was considered in these last two scenarios to ensure fair comparison the parameter subset in scenario 7 was determined using the information that would be available before the start of the test period 2010 2019 the parameter subset was determined by computing the optimal irrigation schedule using the average weather of years 2000 2009 and the nominal model without any adaptation sensitivity analysis was performed only once at the end of this average season assuming lai measurements available every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 the list of identifiable parameters was stored and the calibration optimization procedure was applied to years 2010 2019 calibrating only the parameters included in this list table 5 summarizes the scenarios investigated in all cases optimization of the irrigation schedule was performed using as forecasts the average weather of the ten previous years similarly to linker and sylaios 2016 linker et al 2018 linker 2020 all computations were performed in matlab r2021a using custom scripts that generated the inputs files required by dssat invoked dssat and imported the output files generated by dssat the multi objective optimization problems formulated in eqs 1 and 4 were solved using the procedure described in herrero et al 2007 topsis was performed using the implementation of o a sianaki available at https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 57143 topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution since the calibration optimization procedure involves a large number of random variables initial guesses genetic operations all scenarios except scenarios 5 and 6 were repeated five times in order to assess the repeatability of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows how frequently crop and soil parameters were found to be identifiable when only lai was measured during the season scenario 1 since the number of assimilation events varied from year to year the results are presented in a normalized fashion the parameters not shown in this figure and the following ones were never found to be identifiable although some results were quite consistent throughout the years sp dm sizlf and most soil parameters never selected fl sh and fl sd very rarely selected sdul2 and sdul3 almost always selected most results fluctuated between years especially for the crop parameters for comparison performing sensitivity analysis only once at the end of the average season scenario 7 led to selecting only four parameters em fl fl lf slll3 and sdul2 these results clearly show that as expected from the strong non linearity of the model the standard approach that consists of defining a priori a fixed one fits all set of identifiable parameters e g chen and cournède 2014 kisekka et al 2016 jégo et al 2012 jin et al 2018 is not appropriate assimilating biomass measurements together with lai measurements scenario 2 led to selecting sizlf most of the time this parameter was never selected when assimilating only lai fig 4 in addition em fl fl lf and slavr were selected more often than when assimilating only lai measurements the addition of biomass measurements had no influence on the selection of the soil parameters assimilating daily measurements of soil water content in addition to lai measurements scenario 3 led to more frequent calibration of slll3 and sdul1 but also less frequent calibration of crop parameters most notably podur xfrt and fl lf fig 5 when assimilating only measurements of soil water content scenario 4 the selection of soil parameters was very similar to that of scenario 3 but none of the crop parameters were selected details not shown 3 2 model predictions analysis of the results showed that in most cases the parameters that were calibrated did not converge toward their true value details not shown although this result may seem disappointing this is not surprising considering the complexity of the model and the limited number of measurements available more important is the prediction power of the model i e how well the model can predict future crop development and soil water content this can be appreciated from figs 6 8 which show the results obtained with assimilation of lai only lai and soil water content and soil water content only respectively although these results are presented only for the first repetition of 2010 due to space limitations these results are representatives of other years and repetitions each frame corresponds to a specific date and shows the lai fresh yield and soil water content at 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm simulated with the adjusted model and with the true crop model the virtual measurements and their standard deviations are shows as error bars the adjusted and true models had the same driving inputs actual weather and irrigation until the current day and weather forecasts and planned expected to be optimal irrigation events afterward looking at fig 6 it can be seen that the initial model predicted lai very well until day 180 but largely overestimated it afterwards there was initially a large difference 12 5 between the expected yield and the yield of the true crop model assimilation of lai measurements led to significant improvements in the predictions of both lai and yield mostly after day 205 the fact that data assimilation led to a decrease of predicted lai and increase of predicted yield can be explained by the fact that adjustments were made to the parameter xfrt that controls the partitioning between vegetative and reproductive organs at the end of the season the expected yield was within 3 of the actual one these good predictions were obtained despite the fact that the model did not predict soil water content at 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm accurately especially after day 160 assimilating biomass measurements in addition to the lai measurements did not affect the results significantly details not shown fig 7 shows that as expected assimilating measurements of soil water content in addition to lai led to significant improvements in the predictions of soil water content without any noticeable impact on the predictions of lai yield predictions also remained virtually unaffected by the assimilation of soil water content measurements on the contrary fig 8 shows that assimilating only measurements of soil water content yielded a model that predicted soil water content very well starting around day 180 but this was not sufficient to achieve good predictions of lai or more importantly yield on the last day the yield estimation error was 6 6 more than twice the error obtained when assimilating lai hu et al 2019 reported similar findings namely that assimilation of soil water content alone was not sufficient to improve yield estimations and when combined with lai assimilation of soil water content led to significant improvements only under strong water stress conditions zhang et al 2022a also reported that assimilating lai observations improved yield predictions more than assimilating soil water content measurements 3 3 irrigation optimization decision making fig 9 summarizes the end of season profit achieved in each year when using in the optimization scheme the model adjusted by assimilating lai only lai and biomass lai and soil water content or soil water content only scenarios 1 4 the perfect model benchmark result scenario 5 and the nominal model without data assimilation scenario 6 overall scenarios 1 3 i e all the scenarios in which at least lai was assimilated led to profits that were very close to the benchmark profit scenario 5 i e the profit that could have been achieved if a perfect model had been available from the start of the season the ten year average reduction in profit compared to the benchmark result were virtually identical ranging from 2 8 to 3 0 variability between the five repetitions was also very similar for these three scenarios with standard deviation ranging from 109 9 ha to 103 4 ha in other words assimilation of lai alone together with soil water content at transplanting led to irrigation decisions that were very close to optimal these results are encouraging in the sense that recent advances in aerial and satellite remote sensing can provide accurate lai measurements at high spatiotemporal resolution that could be assimilated into a crop models such as dssat to produce spatial maps of crop yield pasqualotto et al 2019 kaplan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b such yield maps could inform site specific irrigation scheduling assimilating measurements of either biomass or soil water content in addition to lai measurements did not lead to closer to optimal decisions on the other hand assimilating only measurements of soil water content scenario 4 led to significantly worse results not only in terms of average performance 4 9 profit reduction which is 60 more than when assimilating lai but also in terms of repeatability standard deviation of 218 7 ha which is more than twice that of scenarios 1 3 although not very surprising this result clearly shows that measurements of soil water content and the ability to predict accurately soil water content are not sufficient to compute close to optimum irrigation schedules using the model based procedure used here still it must be noted that even assimilating only soil water content led to results that were far better than when not performing any kind of model adaptation 62 2 profit reduction the observed reduction in profit can result from yield reduction and or irrigation increase in order to appreciate the contribution of each factor fig 10 shows the final yield and seasonal irrigation achieved in scenario 5 perfect model symbols in scenarios 1 4 data assimilation and respectively and in scenario 6 no data assimilation for any given year and scenario the loss of optimality can be appreciated from the distance of the corresponding symbol to the symbol it can be seen that when no data assimilation is performed both seasonal irrigation and yield are lower with irrigation decrease ranging from 65 to 90 mm and yield reduction ranging from 26 to 45 t ha by comparison when either type of data assimilation is performed scenarios 1 4 for most years the main deterioration is observed in seasonal irrigation with deviations ranging from 10 to 65 mm while yield remains close to the ideal yield it can also be observed that the worst yield deteriorations were obtained when assimilating only measurements of soil water content the advantage of selecting dynamically the sub set of parameters for calibration can be appreciated from fig 11 which shows the profit achieved when assimilating lai measurements and calibrating 1 the subset of parameters determined dynamically by sensitivity analysis scenario 1 2 the subset of parameters determined by off line sensitivity analysis using average historical weather scenario 7 and 3 all the parameters scenario 8 for scenarios 7 and 8 the ten year average reduction in profit compared to scenario 5 was 3 5 and 3 9 respectively corresponding to 16 and 30 increase compared to result obtained when assimilating the same measurements with a dynamically selected subset of parameters perhaps more importantly results repeatability was much lower for scenarios 7 and 8 than for scenario 1 profit standard deviation of 150 2 ha and 156 5 ha respectively compared to 109 9 ha for scenario 1 4 conclusion we developed a simulation optimization framework in which the model used in the optimization procedure was updated by assimilating measurements of lai biomass and or soil water content the value of each type of measurement was determined by considering whether assimilation of these measurements led to better irrigation decisions i e decisions that would generate a profit closer to the benchmark profit the profit that would be attainable if a perfect model were to be available from the start of the season assimilation of lai alone measured every five days led to a ten year average profit that was very close to the benchmark one assimilating biomass measurements in addition to lai had only a marginal impact assimilating measurements of soil water content in addition to lai enabled the model to predict soil water content more accurately but did not result in higher average profit assimilation of soil water content alone led to poorer decisions although the final average profit was still much higher than the one achieved when performing no data assimilation at all in order to use the information contained in the measurements efficiently sensitivity analysis was performed at each data assimilation step in order to determine which parameters should be updated compared to the more traditional approach in which the subset of parameters which are updated is determined a priori the present approach led not only to a higher average profit but also to a higher repeatability of the results the list of identifiable parameters depended on what measurements were available in particular having measurements of soil water content available in addition to lai measurements led to more frequent adjustments of soil hydraulic parameters but at the expense of less frequent adjustments of crop parameters as expected assimilation of soil water content measurements resulted in much better predictions of soil water content the models obtained by assimilating only lai or lai and soil water content were able to predict crop development quite well and although the recommended irrigation schedules were different the differences in terms of total irrigation and yield were minor in terms of broader impacts the findings from this study demonstrate that assimilating lai which can easily be retrieved from remote sensing can significantly reduce the uncertainty in crop model predictions which has been a hindrance to wide scale adoption of model based irrigation scheduling to enhance adoption by farmers the framework proposed here could be integrated into user friendly web and mobile applications such as farms kim and kisekka 2021 although one of the main limitations of the present study was that it was conducted solely via simulations it must be noted that the noise introduced when generating the lai measurements eqs 6 7 resulted in a root mean square error similar to the best ones reported by kaplan and rozenstein 2021 and kaplan et al 2021 who compared several approaches for estimating processing tomato lai from satellite imagery rmse 1 for their lai range if in the future the results of the present study can be corroborated by experiments this will indicate that when lai measurements are available investing resources to monitor and assimilate biomass and or soil water content does not appear to be justified at least not from an irrigation management point of view finally monitoring and assimilating only soil water content is not sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance when model based optimization is used to

according to a1 d p u w u l 100 where u and l denote the drainage upper limit sdul and wilting point slll respectively and w is the actual water content within the soil depth considered 0 30 cm until growth stage gs 2 0 60 cm between gs2 gs7 and 0 90 cm after gs7 for the computation of the depletion score the season was split into two periods until gs9 end pod depletion beyond 50 was deemed highly undesirable and therefore a quadratic function was used a2 s 1 q d p q 50 2 where d p q denotes water depletion on day q and the sum was performed only on days for which d p 50 after gs9 depletion beyond 50 was considered less harmful and therefore a linear function was used a3 s 2 p d p p 50 again the sum was performed only on days for which d p 50 a larger number of simulations were performed with different irrigation schedules and the corresponding soil water contents were shown to an expert who graded them this analysis led to defining the depletion score d s as d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 a4 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 in this manner irrigation schedules with very low depletion scores typically below 0 1 could be considered as excellent while higher depletion scores reflected increasingly undesirable results 
9239,crop models can be combined with optimization algorithms in order to develop management tools however such model based tools are inherently affected by the imperfectness of the model on which they are based in this paper we describe a procedure in which data assimilation and partial re parametrization of the model embedded in the optimization procedure used to determine irrigation scheduling are performed before each optimization run furthermore sensitivity analysis is performed before performing data assimilation which ensures that only influential parameters are adjusted the procedure was tested via simulation with dssat cropgro for a hypothetical processing tomato crop in davis ca in 2010 2019 several scenarios that differed in terms of the measurements assumed to be available for assimilation leaf area index biomass and or soil water content were simulated the results were compared to a benchmark scenario involving a perfect model as well as a scenario in which data assimilation was not performed the analysis focused on the overall performance of the irrigation schedule yield vs irrigation amount derived using the model rather on the accuracy of the estimated model parameters assimilating weekly measurements of leaf area index led to overall performance that was within 3 of the benchmark performance adding weekly measurements of biomass or daily measurements of soil water content did not improve the performance on the other hand assimilating only daily soil water content measurements led to poorer results 5 decrease compared to benchmark and also affected the repeatability of the results defining dynamically the subset of parameters for calibration via sensitivity analysis rather than calibrating a fixed subset of parameters or all parameters was beneficial both in terms of overall performance and repeatability of the results overall concurrent data assimilation and model based optimization has potential to enhance irrigation

1 introduction climate change characterized by multi year droughts and population growth have put a lot of pressure on the finite fresh water resources on earth xue et al 2020 according to the world bank agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of all freshwater withdrawals globally there are urgent calls for agriculture to reduce its water footprint and to use water resources more sustainably one way to reduce consumptive water use in agriculture is to optimize irrigation scheduling which can be done using measurements of soil water content and crop status and or with the help of mathematical crop models irrigation scheduling refers to the scientific process of determining and optimizing the timing amount and location of water application in order to meet specific management goals e g optimizing profit maximizing ecosystem services or minimizing environmental impact adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling has remained low in many regions of the world giannakis et al 2016 taghvaeian et al 2020 for example in the us less than 15 of irrigated farmers use soil moisture sensors plant based sensing et based or computer simulation models aguilar et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2020 in europe giannakis et al 2016 identified lack of user friendliness of irrigation decision support tools water pricing and public policies among factors affecting irrigation scheduling adoption there is an urgent need to develop irrigation scheduling solutions that meet the direct needs of farmers in their paper on envisioning the next generation of irrigation schedulers hillyer and robinson 2010 noted that to enhance adoption irrigation scheduling tools should serve as optimization tools capable of in season prediction of outcomes of management decisions and have variable rate irrigation capabilities these tools should also be able to demonstrate economic benefits to growers opportunities exist to leverage advances in mathematical crop modeling data assimilation and optimization to develop irrigation scheduling tools capable of meeting grower needs mathematical models that describe soil crop atmosphere interactions in general and crop development in particular are useful tools for developing and investigating management strategies as well as for managing the application of inputs such as water or fertilizers however model based approaches are inherently affected by the imperfection of the models used clearly if historical data is available this data should be used to perform model calibration before the start of the season however in most practical situations the amount of historical data available and its quality is not sufficient to perform full model calibration and yield what can be considered as a reliable and robust model in such cases performing model adjustments during the season may be advantageous nowadays thanks to high internet connectivity and advances in the field of sensing in general and remote sensing rs in particular it is possible to obtain in real time information about the crop development and use this information to adjust the crop model during the season the crop characteristic most commonly used in studies that deal with this so called data assimilation is leaf area index lai or quite equivalently canopy cover cc e g dente et al 2008 jégo et al 2012 huang et al 2015 2016 he et al 2015 hu et al 2019 novelli et al 2019 tewes et al 2020 abi saab et al 2021 although lai is currently the crop characteristic estimated most accurately via rs kaplan and rozenstein 2021 kaplan et al 2021 sadeh et al 2021 assimilation of other rs products such as canopy structure height moisture content or total above ground biomass has also been considered e g claverie et al 2012 wiseman et al 2014 betbeder et al 2016 pichierri et al 2018 liu et al 2019 for yield prediction the latter is of special interest due to its close relation to yield and concurrent assimilation of lai or cc and biomass in various crop models has been investigated in several studies see review of jin et al 2018 jin et al 2020 ji et al 2022 clearly the concept of data assimilation is not restricted to remote sensing data but can be applied to measurements performed in situ such as for instance measurements of soil water content e g hu et al 2019 sima et al 2020 lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a model adjustment can take two main forms model re initialization restarting the model simulations using as initial conditions values corrected based on the observations or model re parametrization i e adjusting the values of some of the model s parameters strictly speaking the former approach does not yield an improved model but only hopefully improved predictions for the specific season considered therefore model re parametrization should be preferred when one wishes to re use the model for instance in the next season also it must be noted that model re initialization is possible only if the model implementation allows for so called hot starts i e starting the simulation at any point in time which is not the case for most commonly used crop models the goal of model re parametrization is to minimize or at least reduce the discrepancy between observations and model estimations the simplest approach consists of using an optimization algorithm to minimize a cost function that includes the discrepancy between the observed and estimated values e g dente et al 2008 claverie et al 2012 jégo et al 2012 huang et al 2015 novelli et al 2019 more complex approaches are based on the ensemble kalman filter e g curnel et al 2011 brandhorst et al 2017 hu et al 2019 lu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 or particle filter e g chen and cournède 2014 jamal and linker 2020 which has the advantage of requiring less stringent assumptions a characteristic shared by such filters is that they rely on an ensemble of models i e a large number of models also called particles are simulated in parallel and each model is given a weight that reflects its accuracy working with an ensemble of models has advantages such as for instance allowing for the computation of confidence intervals for the predictions however it also has the major drawback of not providing a single calibrated model which can be used by other procedures or modules for instance model based optimization numerical model based optimization typically involves hundreds of runs of the model in such a framework replacing the single model by an ensemble consisting of hundreds or thousands of models and having to run all the models of the ensemble at each iteration in order to weight their predictions leads to an unacceptably high computation burden when considering model re parametrization a key decision is which parameters to adjust the subset of adjustable parameters is typically set a priori based on literature or previous knowledge or determined by performing sensitivity analysis using historical data e g chen and cournède 2014 jégo et al 2012 jin et al 2018 in either case the result is a fixed subset of parameters however crop models are strongly non linear and the influence of a specific parameter on the model outputs depends on the growing conditions ruget et al 2002 and may vary greatly throughout the season zhang et al 2021 in such situations considering a fixed subset of adjustable parameters may not be appropriate this was already noted by claverie et al 2012 who split the season into two phases and calibrated different parameters in each phase such an ad hoc approach has clear limitations as it requires deep insight on the process itself the crop developmental stages and the model alternatively sensitivity analysis can be performed beforehand i e prior to performing the calibration itself presumably using historical data so that the sensitivity index of each parameter for each day is determined a priori he et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 such an approach has limitations as well since there is no guarantee that the actual weather and crop state on any given day will be similar to the historical data which may lead to inappropriate parameters selection as detailed below in the present work we propose to perform sensitivity analysis in real time before each calibration step this ensures that only the parameters to which the model outputs are sensitive given the actual driving inputs are included in the calibration procedure regardless of the method used to update the crop model it is important to consider the ultimate purpose of this model most studies involving data assimilation focused on yield prediction i e predicting yield assuming that future weather and management decisions such as irrigation or fertilization are given in such cases it is natural to use yield prediction accuracy to quantify the model performance however when the crop model becomes part of a larger model based control scheme or decision support system the model performance in itself is no longer of primary interest but the model should rather be judged according to its usefulness how close is the outcome of the imperfect model based decisions to the ideal outcome i e the outcome that would have been achieved if the model had been perfect this basic question was at the core of the present study more specifically the objective of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of performing data assimilation of measurements of lai biomass and soil water content in a dssat cropgro tomato model embedded in a model based optimization scheme for irrigation scheduling the specific objectives were to develop a framework for real time adaptation re parameterization of the crop model used for optimizing the irrigation scheduling decisions to quantify the benefits of performing model adjustments in terms of decision making to investigate the contribution of various measurements lai biomass and soil water content towards improving the decisions of the concurrent data assimilation and model based optimization framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology a conceptual flowchart is shown in fig 1 by comparison to the straightforward model based optimization scheme described in linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 the difference is the addition of a model adaptation step prior to performing the optimization as noted above since the crop model includes a very large number of parameters and only very few measurements are available the calibration process must be restricted to a subset of parameters rather than determining this subset a priori it is proposed here to determine dynamically at each adjustment point in time the subset of parameters that can be safely adjusted using the data available accordingly the first step consists of performing sensitivity analysis in order to determine which parameters can be adjusted based on the available data step i this is followed by the calibration procedure itself step ii and finally determination of the optimal irrigation schedule using the updated model step iii each step is detailed below 2 1 1 step i sensitivity analysis the subset of identifiable parameters was determined according to the approach developed by ioslovich et al 2004 this approach is based on the fisher information matrix and yields the set of most influential parameters which are not inter correlated determination of the fisher information matrix requires estimation of the sensitivity of the model outputs of interest i e for which measurements are available due to changes in parameter values this is obtained by running the model with slightly perturbated parameter values and comparing these predictions with those obtained with the nominal parameter values this is a local rather than global sensitivity analysis procedure which is appropriate when one is interested in making relatively small changes around nominal values in terms of computing load such a procedure is much less demanding than a global one such as the popular sobol method e g nossent et al 2011 as suggested by ioslovich et al 2004 the number of identifiable i e influential and non correlated parameters was determined using 40 as cut off value for the condition number of the normalized fisher sub matrix 2 1 2 step ii model calibration model calibration was formulated as a multi objective optimization problem 1 min θ 1 θ 2 θ n s e 1 e 2 e n v c where n s denotes the number of identifiable parameters according to the sensitivity analysis θ 1 θ 2 θ n s denote these identifiable parameters n v is the number of variables for which measurements are available and e i quantifies the deviation between observations and model estimations for variable i 2 e i k 1 ψ i p i k o i k σ i k 2 where ψ i denotes the number of measurements available for variable i o i k and σ i k denote the mean and standard deviation of the observed values of variable d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 at the d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 sampling point and p i k denotes the corresponding model estimation the last term in eq 1 c denotes a cost function that quantifies the changes made in all parameters 3 c i 1 n s θ i θ ˆ i θ ˆ i 2 where θ ˆ i denote the initial before adjustment value of parameter d journalitrack preedit else ehb 101183 the inclusion of this term in the minimization criterion ensures that changes are made to parameter values only if these changes result in sufficient reduction of the differences between observations and estimations such a multi objective approach yields a set of optimal solutions pareto front from which it is necessary to select a single solution for implementation this was performed via to the topsis procedure which is based on the principle of compromise hwang et al 1993 zavadskas et al 2016 after defining a metric to measure the distance of a solution to the best and worst solutions in each dimension the solution chosen is the one which is as close as possible to the best solutions and as far as possible from the worst solutions conceptually the above formulation expresses mathematically the same idea as single objective formulations such as 4dvar dente et al 2008 he et al 2015 huang et al 2015 namely minimizing modeling errors differences between observations and predictions while avoiding unnecessary parameter changes the multi objective formulation introduced here has the advantage of not requiring explicit weighting of the various terms included in the objective function 2 1 3 step iii irrigation schedule optimization optimization of the irrigation schedule was done according to the procedure described in linker et al 2016 and linker and kisekka 2017 the season was divided into seven management intervals and the soil water content at which irrigation was triggered during each interval was optimized assuming that the amount of water delivered at each irrigation event was as listed in table 1 note that these amounts could have been optimized as well as in linker and sylaios 2016 and linker et al 2016 but since previous investigations have shown that the improvements gained in this manner are typically this additional complexity was not introduced here sets of optimal thresholds were obtained by solving the multi objective problem 4 max t 1 t 2 t n p k k k i k y t 1 t 2 t n p where k k denotes the number of irrigation events during interval k i k mm denotes the amount of water applied at each irrigation event during interval k t k denotes the irrigation threshold for interval k and y t ha denotes the end of season yield predicted by the model the number of management intervals n p was initially equal to seven and decreased as the season progressed as detailed in linker and kisekka 2022 a depletion score that quantified the quality of the soil moisture content throughout the season was calculated for each irrigation schedule appendix a irrigation schedules for which this depletion score was beyond 0 1 were discarded as they were likely to cause undesirable effects such a soil cracking due to over mining of soil moisture the irrigation schedule selected for implementation was the one that maximized profit defined as 5 ϒ p y y p i k k k i k f where p y denotes the crop value t p i denotes the price of irrigation water mm ha and f denotes all operational costs that are assumed not to be influenced by irrigation 2 2 case study the procedure described above was tested via simulation of a drip irrigated processing tomato crop at davis ca as case study the water price crop value and fixed costs were set to 0 205 m3 70 5 ton fresh yield and 6780 ha respectively ten growing seasons 2010 2019 were simulated with dssat cropgro using the weather records available from the california irrigation management information system cimis https cimis water ca gov the transplanting date was set to may 1 for all years because of the mediterranean climate in davis ca precipitation during the growing seasons were typically very low cumulative precipitation below 20 mm with two notable exceptions in 2011 and 2019 in which cumulative precipitations in may june exceeded 75 mm seasonal cumulative potential evapotranspiration et0 ranged from 720 to 830 mm in this simulation based investigation the actual crop was replaced by a second dssat cropgro model called true crop model in the sequel which had crop and soil parameters different from the ones of the model into which data was assimilated and which was used to optimize the irrigation schedule the parameters of the two models are listed in tables 2 4 it should be noted that the soil definition differed not only in terms of parameter values but also in terms of the number of layers defined in the model this was done to avoid the overly simplistic assumption that the exact soil layer structure would be known the true crop model was used to generate the following virtual measurements by sampling the simulation output leaf area index biomass soil water content in the 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm layers in order to make the analysis somewhat more realistic data assimilation was performed using corrupted measurements denoted m which were created by adding noise to the virtual measurements 6 m m 1 b where m denotes the perfect measurement i e the outputs of the true crop model and b denotes a random bias uniformly distributed between 0 1 and 0 1 in addition the standard deviation of the measurements σ in eq 2 was assumed to be 7 σ max 0 1 α 0 1 η m where η is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation equal to 1 for lai and biomass α was set to 0 1 while for soil water content α was set to 0 15 to reflect the fact that these measurements tend to be more noisy since the main objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of monitoring and assimilating a specific variable in terms of decision making the following scenarios were investigated scenario 1 measurement of soil water content on day of transplanting and measurements of lai only every 5 days starting once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 2 measurement of soil water content on day of transplanting and measurements of lai and biomass every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 3 daily measurement of soil water content from day of transplanting and measurements of lai every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 scenario 4 daily measurement of soil water content only from day of transplanting fig 2 shows the sequence of the computations that were performed on an optimization day every 7 days in addition two benchmark scenarios were performed scenario 5 irrigation optimization using the true crop model parameters values listed in table 2 top row and 3 scenario 6 irrigation optimization using the initial crop model without any adjustment parameters values listed in table 2 bottom row and 4 finally in order to determine whether performing sensitivity analysis at each assimilation point was indeed advantageous the calibration optimization procedure was repeated while calibrating a fixed subset of parameters as suggested by he et al 2015 and zhang et al 2021 scenario 7 and using all parameters scenario 8 only lai assimilation was considered in these last two scenarios to ensure fair comparison the parameter subset in scenario 7 was determined using the information that would be available before the start of the test period 2010 2019 the parameter subset was determined by computing the optimal irrigation schedule using the average weather of years 2000 2009 and the nominal model without any adaptation sensitivity analysis was performed only once at the end of this average season assuming lai measurements available every 5 days once lai exceeded 0 5 the list of identifiable parameters was stored and the calibration optimization procedure was applied to years 2010 2019 calibrating only the parameters included in this list table 5 summarizes the scenarios investigated in all cases optimization of the irrigation schedule was performed using as forecasts the average weather of the ten previous years similarly to linker and sylaios 2016 linker et al 2018 linker 2020 all computations were performed in matlab r2021a using custom scripts that generated the inputs files required by dssat invoked dssat and imported the output files generated by dssat the multi objective optimization problems formulated in eqs 1 and 4 were solved using the procedure described in herrero et al 2007 topsis was performed using the implementation of o a sianaki available at https www mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 57143 topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution since the calibration optimization procedure involves a large number of random variables initial guesses genetic operations all scenarios except scenarios 5 and 6 were repeated five times in order to assess the repeatability of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows how frequently crop and soil parameters were found to be identifiable when only lai was measured during the season scenario 1 since the number of assimilation events varied from year to year the results are presented in a normalized fashion the parameters not shown in this figure and the following ones were never found to be identifiable although some results were quite consistent throughout the years sp dm sizlf and most soil parameters never selected fl sh and fl sd very rarely selected sdul2 and sdul3 almost always selected most results fluctuated between years especially for the crop parameters for comparison performing sensitivity analysis only once at the end of the average season scenario 7 led to selecting only four parameters em fl fl lf slll3 and sdul2 these results clearly show that as expected from the strong non linearity of the model the standard approach that consists of defining a priori a fixed one fits all set of identifiable parameters e g chen and cournède 2014 kisekka et al 2016 jégo et al 2012 jin et al 2018 is not appropriate assimilating biomass measurements together with lai measurements scenario 2 led to selecting sizlf most of the time this parameter was never selected when assimilating only lai fig 4 in addition em fl fl lf and slavr were selected more often than when assimilating only lai measurements the addition of biomass measurements had no influence on the selection of the soil parameters assimilating daily measurements of soil water content in addition to lai measurements scenario 3 led to more frequent calibration of slll3 and sdul1 but also less frequent calibration of crop parameters most notably podur xfrt and fl lf fig 5 when assimilating only measurements of soil water content scenario 4 the selection of soil parameters was very similar to that of scenario 3 but none of the crop parameters were selected details not shown 3 2 model predictions analysis of the results showed that in most cases the parameters that were calibrated did not converge toward their true value details not shown although this result may seem disappointing this is not surprising considering the complexity of the model and the limited number of measurements available more important is the prediction power of the model i e how well the model can predict future crop development and soil water content this can be appreciated from figs 6 8 which show the results obtained with assimilation of lai only lai and soil water content and soil water content only respectively although these results are presented only for the first repetition of 2010 due to space limitations these results are representatives of other years and repetitions each frame corresponds to a specific date and shows the lai fresh yield and soil water content at 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm simulated with the adjusted model and with the true crop model the virtual measurements and their standard deviations are shows as error bars the adjusted and true models had the same driving inputs actual weather and irrigation until the current day and weather forecasts and planned expected to be optimal irrigation events afterward looking at fig 6 it can be seen that the initial model predicted lai very well until day 180 but largely overestimated it afterwards there was initially a large difference 12 5 between the expected yield and the yield of the true crop model assimilation of lai measurements led to significant improvements in the predictions of both lai and yield mostly after day 205 the fact that data assimilation led to a decrease of predicted lai and increase of predicted yield can be explained by the fact that adjustments were made to the parameter xfrt that controls the partitioning between vegetative and reproductive organs at the end of the season the expected yield was within 3 of the actual one these good predictions were obtained despite the fact that the model did not predict soil water content at 15 30 cm and 60 90 cm accurately especially after day 160 assimilating biomass measurements in addition to the lai measurements did not affect the results significantly details not shown fig 7 shows that as expected assimilating measurements of soil water content in addition to lai led to significant improvements in the predictions of soil water content without any noticeable impact on the predictions of lai yield predictions also remained virtually unaffected by the assimilation of soil water content measurements on the contrary fig 8 shows that assimilating only measurements of soil water content yielded a model that predicted soil water content very well starting around day 180 but this was not sufficient to achieve good predictions of lai or more importantly yield on the last day the yield estimation error was 6 6 more than twice the error obtained when assimilating lai hu et al 2019 reported similar findings namely that assimilation of soil water content alone was not sufficient to improve yield estimations and when combined with lai assimilation of soil water content led to significant improvements only under strong water stress conditions zhang et al 2022a also reported that assimilating lai observations improved yield predictions more than assimilating soil water content measurements 3 3 irrigation optimization decision making fig 9 summarizes the end of season profit achieved in each year when using in the optimization scheme the model adjusted by assimilating lai only lai and biomass lai and soil water content or soil water content only scenarios 1 4 the perfect model benchmark result scenario 5 and the nominal model without data assimilation scenario 6 overall scenarios 1 3 i e all the scenarios in which at least lai was assimilated led to profits that were very close to the benchmark profit scenario 5 i e the profit that could have been achieved if a perfect model had been available from the start of the season the ten year average reduction in profit compared to the benchmark result were virtually identical ranging from 2 8 to 3 0 variability between the five repetitions was also very similar for these three scenarios with standard deviation ranging from 109 9 ha to 103 4 ha in other words assimilation of lai alone together with soil water content at transplanting led to irrigation decisions that were very close to optimal these results are encouraging in the sense that recent advances in aerial and satellite remote sensing can provide accurate lai measurements at high spatiotemporal resolution that could be assimilated into a crop models such as dssat to produce spatial maps of crop yield pasqualotto et al 2019 kaplan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b such yield maps could inform site specific irrigation scheduling assimilating measurements of either biomass or soil water content in addition to lai measurements did not lead to closer to optimal decisions on the other hand assimilating only measurements of soil water content scenario 4 led to significantly worse results not only in terms of average performance 4 9 profit reduction which is 60 more than when assimilating lai but also in terms of repeatability standard deviation of 218 7 ha which is more than twice that of scenarios 1 3 although not very surprising this result clearly shows that measurements of soil water content and the ability to predict accurately soil water content are not sufficient to compute close to optimum irrigation schedules using the model based procedure used here still it must be noted that even assimilating only soil water content led to results that were far better than when not performing any kind of model adaptation 62 2 profit reduction the observed reduction in profit can result from yield reduction and or irrigation increase in order to appreciate the contribution of each factor fig 10 shows the final yield and seasonal irrigation achieved in scenario 5 perfect model symbols in scenarios 1 4 data assimilation and respectively and in scenario 6 no data assimilation for any given year and scenario the loss of optimality can be appreciated from the distance of the corresponding symbol to the symbol it can be seen that when no data assimilation is performed both seasonal irrigation and yield are lower with irrigation decrease ranging from 65 to 90 mm and yield reduction ranging from 26 to 45 t ha by comparison when either type of data assimilation is performed scenarios 1 4 for most years the main deterioration is observed in seasonal irrigation with deviations ranging from 10 to 65 mm while yield remains close to the ideal yield it can also be observed that the worst yield deteriorations were obtained when assimilating only measurements of soil water content the advantage of selecting dynamically the sub set of parameters for calibration can be appreciated from fig 11 which shows the profit achieved when assimilating lai measurements and calibrating 1 the subset of parameters determined dynamically by sensitivity analysis scenario 1 2 the subset of parameters determined by off line sensitivity analysis using average historical weather scenario 7 and 3 all the parameters scenario 8 for scenarios 7 and 8 the ten year average reduction in profit compared to scenario 5 was 3 5 and 3 9 respectively corresponding to 16 and 30 increase compared to result obtained when assimilating the same measurements with a dynamically selected subset of parameters perhaps more importantly results repeatability was much lower for scenarios 7 and 8 than for scenario 1 profit standard deviation of 150 2 ha and 156 5 ha respectively compared to 109 9 ha for scenario 1 4 conclusion we developed a simulation optimization framework in which the model used in the optimization procedure was updated by assimilating measurements of lai biomass and or soil water content the value of each type of measurement was determined by considering whether assimilation of these measurements led to better irrigation decisions i e decisions that would generate a profit closer to the benchmark profit the profit that would be attainable if a perfect model were to be available from the start of the season assimilation of lai alone measured every five days led to a ten year average profit that was very close to the benchmark one assimilating biomass measurements in addition to lai had only a marginal impact assimilating measurements of soil water content in addition to lai enabled the model to predict soil water content more accurately but did not result in higher average profit assimilation of soil water content alone led to poorer decisions although the final average profit was still much higher than the one achieved when performing no data assimilation at all in order to use the information contained in the measurements efficiently sensitivity analysis was performed at each data assimilation step in order to determine which parameters should be updated compared to the more traditional approach in which the subset of parameters which are updated is determined a priori the present approach led not only to a higher average profit but also to a higher repeatability of the results the list of identifiable parameters depended on what measurements were available in particular having measurements of soil water content available in addition to lai measurements led to more frequent adjustments of soil hydraulic parameters but at the expense of less frequent adjustments of crop parameters as expected assimilation of soil water content measurements resulted in much better predictions of soil water content the models obtained by assimilating only lai or lai and soil water content were able to predict crop development quite well and although the recommended irrigation schedules were different the differences in terms of total irrigation and yield were minor in terms of broader impacts the findings from this study demonstrate that assimilating lai which can easily be retrieved from remote sensing can significantly reduce the uncertainty in crop model predictions which has been a hindrance to wide scale adoption of model based irrigation scheduling to enhance adoption by farmers the framework proposed here could be integrated into user friendly web and mobile applications such as farms kim and kisekka 2021 although one of the main limitations of the present study was that it was conducted solely via simulations it must be noted that the noise introduced when generating the lai measurements eqs 6 7 resulted in a root mean square error similar to the best ones reported by kaplan and rozenstein 2021 and kaplan et al 2021 who compared several approaches for estimating processing tomato lai from satellite imagery rmse 1 for their lai range if in the future the results of the present study can be corroborated by experiments this will indicate that when lai measurements are available investing resources to monitor and assimilate biomass and or soil water content does not appear to be justified at least not from an irrigation management point of view finally monitoring and assimilating only soil water content is not sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance when model based optimization is used to

according to a1 d p u w u l 100 where u and l denote the drainage upper limit sdul and wilting point slll respectively and w is the actual water content within the soil depth considered 0 30 cm until growth stage gs 2 0 60 cm between gs2 gs7 and 0 90 cm after gs7 for the computation of the depletion score the season was split into two periods until gs9 end pod depletion beyond 50 was deemed highly undesirable and therefore a quadratic function was used a2 s 1 q d p q 50 2 where d p q denotes water depletion on day q and the sum was performed only on days for which d p 50 after gs9 depletion beyond 50 was considered less harmful and therefore a linear function was used a3 s 2 p d p p 50 again the sum was performed only on days for which d p 50 a larger number of simulations were performed with different irrigation schedules and the corresponding soil water contents were shown to an expert who graded them this analysis led to defining the depletion score d s as d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 a4 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 d s s 1 10 max 0 s 2 125 200 in this manner irrigation schedules with very low depletion scores typically below 0 1 could be considered as excellent while higher depletion scores reflected increasingly undesirable results
