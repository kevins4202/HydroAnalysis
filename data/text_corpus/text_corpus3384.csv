16920,mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox represents one of the most promising energy efficient mechanisms of fixed nitrogen elimination from wastewaters however little is known about the exact processes and drivers of microbial community assembly within the complex microbial biofilms that support anammox in engineered ecosystems here we followed anammox biofilm development on fresh carriers in an established 8m3 mainstream anammox reactor that is exposed to seasonal temperature changes 25 12 c and varying nh4 concentrations 5 25 mg l we use fluorescence in situ hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing to show that three distinct stages of biofilm development emerge naturally from microbial community composition and biofilm structure neutral modelling and network analysis are employed to elucidate the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes and synergistic and antagonistic interactions in the biofilms during their development we find that the different phases are characterized by a dynamic succession and an interplay of both stochastic and deterministic processes the observed growth stages colonization succession and maturation appear to be the prerequisite for the anticipated growth of anammox bacteria and for reaching a biofilm community structure that supports the desired metabolic and functional capacities observed for biofilm carriers already present in the system 100gnh4 n m3 d 1 we discuss the relevance of this improved understanding of anammox community ecology and biofilm development in the context of its practical

sequencing sequencing batch reactor biofilm structure 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox involves the simultaneous oxidation of ammonium nh4 and reduction of nitrite no2 under oxygen limiting conditions and is orchestrated by a unique lineage of bacteria amx which all belong to the phylum planctomycetes and display a high diversity with 10 different candidate species discovered so far kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 zhang and okabe 2020a used under mainstream conditions in wastewater treatment plants wwtp anammox is also one of the most promising mechanisms of fixed nitrogen n elimination since it represents an important step towards energy autarky in the treatment of municipal wastewaters lotti et al 2014 siegrist salzgeber eugster and joss 2008 currently anammox is widely applied and represents a robust method for autotrophic n removal under sidestream conditions high nh4 concentrations and temperatures lackner et al 2014 nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 however application of the anammox processes under mainstream conditions suffers from process instabilities due to unexpected fluctuation of environmental temperature dissolved oxygen low nh4 concentrations and high c n ratios joss et al 2011 laureni et al 2016 pijuan et al 2020 wells et al 2017 amx currently lack representatives available in pure culture they are characterized by very slow growth rates and low cell yields kuenen 2008 which makes sufficient retention of biomass one of the main challenges for their application in wastewater treatment they are grown either in biofilm reactors on various carrier materials or as granules to retain sufficient biomass abma et al 2007 lower space requirements lower sludge production and resilience towards changes in the reactor configuration are additional benefits of biofilm based wastewater treatment systems chen and chen 2000 wilderer and mcswain 2004 zhao et al 2019 the microbial communities that ultimately form the biofilms performing anammox in wastewater treatment systems amx biofilms are very diverse amx although performing the anammox reaction typically comprise only a small fraction of the community heterotrophic bacteria that are crucial for the formation of the biofilm but do not contribute directly to the anammox process itself typically represent the majority of microbes in these biofilms laureni et al 2015 mozumder et al 2014 ni et al 2012 additionally many heterotrophic bacteria in mainstream anammox systems have the functional capacity to perform denitrification complete or single steps and to contribute to the n removal in the reactor or scavenging of detritus and peptides produced by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 niederdorfer et al 2021 speth et al 2016 while there are numerous studies focusing on microbial community assembly in systems with suspended biomass chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 luo et al 2017 the ecological processes underlying amx biofilm formation on synthetic carrier materials are still poorly understood the high diversity and internal structure indicates a high potential for internal competition synergies and feedback mechanisms at the same time the system is in constant contact with the bacteria and variable environmental conditions of the inflow therefore both deterministic faust et al 2018 flemming and wuertz 2019 as well as stochastic effects sloan et al 2006 woodcock and sloan 2017 are expected to govern community assembly this complicates efforts to fully understand amx biofilm formation for engineered applications

facilitation mutualism and predation chase and myers 2011 ofiţeru et al 2010 vellend et al 2014 stochastic processes termed neutral effects in community ecology on the other hand are random ecological processes that generate community diversity patterns these processes typically include probabilistic dispersal random speciation and extinction and ecological drift e g random changes in organism abundance chase and myers 2011 zhou et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 a neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events coupled with limited dispersal can account for

these processes kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 moralejo gárate et al 2011 vlaeminck et al 2012 a spatial i e microscopy based investigation of amx bacterial biofilm provides important information about the structural and spatial requirements of amx within such a complex community almstrand et al 2013 kindaichi et al 2007 laureni et al 2015 understanding of the spatial structure as well as temporal community dynamics is required to understand the ecological processes that lead to an established biofilm community brislawn et al 2019 datta et al 2016 niederdorfer et al 2016 shade et al 2014 given the high microbial diversity of mainstream amx biofilms co occurrence network modelling provides a useful tool to elucidate the mechanistic background of ecological interactions between individual community members faust and raes 2012 ju and zhang 2015 röttjers and faust 2018 widder et al 2016 in this study we investigated the microbial community assembly on synthetic biofilm carriers in a pilot scale mainstream anammox reactor in the presence of already established mature biofilm we studied the spatial biofilm structure using confocal microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization the microbial community composition was analyzed with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the establishment of the biofilm was monitored over the course of a year from initial colonization to mature biofilms we hypothesized i that heterotrophic bacteria are the pioneering colonizers that initiate biofilm formation and create the required base layer for second wave colonizers including amx and ii that the structure of and development within biofilms can be divided into three distinct growth stages colonization succession and maturation as observed in other systems allison et al 2000 hall stoodley et al 2004 we expected colonization to be driven by initial colonizers capable of attaching and growing on the carrier surface during the succession stage we expected increasingly intense competition for space and nutrients in the juvenile biofilm during maturation we expected convergence towards a well adapted quasi equilibrium state determined by the environmental factors in the reactor we further hypothesized iii that the relative importance of stochastic e g growth death and immigration versus deterministic processes e g environmental factors biotic interactions niche differentiation legacy effects for community assembly changes over the different stages of biofilm development using neutral co occurrence and checkerboard score modeling of the amx biofilm community assembly allowed us to disentangle the deterministic and stochastic ecological factors that ultimately shape the community structure of the mature biofilm to our knowledge this is one of the first studies using a toolbox of various community modelling approaches combined with spatial analysis to unravel assembly mechanisms of surface attached amx biofilms in engineered ecosystems for practitioners and engineers this work provides useful information on ecological constraints governing the establishment of functional amx biofilms under mainstream conditions but also highlights their inherent stability 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and sampling the experiment was conducted in an 8 m3 mainstream anammox moving bed biofilm reactor which is part of the pilot wastewater treatment plant at the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag in dübendorf a separate sbr operated a stage pilot scale reactor 8m3 fed with fresh mainstream municipal wastewater from the municipality dübendorf provided the inflow for the anammox reactor the influent has the following composition 50 60 mg l 1 cod 5 25 mgnh4 n l 1 0 1 mgno2 n l 1 and 5 10 mgno3 n l 1 neither a stage nor anammox stage has sludge recirculation given seasonal temperature variations 25 12 c of the inflowing wastewater and the varying nh4 concentrations of 5 25 mg l our anammox reactor was exposed to mainstream conditions throughout its operational history the reactor was operated in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode and was discontinuously filled and emptied every 6 7 hours depending on the process cycle length the reactor was operated as follows 1 decantation the reactor was decanted from 8 m3 to 4 5 m3 ca 60 min while the carriers were retained with a sieve 2 filling the reactor was filled with effluent from the a stage sbr reactor from 4 5 m3 to 8 m3 60 min i e 44 volume exchange 3 reaction phase during the reaction phase the reactor was stirred and nitrite was continuously added 3 5 m nano2 solution until an ammonium concentration of 1 mgnh4 n l 1 was measured 120 180 min as the reactor system is intended to simulate the anoxic amx stage of a 2 stage process we did not apply aeration strategies for aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacterial growth and always maintained an anaerobic environment to prevent washout of the microbial biomass during wastewater decanting 150 m2 m3 of fluopur carrier material wabag water technology ltd switzerland fleece tiles made of synthetic polymeric fibers 12 12 0 1 mm were used in the anammox reactor at the start of our experiment the amx reactor had been operating successfully for over 2 years 100gnh4 n m3 d 1 for the colonization experiment we added 35 000 marked cut corners blank biofilm carriers to the system carrier samples n 6 were collected twice per week over the first eight weeks after carrier addition and on a weekly basis thereafter for a total period of one year non marked carriers that had stayed in the tank since june 2016 were also sampled at each time point for comparison the samples were immediately transferred to cryo tubes snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish six sampling points one three six nine twelve and 24 months were chosen for cryosectioning and analysis by fish duplicate carriers were analyzed for each time point with an additional blank carrier as a control the carriers were cut into three sections with the middle section being used for fixation cryosectioning and fish confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fish was performed according to established standard operational procedures nielsen 2009 using the oligonucleotide probes listed in supplementary table 1 the probe eub 338 specific for the domain bacteria was used together with a number of species specific 16s rrna directed oligonucleotide probes to identify nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and amx in the cryo sectioned samples laureni et al 2015 we use the term eub for bacteria stained by eub 338 and not by the specific probes clsm of the fish slides was performed using a leica sp5 dmi 6000 leica microsystems gmbh germany and the software las af v2 7 9 images with a resolution of 1024 1024 pixels 4 096 pixels µm were collected using a 63x 1 40 oil objective the image files were visualized and extracted in fiji schindelin et al 2012 daime version 2 1 daims lücker and wagner 2016 was used for 3d visualization and digital image analysis of the z stacks we used 30 fields of view and 15z stacks for each sample more detailed information on fish clsm and image analysis can be found in the supplementary information 2 3 biomass sampling extraction and sequencing nucleic acids were extracted based on a method modified from griffiths et al griffiths whiteley o donnell and bailey 2000 duplicate biofilm carriers n 3 from every time point were cut into small pieces on a liquid nitrogen bath carrier pieces were transferred to 1 5 ml matrix e lysis tubes mpbio and 0 5 ml of both hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer and phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 ph 6 8 was added cells were lysed in a fastprep machine mpbio followed by nucleic acid precipitation with peg 6000 on ice nucleic acid pellets were washed three times with ethanol 70 and dissolved in 50 µl depc treated rnase free water dna quality and quantity was assessed by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd 2000c spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed by novogene ltd hong kong on the illumina nextseq platform based on a pair end algorithm 250bp v3 v4 2 4 sequence analysis and ecostatistics raw sequences were analyzed within the qiime2 framework bolyen et al 2019 primer sequences were removed with the cutadapt qiime2 plugin after demultiplexing read pairs were joined low quality reads were filtered out and all high quality reads were analyzed with the deblur software to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs based on illumina miseq hiseq error profiles taxonomical assignment of the asvs was performed within qiime2 environment with the silva 16s v3 v4 classifier accessed january 2020 after filtering of unclassified and contaminated asvs the resulting sequence table consisted of 1038 asvs all subsequent analyses were performed on the relative abundances sequence table rarefied to 15595 reads to ensure comparability between the samples based on the relative abundances we plotted the top bacterial phyla over time for each sample non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis on bray curtis dissimilarity matrices served to visualize patterns of community composition and permanova tested for differences among communities based on the results of nmds and visual observations we categorized the dataset into colonization col succession suc maturation mat old carriers were treated as a separate category old we calculated the bray curtis dissimilarity between adjacent time points and calculated the fraction of dissimilarity contributed by asvs identified as residents all asvs that were present at least in 80 of all samples over all development phases transients asvs that were present in at least 80 of the samples of any two phases and absent during the other exclusives asvs that occurred in 80 of samples of only one biofilm development phase and were absent during the others and the ones that could not be categorized other to clarify the distribution we divided the transients into early transients only occurring during col and suc and late transients only occurring during between suc and mat 2 5 neutral modeling of the stochasticity of the community assembly process to assess the relative importance of stochasticity and determinism for anammox community assembly we firstly evaluated the fit of a sloan neutral community model sloan et al 2006 for each stage output plots mainly show i the fit of neutral model r2 and the migration rate m ii neutral model predictions and its corresponding 95 confidence intervals lines and actual distributions points for each successional stage we then calculated an index normalized stochasticity ratio nst for each stage to verify the results of the sloan neutral model analysis was conducted in r using the package nst ning deng tiedje and zhou 2019 2 6 co occurrence network and c score modeling of process determinism to construct co occurrence networks for microbial community in the anammox biofilm system spearman s rank coefficients ρ between all asvs abundances with occurrence in more than 50 of samples were calculated correlations with ρ 0 8 and p value 0 05 were considered statistically significant and robust a series of topological properties including modularity average clustering coefficient average shortest path length and network density were calculated and compared across each stage the random r and observed o incidences of intra group and inter group co occurrence patterns between microbial entities i e asvs were calculated ju and zhang 2015 and a checkerboard score c score model https github com gotellilab ecosimr was used as the metric of species segregation stone and roberts 1990 and its variance c scorevar was used as the metric of both species segregation and aggregation in the microbial community the higher the observed standardized effect size ses values of the c score the greater the degree of species segregation relative to a random distribution python and r scripts used for co occurrence network and c score analysis are freely available at https github com richieju520 more information on the modeling approach can be found in the si 3 results 3 1 temporal development of anammox biofilm structure revealed by fish clsm during the first month of biofilm growth fish clsm showed small patches of pioneering eub attached to the carrier material in the void space between the fleece fibers fig 1 while amx did not contribute to the earliest phase of biofilm development nob were already part of the community fig 1 after three months amx also started to appear as microcolonies while existing eub patches increased in size after six months larger and sporadically connected agglomerations of eub had developed numerous small amx and nob colonies are attached to or enclosed within the eub patches after nine months of biofilm growth amx clusters displayed a significant increase in volume eub patches had grown and combined with each other to form larger agglomerations while the nob fraction continued to form additional small colonies only after twelve months nob patches started to occasionally connect to form larger agglomerations but never to the extent seen with amx and eub fig 1 finally in the matured biofilms month 24 both amx and eub agglomerations had spread even further now occupying more than 50 of the total carrier volume comparison of bright field and fish microscopy revealed that bacteria only grew around and not within the fibers of the fleece carrier fig 1 month 24 the available pore space within the carrier appeared to be nearly completely filled with bacterial biomass in the mature and old biofilms we used image analysis to determine the average total volume and average number of detected objects from the image data for each time point table 1 the average object volume i e average volume of colonies or patches expressed as the ratio between average total volume and average number of detected objects confirmed the qualitative visual observations fig 2 a eub initiated the biofilm formation but then expanded rather slowly in volume fig 2b between three and six months the average object volume increased for all three bacterial consortia the nob average object volume remained far lower than for eub and amx and was relatively stable over time although the overall volume and number of objects increased until nine and twelve months after initiation of the experiment respectively table 1 this suggests a lack of expansion of the existing nob clusters in parallel with the development of new clusters fig 2b the average object volume for amx and eub on the other hand started to increase significantly after six months t test p 0 005 indicating expanding volume by coalescence of objects fig 2b our findings for old biofilms also demonstrate that in the additional year or more of development the eub and amx clusters nearly doubled in size and number of colonies while nob clusters remained very stable all three bacterial groups showed a significant correlation between the mean total volume and the mean number of objects linear regression r2 eub 0 960 r2 nob 0 946 r2 amx 0 783 based on the above observations we categorized biofilm growth into three distinct biofilm growth phases the colonization col phase lasts until three months after carrier addition when amx appeared for the first time but the eub volume object ratio is still low the succession suc phase includes the dynamic expansion of the eub and amx clusters until month 9 the final maturation mat phase comprises the remainder of the study period when the volume object ratio remains mostly constant although total biofilm volume still increases 3 2 temporal dynamics of the biofilm microbial community composition the development of the biodiversity and composition of the bacterial community was investigated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in total 1038 asvs proxy microbial taxa were detected in the 102 biofilm samples after assigning asvs to the microbial taxonomy we noted that many of the identified taxa are typical for mainstream anammox in wwtp bhattacharjee et al 2017 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 throughout the observation period the biofilm was dominated by asvs belonging to the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes planctomycetes i e the phylum to which amx belong and nitrospirae performing nitrite oxidation fig 3 a the microbial community was subject to dynamic changes in the phylum abundance structure and turnover of representatives of these phyla throughout the one year experiment however the distinct growth phases defined above were also characterized by differences in the dominant microbial taxa and their temporal dynamics during the col phase of biofilm development asvs that were assigned to the phyla of proteobacteria mainly betaproteobacteriales bacteroidetes chitinophagales and flavobacteriales actinobacteria micrococcales and firmicutes lactobacillales displayed highest relative abundances by assessing the prime metabolism of these pioneering consortia based one the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters midas mcilroy et al 2017 we found that all of them are pursuing a heterotrophic lifestyle furthermore members of these bacterial groups were also associated with the formation of suspended aggregates chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 members of the firmicutes nearly vanished towards the end of the col phase and were not able to reestablish their prior dominance in any of the later stages in contrast asvs from the phylum chloroflexi from the bacteria classes anaerolineae and chloroflexia increased significantly students t test p 0 005 in their relative abundance reaching up to 20 in the mat phase and even higher percentages in the old samples fig 3a relative abundance of the proteobacteria decreased during the col phase but they remained the most abundant phylum in all later phases 40 actinobacteria and bacteroidetes increased during the col phase but decreased during succession to more or less stable abundance levels this was also observed for members of the phyla acidobacteria fig 3a consistent with the fish observations amx asvs planctomycetes and nitrospirae displayed very low abundances during the first three months of biofilm growth but started to increase in numbers during the suc phase reaching up to 8 of the total community after the suc phase nine months the community composition stabilized with less evident fluctuations in community composition and asv abundances fig 3a the presence of nob despite the lack of oxygen was very surprising but the overall abundance remained small and we can exclude that substrate competition for no2 between amx and nob affected process performance furthermore as observed in simultaneous nitritation anammox and denitrification reactors du et al 2021 wen et al 2017 heterotrophic denitrification and anammox can occur in parallel however denitrification can be excluded as a major competition for the available no3 or no2 in our system as cod concentrations are small and transcription rates of relevant denitrification genes were shown to be very low in comparison to amx gene transcription niederdorfer et al 2021 to evaluate how the microbial community structure changed over time and to verify whether our categorization into different growth phases is supported by community dissimilarity metrics we performed an ordination analysis on the asv abundance data nmds fig 3b we found that community composition of the three growth phases and the old carriers were all significantly different permanova p 0 001 r2 0 5783 furthermore community dissimilarities within growth phases were much more pronounced during the col phase and gradually decreased as biofilms matured for example the late stages of suc and early stages of mat phase week 30 35 did not display any significant differences permanova p 0 5 as one may expect the overall community composition on the added carriers appeared to converge towards the old carriers but remained significantly different from these permanova p 0 001 however even within the old biofilms we still found significant differences in community composition over time permanova p 0 001 but without any clear temporal trend 3 3 successional patterns of individual microbial taxa a distribution analysis of asvs occurrence over the distinct growth phases revealed a large number of asvs that were abundant only during col phase numerous asvs were only shared between the suc and the mat phase and were low in abundance during the col phase supplementary figure 1 therefore we classified asvs into residents always present transients present in any two phases and exclusives present in one phase depending on their occurrence or detection frequencies over the growth phases see methods we found 373 asvs that were classified as residents col and the old phase displayed the highest number of exclusive asvs n 137 and 52 respectively suc and mat shared the highest number of transient asvs n 211 late transients col and suc shared 41 transient asvs early transients while col and mat only shared 17 re occurring transients to assess the contributions of the defined successional categories to the temporal community turnover we computed the fraction of the bray curtis dissimilarity explained by each group fig 4 overall asvs belonging to the resident fraction contributed most to the overall community dissimilarity 64 5 indicating that they were highly dynamic even though they remained in the biofilm throughout the experimental period the contribution of the exclusives to the overall community change was highest during col 14 7 4 5 and unexpectedly elevated also in old biofilms 11 6 2 9 compared to suc and mat phases 4 1 1 3 and 4 6 3 6 respectively the average contributions of exclusives were significantly different in pairwise comparisons of all phases students t test p 0 005 the contribution of transient asvs increased from 22 3 3 during col to 28 3 1 in the succession phase and to 29 7 5 in the mat phase respectively during the old phase the contribution of transients to the overall community change decreased to 20 9 3 fig 4 3 4 stochasticity versus determinism in community assembly during biofilm development given the above observations the dynamics of community assembly clearly changed over the growth phases we therefore applied a neutral modeling approach to determine the importance of stochasticity in the community assembly based on the differences in the neutral model predictions fitness of the model r2 immigration rate m and the index normalized stochasticity ratio nst this approach led us to further divide the col phase into three distinct subsections col1 col2 and col3 we observed a general decrease of r2 and nst from 0 75 to 0 59 over the first three months of col fig 5 a b c table 2 indicating that the importance of stochastic neutral processes was high initially and then decreased the immigration rate also decreased with experimental period indicating a decreasing contribution of the arrival of new taxa the suc phase on the other hand was concomitant with an increase of the corresponding r2 nst 0 9 and 0 77 respectively and m 1 1 in comparison to col3 fig 5d table 2 indicating a resurgence of neutral processes and the invasion of the developing biofilm by new bacterial taxa in the mat phase fig 5e table 2 r2 and m drastically decreased once again 0 73 and 0 60 respectively while the stochasticity ratio increased further to 0 81 the old phase fig 5f table 2 displayed an again increased average fit of r2 0 83 and the second highest value for m 0 85 for the old carriers we calculated an average nst of 0 74 this indicated that the old biofilms once again become available to stochastic invasion 3 5 deterministic co occurrence and species segregation patterns assuming that both synergistic and antagonistic species interaction play a role in community assemblage we further explored co occurrence patterns using network analysis we built networks from strong and significant correlations of the spearman s rank coefficient the networks for each of the growth stages differed substantially in the number of nodes asvs edges number of connections size of modules closely interconnected nodes modularity extent to which species interaction are organized into modules or subnetworks in a network and the clustering coefficient the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together fig 6 table 3 for all parameters except modularity we observed a decrease from col1 to col2 whereas all network properties significantly increased again from col2 to col3 fig 6a b c table 3 the suc phase displayed lowest values for all network properties with an all time low in nodes n 94 and edges n 87 but an increase in average modularity from 0 295 col3 to 0 795 fig 6d during mat phase the number of nodes and edges increased again n 213 and 206 respectively in addition an increase in modularity was observed fig 6f table 3 networks for old carriers that have been in the reactor for over two years displayed a substantial increase in nodes n 363 and edges n 1027 but a decrease in modularity 0 687 in comparison to the mat biofilm we analyzed the networks for co occurrence of asv within and between individual phyla we found that in col1 asvs tended to not co occur deterministically as indicated by the low o r ratios supplementary table 2 only asvs assigned to the phylum of bacteroidetes appeared to co occur with other representatives of the same phylum intra taxon co occurrence during this phase this changed drastically in col2 and suc phases when the number of significant positive inter taxa and intra taxon co occurrences increased substantially especially the suc phase of biofilm formation displayed a pronounced number of inter taxa co occurrences in stark contrast during the col3 mat and old phases incidences of inter and intra taxa co occurrences occurred less than would be expected by chance supplementary table 2 based on the findings from the co occurrence networks we applied a null model approach to make inferences about the ecological species interactions cooperation and competition within the microbial community over the growth phases of the biofilm here we found strong consistencies between the c score and its variance cvar score table 4 supplementary figure 2 during the col phase ses values from c score increased from 3 32 to 45 3 while the corresponding cvar score increased from 3 11 to 285 suggesting increasingly less positive species interaction i e cooperation over time while species competition increased table 4 supplementary figure 2 ses values and potential species competition decreased for both scores during the suc phase followed by a significant increase in the mat phase ses 34 6 and 46 8 respectively species cooperation increased again in old carriers in comparison to the mat phase with comparable ses values from 17 8 c score and 14 8 cvar score respectively table 4 supplementary figure 2 4 discussion this study was designed to track and model amx biofilm microbiota development on synthetic carrier material in a controlled engineered ecosystem over the course of a year our purpose was to understand in more detail how microbial interaction shape a functioning anammox biofilm in accordance with our hypotheses i and ii we observed distinct developmental stages in biofilm formation these stages differed in terms of structure fig 1 2 and community composition fig 3a in support of hypothesis iii these stages were further characterized by dynamic shifts between stochastic and deterministic processes fig 5 and changing co occurrence patterns fig 6 after a year the new biofilm converged towards community structures that resembled the mature carrier biofilms already present in the reactor at the initiation of the experiment fig 3b in the following sections we discuss the ecological dynamics at each stage with fig 7 as a conceptual guideline 4 1 initial colonization phase col1 in support of our hypothesis i biofilm formation was initiated by a consortium of heterotrophic bacteria with mostly members of firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobacteria and surprisingly nob fig 3a using fish clsm fig 1 we observed a stochastic spatial distribution of microcolonies built by pioneering colonizers in the first month presumably detached bacterial cells from mature biofilms or from the surrounding wastewater non specifically and randomly attached to the pristine carrier surfaces as newly adhered cells are loosely associated with the carriers they are likely to easily become detached again as they are subjected to hydrodynamic perturbation e g shear forces in the reactor fig 1 this is clearly reflected in the substantially higher quantity of exclusive asvs at the very beginning of biofilm formation fig 4 furthermore neutral modeling revealed the predominant role of stochastic processes in the microbiota assembly during this initial colonization stage col1 fig 5a 7 and table 2 confirming the very dynamic nature of this biofilm growth phase however a large fraction of these biofilm founding taxa established successfully and became part of the biofilm core community all observed initial colonization patterns during col1 agree well with the scientific consensus regarding the fundamental steps of biofilm formation battin et al 2016 hall stoodley et al 2004 jackson et al 2001 4 2 later colonization phases col2 col3 during col2 stochastic processes still dominated the biofilm formation but the relative contribution of deterministic processes increased due to higher competition fig 5b table 4 we hypothesize that the microscopically observed stagnation in cluster formation fig 1 month 3 directly resulted from increased competition resulting in a metabolic trade off polz and cordero 2016 pioneering populations are forced to invest some of their metabolic capacity into defense mechanisms rather than in fast growth and spatial expansion the increase in determinism i e competition accompanied by a considerable decrease in the immigration rate further supports the notion of the community transitioning from an initially reversible to irreversible attachment resulting in an enhanced community stability the drastic decrease in exclusive asvs in col3 fig 4 supports this result while pioneering phyla like firmicutes slowly vanished new key players such as chloroflexi emerged fig 3a based on previous findings on microbial community succession cordero and datta 2016 datta et al 2016 we speculate that these dynamics are modulated by the availability of substrate to microbes within the biofilm more precisely during initial biofilm colonization labile substrates will be consumed first supporting copiotrophic microbial taxa such as firmicutes datta et al 2016 nemergut et al 2016 the latter are then replaced by more oligotrophic slow growing taxa e g chloroflexi acidobacteria that are capable of metabolizing the remaining more recalcitrant organic carbon pools rui peng and lu 2009 these may eventually outcompete less adapted pioneering consortia polz and cordero 2016 the filamentous members of the chloroflexi phylum are known to structurally support biofilm formation speirs rice petrovski and seviour 2019 and to scavenge secondary metabolites from generalist decomposers kindaichi et al 2012 xia et al 2007 the observed dynamics in community turnover are consistent with the results from the dissimilarity analysis fig 3b they also agree with the significantly increased species competition fig 5c 7 as well as frequencies of species co occurrence associations fig 6c 7 suggested by the neutral model and network analyses overall the results indicate a substantial increase in the deterministic influences on the microbiota assembly in the later stages of the col phase 4 3 succession phase suc in developing stream biofilms after successful surface attachment cells multiply and continue to produce essential eps matrix components forming microcolonies and eventually multilayer aggregates hall stoodley costerton and stoodley 2004 the observed expansion of the clusters within the carrier material indicated by the fish clsm imaging fig 1 table 1 month 6 9 clearly resembles this biofilm formation pattern in natural ecosystems the increasing number of late transient asvs fig 4 supplementary figure 1 and the reduced community dissimilarities fig 3b suggest the convergence of the carrier associated microbiome towards an essentially stable core community at this point competition driven deterministic dynamics play only a minor role anymore indeed the suc phase is characterized by a sharp increase in both the importance of stochastic assembly and immigration rates fig 5d 7 and table 2 and by reduced species competition and co occurrence fig 6d and supplementary figure 3 a stable core community now enables transitory attachment and immigration events to dominate the temporal dynamics again during the suc phase amx started to emerge within the community fig 1 3a which confirmed our hypothesis i that amx do not participate in the initial biofilm formation but rather grow slowly into the biofilm when substrate conditions are sufficiently conducive we argue that slow growth rates kuenen 2008 mulder et al 1995 and the high sensitivity to inhibition by various environmental factors jin yang yu and zheng 2012 make amx rather weak competitors during initial biofilm formation however once a biofilm has established and anoxic suboxic zones within the deeper layers of the biofilm have formed flemming et al 2016 anaerobic bacteria like amx increase in biomass and metabolic performance zhang and okabe 2020b during natural biofilm development complex physical and chemical gradients available nutrients oxygen redox gradients are established veach et al 2016 and create multiple niches that harbor various cells with different metabolic capacities which in turn creates opportunities for synergistic interactions flemming et al 2016 we observed an increase in inter taxa co occurrences between taxonomically distant bacteria supplementary table 2 suggesting a high degree of mutualistic and commensal metabolic cooperation during the suc phase ju and zhang 2015 4 4 mature phase mat old the near complete filling of the pore space with biomass and the agglomeration of existing clusters during the last stage of the experimental period fig 1 2 in combination with the observed stability in community structure fig 3 4 confirm that the biofilm has matured into a stable state during the mat phase and in old biofilms intra taxa co occurrences further increased which suggests established niches and an increase in the coexistence of closely related species röttjers and faust 2018 according to established concepts of biofilm life cycles bacterial cells disperse from mature biofilm revert to planktonic growth and start a new cycle of biofilm establishment on new surface patches flemming et al 2016 mcdougald et al 2012 in engineered ecosystems passive separation from the carrier due to shear forces induced by the constant stirring in these systems is the predominant control on biofilm dispersal garny horn and neu 2008 and increases with increasing biofilm thickness telgmann horn and morgenroth 2004 we argue that these dispersal dynamics also create new ecological niches within the biofilm community as sloughing now creates local patches that are again susceptible to attachment by bacterial cells mcdougald et al 2012 or growth of already present community members such as observed for chloroflexi the observed increase in immigration rate number of exclusive asvs and frequency of co occurrences in the old biofilm fig 6f 7 support this notion on the other hand the marked decrease in the community wide species competition and increased influence of stochastic processes fig 5f table 2 supplementary figure 2 on the community assembly might be the direct result of the aforementioned dispersal dynamics in summary our findings show in considerable detail how an amx biofilm develops on synthetic carrier material within an engineered ecosystem stochastic and deterministic processes structure the microbial community and lead to a multi phase succession even in the presence of abundant established biofilms in the reactor the right choice of reactor conditions has proven its potential to facilitate amx growth within biofilms agrawal et al 2017 bhattacharjee et al 2017 tao et al 2012 our results suggest however that the microbial community has to proceed through the different phases of biofilm formation mandated by internal ecological processes to reach the desired core community structure and metabolic capacities of the mature biofilm simple changes in reactor conditions alone appear unlikely to significantly accelerate or modulate biofilm formation as the community members themselves their mutual interactions and the biofilm structure have to develop over time in our case over a year and alter the microenvironment they inhabit this has considerable practical implications it may prove difficult to considerably speed up the process of establishing functional amx biofilms as each phase depends on previous developments which puts constraints on the startup of new reactors and the regular replacement of carrier material it seems plausible that a detailed understanding of the community assembly development can be used to optimize the process on the other hand given the observed high degree of microbial interactions in amx reactors lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and fig 6 it seems possible that changes in the reactor configuration might alter the community development which in turn could directly affect the balance of bacterial interactions within the community in unexpected ways amx generally comprise only a small fraction of the microbial community and are especially under mainstream conditions very susceptible to disturbances joss et al 2011 laureni et al 2016 wells et al 2017 however they are the key players for one of the most promising energy efficient mechanisms of fixed nitrogen elimination and the effect of changing community interactions on amx ecology thus needs to be further explored encouragingly our results indicate that the developing biofilm on the new carriers converged towards the community composition and structure observed in already established biofilms the mature biofilm exhibited considerable long term stability both in terms of function and microbial composition in spite of the potential disturbance effects of compositional or seasonal temperature changes of the incoming wastewater this may point to a stabilizing effect of the complex interactions in the diverse microbial biofilm community future research needs to apply metagenomic sequencing paired with genome centric approaches to provide a deeper understanding of the functions involved in the assembly and the exact roles of individual community members which will in turn help to manipulate their development 5 conclusions in the studied pilot scale mainstream anammox reactor stochastic and deterministic processes modulated the microbial community structure within carrier associated biofilms and led to a multi phase microbial succession ultimately leading to the microbial community structure of already established biofilms we argue that a microbial community has to proceed through different phases of biofilm formation constrained by internal ecological processes to reach the desired stable core community structure and metabolic capacities of the mature biofilm it must be assumed that simple changes in reactor conditions alone are unlikely to accelerate or modulate the biofilm formation as internal ecological mechanisms seem to play a critical role in structuring the biofilm community over time the staged biofilm growth has considerable practical implications for the startup of new reactors and the regular replacement of carrier materials as each growth phase seems to be a prerequisite for the next one and ultimately leading to a stable community structure a deeper understanding of the functions involved in the assembly and maintenance of amx biofilms is clearly necessary to better understand and potentially manipulate their development declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from the

16920,mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox represents one of the most promising energy efficient mechanisms of fixed nitrogen elimination from wastewaters however little is known about the exact processes and drivers of microbial community assembly within the complex microbial biofilms that support anammox in engineered ecosystems here we followed anammox biofilm development on fresh carriers in an established 8m3 mainstream anammox reactor that is exposed to seasonal temperature changes 25 12 c and varying nh4 concentrations 5 25 mg l we use fluorescence in situ hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing to show that three distinct stages of biofilm development emerge naturally from microbial community composition and biofilm structure neutral modelling and network analysis are employed to elucidate the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes and synergistic and antagonistic interactions in the biofilms during their development we find that the different phases are characterized by a dynamic succession and an interplay of both stochastic and deterministic processes the observed growth stages colonization succession and maturation appear to be the prerequisite for the anticipated growth of anammox bacteria and for reaching a biofilm community structure that supports the desired metabolic and functional capacities observed for biofilm carriers already present in the system 100gnh4 n m3 d 1 we discuss the relevance of this improved understanding of anammox community ecology and biofilm development in the context of its practical

sequencing sequencing batch reactor biofilm structure 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox involves the simultaneous oxidation of ammonium nh4 and reduction of nitrite no2 under oxygen limiting conditions and is orchestrated by a unique lineage of bacteria amx which all belong to the phylum planctomycetes and display a high diversity with 10 different candidate species discovered so far kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 zhang and okabe 2020a used under mainstream conditions in wastewater treatment plants wwtp anammox is also one of the most promising mechanisms of fixed nitrogen n elimination since it represents an important step towards energy autarky in the treatment of municipal wastewaters lotti et al 2014 siegrist salzgeber eugster and joss 2008 currently anammox is widely applied and represents a robust method for autotrophic n removal under sidestream conditions high nh4 concentrations and temperatures lackner et al 2014 nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 however application of the anammox processes under mainstream conditions suffers from process instabilities due to unexpected fluctuation of environmental temperature dissolved oxygen low nh4 concentrations and high c n ratios joss et al 2011 laureni et al 2016 pijuan et al 2020 wells et al 2017 amx currently lack representatives available in pure culture they are characterized by very slow growth rates and low cell yields kuenen 2008 which makes sufficient retention of biomass one of the main challenges for their application in wastewater treatment they are grown either in biofilm reactors on various carrier materials or as granules to retain sufficient biomass abma et al 2007 lower space requirements lower sludge production and resilience towards changes in the reactor configuration are additional benefits of biofilm based wastewater treatment systems chen and chen 2000 wilderer and mcswain 2004 zhao et al 2019 the microbial communities that ultimately form the biofilms performing anammox in wastewater treatment systems amx biofilms are very diverse amx although performing the anammox reaction typically comprise only a small fraction of the community heterotrophic bacteria that are crucial for the formation of the biofilm but do not contribute directly to the anammox process itself typically represent the majority of microbes in these biofilms laureni et al 2015 mozumder et al 2014 ni et al 2012 additionally many heterotrophic bacteria in mainstream anammox systems have the functional capacity to perform denitrification complete or single steps and to contribute to the n removal in the reactor or scavenging of detritus and peptides produced by anammox bacteria lawson et al 2017 niederdorfer et al 2021 speth et al 2016 while there are numerous studies focusing on microbial community assembly in systems with suspended biomass chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 luo et al 2017 the ecological processes underlying amx biofilm formation on synthetic carrier materials are still poorly understood the high diversity and internal structure indicates a high potential for internal competition synergies and feedback mechanisms at the same time the system is in constant contact with the bacteria and variable environmental conditions of the inflow therefore both deterministic faust et al 2018 flemming and wuertz 2019 as well as stochastic effects sloan et al 2006 woodcock and sloan 2017 are expected to govern community assembly this complicates efforts to fully understand amx biofilm formation for engineered applications

temporal community dynamics is required to understand the ecological processes that lead to an established biofilm community brislawn et al 2019 datta et al 2016 niederdorfer et al 2016 shade et al 2014 given the high microbial diversity of mainstream amx biofilms co occurrence network modelling provides a useful tool to elucidate the mechanistic background of ecological interactions between individual community members faust and raes 2012 ju and zhang 2015 röttjers and faust 2018 widder et al 2016 in this study we investigated the microbial community assembly on synthetic biofilm carriers in a pilot scale mainstream anammox reactor in the presence of already established mature biofilm we studied the spatial biofilm structure using confocal microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization the microbial community composition was analyzed with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the establishment of the biofilm was monitored over the course of a year from initial colonization to mature biofilms we hypothesized i that heterotrophic bacteria are the pioneering colonizers that initiate biofilm formation and create the required base layer for second wave colonizers including amx and ii that the structure of and development within biofilms can be divided into three distinct growth stages colonization succession and maturation as observed in other systems allison et al 2000 hall stoodley et al 2004 we expected colonization to be driven by initial colonizers capable of attaching and growing on the carrier surface during the succession stage we expected increasingly intense competition for space and nutrients in the juvenile biofilm during maturation we expected convergence towards a well adapted quasi equilibrium state determined by the environmental factors in the reactor we further hypothesized iii that the relative importance of stochastic e g growth death and immigration versus deterministic processes e g environmental factors biotic interactions niche differentiation legacy effects for community assembly changes over the different stages of biofilm development using neutral co occurrence and checkerboard score modeling of the amx biofilm community assembly allowed us to disentangle the deterministic and stochastic ecological factors that ultimately shape the community structure of the mature biofilm to our knowledge this is one of the first studies using a toolbox of various community modelling approaches combined with spatial analysis to unravel assembly mechanisms of surface attached amx biofilms in engineered ecosystems for practitioners and engineers this work provides useful information on ecological constraints governing the establishment of functional amx biofilms under mainstream conditions but also highlights their inherent stability 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up and sampling the experiment was conducted in an 8 m3 mainstream anammox moving bed biofilm reactor which is part of the pilot wastewater treatment plant at the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag in dübendorf a separate sbr operated a stage pilot scale reactor 8m3 fed with fresh mainstream municipal wastewater from the municipality dübendorf provided the inflow for the anammox reactor the influent has the following composition 50 60 mg l 1 cod 5 25 mgnh4 n l 1 0 1 mgno2 n l 1 and 5 10 mgno3 n l 1 neither a stage nor anammox stage has sludge recirculation given seasonal temperature variations 25 12 c of the inflowing wastewater and the varying nh4 concentrations of 5 25 mg l our anammox reactor was exposed to mainstream conditions throughout its operational history the reactor was operated in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode and was discontinuously filled and emptied every 6 7 hours depending on the process cycle length the reactor was operated as follows 1 decantation the reactor was decanted from 8 m3 to 4 5 m3 ca 60 min while the carriers were retained with a sieve 2 filling the reactor was filled with effluent from the a stage sbr reactor from 4 5 m3 to 8 m3 60 min i e 44 volume exchange 3 reaction phase during the reaction phase the reactor was stirred and nitrite was continuously added 3 5 m nano2 solution until an ammonium concentration of 1 mgnh4 n l 1 was measured 120 180 min as the reactor system is intended to simulate the anoxic amx stage of a 2 stage process we did not apply aeration strategies for aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacterial growth and always maintained an anaerobic environment to prevent washout of the microbial biomass during wastewater decanting 150 m2 m3 of fluopur carrier material wabag water technology ltd switzerland fleece tiles made of synthetic polymeric fibers 12 12 0 1 mm were used in the anammox reactor at the start of our experiment the amx reactor had been operating successfully for over 2 years 100gnh4 n m3 d 1 for the colonization experiment we added 35 000 marked cut corners blank biofilm carriers to the system carrier samples n 6 were collected twice per week over the first eight weeks after carrier addition and on a weekly basis thereafter for a total period of one year non marked carriers that had stayed in the tank since june 2016 were also sampled at each time point for comparison the samples were immediately transferred to cryo tubes snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish six sampling points one three six nine twelve and 24 months were chosen for cryosectioning and analysis by fish duplicate carriers were analyzed for each time point with an additional blank carrier as a control the carriers were cut into three sections with the middle section being used for fixation cryosectioning and fish confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fish was performed according to established standard operational procedures nielsen 2009 using the oligonucleotide probes listed in supplementary table 1 the probe eub 338 specific for the domain bacteria was used together with a number of species specific 16s rrna directed oligonucleotide probes to identify nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and amx in the cryo sectioned samples laureni et al 2015 we use the term eub for bacteria stained by eub 338 and not by the specific probes clsm of the fish slides was performed using a leica sp5 dmi 6000 leica microsystems gmbh germany and the software las af v2 7 9 images with a resolution of 1024 1024 pixels 4 096 pixels µm were collected using a 63x 1 40 oil objective the image files were visualized and extracted in fiji schindelin et al 2012 daime version 2 1 daims lücker and wagner 2016 was used for 3d visualization and digital image analysis of the z stacks we used 30 fields of view and 15z stacks for each sample more detailed information on fish clsm and image analysis can be found in the supplementary information 2 3 biomass sampling extraction and sequencing nucleic acids were extracted based on a method modified from griffiths et al griffiths whiteley o donnell and bailey 2000 duplicate biofilm carriers n 3 from every time point were cut into small pieces on a liquid nitrogen bath carrier pieces were transferred to 1 5 ml matrix e lysis tubes mpbio and 0 5 ml of both hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer and phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 ph 6 8 was added cells were lysed in a fastprep machine mpbio followed by nucleic acid precipitation with peg 6000 on ice nucleic acid pellets were washed three times with ethanol 70 and dissolved in 50 µl depc treated rnase free water dna quality and quantity was assessed by using agarose gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop nd 2000c spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed by novogene ltd hong kong on the illumina nextseq platform based on a pair end algorithm 250bp v3 v4 2 4 sequence analysis and ecostatistics raw sequences were analyzed within the qiime2 framework bolyen et al 2019 primer sequences were removed with the cutadapt qiime2 plugin after demultiplexing read pairs were joined low quality reads were filtered out and all high quality reads were analyzed with the deblur software to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs based on illumina miseq hiseq error profiles taxonomical assignment of the asvs was performed within qiime2 environment with the silva 16s v3 v4 classifier accessed january 2020 after filtering of unclassified and contaminated asvs the resulting sequence table consisted of 1038 asvs all subsequent analyses were performed on the relative abundances sequence table rarefied to 15595 reads to ensure comparability between the samples based on the relative abundances we plotted the top bacterial phyla over time for each sample non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis on bray curtis dissimilarity matrices served to visualize patterns of community composition and permanova tested for differences among communities based on the results of nmds and visual observations we categorized the dataset into colonization col succession suc maturation mat old carriers were treated as a separate category old we calculated the bray curtis dissimilarity between adjacent time points and calculated the fraction of dissimilarity contributed by asvs identified as residents all asvs that were present at least in 80 of all samples over all development phases transients asvs that were present in at least 80 of the samples of any two phases and absent during the other exclusives asvs that occurred in 80 of samples of only one biofilm development phase and were absent during the others and the ones that could not be categorized other to clarify the distribution we divided the transients into early transients only occurring during col and suc and late transients only occurring during between suc and mat 2 5 neutral modeling of the stochasticity of the community assembly process to assess the relative importance of stochasticity and determinism for anammox community assembly we firstly evaluated the fit of a sloan neutral community model sloan et al 2006 for each stage output plots mainly show i the fit of neutral model r2 and the migration rate m ii neutral model predictions and its corresponding 95 confidence intervals lines and actual distributions points for each successional stage we then calculated an index normalized stochasticity ratio nst for each stage to verify the results of the sloan neutral model analysis was conducted in r using the package nst ning deng tiedje and zhou 2019 2 6 co occurrence network and c score modeling of process determinism to construct co occurrence networks for microbial community in the anammox biofilm system spearman s rank coefficients ρ between all asvs abundances with occurrence in more than 50 of samples were calculated correlations with ρ 0 8 and p value 0 05 were considered statistically significant and robust a series of topological properties including modularity average clustering coefficient average shortest path length and network density were calculated and compared across each stage the random r and observed o incidences of intra group and inter group co occurrence patterns between microbial entities i e asvs were calculated ju and zhang 2015 and a checkerboard score c score model https github com gotellilab ecosimr was used as the metric of species segregation stone and roberts 1990 and its variance c scorevar was used as the metric of both species segregation and aggregation in the microbial community the higher the observed standardized effect size ses values of the c score the greater the degree of species segregation relative to a random distribution python and r scripts used for co occurrence network and c score analysis are freely available at https github com richieju520 more information on the modeling approach can be found in the si 3 results 3 1 temporal development of anammox biofilm structure revealed by fish clsm during the first month of biofilm growth fish clsm showed small patches of pioneering eub attached to the carrier material in the void space between the fleece fibers fig 1 while amx did not contribute to the earliest phase of biofilm development nob were already part of the community fig 1 after three months amx also started to appear as microcolonies while existing eub patches increased in size after six months larger and sporadically connected agglomerations of eub had developed numerous small amx and nob colonies are attached to or enclosed within the eub patches after nine months of biofilm growth amx clusters displayed a significant increase in volume eub patches had grown and combined with each other to form larger agglomerations while the nob fraction continued to form additional small colonies only after twelve months nob patches started to occasionally connect to form larger agglomerations but never to the extent seen with amx and eub fig 1 finally in the matured biofilms month 24 both amx and eub agglomerations had spread even further now occupying more than 50 of the total carrier volume comparison of bright field and fish microscopy revealed that bacteria only grew around and not within the fibers of the fleece carrier fig 1 month 24 the available pore space within the carrier appeared to be nearly completely filled with bacterial biomass in the mature and old biofilms we used image analysis to determine the average total volume and average number of detected objects from the image data for each time point table 1 the average object volume i e average volume of colonies or patches expressed as the ratio between average total volume and average number of detected objects confirmed the qualitative visual observations fig 2 a eub initiated the biofilm formation but then expanded rather slowly in volume fig 2b between three and six months the average object volume increased for all three bacterial consortia the nob average object volume remained far lower than for eub and amx and was relatively stable over time although the overall volume and number of objects increased until nine and twelve months after initiation of the experiment respectively table 1 this suggests a lack of expansion of the existing nob clusters in parallel with the development of new clusters fig 2b the average object volume for amx and eub on the other hand started to increase significantly after six months t test p 0 005 indicating expanding volume by coalescence of objects fig 2b our findings for old biofilms also demonstrate that in the additional year or more of development the eub and amx clusters nearly doubled in size and number of colonies while nob clusters remained very stable all three bacterial groups showed a significant correlation between the mean total volume and the mean number of objects linear regression r2 eub 0 960 r2 nob 0 946 r2 amx 0 783 based on the above observations we categorized biofilm growth into three distinct biofilm growth phases the colonization col phase lasts until three months after carrier addition when amx appeared for the first time but the eub volume object ratio is still low the succession suc phase includes the dynamic expansion of the eub and amx clusters until month 9 the final maturation mat phase comprises the remainder of the study period when the volume object ratio remains mostly constant although total biofilm volume still increases 3 2 temporal dynamics of the biofilm microbial community composition the development of the biodiversity and composition of the bacterial community was investigated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in total 1038 asvs proxy microbial taxa were detected in the 102 biofilm samples after assigning asvs to the microbial taxonomy we noted that many of the identified taxa are typical for mainstream anammox in wwtp bhattacharjee et al 2017 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 throughout the observation period the biofilm was dominated by asvs belonging to the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi actinobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes planctomycetes i e the phylum to which amx belong and nitrospirae performing nitrite oxidation fig 3 a the microbial community was subject to dynamic changes in the phylum abundance structure and turnover of representatives of these phyla throughout the one year experiment however the distinct growth phases defined above were also characterized by differences in the dominant microbial taxa and their temporal dynamics during the col phase of biofilm development asvs that were assigned to the phyla of proteobacteria mainly betaproteobacteriales bacteroidetes chitinophagales and flavobacteriales actinobacteria micrococcales and firmicutes lactobacillales displayed highest relative abundances by assessing the prime metabolism of these pioneering consortia based one the global database of microbes in wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters midas mcilroy et al 2017 we found that all of them are pursuing a heterotrophic lifestyle furthermore members of these bacterial groups were also associated with the formation of suspended aggregates chu et al 2015 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 members of the firmicutes nearly vanished towards the end of the col phase and were not able to reestablish their prior dominance in any of the later stages in contrast asvs from the phylum chloroflexi from the bacteria classes anaerolineae and chloroflexia increased significantly students t test p 0 005 in their relative abundance reaching up to 20 in the mat phase and even higher percentages in the old samples fig 3a relative abundance of the proteobacteria decreased during the col phase but they remained the most abundant phylum in all later phases 40 actinobacteria and bacteroidetes increased during the col phase but decreased during succession to more or less stable abundance levels this was also observed for members of the phyla acidobacteria fig 3a consistent with the fish observations amx asvs planctomycetes and nitrospirae displayed very low abundances during the first three months of biofilm growth but started to increase in numbers during the suc phase reaching up to 8 of the total community after the suc phase nine months the community composition stabilized with less evident fluctuations in community composition and asv abundances fig 3a the presence of nob despite the lack of oxygen was very surprising but the overall abundance remained small and we can exclude that substrate competition for no2 between amx and nob affected process performance furthermore as observed in simultaneous nitritation anammox and denitrification reactors du et al 2021 wen et al 2017 heterotrophic denitrification and anammox can occur in parallel however denitrification can be excluded as a major competition for the available no3 or no2 in our system as cod concentrations are small and transcription rates of relevant denitrification genes were shown to be very low in comparison to amx gene transcription niederdorfer et al 2021 to evaluate how the microbial community structure changed over time and to verify whether our categorization into different growth phases is supported by community dissimilarity metrics we performed an ordination analysis on the asv abundance data nmds fig 3b we found that community composition of the three growth phases and the old carriers were all significantly different permanova p 0 001 r2 0 5783 furthermore community dissimilarities within growth phases were much more pronounced during the col phase and gradually decreased as biofilms matured for example the late stages of suc and early stages of mat phase week 30 35 did not display any significant differences permanova p 0 5 as one may expect the overall community composition on the added carriers appeared to converge towards the old carriers but remained significantly different from these permanova p 0 001 however even within the old biofilms we still found significant differences in community composition over time permanova p 0 001 but without any clear temporal trend 3 3 successional patterns of individual microbial taxa a distribution analysis of asvs occurrence over the distinct growth phases revealed a large number of asvs that were abundant only during col phase numerous asvs were only shared between the suc and the mat phase and were low in abundance during the col phase supplementary figure 1 therefore we classified asvs into residents always present transients present in any two phases and exclusives present in one phase depending on their occurrence or detection frequencies over the growth phases see methods we found 373 asvs that were classified as residents col and the old phase displayed the highest number of exclusive asvs n 137 and 52 respectively suc and mat shared the highest number of transient asvs n 211 late transients col and suc shared 41 transient asvs early transients while col and mat only shared 17 re occurring transients to assess the contributions of the defined successional categories to the temporal community turnover we computed the fraction of the bray curtis dissimilarity explained by each group fig 4 overall asvs belonging to the resident fraction contributed most to the overall community dissimilarity 64 5 indicating that they were highly dynamic even though they remained in the biofilm throughout the experimental period the contribution of the exclusives to the overall community change was highest during col 14 7 4 5 and unexpectedly elevated also in old biofilms 11 6 2 9 compared to suc and mat phases 4 1 1 3 and 4 6 3 6 respectively the average contributions of exclusives were significantly different in pairwise comparisons of all phases students t test p 0 005 the contribution of transient asvs increased from 22 3 3 during col to 28 3 1 in the succession phase and to 29 7 5 in the mat phase respectively during the old phase the contribution of transients to the overall community change decreased to 20 9 3 fig 4 3 4 stochasticity versus determinism in community assembly during biofilm development given the above observations the dynamics of community assembly clearly changed over the growth phases we therefore applied a neutral modeling approach to determine the importance of stochasticity in the community assembly based on the differences in the neutral model predictions fitness of the model r2 immigration rate m and the index normalized stochasticity ratio nst this approach led us to further divide the col phase into three distinct subsections col1 col2 and col3 we observed a general decrease of r2 and nst from 0 75 to 0 59 over the first three months of col fig 5 a b c table 2 indicating that the importance of stochastic neutral processes was high initially and then decreased the immigration rate also decreased with experimental period indicating a decreasing contribution of the arrival of new taxa the suc phase on the other hand was concomitant with an increase of the corresponding r2 nst 0 9 and 0 77 respectively and m 1 1 in comparison to col3 fig 5d table 2 indicating a resurgence of neutral processes and the invasion of the developing biofilm by new bacterial taxa in the mat phase fig 5e table 2 r2 and m drastically decreased once again 0 73 and 0 60 respectively while the stochasticity ratio increased further to 0 81 the old phase fig 5f table 2 displayed an again increased average fit of r2 0 83 and the second highest value for m 0 85 for the old carriers we calculated an average nst of 0 74 this indicated that the old biofilms once again become available to stochastic invasion 3 5 deterministic co occurrence and species segregation patterns assuming that both synergistic and antagonistic species interaction play a role in community assemblage we further explored co occurrence patterns using network analysis we built networks from strong and significant correlations of the spearman s rank coefficient the networks for each of the growth stages differed substantially in the number of nodes asvs edges number of connections size of modules closely interconnected nodes modularity extent to which species interaction are organized into modules or subnetworks in a network and the clustering coefficient the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together fig 6 table 3 for all parameters except modularity we observed a decrease from col1 to col2 whereas all network properties significantly increased again from col2 to col3 fig 6a b c table 3 the suc phase displayed lowest values for all network properties with an all time low in nodes n 94 and edges n 87 but an increase in average modularity from 0 295 col3 to 0 795 fig 6d during mat phase the number of nodes and edges increased again n 213 and 206 respectively in addition an increase in modularity was observed fig 6f table 3 networks for old carriers that have been in the reactor for over two years displayed a substantial increase in nodes n 363 and edges n 1027 but a decrease in modularity 0 687 in comparison to the mat biofilm we analyzed the networks for co occurrence of asv within and between individual phyla we found that in col1 asvs tended to not co occur deterministically as indicated by the low o r ratios supplementary table 2 only asvs assigned to the phylum of bacteroidetes appeared to co occur with other representatives of the same phylum intra taxon co occurrence during this phase this changed drastically in col2 and suc phases when the number of significant positive inter taxa and intra taxon co occurrences increased substantially especially the suc phase of biofilm formation displayed a pronounced number of inter taxa co occurrences in stark contrast during the col3 mat and old phases incidences of inter and intra taxa co occurrences occurred less than would be expected by chance supplementary table 2 based on the findings from the co occurrence networks we applied a null model approach to make inferences about the ecological species interactions cooperation and competition within the microbial community over the growth phases of the biofilm here we found strong consistencies between the c score and its variance cvar score table 4 supplementary figure 2 during the col phase ses values from c score increased from 3 32 to 45 3 while the corresponding cvar score increased from 3 11 to 285 suggesting increasingly less positive species interaction i e cooperation over time while species competition increased table 4 supplementary figure 2 ses values and potential species competition decreased for both scores during the suc phase followed by a significant increase in the mat phase ses 34 6 and 46 8 respectively species cooperation increased again in old carriers in comparison to the mat phase with comparable ses values from 17 8 c score and 14 8 cvar score respectively table 4 supplementary figure 2 4 discussion this study was designed to track and model amx biofilm microbiota development on synthetic carrier material in a controlled engineered ecosystem over the course of a year our purpose was to understand in more detail how microbial interaction shape a functioning anammox biofilm in accordance with our hypotheses i and ii we observed distinct developmental stages in biofilm formation these stages differed in terms of structure fig 1 2 and community composition fig 3a in support of hypothesis iii these stages were further characterized by dynamic shifts between stochastic and deterministic processes fig 5 and changing co occurrence patterns fig 6 after a year the new biofilm converged towards community structures that resembled the mature carrier biofilms already present in the reactor at the initiation of the experiment fig 3b in the following sections we discuss the ecological dynamics at each stage with fig 7 as a conceptual guideline 4 1 initial colonization phase col1 in support of our hypothesis i biofilm formation was initiated by a consortium of heterotrophic bacteria with mostly members of firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobacteria and surprisingly nob fig 3a using fish clsm fig 1 we observed a stochastic spatial distribution of microcolonies built by pioneering colonizers in the first month presumably detached bacterial cells from mature biofilms or from the surrounding wastewater non specifically and randomly attached to the pristine carrier surfaces as newly adhered cells are loosely associated with the carriers they are likely to easily become detached again as they are subjected to hydrodynamic perturbation e g shear forces in the reactor fig 1 this is clearly reflected in the substantially higher quantity of exclusive asvs at the very beginning of biofilm formation fig 4 furthermore neutral modeling revealed the predominant role of stochastic processes in the microbiota assembly during this initial colonization stage col1 fig 5a 7 and table 2 confirming the very dynamic nature of this biofilm growth phase however a large fraction of these biofilm founding taxa established successfully and became part of the biofilm core community all observed initial colonization patterns during col1 agree well with the scientific consensus regarding the fundamental steps of biofilm formation battin et al 2016 hall stoodley et al 2004 jackson et al 2001 4 2 later colonization phases col2 col3 during col2 stochastic processes still dominated the biofilm formation but the relative contribution of deterministic processes increased due to higher competition fig 5b table 4 we hypothesize that the microscopically observed stagnation in cluster formation fig 1 month 3 directly resulted from increased competition resulting in a metabolic trade off polz and cordero 2016 pioneering populations are forced to invest some of their metabolic capacity into defense mechanisms rather than in fast growth and spatial expansion the increase in determinism i e competition accompanied by a considerable decrease in the immigration rate further supports the notion of the community transitioning from an initially reversible to irreversible attachment resulting in an enhanced community stability the drastic decrease in exclusive asvs in col3 fig 4 supports this result while pioneering phyla like firmicutes slowly vanished new key players such as chloroflexi emerged fig 3a based on previous findings on microbial community succession cordero and datta 2016 datta et al 2016 we speculate that these dynamics are modulated by the availability of substrate to microbes within the biofilm more precisely during initial biofilm colonization labile substrates will be consumed first supporting copiotrophic microbial taxa such as firmicutes datta et al 2016 nemergut et al 2016 the latter are then replaced by more oligotrophic slow growing taxa e g chloroflexi acidobacteria that are capable of metabolizing the remaining more recalcitrant organic carbon pools rui peng and lu 2009 these may eventually outcompete less adapted pioneering consortia polz and cordero 2016 the filamentous members of the chloroflexi phylum are known to structurally support biofilm formation speirs rice petrovski and seviour 2019 and to scavenge secondary metabolites from generalist decomposers kindaichi et al 2012 xia et al 2007 the observed dynamics in community turnover are consistent with the results from the dissimilarity analysis fig 3b they also agree with the significantly increased species competition fig 5c 7 as well as frequencies of species co occurrence associations fig 6c 7 suggested by the neutral model and network analyses overall the results indicate a substantial increase in the deterministic influences on the microbiota assembly in the later stages of the col phase 4 3 succession phase suc in developing stream biofilms after successful surface attachment cells multiply and continue to produce essential eps matrix components forming microcolonies and eventually multilayer aggregates hall stoodley costerton and stoodley 2004 the observed expansion of the clusters within the carrier material indicated by the fish clsm imaging fig 1 table 1 month 6 9 clearly resembles this biofilm formation pattern in natural ecosystems the increasing number of late transient asvs fig 4 supplementary figure 1 and the reduced community dissimilarities fig 3b suggest the convergence of the carrier associated microbiome towards an essentially stable core community at this point competition driven deterministic dynamics play only a minor role anymore indeed the suc phase is characterized by a sharp increase in both the importance of stochastic assembly and immigration rates fig 5d 7 and table 2 and by reduced species competition and co occurrence fig 6d and supplementary figure 3 a stable core community now enables transitory attachment and immigration events to dominate the temporal dynamics again during the suc phase amx started to emerge within the community fig 1 3a which confirmed our hypothesis i that amx do not participate in the initial biofilm formation but rather grow slowly into the biofilm when substrate conditions are sufficiently conducive we argue that slow growth rates kuenen 2008 mulder et al 1995 and the high sensitivity to inhibition by various environmental factors jin yang yu and zheng 2012 make amx rather weak competitors during initial biofilm formation however once a biofilm has established and anoxic suboxic zones within the deeper layers of the biofilm have formed flemming et al 2016 anaerobic bacteria like amx increase in biomass and metabolic performance zhang and okabe 2020b during natural biofilm development complex physical and chemical gradients available nutrients oxygen redox gradients are established veach et al 2016 and create multiple niches that harbor various cells with different metabolic capacities which in turn creates opportunities for synergistic interactions flemming et al 2016 we observed an increase in inter taxa co occurrences between taxonomically distant bacteria supplementary table 2 suggesting a high degree of mutualistic and commensal metabolic cooperation during the suc phase ju and zhang 2015 4 4 mature phase mat old the near complete filling of the pore space with biomass and the agglomeration of existing clusters during the last stage of the experimental period fig 1 2 in combination with the observed stability in community structure fig 3 4 confirm that the biofilm has matured into a stable state during the mat phase and in old biofilms intra taxa co occurrences further increased which suggests established niches and an increase in the coexistence of closely related species röttjers and faust 2018 according to established concepts of biofilm life cycles bacterial cells disperse from mature biofilm revert to planktonic growth and start a new cycle of biofilm establishment on new surface patches flemming et al 2016 mcdougald et al 2012 in engineered ecosystems passive separation from the carrier due to shear forces induced by the constant stirring in these systems is the predominant control on biofilm dispersal garny horn and neu 2008 and increases with increasing biofilm thickness telgmann horn and morgenroth 2004 we argue that these dispersal dynamics also create new ecological niches within the biofilm community as sloughing now creates local patches that are again susceptible to attachment by bacterial cells mcdougald et al 2012 or growth of already present community members such as observed for chloroflexi the observed increase in immigration rate number of exclusive asvs and frequency of co occurrences in the old biofilm fig 6f 7 support this notion on the other hand the marked decrease in the community wide species competition and increased influence of stochastic processes fig 5f table 2 supplementary figure 2 on the community assembly might be the direct result of the aforementioned dispersal dynamics in summary our findings show in considerable detail how an amx biofilm develops on synthetic carrier material within an engineered ecosystem stochastic and deterministic processes structure the microbial community and lead to a multi phase succession even in the presence of abundant established biofilms in the reactor the right choice of reactor conditions has proven its potential to facilitate amx growth within biofilms agrawal et al 2017 bhattacharjee et al 2017 tao et al 2012 our results suggest however that the microbial community has to proceed through the different phases of biofilm formation mandated by internal ecological processes to reach the desired core community structure and metabolic capacities of the mature biofilm simple changes in reactor conditions alone appear unlikely to significantly accelerate or modulate biofilm formation as the community members themselves their mutual interactions and the biofilm structure have to develop over time in our case over a year and alter the microenvironment they inhabit this has considerable practical implications it may prove difficult to considerably speed up the process of establishing functional amx biofilms as each phase depends on previous developments which puts constraints on the startup of new reactors and the regular replacement of carrier material it seems plausible that a detailed understanding of the community assembly development can be used to optimize the process on the other hand given the observed high degree of microbial interactions in amx reactors lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and fig 6 it seems possible that changes in the reactor configuration might alter the community development which in turn could directly affect the balance of bacterial interactions within the community in unexpected ways amx generally comprise only a small fraction of the microbial community and are especially under mainstream conditions very susceptible to disturbances joss et al 2011 laureni et al 2016 wells et al 2017 however they are the key players for one of the most promising energy efficient mechanisms of fixed nitrogen elimination and the effect of changing community interactions on amx ecology thus needs to be further explored encouragingly our results indicate that the developing biofilm on the new carriers converged towards the community composition and structure observed in already established biofilms the mature biofilm exhibited considerable long term stability both in terms of function and microbial composition in spite of the potential disturbance effects of compositional or seasonal temperature changes of the incoming wastewater this may point to a stabilizing effect of the complex interactions in the diverse microbial biofilm community future research needs to apply metagenomic sequencing paired with genome centric approaches to provide a deeper understanding of the functions involved in the assembly and the exact roles of individual community members which will in turn help to manipulate their development 5 conclusions in the studied pilot scale mainstream anammox reactor stochastic and deterministic processes modulated the microbial community structure within carrier associated biofilms and led to a multi phase microbial succession ultimately leading to the microbial community structure of already established biofilms we argue that a microbial community has to proceed through different phases of biofilm formation constrained by internal ecological processes to reach the desired stable core community structure and metabolic capacities of the mature biofilm it must be assumed that simple changes in reactor conditions alone are unlikely to accelerate or modulate the biofilm formation as internal ecological mechanisms seem to play a critical role in structuring the biofilm community over time the staged biofilm growth has considerable practical implications for the startup of new reactors and the regular replacement of carrier materials as each growth phase seems to be a prerequisite for the next one and ultimately leading to a stable community structure a deeper understanding of the functions involved in the assembly and maintenance of amx biofilms is clearly necessary to better understand and potentially manipulate their development declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from the

16921,in heavily urbanised areas groundwater diffuse pollution is recognised as one of the most insidious threats to groundwater quality diffuse pollution originates from multiple small sources releasing a low contaminant mass over a relatively large area the lack of a defined plume in groundwater the limited leaked mass and the fact that leakage may have occurred in the past and be now ceased make these sources difficult to locate and characterise in addressing this environmental issue an inverse approach based on the null space monte carlo stochastic method has been applied in the framework of an innovative methodology with the aim to locate potential source areas distributed in a large 120 km2 urban area to simplify the problem and better understand the limitations and effectiveness of the proposed methodology the analysis has been performed using a groundwater model with fixed i e determined by a previous calibration hydraulic conductivity and flow boundary conditions the only source of uncertainty considered in the study is the pce mass discharge from all model cells of the topmost layer after implementing and calibrating a deterministic solute transport model multiple random realisations of mass discharge fields were generated all of which are history match constrained and hydrogeologically plausible the obtained stochastic parameter sets were used to investigate the statistical distribution of the solute mass discharge and map the areas that are more likely to host unknown sources of pce although the application of the nsmc stochastic method on the synthetic case study has provided promising results it has also highlighted that multiple sources of uncertainty e g continuity and duration of each source attenuation processes could adversely affect the reliability of the results in a real world context in which the effect of other uncertain parameters hydraulic conductivity amongst all would need to be considered in addition this study offers new insights to the problem of aquifer diffuse pollution by providing key information on the potential source zones and on the areas that urgently need to be prioritised for further investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stochastic analysis uncertainty mass discharge pce groundwater diffuse pollution 1 introduction globally the levels of urbanisation have been rising rapidly amongst all the countries since 1950 and are expected to continue to increase unabated in 2018 about 55 3 of the world s population lived in urban areas with a projected increase to 68 4 by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 together with the growth of urban dwellers and the associated industrial and commercial activities the role played by groundwater has gained an increasing importance groundwater beneath urban agglomerates constitutes an essential source of freshwater available for human agricultural and industrial purposes and contributes to the socio economic development of the cities nevertheless as urban population and activities grow groundwater resources become significantly stressed by the increasing demand for safe drinking water supply in densely urbanised areas the qualitative status of aquifers can be compromised by a myriad of potential sources of pollution amongst which multiple point sources mps alberti et al 2018a represent the most serious threat mps indicate a series of small and uncontrolled point sources that release a low contaminant mass over a relatively large area generating a diffuse groundwater pollution parker and foster 1986 alberti et al 2018a in italy diffuse contamination is defined by the legislative decree 152 2006 as the chemical physical and biological alteration of environmental matrices and contaminations determined by diffuse sources and not linked to a point source environmental ministry of italy 2006 mps can contribute to make an entire aquifer unsuitable for drinking by increasing contaminant concentrations to levels just above drinking water quality standards howard and gelo 2002 another characteristic of aquifer diffuse pollution is that it can be attributable to recent as well as to historical inputs which adversely affected groundwater quality in the past and still deteriorate it today even if these sources are no longer active e g industrial districts currently dismantled rivett 2012 given the insidious and long term nature of diffuse contamination mps are difficult to identify and cannot be remediated with the traditional remedial strategies environmental agency and water services are in urgent need of methods to locate the unknown sources which is the first step to interrupt their effects on groundwater quality in the last years some studies have attempted to set up effective methods for the assessment of groundwater diffuse pollution through gis based statistical techniques pollicino et al 2019 multivariate statistic azzellino et al 2019 and numerical models coupled with a stochastic approach alberti et al 2018a this latter method has been applied by the mentioned authors using the pest software suite doherty 2020 regularisation methods were applied to calculate the solution of minimum error variance to the underdetermined model doherty 2003 then a null space monte carlo nsmc stochastic analysis was performed to generate multiple history match constrained parameter fields and explore the effect of parameter uncertainty on model predictions keating et al 2010 tonkin and doherty 2009 although nsmc is acquiring an ever increasing interest in the hydrogeological field most of the studies are focused on exploring the uncertainty tied to flow parameters e g herckenrath et al 2011 moeck et al 2020 moges et al 2020 also using particle tracking instead of solute transport under the assumption that uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity surrogates for uncertainty in dispersivity formentin et al 2019 while a considerable effort has been devoted to the application of inverse methods to groundwater flow models the number of works dealing with the estimation and uncertainty of solute transport parameters is very limited in the last decades some studies developed a monte carlo stochastic analysis of solute mass discharge li et al 2007 schwede and cirpka 2010 also investigating its interaction with heterogeneities of hydrogeological properties and release conditions at source zone ciriello and de barros 2020 de barros et al 2018 koch and nowak 2015 in this work the uncertainty in the estimation of mass discharge has been quantified to address the problem of groundwater diffuse contamination and delineate the areas that potentially host an unknown pce source the stochastic analysis has been performed within the densely urbanised and industrialised north eastern sector of the milan functional urban area fua already used in other works as a pilot area for the application of statistical and stochastic methods to assess groundwater tetrachloroethylene pce pollution e g azzellino et al 2019 pizzol et al 2015 pollicino et al 2021 this area is significantly affected by a long standing groundwater widespread pollution which overlaps with the plumes originating from hot spots or well defined high impact point sources monitored concentrations over a period of more than 15 years arpa lombardia 2015 colombo et al 2020a show that diffuse component of pce pollution is particularly stable in time this is probably due to the low solubility of pce as well as to a slow and steady release of low concentrations from long term underground sources starting from the transport model previously developed by alberti et al 2016a and alberti 2018b a diffuse pollution scenario was artificially created by the simulation of fictitious source zones which were active 40 years ago in the view of assessing diffuse pollution for the first time by exploring the uncertainty of the solute mass discharge field the use of a synthetic case study served to simplify the problem and offered some advantages amongst these it served to gain a major control over the initial conditions of the transport model i e initial concentrations contribution of the sources and over the release time of the sources 2 study area the study area is located in the lombardy region northern italy and covers an area of approximately 120 km2 together with the milan city and some surrounding municipalities it belongs to the so called milan functional urban area fua known as one of the most heavily urbanised and industrialised areas in europe the territory is drained by a dense hydrographic system which comprises the seveso and lambro rivers as well as the villoresi and naviglio martesana irrigation channels fig 1 the milan subsoil is composed of sediments belonging to the continental depositional system of plio pleistocenic age irsa cnr 1981 lombardia and eni divisione 2002 overlying a marine depositional sequence the sedimentary succession hosts a multilayer alluvial aquifer of great importance for the public agricultural and industrial water supply four hydrogeological units called aquifer groups a b c and d from the top to the bottom of the sequence can be distinguished bini 1997 lombardia and eni divisione 2002 fig 1 the aquifer group a is mainly constituted by gravel and sand and identify the unconfined shallow aquifer it has an average thickness of 60 m and is characterised by high values of both hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 to 10 3 m s and transmissivity usually higher than 10 2 m2 s the aquifer group a is separated from the underlying aquifer group b by a clay silty layer of variable thickness which pinches out northward leading aquifer groups a and b to be hydraulically interconnected gorla et al 2016 sacchi et al 2013 the aquifer group b is mainly composed of coarse to fine sand with several silty clay lenses and hosts a semi confined aquifer it has an average thickness of 40 50 m and is characterised by a lower hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 5 to 10 4 m s and transmissivity varying from 10 3 to 10 2 m2 s with respect to the aquifer group a finally the aquifer groups c and d identify the deepest confined aquifers mainly constituted by sandy silty clay with interbedded fine and very fine sand the groundwater flow is generally orientated n s and the water table depth decreases from nw to se pilla et al 2006 the recharge areas for the multilayer aquifer are located in the alpine foothills but the phreatic aquifer is also significantly recharged by direct infiltration of precipitation seepages of the irrigation channels and losses of the water network within the milan urban area which roughly correspond to 15 of the total water supply alberti et al 2016b the climate is classified as temperate continental mean annual temperature about 13 c mean precipitation about 900 mm with spring and autumn being characterised by the greatest precipitation this study focuses on the quality deterioration of the unconfined shallow aquifer identified by the aquifer group a and the portion of the aquifer group b hydraulically connected to the shallow aquifer northern sector of the study area organo halogenated compounds were first detected in the shallow aquifer in 1975 when evidence of pce contamination was found in several water supply zones in milan berbenni et al 1993 cavallaro et al 1985 giovanardi 1979 since then they have become the major cause of groundwater diffuse pollution in densely industrialised and urbanised areas such as the area of interest milano 1992 although the contamination originated from industrial processes active in the past these substances still threaten the quality of groundwater today colombo et al 2020a in the study area the problem of historical widespread pollution is so persistent and dangerous that a huge part of sesto san giovanni which hosted important steel industries throughout the 1900s has been classified as site of national interest sin for environmental remediation by the italian legislation 3 materials and method 3 1 regularisation and null space monte carlo model calibration is the process whereby model parameters are adjusted to achieve an optimal fit between model outputs and field measurements moore and doherty 2006 more specifically the goal of the calibration process is to minimise an objective function which is the weighted sum of squared residuals and represents a least squares estimate of the fit between observations and their simulated counterparts tonkin and doherty 2009 this is called measurement objective function to distinguish it from the regularization objective function described below it follows that the concept of calibration infers parameter uniqueness even in problems where the model parameters representing the hydraulic properties of a heterogeneous and complex hydrogeological system must be estimated from a limited set of field observations affected by measurement noise in such problems referred as ill posed inverse or underdetermined problems uniqueness in solution is achieved using mathematical regularisation this indicates a general class of methods that provide stability and uniqueness to underdetermined models by adding constraints of structure or a preferred condition to the parameters being estimated doherty et al 2010 two methods were employed in this study tikhonov regularisation and singular value decomposition svd tikhonov regularisation is practically implemented by supplying information about parameters that require calibration the information that is input derives from soft knowledge or expert knowledge meaning that it does not derive from direct measurement but from interpretation or conceptual modelling by an expert svd is a linear algebra procedure that rewrites the inverse problem equations in such way that the most important parameters in calibration can be separated by those parameters that are not informed by the calibration dataset and as such cannot be uniquely estimated these latter parameters and their uncertainties can only be estimated by expert knowledge and are usually not modified during the calibration retaining their initial values christensen and doherty 2008 the application of regularization techniques in conjunction with the null space monte carlo method nsmc tonkin and doherty 2009 keating et al 2010 is functional in exploring the uncertainty associated with parameter calibration the purpose of the nsmc analysis is to generate multiple parameter field realisations that express parameter variability while being history match constrained the nsmc analysis is performed according to the following procedure the model undergoes a first calibration in which regularisation allows to obtain a set of parameters p that yields a solution of minimum error variance to the inverse problem doherty 2003 sepúlveda and doherty 2015 the following equation 1 h x p ε describes the relationship between the calibration dataset represented by the array h which includes field observations of system properties constituting the elements of parameter array p on which the jacobian matrix x acts matrix x contains the sensitivity of the simulated equivalent of each measurement with respect to each parameter whereas ε indicates measurement error i e noise a parameter covariance matrix c p is defined based on prior assumptions on parameter uncertainty this matrix is used to generate multiple 100 in the present case random stochastic realisations of parameter values whose solution space projections are close to the parameter field achieved through model calibration p but whose null space projections are variable in accordance with a prior knowledge of system properties burrows and doherty 2015 the calibrated parameter field p is subtracted from each of the stochastically generated parameter sets p and the difference between p and p is then projected onto the calibration null space thus forming the vector p p the covariance matrix associated with the vector p p is derived from the following equation 2 c p p v 2 v 2 t c p v 2 v 2 t where the vectors composing the columns of the v2 matrix span the calibration null space this being obtained through truncated singular value decomposition svd of q1 2x where q is the observation weight matrix and x is the jacobian matrix 4 null and solution space projection of each stochastic parameter set is then undertaken the null space component of the parameter field is retained whereas the solution space component of the stochastically generated parameter sets is removed and replaced by that pertaining to the calibrated parameter field p herckenrath et al 2011 however model nonlinearity and the indistinct boundary between solution and null spaces lead to a degradation in the level of model to measurements fit resulting in an almost calibrated set of parameters doherty et al 2010 5 a limited model re calibration process is required to adjust each processed stochastic parameter set and return the model to a calibrated state ensuring that the level of model to measurement fit is in accordance with user specifications 3 2 synthetic pce concentration dataset in this study the stochastic analysis has been performed based on a synthetic scenario of groundwater diffuse pollution fig 2 b the synthetic case study as well as the stochastic modelling has been implemented using the deterministic flow and transport model already developed and described in the study by alberti et al 2016a alberti 2018b the model domain consists of 219 rows and 218 columns with a cell resolution of 50 m and is vertically discretised into three layers with layer 1 representing the aquifer group a layer 3 identifying the aquifer group b and layer 2 corresponding to the aquitard between aquifer groups a and b alberti et al 2018b fig s1 in the supplementary material the synthetic pce concentration values were generated by associating pce concentrations to surficial recharge zones fig 2a and by assigning to all the model cells an initial concentration of 3 1 µg l corresponding to the pce diffuse pollution background level estimated for the milan area and adopted by lombardy region for the remediation plan azzellino et al 2019 both the porosity 0 2 for layers 1 and 3 and 0 05 for the aquitard and the transverse dispersivity 3 m were not modified from those used in the numerical models developed in alberti et al 2016a alberti 2018b nevertheless the longitudinal dispersivity has been increased to 30 m in order to keep the peclet number below 2 and ensure numerical stability to solute transport simulation as recommended by zheng and bennett 2002 after a solute transport simulation time of 40 years the computed concentration values were extracted in correspondence of 401 monitoring wells to be employed as observations in the stochastic analysis fig 2 c d although these concentrations were synthetically created they can be considered physically based since they were generated based on the real hydrogeological setting thus they reflect the contribution of pce diffuse pollution attributable to historical anthropogenic sources of unknown position that still affect the study area today in the view of setting up and testing a new methodology to investigate a complex phenomenon such as groundwater diffuse pollution the use of a synthetic case study offered the following advantages the synthetic transport model was assumed as the truth to be compared with the results derived from the stochastic analysis to better understand both the limitations and reliability of the methodology the use of a diffuse contamination scenario produced by sources which were artificially created allowed to neglect the uncertainty associated with the start time continuity and duration of each source in releasing the contaminant mass the synthetic concentration data provided the possibility of including additional monitoring wells screening the shallow unconfined aquifer to the existing network particularly in unmonitored zones as shown in fig 2c 17 wells were added in different portions of the study area in order to enhance the monitoring network particularly in the first layer 3 3 implementation of the deterministic transport model as a first step the application of the nsmc stochastic approach required the implementation and calibration of a solute transport model this numerical model was built starting from the same flow model already used to create the synthetic case study in which the transport boundary conditions were reset and input as described later herein the synthetic concentrations previously generated were imported into the model as synthetic pce observations and at a later stage they were employed to constrain the model calibration process with pest a total number of 401 concentration targets were added at each monitoring well location 317 observations were assigned to layer 1 while the remaining 84 targets were assigned to the northern sector of layer 3 where group aquifers a and b constitute an undifferentiated unconfined aquifer to simulate the solute mass entering the aquifer system through sources the well boundary package i e neumann boundary condition was applied over the entire top model layer using a regular matrix composed of 10 815 cells with a resolution of 50 m fig 3 a specified volumetric flux qin of 10 5 m3 s and a starting concentration cin of 30 μg l were assigned to each cell of the well boundary condition representing the potential source zones the qin is consistent with estimates of the average annual recharge and its value has been kept fixed the cin is the parameter subject to the calibration process and whose variability i e uncertainty has been explored with the stochastic analysis contaminant injection from the cells representing the well boundary condition was handled by the mt3dms source sink mixing package ssm zheng 2010 as in the synthetic transport model an initial background concentration of pce equal to 3 1 μg l was applied to the transport model a statistical technique borrowed from geochemistry exploration sinclair 1974 1991 and already applied in similar case studies panno et al 2006 masetti et al 2009 was employed to test the validity of this value based on pce distribution within the study area this technique involved the use of a cumulative probability graph to identify an inflection point 3 1 μg l considered as a threshold value and distinguish an upper or anomalous data set from a lower or background set fig s3 in the supplementary material after setting the boundary and initial conditions pce fate and transport modelling over a 40 year period was simulated through the mt3dms code zheng 2010 using a quasi steady state solution of the contaminant transport equation this assumption was found appropriate to simulate the diffuse pollution resulting from the constant low grade dispersion of pce occurring since more than 60 years dating back to the high paced industrialization that started in the region in the mid 50 s 3 4 model calibration and application of the nsmc stochastic approach the implementation of model calibration and the evaluation of parameter uncertainty were addressed by using the pest software suite doherty 2020 a total number of 452 pilot points were distributed over the first layer according to a regular grid with a spacing of 500 m between each pilot point neglecting areas occupied by dry cells fig 3 the pilot points served to parameterise the mass discharge through spatial interpolation of the pilot point values in all the cells in the first layer hence all these cells represent potential sources of pce the interpolation has been performed by using the kriging method expressing the spatial structure of the mass discharge by an exponential variogram a significantly wide range of pce concentration was attributed to each pilot point in order to avoid any constraint during the generation of the stochastic parameter realisations pest was asked to estimate for all pilot points an optimal value of mass discharge concentration in the range between 0 001 to 100 000 µg l for each concentration target containing a synthetic observation specific weights were assigned as a function of the spatial density of the monitoring wells doherty and hunt 2010 thus increasing weights were associated with concentrations data in wells that are isolated or more sparsely distributed whereas lower weights were attributed to concentration values in densely clustered wells this criterion prevents the underrepresentation of observed concentrations pertaining to sparse wells due to the presence of clusters of wells with homogeneous observed concentrations moreover the concentration values were log transformed in order to reduce their high variation range and avoid observations with small values being under represented in the measurement of the objective function the high dimensionality of the optimization problem i e 452 pilot points and the transport model run time required an unbearable total runtime hence the svd assist method as implemented in pest has been applied this method reduces the problem dimensionality by rewriting it in terms of the so called super parameters or linear combinations of native parameters i e mass influx values as represented by pilot points calculated from the jacobian matrix of parameter sensitivities the number of super parameters required to achieve a good fit between field measurements and corresponding model outputs is equal to the dimensions of the calibration solution space which are considerably less than the dimensions of the parameter space defined by native parameters doherty 2020 this number has been calculated using a utility of the pest suite called supcalc doherty 2018 based on the covariance matrix of pre calibration parameter uncertainty 100 stochastic parameter realisations were generated and then modified through null space projection as described in par 3 1 the utilities that were employed are described in doherty et al 2010 as done in previous studies e g alberti et al 2018b colombo et al 2020b the objective function achieved at the end of the calibration process of the deterministic transport model was set as target objective function value for all the alternative models built with each parameter realisation thus each stochastic parameter set was subjected to a recalibration process based on two optimisation iterations only the parameter set that provided objective function values below the target objective function value were retained in the last stage of the study the multiple stochastic realisations of mass discharge were statistically analysed the mass discharge values of all realisations were aggregated for every first layer cell and the sets corresponding to the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of the mass discharge were determined these statistical parameters were used as variables in the k means cluster analysis macqueen 1967 to identify relatively homogenous groups of cells by defining the k number of clusters in advance the k means clustering algorithm uses an iterative process to partition a dataset in such a way that the sum of the squared euclidean distance between each data point and the nearest cluster s centroid i e mean value of all the data points that belong to that cluster is minimised at the end of this procedure the data are clustered into different groups and data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to data points in other clusters in this study the k means cluster analysis was performed to accurately delineate the zones that are more likely to contain a source of diffuse contamination based on the selected statistical parameters the analysis procedure is described in the workflow illustrated in fig 4 4 results 4 1 calibration results the calibration of the inverse problem was achieved through tikhonov regularisation and svd svd assist was also employed to render the problem solvable by reducing its dimensionality to a value similar to that of the calibration solution space a total of 334 super parameters linear combinations of native parameters were estimated from a qualitative point of view the comparison between the map resulting from the calibrated deterministic transport model fig 5 b and the map obtained from the synthetic transport model fig 2a suggests a good correspondence in terms of pce distribution to better diagnose the error associated with each concentration target and verify the level of the calibration results specific statistical parameters were computed anderson and woessner 1992 and reported in table 1 a general description of model bias is provided by the residual mean whose low value 0 03 µg l in the present case may indicate that the model fit is not biased more robust indicators of model fit are represented by the absolute residual mean and by the root mean squared error which provided values equal to 0 59 µg l and 0 96 µg l respectively suggesting a good match between the simulated values and the calibration targets moreover both the residual standard deviation and its ratio to the overall range in target values show values below 10 which is typically assumed as a threshold for deeming a model calibration level as acceptable anderson and woessner 1992 khandri and pande 2016 the performance of the calibration process was also assessed by plotting the observed concentration target values versus the values computed by the model as shown in fig 5c most of the points fall along a line with a slope of 45 reflecting a good correspondence between the field data and the simulated values the coefficient of determination r2 provides a value of 0 85 which we deem satisfactory considering all the uncertainties that affect our model as well as all transport models to investigate the spatial distribution of model error a map representing both the location and magnitude of the residuals was generated fig 5a this map highlights that most field observations have small errors with respect to their simulated counterparts on the other hand some concentration targets are excessively under estimated blue dots in the central sector of the study area or over estimated red dots in the western sector of the study area by the model some high residuals appear to be clustered in specific areas such as underestimated concentrations in the upper portion of the domain 4 2 nsmc stochastic analysis a total of 100 random stochastic realisations of solute mass discharge were generated and re calibrated to match the observations with an objective function equal or less than that of the first calibrated model the final objective function achieved by all realisations is shown in fig 6 all the stochastic realisations of the mass discharge field were collected into a single table in such a way that 100 different plausible values of mass discharge were attributed to each individual cell representing a potential source of diffuse pollution by defining the statistical distribution of the mass discharge for each single cell the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of mass discharge were determined and mapped at the cell scale fig 7 a d the minimum set was selected for a conservative assessment of the areas that are more likely to contain a source of contamination the mean maximum and standard deviation sets served to investigate both the variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values in each cell the minimum map fig 7a displayed that the central western and north eastern parts of the study area are characterised by relatively high minimum values of mass discharge ranging from 0 6 to 1 5 g d and in some portions from 1 6 to 5 0 g d in the western and north western sectors some cells show mass discharge values even exceeding 10 0 g d since these zones are located close to dry cells north western sector or to the model domain boundary western sector they may be affected by a bias a first qualitative comparison between the minimum and the mean maximum and standard deviation maps revealed that some areas are characterised by an extremely wide variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values this can be clearly observed in the southern and south eastern portions of the study area where some cells showed minimum mass discharge values between 0 and 0 5 g d fig 7a mean values between 1 6 and 5 0 g d fig 7c maximum values even higher than 10 0 g d fig 7b and consequently a standard deviation above 10 0 g d fig 7d on the other hand the comparison between the maps in fig 7 highlighted that some areas are characterised by a narrower range of variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values for instance the cells located in the central and northern parts of the study area displayed mass discharge values ranging between 0 and 0 5 g d in the minimum mean and maximum maps reflecting a very low degree of dispersion as expressed by the low standard deviation 0 1 g d to better discriminate the potential source zones accounting for the variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values in each cell the k means cluster analysis was performed afifi et al 2003 azzellino et al 2019 everitt et al 2011 based on the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of the mass discharge the k means clustering algorithm led to partitioning the cells into three different clusters fig 8 a b cluster 1 contains cells with the highest variation and dispersion values of mass discharge this group of cells is characterised by an average minimum value of 0 22 g d an average maximum value of 3 91 g d and an average standard deviation of 0 62 g d the minimum varies from 3 33 10 2 to 0 56 g d while the maximum ranges between 0 30 and 118 58 g d accordingly cluster 1 contains both potential source areas and areas not contributing to pce contamination this can also be observed in fig 9 where the spatial distribution of cluster 1 is compared with the spatial distribution of the minimum mean and maximum values of mass discharge fig 9a d and g cluster 2 contains cells with high minimum mass discharge values the average minimum value is 1 01 g d and with extremely high mean and maximum values the average mean and maximum values are 1 72 and 3 28 g d respectively the minimum varies between 0 18 and 122 69 g d while the maximum ranges between 0 60 and 376 43 g d conversely cluster 3 contains cells characterised by very low minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of mass discharge the average value for the minimum is 0 09 g d the average values for the mean and maximum are 0 13 and 0 23 respectively and the average standard deviation is 0 03 g d the minimum ranges from 5 83 10 4 to 0 28 g d whereas the maximum varies from 2 18 10 3 to 1 60 g d overall the results indicate that cluster 2 identifies the areas that most likely host a source zone while cluster 3 includes areas that may reasonably be considered not responsible for diffuse pollution as represented in fig 9 the cells belonging to cluster 2 correspond to the potential source zones already delineated by the map of minimum values fig 9b whereas cluster 3 includes areas in which even the maximum simulated values entail the release of a small contaminant mass fig 9i 5 discussion in this study the problem of groundwater diffuse pollution which affects many highly urbanised regions worldwide was addressed for the first time by exploring the uncertainty associated with the contaminant mass discharge given the high complexity of the diffuse pollution phenomenon and of the inverse method applied to solute transport models the performance of the proposed methodology was tested by artificially creating a situation widespread contamination by chlorinated solvents the use of a synthetic deterministic transport model was found as an effective solution to gain a deeper understanding of both the reliability and limitations of the proposed methodology the magnitude of model to measurements fit errors and the comparison between the calibrated deterministic transport model with the synthetic transport model revealed a reasonable and acceptable correspondence between the simulated and observed pce concentrations the calibrated deterministic transport model served as starting point for the implementation of the nsmc stochastic analysis and the generation of the multiple random realisations of mass discharge these stochastic parameter sets all of which are hydrogeologically plausible and reproduce the calibration dataset were used to investigate the statistical distribution of the mass discharge field for each cell representing a potential source zone by determining the sets reflecting the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation of the mass discharge it was possible to map the areas associated with the major contribution in terms of mass release the most critical areas are those characterised by relatively high minimum mass values that achieve even higher values in the mean and maximum maps showing low values of standard deviation fig 7a d these areas also correspond to those delineated by the cluster 2 which overlaps with the most impacting source zones in the synthetic transport model such as the southwestern sector and the small portions in the centre of the study area fig s3 in the supplementary material in addition to the cluster 2 the cluster analysis allowed to group the cells reflecting a very high dispersion and variability of the mass discharge these cells which belong to cluster 1 identified areas that could be either not involved in contaminant mass release or responsible for widespread pollution finally the cluster 3 delineated areas characterised by very low mass discharge values in the minimum map as well as in the mean and maximum maps this might suggest that these areas did not significantly contribute to generating diffuse contamination the identification of the potential source zones derived from the stochastic analysis on the mass discharge fields and the cluster classification provided key information on the areas that would need to be prioritised in terms of environmental investigations in the present case an enhancement of the monitoring network would be appropriate within the sectors delineated by the clusters 2 and 1 representing the areas that are more likely to contain sources and the areas with the highest degree of uncertainty respectively although the nsmc stochastic method produced promising results it is important to highlight that the application of the inverse approach to solute transport models is particularly complex and suffers from a significant degree of uncertainty associated with multiple sources carrera et al 1988 tiedeman and hill 2007 the main critical aspects include i the scarcity of concentration observations at least compared to head observations that makes the simulation of transport model dependant variables such as concentrations normally more challenging than modelling flow model dependant variables such as hydraulic heads ii the inaccuracy of numerical solutions of transport equation that can negatively affect parameter estimation iii the differences between the real and simulated systems that can generate much greater differences between computed and observed transport parameters than between computed and observed flow parameters iv the effect of uncertain parameters hydraulic conductivity amongst all v the uncertainty associated with the release history e g start time continuity and duration of each source and the evolution of the pollutant e g biodegradation or natural attenuation processes amongst the aspect mentioned above the latter becomes even more critical when dealing with groundwater diffuse pollution phenomena in fact as time passes widespread pollution can overlap and or interact with single medium high concentration plumes making the former difficult to characterise 6 conclusions groundwater diffuse pollution is one of the most insidious threats to the quality of the aquifers beneath densely urbanised areas amongst the different contaminants chlorinated solvents such as pce represent the most common example of long standing and persistent pollution in groundwater locating the sources responsible for widespread contamination is a mandatory first step to reclaim them and restore a good groundwater quality level the application of the inverse approach based on the nsmc stochastic method to investigate the uncertainty of the mass discharge field offers new insights to the problem of aquifer diffuse pollution the maps derived from the analysis could be used by decision makers and public authorities as an advanced support tool i to gain a deeper knowledge on the potential areas that cause groundwater diffuse pollution ii to locate zones that require to be prioritised in terms of environmental monitoring and iii to plan more effective actions for the containment and mitigation of the widespread pollution problem the complexity of both diffuse contamination phenomena and solute transport processes poses a major challenge to the reliability of the results in a real world context which could suffer from the uncertainty due for instance to the continuity and duration of each source as well as to the occurrence of attenuation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16921,in heavily urbanised areas groundwater diffuse pollution is recognised as one of the most insidious threats to groundwater quality diffuse pollution originates from multiple small sources releasing a low contaminant mass over a relatively large area the lack of a defined plume in groundwater the limited leaked mass and the fact that leakage may have occurred in the past and be now ceased make these sources difficult to locate and characterise in addressing this environmental issue an inverse approach based on the null space monte carlo stochastic method has been applied in the framework of an innovative methodology with the aim to locate potential source areas distributed in a large 120 km2 urban area to simplify the problem and better understand the limitations and effectiveness of the proposed methodology the analysis has been performed using a groundwater model with fixed i e determined by a previous calibration hydraulic conductivity and flow boundary conditions the only source of uncertainty considered in the study is the pce mass discharge from all model cells of the topmost layer after implementing and calibrating a deterministic solute transport model multiple random realisations of mass discharge fields were generated all of which are history match constrained and hydrogeologically plausible the obtained stochastic parameter sets were used to investigate the statistical distribution of the solute mass discharge and map the areas that are more likely to host unknown sources of pce although the application of the nsmc stochastic method on the synthetic case study has provided promising results it has also highlighted that multiple sources of uncertainty e g continuity and duration of each source attenuation processes could adversely affect the reliability of the results in a real world context in which the effect of other uncertain parameters hydraulic conductivity amongst all would need to be considered in addition this study offers new insights to the problem of aquifer diffuse pollution by providing key information on the potential source zones and on the areas that urgently need to be prioritised for further investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stochastic analysis uncertainty mass discharge pce groundwater diffuse pollution 1 introduction globally the levels of urbanisation have been rising rapidly amongst all the countries since 1950 and are expected to continue to increase unabated in 2018 about 55 3 of the world s population lived in urban areas with a projected increase to 68 4 by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 together with the growth of urban dwellers and the associated industrial and commercial activities the role played by groundwater has gained an increasing importance groundwater beneath urban agglomerates constitutes an essential source of freshwater available for human agricultural and industrial purposes and contributes to the socio economic development of the cities nevertheless as urban population and activities grow groundwater resources become significantly stressed by the increasing demand for safe drinking water supply in densely urbanised areas the qualitative status of aquifers can be compromised by a myriad of potential sources of pollution amongst which multiple point sources mps alberti et al 2018a represent the most serious threat mps indicate a series of small and uncontrolled point sources that release a low contaminant mass over a relatively large area generating a diffuse groundwater pollution parker and foster 1986 alberti et al 2018a in italy diffuse contamination is defined by the legislative decree 152 2006 as the chemical physical and biological alteration of environmental matrices and contaminations determined by diffuse sources and not linked to a point source environmental ministry of italy 2006 mps can contribute to make an entire aquifer unsuitable for drinking by increasing contaminant concentrations to levels just above drinking water quality standards howard and gelo 2002 another characteristic of aquifer diffuse pollution is that it can be attributable to recent as well as to historical inputs which adversely affected groundwater quality in the past and still deteriorate it today even if these sources are no longer active e g industrial districts currently dismantled rivett 2012 given the insidious and long term nature of diffuse contamination mps are difficult to identify and cannot be remediated with the traditional remedial strategies environmental agency and water services are in urgent need of methods to locate the unknown sources which is the first step to interrupt their effects on groundwater quality in the last years some studies have attempted to set up effective methods for the assessment of groundwater diffuse pollution through gis based statistical techniques pollicino et al 2019 multivariate statistic azzellino et al 2019 and numerical models coupled with a stochastic approach alberti et al 2018a this latter method has been applied by the mentioned authors using the pest software suite doherty 2020 regularisation methods were applied to calculate the solution of minimum error variance to the underdetermined model doherty 2003 then a null space monte carlo nsmc stochastic analysis was performed to generate multiple history match constrained parameter fields and explore the effect of parameter uncertainty on model predictions keating et al 2010 tonkin and doherty 2009 although nsmc is acquiring an ever increasing interest in the hydrogeological field most of the studies are focused on exploring the uncertainty tied to flow parameters e g herckenrath et al 2011 moeck et al 2020 moges et al 2020 also using particle tracking instead of solute transport under the assumption that uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity surrogates for uncertainty in dispersivity formentin et al 2019 while a considerable effort has been devoted to the application of inverse methods to groundwater flow models the number of works dealing with the estimation and uncertainty of solute transport parameters is very limited in the last decades some studies developed a monte carlo stochastic analysis of solute mass discharge li et al 2007 schwede and cirpka 2010 also investigating its interaction with heterogeneities of hydrogeological properties and release conditions at source zone ciriello and de barros 2020 de barros et al 2018 koch and nowak 2015 in this work the uncertainty in the estimation of mass discharge has been quantified to address the problem of groundwater diffuse contamination and delineate the areas that potentially host an unknown pce source the stochastic analysis has been performed within the densely urbanised and industrialised north eastern sector of the milan functional urban area fua already used in other works as a pilot area for the application of statistical and stochastic methods to assess groundwater tetrachloroethylene pce pollution e g azzellino et al 2019 pizzol et al 2015 pollicino et al 2021 this area is significantly affected by a long standing groundwater widespread pollution which overlaps with the plumes originating from hot spots or well defined high impact point sources monitored concentrations over a period of more than 15 years arpa lombardia 2015 colombo et al 2020a show that diffuse component of pce pollution is particularly stable in time this is probably due to the low solubility of pce as well as to a slow and steady release of low concentrations from long term underground sources starting from the transport model previously developed by alberti et al 2016a and alberti 2018b a diffuse pollution scenario was artificially created by the simulation of fictitious source zones which were active 40 years ago in the view of assessing diffuse pollution for the first time by exploring the uncertainty of the solute mass discharge field the use of a synthetic case study served to simplify the problem and offered some advantages amongst these it served to gain a major control over the initial conditions of the transport model i e initial concentrations contribution of the sources and over the release time of the sources 2 study area the study area is located in the lombardy region northern italy and covers an area of approximately 120 km2 together with the milan city and some surrounding municipalities it belongs to the so called milan functional urban area fua known as one of the most heavily urbanised and industrialised areas in europe the territory is drained by a dense hydrographic system which comprises the seveso and lambro rivers as well as the villoresi and naviglio martesana irrigation channels fig 1 the milan subsoil is composed of sediments belonging to the continental depositional system of plio pleistocenic age irsa cnr 1981 lombardia and eni divisione 2002 overlying a marine depositional sequence the sedimentary succession hosts a multilayer alluvial aquifer of great importance for the public agricultural and industrial water supply four hydrogeological units called aquifer groups a b c and d from the top to the bottom of the sequence can be distinguished bini 1997 lombardia and eni divisione 2002 fig 1 the aquifer group a is mainly constituted by gravel and sand and identify the unconfined shallow aquifer it has an average thickness of 60 m and is characterised by high values of both hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 to 10 3 m s and transmissivity usually higher than 10 2 m2 s the aquifer group a is separated from the underlying aquifer group b by a clay silty layer of variable thickness which pinches out northward leading aquifer groups a and b to be hydraulically interconnected gorla et al 2016 sacchi et al 2013 the aquifer group b is mainly composed of coarse to fine sand with several silty clay lenses and hosts a semi confined aquifer it has an average thickness of 40 50 m and is characterised by a lower hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 5 to 10 4 m s and transmissivity varying from 10 3 to 10 2 m2 s with respect to the aquifer group a finally the aquifer groups c and d identify the deepest confined aquifers mainly constituted by sandy silty clay with interbedded fine and very fine sand the groundwater flow is generally orientated n s and the water table depth decreases from nw to se pilla et al 2006 the recharge areas for the multilayer aquifer are located in the alpine foothills but the phreatic aquifer is also significantly recharged by direct infiltration of precipitation seepages of the irrigation channels and losses of the water network within the milan urban area which roughly correspond to 15 of the total water supply alberti et al 2016b the climate is classified as temperate continental mean annual temperature about 13 c mean precipitation about 900 mm with spring and autumn being characterised by the greatest precipitation this study focuses on the quality deterioration of the unconfined shallow aquifer identified by the aquifer group a and the portion of the aquifer group b hydraulically connected to the shallow aquifer northern sector of the study area organo halogenated compounds were first detected in the shallow aquifer in 1975 when evidence of pce contamination was found in several water supply zones in milan berbenni et al 1993 cavallaro et al 1985 giovanardi 1979 since then they have become the major cause of groundwater diffuse pollution in densely industrialised and urbanised areas such as the area of interest milano 1992 although the contamination originated from industrial processes active in the past these substances still threaten the quality of groundwater today colombo et al 2020a in the study area the problem of historical widespread pollution is so persistent and dangerous that a huge part of sesto san giovanni which hosted important steel industries throughout the 1900s has been classified as site of national interest sin for environmental remediation by the italian legislation 3 materials and method 3 1 regularisation and null space monte carlo model calibration is the process whereby model parameters are adjusted to achieve an optimal fit between model outputs and field measurements moore and doherty 2006 more specifically the goal of the calibration process is to minimise an objective function which is the weighted sum of squared residuals and represents a least squares estimate of the fit between observations and their simulated counterparts tonkin and doherty 2009 this is called measurement objective function to distinguish it from the regularization objective function described below it follows that the concept of calibration infers parameter uniqueness even in problems where the model parameters representing the hydraulic properties of a heterogeneous and complex hydrogeological system must be estimated from a limited set of field observations affected by measurement noise in such problems referred as ill posed inverse or underdetermined problems uniqueness in solution is achieved using mathematical regularisation this indicates a general class of methods that provide stability and uniqueness to underdetermined models by adding constraints of structure or a preferred condition to the parameters being estimated doherty et al 2010 two methods were employed in this study tikhonov regularisation and singular value decomposition svd tikhonov regularisation is practically implemented by supplying information about parameters that require calibration the information that is input derives from soft knowledge or expert knowledge meaning that it does not derive from direct measurement but from interpretation or conceptual modelling by an expert svd is a linear algebra procedure that rewrites the inverse problem equations in such way that the most important parameters in calibration can be separated by those parameters that are not informed by the calibration dataset and as such cannot be uniquely estimated these latter parameters and their uncertainties can only be estimated by expert knowledge and are usually not modified during the calibration retaining their initial values christensen and doherty 2008 the application of regularization techniques in conjunction with the null space monte carlo method nsmc tonkin and doherty 2009 keating et al 2010 is functional in exploring the uncertainty associated with parameter calibration the purpose of the nsmc analysis is to generate multiple parameter field realisations that express parameter variability while being history match constrained the nsmc analysis is performed according to the following procedure the model undergoes a first calibration in which regularisation allows to obtain a set of parameters p that yields a solution of minimum error variance to the inverse problem doherty 2003 sepúlveda and doherty 2015 the following equation 1 h x p ε describes the relationship between the calibration dataset represented by the array h which includes field observations of system properties constituting the elements of parameter array p on which the jacobian matrix x acts matrix x contains the sensitivity of the simulated equivalent of each measurement with respect to each parameter whereas ε indicates measurement error i e noise a parameter covariance matrix c p is defined based on prior assumptions on parameter uncertainty this matrix is used to generate multiple 100 in the present case random stochastic realisations of parameter values whose solution space projections are close to the parameter field achieved through model calibration p but whose null space projections are variable in accordance with a prior knowledge of system properties burrows and doherty 2015 the calibrated parameter field p is subtracted from each of the stochastically generated parameter sets p and the difference between p and p is then projected onto the calibration null space thus forming the vector p p the covariance matrix associated with the vector p p is derived from the following equation 2 c p p v 2 v 2 t c p v 2 v 2 t where the vectors composing the columns of the v2 matrix span the calibration null space this being obtained through truncated singular value decomposition svd of q1 2x where q is the observation weight matrix and x is the jacobian matrix 4 null and solution space projection of each stochastic parameter set is then undertaken the null space component of the parameter field is retained whereas the solution space component of the stochastically generated parameter sets is removed and replaced by that pertaining to the calibrated parameter field p herckenrath et al 2011 however model nonlinearity and the indistinct boundary between solution and null spaces lead to a degradation in the level of model to measurements fit resulting in an almost calibrated set of parameters doherty et al 2010 5 a limited model re calibration process is required to adjust each processed stochastic parameter set and return the model to a calibrated state ensuring that the level of model to measurement fit is in accordance with user specifications 3 2 synthetic pce concentration dataset in this study the stochastic analysis has been performed based on a synthetic scenario of groundwater diffuse pollution fig 2 b the synthetic case study as well as the stochastic modelling has been implemented using the deterministic flow and transport model already developed and described in the study by alberti et al 2016a alberti 2018b the model domain consists of 219 rows and 218 columns with a cell resolution of 50 m and is vertically discretised into three layers with layer 1 representing the aquifer group a layer 3 identifying the aquifer group b and layer 2 corresponding to the aquitard between aquifer groups a and b alberti et al 2018b fig s1 in the supplementary material the synthetic pce concentration values were generated by associating pce concentrations to surficial recharge zones fig 2a and by assigning to all the model cells an initial concentration of 3 1 µg l corresponding to the pce diffuse pollution background level estimated for the milan area and adopted by lombardy region for the remediation plan azzellino et al 2019 both the porosity 0 2 for layers 1 and 3 and 0 05 for the aquitard and the transverse dispersivity 3 m were not modified from those used in the numerical models developed in alberti et al 2016a alberti 2018b nevertheless the longitudinal dispersivity has been increased to 30 m in order to keep the peclet number below 2 and ensure numerical stability to solute transport simulation as recommended by zheng and bennett 2002 after a solute transport simulation time of 40 years the computed concentration values were extracted in correspondence of 401 monitoring wells to be employed as observations in the stochastic analysis fig 2 c d although these concentrations were synthetically created they can be considered physically based since they were generated based on the real hydrogeological setting thus they reflect the contribution of pce diffuse pollution attributable to historical anthropogenic sources of unknown position that still affect the study area today in the view of setting up and testing a new methodology to investigate a complex phenomenon such as groundwater diffuse pollution the use of a synthetic case study offered the following advantages the synthetic transport model was assumed as the truth to be compared with the results derived from the stochastic analysis to better understand both the limitations and reliability of the methodology the use of a diffuse contamination scenario produced by sources which were artificially created allowed to neglect the uncertainty associated with the start time continuity and duration of each source in releasing the contaminant mass the synthetic concentration data provided the possibility of including additional monitoring wells screening the shallow unconfined aquifer to the existing network particularly in unmonitored zones as shown in fig 2c 17 wells were added in different portions of the study area in order to enhance the monitoring network particularly in the first layer 3 3 implementation of the deterministic transport model as a first step the application of the nsmc stochastic approach required the implementation and calibration of a solute transport model this numerical model was built starting from the same flow model already used to create the synthetic case study in which the transport boundary conditions were reset and input as described later herein the synthetic concentrations previously generated were imported into the model as synthetic pce observations and at a later stage they were employed to constrain the model calibration process with pest a total number of 401 concentration targets were added at each monitoring well location 317 observations were assigned to layer 1 while the remaining 84 targets were assigned to the northern sector of layer 3 where group aquifers a and b constitute an undifferentiated unconfined aquifer to simulate the solute mass entering the aquifer system through sources the well boundary package i e neumann boundary condition was applied over the entire top model layer using a regular matrix composed of 10 815 cells with a resolution of 50 m fig 3 a specified volumetric flux qin of 10 5 m3 s and a starting concentration cin of 30 μg l were assigned to each cell of the well boundary condition representing the potential source zones the qin is consistent with estimates of the average annual recharge and its value has been kept fixed the cin is the parameter subject to the calibration process and whose variability i e uncertainty has been explored with the stochastic analysis contaminant injection from the cells representing the well boundary condition was handled by the mt3dms source sink mixing package ssm zheng 2010 as in the synthetic transport model an initial background concentration of pce equal to 3 1 μg l was applied to the transport model a statistical technique borrowed from geochemistry exploration sinclair 1974 1991 and already applied in similar case studies panno et al 2006 masetti et al 2009 was employed to test the validity of this value based on pce distribution within the study area this technique involved the use of a cumulative probability graph to identify an inflection point 3 1 μg l considered as a threshold value and distinguish an upper or anomalous data set from a lower or background set fig s3 in the supplementary material after setting the boundary and initial conditions pce fate and transport modelling over a 40 year period was simulated through the mt3dms code zheng 2010 using a quasi steady state solution of the contaminant transport equation this assumption was found appropriate to simulate the diffuse pollution resulting from the constant low grade dispersion of pce occurring since more than 60 years dating back to the high paced industrialization that started in the region in the mid 50 s 3 4 model calibration and application of the nsmc stochastic approach the implementation of model calibration and the evaluation of parameter uncertainty were addressed by using the pest software suite doherty 2020 a total number of 452 pilot points were distributed over the first layer according to a regular grid with a spacing of 500 m between each pilot point neglecting areas occupied by dry cells fig 3 the pilot points served to parameterise the mass discharge through spatial interpolation of the pilot point values in all the cells in the first layer hence all these cells represent potential sources of pce the interpolation has been performed by using the kriging method expressing the spatial structure of the mass discharge by an exponential variogram a significantly wide range of pce concentration was attributed to each pilot point in order to avoid any constraint during the generation of the stochastic parameter realisations pest was asked to estimate for all pilot points an optimal value of mass discharge concentration in the range between 0 001 to 100 000 µg l for each concentration target containing a synthetic observation specific weights were assigned as a function of the spatial density of the monitoring wells doherty and hunt 2010 thus increasing weights were associated with concentrations data in wells that are isolated or more sparsely distributed whereas lower weights were attributed to concentration values in densely clustered wells this criterion prevents the underrepresentation of observed concentrations pertaining to sparse wells due to the presence of clusters of wells with homogeneous observed concentrations moreover the concentration values were log transformed in order to reduce their high variation range and avoid observations with small values being under represented in the measurement of the objective function the high dimensionality of the optimization problem i e 452 pilot points and the transport model run time required an unbearable total runtime hence the svd assist method as implemented in pest has been applied this method reduces the problem dimensionality by rewriting it in terms of the so called super parameters or linear combinations of native parameters i e mass influx values as represented by pilot points calculated from the jacobian matrix of parameter sensitivities the number of super parameters required to achieve a good fit between field measurements and corresponding model outputs is equal to the dimensions of the calibration solution space which are considerably less than the dimensions of the parameter space defined by native parameters doherty 2020 this number has been calculated using a utility of the pest suite called supcalc doherty 2018 based on the covariance matrix of pre calibration parameter uncertainty 100 stochastic parameter realisations were generated and then modified through null space projection as described in par 3 1 the utilities that were employed are described in doherty et al 2010 as done in previous studies e g alberti et al 2018b colombo et al 2020b the objective function achieved at the end of the calibration process of the deterministic transport model was set as target objective function value for all the alternative models built with each parameter realisation thus each stochastic parameter set was subjected to a recalibration process based on two optimisation iterations only the parameter set that provided objective function values below the target objective function value were retained in the last stage of the study the multiple stochastic realisations of mass discharge were statistically analysed the mass discharge values of all realisations were aggregated for every first layer cell and the sets corresponding to the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of the mass discharge were determined these statistical parameters were used as variables in the k means cluster analysis macqueen 1967 to identify relatively homogenous groups of cells by defining the k number of clusters in advance the k means clustering algorithm uses an iterative process to partition a dataset in such a way that the sum of the squared euclidean distance between each data point and the nearest cluster s centroid i e mean value of all the data points that belong to that cluster is minimised at the end of this procedure the data are clustered into different groups and data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to data points in other clusters in this study the k means cluster analysis was performed to accurately delineate the zones that are more likely to contain a source of diffuse contamination based on the selected statistical parameters the analysis procedure is described in the workflow illustrated in fig 4 4 results 4 1 calibration results the calibration of the inverse problem was achieved through tikhonov regularisation and svd svd assist was also employed to render the problem solvable by reducing its dimensionality to a value similar to that of the calibration solution space a total of 334 super parameters linear combinations of native parameters were estimated from a qualitative point of view the comparison between the map resulting from the calibrated deterministic transport model fig 5 b and the map obtained from the synthetic transport model fig 2a suggests a good correspondence in terms of pce distribution to better diagnose the error associated with each concentration target and verify the level of the calibration results specific statistical parameters were computed anderson and woessner 1992 and reported in table 1 a general description of model bias is provided by the residual mean whose low value 0 03 µg l in the present case may indicate that the model fit is not biased more robust indicators of model fit are represented by the absolute residual mean and by the root mean squared error which provided values equal to 0 59 µg l and 0 96 µg l respectively suggesting a good match between the simulated values and the calibration targets moreover both the residual standard deviation and its ratio to the overall range in target values show values below 10 which is typically assumed as a threshold for deeming a model calibration level as acceptable anderson and woessner 1992 khandri and pande 2016 the performance of the calibration process was also assessed by plotting the observed concentration target values versus the values computed by the model as shown in fig 5c most of the points fall along a line with a slope of 45 reflecting a good correspondence between the field data and the simulated values the coefficient of determination r2 provides a value of 0 85 which we deem satisfactory considering all the uncertainties that affect our model as well as all transport models to investigate the spatial distribution of model error a map representing both the location and magnitude of the residuals was generated fig 5a this map highlights that most field observations have small errors with respect to their simulated counterparts on the other hand some concentration targets are excessively under estimated blue dots in the central sector of the study area or over estimated red dots in the western sector of the study area by the model some high residuals appear to be clustered in specific areas such as underestimated concentrations in the upper portion of the domain 4 2 nsmc stochastic analysis a total of 100 random stochastic realisations of solute mass discharge were generated and re calibrated to match the observations with an objective function equal or less than that of the first calibrated model the final objective function achieved by all realisations is shown in fig 6 all the stochastic realisations of the mass discharge field were collected into a single table in such a way that 100 different plausible values of mass discharge were attributed to each individual cell representing a potential source of diffuse pollution by defining the statistical distribution of the mass discharge for each single cell the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of mass discharge were determined and mapped at the cell scale fig 7 a d the minimum set was selected for a conservative assessment of the areas that are more likely to contain a source of contamination the mean maximum and standard deviation sets served to investigate both the variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values in each cell the minimum map fig 7a displayed that the central western and north eastern parts of the study area are characterised by relatively high minimum values of mass discharge ranging from 0 6 to 1 5 g d and in some portions from 1 6 to 5 0 g d in the western and north western sectors some cells show mass discharge values even exceeding 10 0 g d since these zones are located close to dry cells north western sector or to the model domain boundary western sector they may be affected by a bias a first qualitative comparison between the minimum and the mean maximum and standard deviation maps revealed that some areas are characterised by an extremely wide variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values this can be clearly observed in the southern and south eastern portions of the study area where some cells showed minimum mass discharge values between 0 and 0 5 g d fig 7a mean values between 1 6 and 5 0 g d fig 7c maximum values even higher than 10 0 g d fig 7b and consequently a standard deviation above 10 0 g d fig 7d on the other hand the comparison between the maps in fig 7 highlighted that some areas are characterised by a narrower range of variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values for instance the cells located in the central and northern parts of the study area displayed mass discharge values ranging between 0 and 0 5 g d in the minimum mean and maximum maps reflecting a very low degree of dispersion as expressed by the low standard deviation 0 1 g d to better discriminate the potential source zones accounting for the variation and dispersion of the mass discharge values in each cell the k means cluster analysis was performed afifi et al 2003 azzellino et al 2019 everitt et al 2011 based on the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of the mass discharge the k means clustering algorithm led to partitioning the cells into three different clusters fig 8 a b cluster 1 contains cells with the highest variation and dispersion values of mass discharge this group of cells is characterised by an average minimum value of 0 22 g d an average maximum value of 3 91 g d and an average standard deviation of 0 62 g d the minimum varies from 3 33 10 2 to 0 56 g d while the maximum ranges between 0 30 and 118 58 g d accordingly cluster 1 contains both potential source areas and areas not contributing to pce contamination this can also be observed in fig 9 where the spatial distribution of cluster 1 is compared with the spatial distribution of the minimum mean and maximum values of mass discharge fig 9a d and g cluster 2 contains cells with high minimum mass discharge values the average minimum value is 1 01 g d and with extremely high mean and maximum values the average mean and maximum values are 1 72 and 3 28 g d respectively the minimum varies between 0 18 and 122 69 g d while the maximum ranges between 0 60 and 376 43 g d conversely cluster 3 contains cells characterised by very low minimum mean maximum and standard deviation values of mass discharge the average value for the minimum is 0 09 g d the average values for the mean and maximum are 0 13 and 0 23 respectively and the average standard deviation is 0 03 g d the minimum ranges from 5 83 10 4 to 0 28 g d whereas the maximum varies from 2 18 10 3 to 1 60 g d overall the results indicate that cluster 2 identifies the areas that most likely host a source zone while cluster 3 includes areas that may reasonably be considered not responsible for diffuse pollution as represented in fig 9 the cells belonging to cluster 2 correspond to the potential source zones already delineated by the map of minimum values fig 9b whereas cluster 3 includes areas in which even the maximum simulated values entail the release of a small contaminant mass fig 9i 5 discussion in this study the problem of groundwater diffuse pollution which affects many highly urbanised regions worldwide was addressed for the first time by exploring the uncertainty associated with the contaminant mass discharge given the high complexity of the diffuse pollution phenomenon and of the inverse method applied to solute transport models the performance of the proposed methodology was tested by artificially creating a situation widespread contamination by chlorinated solvents the use of a synthetic deterministic transport model was found as an effective solution to gain a deeper understanding of both the reliability and limitations of the proposed methodology the magnitude of model to measurements fit errors and the comparison between the calibrated deterministic transport model with the synthetic transport model revealed a reasonable and acceptable correspondence between the simulated and observed pce concentrations the calibrated deterministic transport model served as starting point for the implementation of the nsmc stochastic analysis and the generation of the multiple random realisations of mass discharge these stochastic parameter sets all of which are hydrogeologically plausible and reproduce the calibration dataset were used to investigate the statistical distribution of the mass discharge field for each cell representing a potential source zone by determining the sets reflecting the minimum mean maximum and standard deviation of the mass discharge it was possible to map the areas associated with the major contribution in terms of mass release the most critical areas are those characterised by relatively high minimum mass values that achieve even higher values in the mean and maximum maps showing low values of standard deviation fig 7a d these areas also correspond to those delineated by the cluster 2 which overlaps with the most impacting source zones in the synthetic transport model such as the southwestern sector and the small portions in the centre of the study area fig s3 in the supplementary material in addition to the cluster 2 the cluster analysis allowed to group the cells reflecting a very high dispersion and variability of the mass discharge these cells which belong to cluster 1 identified areas that could be either not involved in contaminant mass release or responsible for widespread pollution finally the cluster 3 delineated areas characterised by very low mass discharge values in the minimum map as well as in the mean and maximum maps this might suggest that these areas did not significantly contribute to generating diffuse contamination the identification of the potential source zones derived from the stochastic analysis on the mass discharge fields and the cluster classification provided key information on the areas that would need to be prioritised in terms of environmental investigations in the present case an enhancement of the monitoring network would be appropriate within the sectors delineated by the clusters 2 and 1 representing the areas that are more likely to contain sources and the areas with the highest degree of uncertainty respectively although the nsmc stochastic method produced promising results it is important to highlight that the application of the inverse approach to solute transport models is particularly complex and suffers from a significant degree of uncertainty associated with multiple sources carrera et al 1988 tiedeman and hill 2007 the main critical aspects include i the scarcity of concentration observations at least compared to head observations that makes the simulation of transport model dependant variables such as concentrations normally more challenging than modelling flow model dependant variables such as hydraulic heads ii the inaccuracy of numerical solutions of transport equation that can negatively affect parameter estimation iii the differences between the real and simulated systems that can generate much greater differences between computed and observed transport parameters than between computed and observed flow parameters iv the effect of uncertain parameters hydraulic conductivity amongst all v the uncertainty associated with the release history e g start time continuity and duration of each source and the evolution of the pollutant e g biodegradation or natural attenuation processes amongst the aspect mentioned above the latter becomes even more critical when dealing with groundwater diffuse pollution phenomena in fact as time passes widespread pollution can overlap and or interact with single medium high concentration plumes making the former difficult to characterise 6 conclusions groundwater diffuse pollution is one of the most insidious threats to the quality of the aquifers beneath densely urbanised areas amongst the different contaminants chlorinated solvents such as pce represent the most common example of long standing and persistent pollution in groundwater locating the sources responsible for widespread contamination is a mandatory first step to reclaim them and restore a good groundwater quality level the application of the inverse approach based on the nsmc stochastic method to investigate the uncertainty of the mass discharge field offers new insights to the problem of aquifer diffuse pollution the maps derived from the analysis could be used by decision makers and public authorities as an advanced support tool i to gain a deeper knowledge on the potential areas that cause groundwater diffuse pollution ii to locate zones that require to be prioritised in terms of environmental monitoring and iii to plan more effective actions for the containment and mitigation of the widespread pollution problem the complexity of both diffuse contamination phenomena and solute transport processes poses a major challenge to the reliability of the results in a real world context which could suffer from the uncertainty due for instance to the continuity and duration of each source as well as to the occurrence of attenuation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16922,ozonation is increasingly applied in water and wastewater treatment for the abatement of micropollutants mps however the transformation products formed during ozonation otps and their fate in biological or sorptive post treatments is largely unknown in this project a high throughput approach combining laboratory ozonation experiments and detection by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms was developed and applied to identify otps formed during ozonation of wastewater effluent for a large number of relevant mps total 87 for the laboratory ozonation experiments a simplified experimental solution consisting of surrogate organic matter methanol and acetate was created which produced ozonation conditions similar to realistic conditions in terms of ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures the 87 selected parent mps were divided into 19 mixtures which enabled the identification of otps with an optimized number of experiments the following two approaches were considered to identify otps 1 a screening of lc hr ms signal formation in these experiments was performed and revealed a list of 1749 potential otp candidate signals associated to 70 parent mps this list can be used in future suspect screening studies 2 a screening was performed for signals that were formed in both batch experiments and in samples of wastewater treatment plants wwtps this second approach was ultimately more time efficient and was applied to four different wwtps with ozonation specific ozone doses in the range 0 23 0 55 go3 gdoc leading to the identification of 84 relevant otps of 40 parent mps in wastewater effluent chemical structures could be proposed for 83 otps through the interpretation of ms ms spectra and expert knowledge in ozone chemistry forty eight otps 58 have not been reported previously the fate of the verified otps was studied in different post treatment steps during sand filtration 87 89 of the otps were stable in granular activated carbon gac filters otps were abated with decreasing efficiency with increasing run times of the filters for example in a gac filter with 16 000 bed volumes 53 of the otps were abated while in a gac filter with 35 000 bed volumes 40 of the otps were abated the highest abatement 87 of otps was observed when 13 mg l powdered activated carbon pac was dosed onto a sand filter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone granular activated carbon powdered activated carbon sand filter micropollutants structure elucidation 1 introduction oxidative treatment such as ozonation has been applied in water treatment for decades traditionally ozone based technologies were mainly applied for disinfection of drinking waters but since the 1990s the possibility to simultaneously abate micropollutants mps mainly with ozone or ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops involving oh radicals oh has gained importance von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the same processes are currently being evaluated and increasingly applied for enhanced treatment of municipal wastewater effluents von gunten 2018 while initially the abatement of parent compounds was the sole goal of such treatments the fact that mps are not mineralized during reactions with ozone and or oh but largely unknown transformation products are formed required a paradigm shift von gunten 2003 2018 in previous studies in vitro bioassays revealed significantly reduced ecotoxicological effects after ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents margot et al 2013 and it has been shown that the formed transformation products have lower biological activity e g antimicrobial estrogenic or herbicidal activity compared to the parent compounds lee and von gunten 2016 however some studies showed an increased toxicity after ozonation magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 and it is unknown to what extent transformation products from mps or by products formed during oxidation of matrix components i e dissolved organic matter dom are involved in these observations lee and von gunten 2016 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2014 mestankova et al 2012 von gunten 2018 fortunately increased ozonation induced toxicity is often abated during biological post treatment stalter et al 2010 since assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc which is formed during ozonation is usually well degraded in the biological post treatment it can be assumed that a significant portion of the induced toxicity is related to compounds contributing to these bulk parameters zimmermann et al 2011 in analogy to aoc or bdoc it is often assumed that ozonation transformation products otps are well biodegradable however this and their potential contribution to the increased toxicity are still largely unknown therefore it is recommended to test the feasibility of ozonation at a specific wwtp before its installation with a test procedure including chemical and ecotoxicological parameters schindler wildhaber et al 2015 based on general knowledge of ozone chemistry otps resulting from the reaction of ozone with certain structural moieties can be predicted based on their reactivity in systems where only ozone is considered lee et al 2017 however under realistic conditions ozone decomposes to oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which concurrently react less selectively with the mps or with the otps formed from the direct reaction with ozone complicating the prediction of otps typically liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms is applied for the identification of otps otps can be elucidated in laboratory experiments often in combination with expert knowledge and or model predictions lee et al 2017 von gunten 2018 however the elucidation of otps of single substances is very labor intensive and therefore data remain scarce carbajo et al 2015 christophoridis et al 2016 knopp et al 2016 rodayan et al 2014 rosal et al 2009 moreover otps that are elucidated in laboratory experiments at specific ozone exposures in the absence of oh reactions might not occur or occur in different yields in real water matrices because of the contribution of oh to product formation acero et al 2000 kamath et al 2018 stefan and bolton 1998 stefan et al 2000 for example during ozonation of secondary effluent at wwtp neugut with 2 mg l ozone a yield of about 40 of chlorothiazide from the transformation of hydrochlorothiazide was observed while in laboratory experiments where oh were scavenged the yield of chlorothiazide was 80 borowska et al 2016 different otps may be favored in realistic samples with varying types and concentrations of dom determining the ozone and oh exposures compared to laboratory experiments performed in absence of oh ozone and oh exposure at a dissolved organic carbon doc normalized ozone dose together with the rate constants for the reactions of selected mps with ozone and oh were found to be key parameters to predict the abatement efficiency of the mps during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents lee et al 2013 non target analysis with lc hr ms ms can be used to screen for peaks that appear after ozonation in laboratory pilot or full scale studies brunner et al 2020 gago ferrero et al 2015 itzel et al 2020 krauss et al 2010 phungsai et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 schollée et al 2021b however with this approach it is very difficult to assign chemical structures to transformation product candidates and to relate transformation products to their parent mps it is also challenging to differentiate between the otps arising from the reaction of ozone with mps and those that are formed as oxidation by products from the water matrix components furthermore it is not easily predictable how stable the formed products are when the oxidants are depleted and what their fate is in biological post treatment processes which typically follow an ozonation process hübner et al 2015 overall there is an important knowledge gap related to the formation of otps during ozonation and their fate during post treatment in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents the goal of this study was to identify otps that are formed during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent from a large number of mps and to assess their fate in different post treatments a novel method was developed that enables an efficient and reliable identification of relevant otps formed during ozonation of mps including the elucidation of their chemical structures to identify otps laboratory ozonation batch experiments were performed in simulated water matrices with similar ozone and oh exposures as in wastewater samples with smart mixtures of mps that enabled backtracking of parent mps without needing an individual experiment for each mp in parallel wastewater samples were collected from four wwtps equipped with ozonation in full or pilot scale and different post treatment technologies namely sand filtration granular activated carbon gac filtration and treatment with powdered activated carbon pac dosed onto a sand filter all samples were measured with lc hr ms ms two approaches were tested to identify otp signals that were formed in laboratory ozonation batch experiments and during ozonation in the wwtps the structures of identified otp signals were elucidated by interpretation of the ms2 spectra as well as expert knowledge on ozone chemistry the abatement of the otps in the differing post treatment steps was evaluated using the relative difference of the corresponding peak areas 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of micropollutants and their distribution into smart mixtures eighty seven organic mps were selected based on their abundance in municipal wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 and their relevance in aquatic ecosystems hollender et al 2018 an additional criterion for the selection of mps was the presence of different functional moieties in their chemical structures that are known to react with ozone such as primary secondary and tertiary amines olefins activated aromatic compounds and thioethers von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the selected mps are mainly pharmaceuticals and pesticides the 87 mps were separated into 19 different mixtures whereby each mp was present in two mixtures while no other mp occurred twice in these two mixtures details in

ozonation batch experiments 2 2 1 simulation of water matrix containing organic matter a simplified organic water matrix was simulated by substituting the organic matter with methanol radical chain carrier and acetate radical chain inhibitor staehelin and hoigne 1985 this matrix yields experimental solutions with ozonation conditions similar to real water matrices in terms of ozone and oh exposures and concentration ratios oh o3 known as rct elovitz and von gunten 1999 but with less interferences in the lc hr ms ms screening for otp signals the experimental solution consisted of 0 15 mm acetate and 0 029 mm methanol in phosphate buffer 1 5 mm depending on the experiment adjusted to ph 7 5 ozone exposure at full depletion was 0 035 ms with an rct of 1 3 10 8 representative for an environmental matrix elovitz et al 2000 lee et al 2013 details of this approach and another simulated matrix are provided in text s2 table s4 and figs s3 s9 si 2 2 2 ozonation batch experiments two types of ozonation batch experiments were conducted the first set of 19 ozonation batch experiments was spiked with the 19 different mp mixtures as described in section 2 1 these experiments are called o3bmix in the following and they were used to relate otps to the respective parent mps we targeted a final concentration of 10 µg l for each mp 0 013 0 084 µm additionally a second set of ozonation batch experiments was conducted where all mps were spiked together to a final target concentration of 1 µg l each these experiments are called o3ball in the following the o3ball samples were analyzed concurrently with the wwtp samples and processed simultaneously to enable an efficient screening for otp candidate signals the following experimental set up was similar for both types of ozonation batch experiments o3bmix and o3ball the mp spike solution o3bmix 32 µl of 100 mg l stock solution in methanol o3ball 40 µl of 8 mg l stock solution in methanol was added to an empty 250 ml schott bottle and left under a gentle nitrogen stream in the dark for 1 3 days to evaporate the organic solvent afterwards 250 ml of the experimental solution described in section 2 2 1 augmented with 0 5 µm para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was added for the dissolution of the mps the solution was kept on a circular shaker table at 130 rpm overnight the ozonation batch experiments were adopted from lee et al 2013 briefly we initiated the experiment by adding an ozone stock solution to a concentration of 1 3 mg o3 l in 250 ml batch reactors to follow the evolution of the reactions aliquots 6 ml were taken at multiple time points to quench ozone in these samples quenching reagents were previously added into the sample vials two kinds of quenching reagents were used first samples quenched with indigo were taken sampling times before ozone addition 15 45 90 150 240 300 480 900 1800 seconds after ozone addition to determine the residual ozone concentration via the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 from these the ozone exposures were obtained from the area under the ozone decay curves von gunten and hoigné 1994 second samples quenched with sulfite final concentration 0 16 mm were taken sampling times before ozone addition 23 53 98 158 248 308 488 908 1808 seconds after ozone addition to determine the oh exposures and consequently the rct value from the abatement of the ozone recalcitrant compound pcba measured with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an uv vis detector ultimate 3000 thermo scientific elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000 in addition five of these sulfite quenched samples sampling times before ozone addition 53 158 308 488 seconds after ozone addition were used for analyses by lc hr ms ms as described in section 2 4 unfortunately the ozone quenching with sulfite did not work in the o3bmix samples the sulfite solution was not fresh enough i e prepared a few hours before the start of the experiment therefore all samples except those collected prior to ozone addition reacted to full ozone depletion around 15 30 min therefore only one time point was available and a time dependent evaluation of otp formation was not possible in the o3bmix samples the o3ball experiments were not affected 2 3 wastewater treatment plant samples four municipal wwtps in switzerland with advanced treatment were sampled after biological

reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to a high resolution quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms was used for chemical analyses the acquisition method of the o3bmix samples that were used to relate otps to their respective parent mps differed slightly from the acquisition method of the o3ball and the wwtp samples which were used in combination to i identify otps forming in o3ball and the wwtp samples and ii to elucidate the structures via the acquired ms2 scans 2 4 1 method for the o3bmix samples after ozonation 1 ml from each o3bmix sample was taken and augmented with 20 µl internal standard istd stock solution 250 µg l in methanol and ethanol for details on the istds see table s1 si and stored at 4 c in the dark the analytical method was adopted from gulde et al 2014 a sample aliquot of 100 µl was directly injected onto a c18 atlantis t3 column particle size 3 µm 3 0 150 mm waters without enrichment mp concentration was 10 µg l before ozonation a gradient of nanopure water and methanol both augmented with 0 1 formic acid enabled chromatographic separation the eluate of the first 4 minutes was discarded to avoid salts from the phosphate buffer from entering the hr ms instrument qexactive thermo scientific detection was performed by full scan acquisition with a mass resolution r of 140 000 at m z 200 and data dependent ms ms r 17 500 top 10 the scan range was 50 750 m z and the dynamic exclusion was set to 3 s data dependent ms2 were triggered at masses of otps predicted by o3 pps lee et al 2014 schollée et al 2021a samples were measured in separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization whereby nine calibration standards 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 2 5 5 10 25 50 µg l were acquired in switch mode with r 70 000 details on method and mp quantification in text s3 1 and table s1 si 2 4 2 method for the o3ball the re measurement of the o3bmix and the wwtp samples the o3ball the re measured o3bmix and the wwtp samples were enriched by online solid phase extraction spe prior to the lc hr ms ms measurement as described by bourgin et al 2018 using 20 ml samples o3ball samples mp concentration of 1 µg l before ozonation were obtained by taking 2 5 ml of the sulfite quenched sample adding 16 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l and filling them up with nanopure water to a volume of 20 ml o3bmix samples were re measured with this method for ms2 acquisition and for relating otps to their respective parent mps here 16 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l and 17 5 ml nanopore water were added to a 2 5 ml sample this procedure resulted in o3bmix samples with concentrations 25 times higher than in the direct measurements the wwtp samples were filtered through two glass microfiber filters i e gf d top 2 7 µm pore size whatman and gf f bottom 0 7 µm pore size whatman the filtrate 50 ml was diluted with 50 ml nanopure water and spiked with 80 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l the spe cartridge was filled with four absorbents 9 mg oasis

triggered at identified otp masses see section 2 5 for details samples were measured in separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization a calibration row consisting of eleven standards 1 2 5 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 750 1000 ng l was measured at the beginning of each run for details on method and mp quantification see text s3 2 and table s1 si 2 5 identification of ozonation transformation products in principle otps can be identified in wwtp samples by the two approaches shown in fig 1 approach 1 resulted in a list of suspect otps by selecting signals that were formed in the o3bmix experiments for each parent mp approach 1a c due to time constrains this approach was only done for 70 of 87 mps after generation of the list of suspect otps approach 2 was applied however strictly following approach 1 would also enable the identification of otps present in wwtps within approach 2 otp signals were identified that were simultaneously formed in the o3ball experiments for all 87 mps and the wwtps a re measurement of o3bmix samples together with the wwtp samples was necessary to acquire ms2 scans on all identified otp masses and to assign them to their corresponding parent mps 2 5 1 generation of a list of suspect otps using laboratory ozonation batch experiments o3bmix in approach 1 a c for the identification of otp signals in laboratory batch experiments we further developed the method from gulde et al 2016 by using the software compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific otp signals were identified for each parent mp and separately for positive and negative ionization mode to do so the samples of the two mixtures in which the respective mp was spiked and the sample of another mixture where no structurally related mp was spiked used as control were uploaded to identify likely otp signals a non target approach i e without previous knowledge or expectation of e g otp masses was used on these o3bmix samples by applying the following automatic and manual filter criteria i a minimal five fold increase in peak area for the ozonated samples compared to the non ozonated samples ii presence in both mixtures containing the respective mp iii absence in the control mixture and iv reasonable peak shape for details see text s4 1 figs s10 13 and table s5 si in general the goal of this evaluation was to get a complete list while accepting a certain number of false positives since confirmation of the signal being a relevant otp followed only after its detection in wwtp samples therefore also no component i e isotope and or adduct grouping was performed at this stage 2 5 2 identification and confirmation of otp signals in wwtp samples using approach 2 to identify otp signals that were formed in our reference laboratory ozonation batch experiment o3ball and in the wwtps we used compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific for a separate evaluation in positive and negative mode we uploaded the samples from the o3ball experiments and from the four different wwtps for signal identification an automatic filter and a manual selection was applied the automatic filter had the following criteria i presence of a signal in at least one o3ball sample after ozone addition ii a minimal two fold increase in peak area in the o3ball experiment for the ozonated samples compared to the non ozonated samples iii a minimal five fold increase in peak area in the o3ball samples compared to the blank samples 20 ml nanopure water spiked with 16 µl istd stock solution iv peak retention time between 4 and 28 min and v a maximal peak area of at least 10000 1000 in positive negative mode for details see text s4 2 figs s14 16 and table s6 si signals were manually selected based on their pattern over time in the ozonation batch experiments and their occurrence in the wwtp samples since we had knowledge of suspect otps of 70 mps from approach 1 we used this information by uploading the list of all exact masses of the identified otp signals that way an easier selection of matching otp signals was possible since ms2 spectra were available however approach 2 can be applied without this prior knowledge for the parent mp assignment as well as for the confirmation of identified otp signals in the wwtp samples a sample of each of the 19 o3bmix experiments the o3ball samples and an ozo sample of all wwtp campaigns were re measured for ms2 spectra acquisition for all otps of the 87 mps the samples were then uploaded into compound discoverer 2 1 the assignment of otps to their respective parent mps was achieved by examining which parent mp was spiked into the o3bmix experiments in which the otp signal was observed for confirmation of the otp signal a clean ms2 spectrum of the o3bmix or o3ball samples was manually selected as a reference spectrum afterwards the reference ms2 spectrum was compared to the highest acquired ms2 spectrum for the respective mass of each wwtp ozo sample similarity of the ms2 spectra were calculated using the modified cosine or dot product using the msmssim package schollée 2017 weighting factors for m z and intensity were 0 and 0 75 respectively further details are available in schollée et al 2017 generally the better the agreement between the ms2 spectra the closer are the scores to 1 0 the scores were categorized in the following five groups by visual inspection of ms2 spectra of known compounds 1 0 0 6 very good 0 6 0 4 good 0 4 0 2 ok 0 2 0 1 bad and 0 1 0 0 very bad all values 0 2 were treated as sufficient the ms2 spectra match of the whole otp was classified as sufficient if 40 of all ms2 scores of ozo samples for which a signal was detected were rated as sufficient 0 2 2 6 structure elucidation of otps multiple components of an otp e g different adducts also in both modes or in source fragments could be identified as otp signals by our approaches therefore related signals were grouped manually by comparing rts and peak shapes within compound discoverer 2 1 assumed adducts e g m h m h or m fa h were assigned and chemical formulas were proposed using xcalibur qualbrowser 4 1 thermo scientific based on the ms2 spectra and on known ozonation reaction pathways plausible otp structures were proposed either using compound discoverer 2 1 or by visual interpretation confidence levels were assigned as proposed by schymanski et al 2014 2 7 evaluation of the fate of the otps in the wwtps to investigate the fate of the identified otps during ozonation and the different wwtp post treatment steps the peak areas as calculated by compound discoverer 2 1 were used the percent difference between the wwtp samples bio and ozo or between the wwtp samples ozo and eff were calculated as a r e a b i o a r e a o z o max a r e a b i o a r e a o z o 100 or a r e a o z o a r e a e f f max a r e a o z o a r e a e f f 100 respectively signals were defined as predominately forming during the ozonation step of the wwtps if their relative difference between bio and ozo samples was 33 in 50 of the wwtp samples only these signals were used for further analyses to evaluate the fate in the different wwtp post treatment steps a classification of relative differences was introduced see section 3 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation conditions of the laboratory ozonation batch experiments otp identification is simplified if experimental solutions are free of dom however the ozonation conditions i e ozone exposure oh exposure and rct value are controlled by complicated interactions between o3 oh with dom elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to overcome the inherent problems of dom for the chemical analysis of otps the ozone relevant properties of dom were simulated by methanol and acetate as promoter and inhibitor respectively thereby adjusting the ozone and oh exposures to values similar to real water matrices see text s2 1 for details the resulting ozone exposures were 0 011 0 003 ms in the o3bmix experiments note that the samples of all 19 experiments reacted to complete ozone depletion due to problems with ozone quenching and in the o3ball experiment 0 00048 0 0024 0 0058 0 0071 and 0 023 ms in the samples at 45 s 150 s 300 s 480 s and at full ozone depletion respectively these results are in the range of ozone exposures determined for nine different municipal wastewaters lee et al 2013 which were reported to be 0 0002 0 0028 ms for a specific ozone dose of 0 5 go3 gdoc and 0 004 0 013 ms for a specifc ozone dose of 1 go3 gdoc also the ozone exposures of 0 0015 0 024 ms determined by elovitz et al 2000 for five lake and two river waters with specific ozone doses of 0 67 1 0 go3 gdoc were in the same range the estimated average rct value for the o3bmix experiments was 2 3 0 7 10 8 and for the o3ball experiments 1 4 10 8 which is in a similar range as for nine municipal wastewater effluents 2 2 10 8 19 10 8 lee et al 2013 and seven surface waters 0 12 10 8 5 8 10 8 elovitz et al 2000 overall the ozonation conditions in the simulated water matrix were similar to those in municipal wastewater effluents and surface waters indicating that the simulated water matrices were representative of real water matrices furthermore the good agreement between the observed and predicted abatement of four mps from experimentally determined second order rate constants for their reactions with ozone and oh radicals see text s5 and fig s17 si confirms the significance of such batch experiments 3 2 detected suspect otps using laboratory ozonation batch experiments o3bmix in approach 1 a c the 87 mps were divided into 19 smart mixtures for individual ozonation batch experiments o3bmix the distribution in mixtures significantly reduced the number of batch experiments needed to relate the otps to the corresponding parent mps a list of suspect otps was generated by identification of signals that were formed in the o3bmix experiments for each parent mp the 70 selected parent mps which are expected to occur in the highest concentrations in wastewater bourgin et al 2018 resulted in 1749 otp signals these otp signals are listed in table s2 si and were identified in positive 777 and negative 972 modes different components e g isotopes adducts in source fragments were not grouped together since a rather comprehensive list is beneficial for a subsequent screening in wwtp samples for our final identification of otps in wwtps approach 2 was taken see section 3 3 however the list generated with approach 1 was also consulted and can be used in other studies to screen for potential otps 3 3 results from ozonated wwtps samples 3 3 1 identification of otps in ozonated samples from wwtps the samples of four wwtps were screened for the 87 selected parent mps and for otps formed from them that had matching signals in the ozonation batch experiments o3ball containing all mps as described in approach 2 in fig 1 in the wwtp neugut the full scale ozonation 0 5 go3 gdoc was followed by sand filtration sf while the other three wwtps operated pilot plants with a pre ozonation 0 21 0 33 go3 gdoc followed by activated carbon treatment different numbers of mps from the selected 87 mps were abundant in the samples after biological treatment bio in the different wwtps 71 73 in neugut 64 68 in glarnerland 59 in altenrhein and 63 in prorheno concentrations are provided in table s1 and text s6 si mps found in the highest average concentrations of 1 µg l were acesulfame metformin sucralose and 2 7 naphthalic disulfonic acid in total 153 otp signals matching with signals formed in the o3ball samples were detected in the wwtp samples table s3 si after grouping component signals together and filtering for signals that were predominantly formed during the ozonation step 84 otps remained which originated from 40 of the 87 investigated mps of the 47 mps for which no otp was assigned 15 mps were not detected or detected in bio with average concentrations 10 ng l and 19 mps 50 ng l no otps were assigned to atenolol acid and valsartan acid however their otps could be the same as for atenolol and valsartan four mps occurring in higher concentrations in bio with no otp assigned were poorly abated on average by 30 during ozonation 2 7 naphthalic disulfonic acid acesulfame levetiracetam and metformin and two mps by 40 50 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and benzotriazole these are mps known to exhibit low reactivity with ozone at the ph of the wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2014 mathon et al 2021 between 1 and 7 of the detected 84 otps were assigned to the same parent mps fig s18 and text s6 si for most parents 22 only 1 otp was found for 17 mps 2 4 otps while 6 otps were observed for carbamazepine and 7 otps for sitagliptin from the 84 otps 22 were not found in the evaluation of the o3bmix samples in approach 1 ten of them were assigned to six parent mps which were not evaluated only 70 of all 87 mps expected to occur in the highest concentrations in wastewater were screened in approach 1 due to time constraints the other 12 otps may be fast reacting otps since the o3bmix samples reacted until full ozone depletion and fast forming otps which further degraded at higher ozone exposure were most likely abated again and hence not identified in these samples moreover otps with less intense signals might be found by approach 2 since the o3ball samples measured with online spe enrichment were concentrated by a factor of 2 5 compared to o3bmix samples in approach 1 3 3 2 chemical structure of identified otps in wwtps the structures of 84 otps were elucidated figs 2 and 3 show the available data exemplarily for otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 details for all otps in table s3

present in the o3bmix samples where irbesartan was spiked it was assigned to this mp the formula c11h18on2 h fit best to the measured mass δppm 0 31 a modification of c14h10n4 between the parent irbesartan c25h28n6o and this otp likely results from a cleavage of the tetrazolebiphenylmethyl moiety which was also detected as an otp sartans p 251 0924 17 9 this moiety is common for all sartans and its cleavage was also observed for candesartan can p 207 0766 17 0 and valsartan val n 200 1289 18 1 the ms2 spectrum of rb p 195 1491 12 8 is shown in fig 2a and is publicly available on massbank together with all available spectra of the other otps massbank 2006 for the structure elucidation ms2 fragments were annotated by compound discoverer 2 1 and compared with the measured fragments the predicted structures of the ms2 fragments are drawn above the fragments highlighted in green are measured ms2 fragments that can be explained by predicted fragments for the proposed structure showing a fit for all relevant fragments for irb p 195 1491 12 8 the proposed structure fig 2b was assigned a confidence level 3 according to schymanski et al 2014 the ms2 fragments and neutral losses of other otps were also manually annotated if the compound discoverer 2 1 annotation was not sufficient from the 84 identified and structure elucidated otps 6 were assigned with level 1 confirmed structure by reference standard 6 with level 2a probable structure by library spectrum match 71 with level 3 tentative candidate structure and one with level 5 exact mass the otp without structure assignment nk n 293 1148 16 2 will not be further discussed below only 35 42 of the remaining 83 otps with proposed structure from 40 mps were previously reported in literature table 1 and text s6 si otps of 20 mps have to the best of our knowledge not been previously described and for 8 mps additional novel otps were observed however we did not find all otps that were proposed in literature for diclofenac for example diclofenac 2 5 quinone imine was reported elsewhere as a major otp coelho et al 2009 el taliawy et al 2018 faber et al 2014 sein et al 2008 we saw a signal for this otp in some wastewater samples however it was not present in our batch experiments and was therefore not discovered with our workflow cleavage of part of the molecule was observed for more than half of the parent mps 52 14 of which were n dealkylations a well known ozone reaction lim et al 2019 nearly all cleavages co occurred with an oxidation the following atomic modifications of the otp relative to its parent were observed plus one oxygen o minus two hydrogens plus one oxygen h2 o minus two hydrogens plus two oxygens h2 o2 minus two hydrogens h2 or a combination thereof a modification of o can occur through the formation of an n oxide an s oxide or a hydroxylation n oxides were found in 13 otps 7 otps with only this modification their formation from mps with tertiary amine functional groups is well known and has been detected in wastewater previously bollmann et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hörsing et al 2012 knopp et al 2016 lajeunesse et al 2013 lester et al 2013 lim et al 2019 merel et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2012 zucker et al 2018 n oxides of amisulpride citalopram clindamycin diphenhydramine fenpropidin lidocaine sulpride tramadol and venlafaxine were also detected in the current study table 1 for clindamycin the formation of a sulfoxide s oxide from the thioether was observed hydroxylation can occur via reaction with oh at aromatic rings forming a phenol on an aliphatic carbon or on a nitrogen and was observed in 13 otps since phenols react further quickly during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and therefore are unlikely to be found hydroxylations are expected to mostly occur on aliphatic carbons through various oh induced pathways von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 in 10 otps table 1 a modification of h2 o can be assigned to a formation of a carbonyl group 11 otps or an aldehyde 7 otps for another 10 otps this modification could not be definitively assigned such modifications were observed for aliskiren bezafibrate carbamazepine azais et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 citalopram caffeine rosal et al 2009 cyprodinil diclofenac fenprodin flufenamic acid gabapentin lidocaine phenazone favier et al 2015 miao et al 2015 propyzamide rosuvastatin sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 tramadol venlafaxine and the sartans diehle et al 2019 table 1 the same modification was observed in sitagliptin for the potential formation of a nitroso or an oxime group from the primary amine also postulated by hermes et al 2020 a modification of h2 o2 can be observed for the formation of a carboxylic acid as detected in 13 otps of aliskiren candesartan carbamazepine azais et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 fenfluramine flecainide irbesartan lidocaine phenazone miao et al 2015 propyzamide sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 and valsartan diehle et al 2019 table 1 benzisothiazolone was transformed into an otp with a benzoquinone type structure with the same atomic modification which could occur via an ozone reaction of a phenol which is formed as a transient product by ozone and or oh ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 ten more otps showed the addition of oxygen atoms that could not be precisely localized especially in otps after a cleavage of the molecule for candesartan carbamazepine clindamycin diclofenac flufenamic acid levamisole mefenamic acid and rosuvastatin table 1 the modification h2 o2 can also be a combination of a formation of a carbonyl group and the addition of a hydroxyl group it also occurs in the transformation of a primary amine to a nitro group which is a common reaction pathway lim et al 2019 and was observed for 2 otps of sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 3 otps of sulfamethoxazole abellan et al 2008 gao et al 2014 gomez ramos et al 2011 rodayan et al 2010 willach et al 2017 and 1 otp of amisulpride here from an aniline type moiety which is not very common a modification of h2 occurs by a transformation of an alcohol to a carbonyl group via h abstraction at the c h by oh formation of a peroxy radical from the reaction of the carbon centered radical with oxygen and the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compound von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 as in otps of oxazepam and potentially of aliskiren and sucralose hu et al 2017 an abstraction of hydrogen atoms was observed in 6 more otps which cannot be easily explained an transformation of a c c or c n bond to a double bond is not likely an exception is the formation of chlorothiazide from hydrochlorothiazide by the oxidation of a c n bond borowska et al 2016 the modification of h2 observed in 5 otps for aliskiren n desmethyltramadol lidocaine and sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 is unclear finally the formation of a sulfonic acid h2 o3 was found for levamisole table 1 3 3 3 abatement of parent mp and formation of otps in fig 3a the evolution of irbesartan otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 is shown in the o3ball experiment it is formed quickly and peak area remains rather stable with increasing ozone exposure for other otps text s6 si a continuous formation or a formation followed by a decrease can be observed the concentrations of the corresponding parent compound irbesartan after biological treatment bio ozonation ozo and post treatment in the four investigated wwtps are shown in fig 3b irbesartan as well as most other investigated mps were still present after biological treatment in all measurement campaigns of the four wwtps the selected mps were abated to different extents during ozonation in general abatement was smaller in wwtps glarnerland and altenrhein since the specific ozone doses were lower 0 23 0 33 go3 gdoc compared to wwtp neugut 0 5 0 55 go3 gdoc wwtp prorheno claimed to have applied low specific ozone doses 0 21 go3 gdoc however the evaluation of parent mps here and in krahnstöver et al 2018 revealed that the specific ozone doses must have been higher than planned please note that the quantification of the parent mps included correction through internal standard in this study 27 of the 40 mps had matching isotopically labeled istd however no corrections for matrix factors or relative recoveries for mps without matching istd were performed to keep a rather similar level of uncertainty as for the otp area estimation nevertheless the results are in agreement with full quantification results including recoveries done elsewhere for selected mps krahnstöver et al 2018 oltramare et al 2021 schollée et al 2021b 3 3 4 fate of the otp of irbesartan in different post treatments the fate of otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 of irbesartan in the post treatments of the four wwtps is shown in fig 3c different post treatments were investigated wwtp neugut had a sand filter sf while the other wwtps either had gac filtration sampled at different bed volumes gac1 at wwtp glarnerland and gac2 at wwtp altenrhein or pac dosed onto a sand filter at wwtp prorheno irb p 195 1491 12 8 was already present in small amounts in the bio samples of some wwtps this can occur if the otp is also formed during biological transformation in the human body or the activated sludge treatment all transformation products that were not predominately increasing during the ozonation step were already filtered out during the processing of the data because this study focuses only on otps irb p 195 1491 12 8 was mainly formed during ozonation in each wwtp different patterns were observed in the subsequent post treatments in wwtp neugut the peak area of the otp was rather stable during sand filtration in wwtp glarnerland with gac1 filtration the otp was abated to a certain extent or was stable while in wwtp altenrhein with gac2 filtration at higher bed volumes the otp was stable in wwtp prorheno with a pac treatment it was significantly abated since the fate of the otps in the different post treatments is of special interest the relative difference between the ozo and eff i e sf gac1 gac2 and pac samples was further evaluated and illustrated in fig 3d for irb p 195 1491 12 8 the relative difference was categorized as abatement if 50 stable between 50 and 50 and formation 50 a rather broad range of 50 to 50 was chosen as stable to account for the uncertainties of the estimated otp peak areas which arise through the automatic fitting of the signal peaks the lack of correction with internal standards and for matrix effects and the lack of loq values the fate of each otp categorized as abatement a stable s and formation f in the seven different sampling campaigns is also summarized in table 1 and will be further discussed below 3 3 5 verification of otp occurrence in wwtps via ms2 spectra comparison to confirm that an otp signal in the wwtp samples and the ozonation batch samples truly originated from the same otp precursor the ms2 spectra were compared an ms2 score was calculated for the otp signal measured in the ozo sample of each wwtp campaign and a selected reference ms2 spectrum of an ozonated batch sample the results of the ms2 spectra match for irb p 195 1491 12 8 for all ozo samples are provided in fig 3e and was rated overall as sufficient five out of the seven samples resulted in a very good ms2 score see section 2 5 2 for details on categorization the rating of the ms2 spectra match for all otps is summarized in table 1 from the 84 otps the ms2 spectra match was sufficient for 56 however the remaining 28 otps might still be present in the wwtps but possibly in low concentrations leading to meaningless ms2 spectra or with an interfering compound at a similar mass 3 4 overall fate of otps in the different post treatments after ozonation to assess the fate of otps during post treatment the 56 otps with sufficient ms2 spectra matches were used fig 4 illustrates the fate of these otps in the seven wwtp campaigns assigned according to their relative signal reduction into abatement 50 stable between 50 and 50 and formation 50 between 42 and 53 otps were identified in seven wwtp campaigns these numbers can differ due to varying occurrence and concentration patterns of parent compounds in the wastewater effluents and due to different specific ozone doses ph of wastewater and matrix compositions at wwtp neugut which has a sand filtration as post treatment the result of the two campaigns were very consistent most 89 of the 53 identified otps were stable during sand filtration n oxides for example and most other otps were found to have low abatement as has been observed previously for ate p 283 1666 21 2 lam p 259 9988 13 7 phe p 165 1021 17 6 and smx n 282 0188 18 0 bollmann et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 merel et al 2017 only 6 were abated most probably through biotransformation namely cbz p 251 0812 17 9 known as bqm for which a biological transformation to baqm and further to baqd here cbz p 283 0711 17 3 was previously reported hübner et al 2014 fad n 232 0224 21 7 fad n 258 038 19 6 and lid p 247 1438 17 8 furthermore 6 of the identified otps were formed during post treatment which is possible if these transformation products are forming through biotransformation from either remaining parent mps or other otps e g otp cbz p 283 0711 17 3 above a systematic evaluation of the abatement of otps in comparison to their parent mps based on ozone reactive functional groups was conducted in another study for ozonated surface water followed by a biological sand filter gulde et al 2021 at wwtp glarnerland a gac filter gac1 was used as a post treatment samples were taken at three different run times at a 16 000 b 25 000 and c 35 000 bv with 40 58 abatement of the 42 43 identified otps a better abatement was observed than in the biological sand filter described above less otps 33 45 were stable and 7 14 were formed when comparing the abatement of otps as a function of the bed volumes treated similar results were obtained at 16 000 and at 25 000 bv 23 25 otps abated 53 58 but less abatement was observed at 35 000 bv 17 otps abated 40 wwtp altenrhein was also equipped with gac filtration gac2 and was sampled once at 48 000 bv in this wwtp the share of abatement was smaller 23 11 otps than for wwtp glarnerland more otps were stable 53 25 otps or formed 23 11 otps this confirms the trend of less efficient otp abatement with longer gac filter run times which can be explained by the lower sorption capacities of gac filters over time crittenden et al 2005 the otps chlorothiazide hct n 293 9415 10 8 tramadol n oxide tra p 280 1905 14 4 and venlafaxine n oxide ven p 294 2064 16 1 were found to sorb well on gac in agreement with bourgin et al 2018 and knopp et al 2016 and consequently showed also a clear drop of abatement at higher bed volumes in addition to adsorption sites gac filters exhibit a biofilm that may enable biotransformation which can enhance abatement reungoat et al 2012 however it is difficult to delineate sorption and biotransformation several otps that were formed in ozonation were also formed during gac filtration four of them had a pronounced increase with a tendency of higher formation with higher bed volumes can p 207 0766 17 0 cbz p 283 0711 17 3 see also discussion of sand filtration above dic n 257 9729 16 7 and phe p 237 0868 15 1 most probably these otps are also biotransformation products of the parent mps or other otps in general it can be concluded that gac filtration is more efficient in abating otps than biological sand filtration this is in agreement with a previous study based on a trend analysis of unknown otp signals schollée et al 2018 note that in the wwtp with sand filtration a higher specific ozone dose was used than in the wwtps with gac filtration yielding different otp peak areas which may have partly biased the results in the wwtp prorheno the ozonated water was treated with 13 mg l pac dosed onto a sand filter the pac performed significantly better than gac or sf with 87 abatement of otps 46 of 53 otps were abated this result was expected because fresh pac is continuously dosed to the sand filter enabling better sorption of mps and otps compared to a gac filter which loses adsorption capacity with increasing operation time 4 conclusion laboratory experiments with aqueous solutions containing acetate and methanol to simulate real water ozonation conditions o3 oh exposure rct are adequate to mimic ozonation conditions in wastewater treatment and enable the detection of environmentally relevant otps laboratory ozonation experiments with 87 micropollutants mps were performed by dividing them into 19 smart mp mixtures this approach allows identification of otps as well as assignment of otps to their corresponding parent mps while reducing the number of necessary experiments and sample analyses two data evaluation approaches for the identification of otps in wwtps with aid of laboratory ozonation experiments were developed approach 1 lc hr ms signals formed in laboratory batch experiments were identified as otp candidates for each parent mp this resulted in a comprehensive list of otp signals 1749 otp signals for 70 mps without ms2 spectra which can be used for suspect screening in other studies this approach was not further applied but a workflow was proposed for the identification of otps in wwtps approach 2 relevant otps were identified by directly screening for lc hr ms signals that were present in the wwtp samples and were formed in the batch experiments even though a re measurement of the samples was necessary for the acquisition of ms2 spectra for otp confirmation this is a very efficient high throughput approach eighty four otps from 40 different mps could be identified during ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents from four different wwtps specific ozone doses 0 23 0 55 go3 gdoc structure elucidation via interpretation of ms2 spectra and expert knowledge on ozone chemistry revealed 6 confirmed structures level 1 reference standard 6 probable structures level 2a library spectrum match 71 tentative candidate structures level 3 and one exact mass of interest level 5 schymanski et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge 48 58 of the otps with proposed structures have not been reported in literature previously for 56 otps their occurrence in the wwtp could be verified through ms2 spectra comparison by calculating ms2 scores ms2 spectra of most of the 84 otps were made publicly available in massbank 2006 to extend the community knowledge and support the identification of otps the overall abatement of the otps in the different post treatments was poor in biological sand filtration better in gac columns but with decreasing efficiency with higher bed volumes and best in pac treatment information on otps formed in laboratory systems with simulated water matrix or real systems should be used in future studies to better understand mechanisms of otp formation during ozonation to include both ozone and hydroxyl radical reactions gulde et al 2021 this will improve predictions and opens up the possibility to couple them to structural alerts for toxicity assessment lee et al 2017 von gunten 2018 declaration of

16922,ozonation is increasingly applied in water and wastewater treatment for the abatement of micropollutants mps however the transformation products formed during ozonation otps and their fate in biological or sorptive post treatments is largely unknown in this project a high throughput approach combining laboratory ozonation experiments and detection by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms was developed and applied to identify otps formed during ozonation of wastewater effluent for a large number of relevant mps total 87 for the laboratory ozonation experiments a simplified experimental solution consisting of surrogate organic matter methanol and acetate was created which produced ozonation conditions similar to realistic conditions in terms of ozone and hydroxyl radical exposures the 87 selected parent mps were divided into 19 mixtures which enabled the identification of otps with an optimized number of experiments the following two approaches were considered to identify otps 1 a screening of lc hr ms signal formation in these experiments was performed and revealed a list of 1749 potential otp candidate signals associated to 70 parent mps this list can be used in future suspect screening studies 2 a screening was performed for signals that were formed in both batch experiments and in samples of wastewater treatment plants wwtps this second approach was ultimately more time efficient and was applied to four different wwtps with ozonation specific ozone doses in the range 0 23 0 55 go3 gdoc leading to the identification of 84 relevant otps of 40 parent mps in wastewater effluent chemical structures could be proposed for 83 otps through the interpretation of ms ms spectra and expert knowledge in ozone chemistry forty eight otps 58 have not been reported previously the fate of the verified otps was studied in different post treatment steps during sand filtration 87 89 of the otps were stable in granular activated carbon gac filters otps were abated with decreasing efficiency with increasing run times of the filters for example in a gac filter with 16 000 bed volumes 53 of the otps were abated while in a gac filter with 35 000 bed volumes 40 of the otps were abated the highest abatement 87 of otps was observed when 13 mg l powdered activated carbon pac was dosed onto a sand filter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone granular activated carbon powdered activated carbon sand filter micropollutants structure elucidation 1 introduction oxidative treatment such as ozonation has been applied in water treatment for decades traditionally ozone based technologies were mainly applied for disinfection of drinking waters but since the 1990s the possibility to simultaneously abate micropollutants mps mainly with ozone or ozone based advanced oxidation processes aops involving oh radicals oh has gained importance von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the same processes are currently being evaluated and increasingly applied for enhanced treatment of municipal wastewater effluents von gunten 2018 while initially the abatement of parent compounds was the sole goal of such treatments the fact that mps are not mineralized during reactions with ozone and or oh but largely unknown transformation products are formed required a paradigm shift von gunten 2003 2018 in previous studies in vitro bioassays revealed significantly reduced ecotoxicological effects after ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents margot et al 2013 and it has been shown that the formed transformation products have lower biological activity e g antimicrobial estrogenic or herbicidal activity compared to the parent compounds lee and von gunten 2016 however some studies showed an increased toxicity after ozonation magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 and it is unknown to what extent transformation products from mps or by products formed during oxidation of matrix components i e dissolved organic matter dom are involved in these observations lee and von gunten 2016 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2014 mestankova et al 2012 von gunten 2018 fortunately increased ozonation induced toxicity is often abated during biological post treatment stalter et al 2010 since assimilable organic carbon aoc or biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc which is formed during ozonation is usually well degraded in the biological post treatment it can be assumed that a significant portion of the induced toxicity is related to compounds contributing to these bulk parameters zimmermann et al 2011 in analogy to aoc or bdoc it is often assumed that ozonation transformation products otps are well biodegradable however this and their potential contribution to the increased toxicity are still largely unknown therefore it is recommended to test the feasibility of ozonation at a specific wwtp before its installation with a test procedure including chemical and ecotoxicological parameters schindler wildhaber et al 2015 based on general knowledge of ozone chemistry otps resulting from the reaction of ozone with certain structural moieties can be predicted based on their reactivity in systems where only ozone is considered lee et al 2017 however under realistic conditions ozone decomposes to oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which concurrently react less selectively with the mps or with the otps formed from the direct reaction with ozone complicating the prediction of otps typically liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms is applied for the identification of otps otps can be elucidated in laboratory experiments often in combination with expert knowledge and or model predictions lee et al 2017 von gunten 2018 however the elucidation of otps of single substances is very labor intensive and therefore data remain scarce carbajo et al 2015 christophoridis et al 2016 knopp et al 2016 rodayan et al 2014 rosal et al 2009 moreover otps that are elucidated in laboratory experiments at specific ozone exposures in the absence of oh reactions might not occur or occur in different yields in real water matrices because of the contribution of oh to product formation acero et al 2000 kamath et al 2018 stefan and bolton 1998 stefan et al 2000 for example during ozonation of secondary effluent at wwtp neugut with 2 mg l ozone a yield of about 40 of chlorothiazide from the transformation of hydrochlorothiazide was observed while in laboratory experiments where oh were scavenged the yield of chlorothiazide was 80 borowska et al 2016 different otps may be favored in realistic samples with varying types and concentrations of dom determining the ozone and oh exposures compared to laboratory experiments performed in absence of oh ozone and oh exposure at a dissolved organic carbon doc normalized ozone dose together with the rate constants for the reactions of selected mps with ozone and oh were found to be key parameters to predict the abatement efficiency of the mps during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents lee et al 2013 non target analysis with lc hr ms ms can be used to screen for peaks that appear after ozonation in laboratory pilot or full scale studies brunner et al 2020 gago ferrero et al 2015 itzel et al 2020 krauss et al 2010 phungsai et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 schollée et al 2021b however with this approach it is very difficult to assign chemical structures to transformation product candidates and to relate transformation products to their parent mps it is also challenging to differentiate between the otps arising from the reaction of ozone with mps and those that are formed as oxidation by products from the water matrix components furthermore it is not easily predictable how stable the formed products are when the oxidants are depleted and what their fate is in biological post treatment processes which typically follow an ozonation process hübner et al 2015 overall there is an important knowledge gap related to the formation of otps during ozonation and their fate during post treatment in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents the goal of this study was to identify otps that are formed during ozonation of secondary wwtp effluent from a large number of mps and to assess their fate in different post treatments a novel method was developed that enables an efficient and reliable identification of relevant otps formed during ozonation of mps including the elucidation of their chemical structures to identify otps laboratory ozonation batch experiments were performed in simulated water matrices with similar ozone and oh exposures as in wastewater samples with smart mixtures of mps that enabled backtracking of parent mps without needing an individual experiment for each mp in parallel wastewater samples were collected from four wwtps equipped with ozonation in full or pilot scale and different post treatment technologies namely sand filtration granular activated carbon gac filtration and treatment with powdered activated carbon pac dosed onto a sand filter all samples were measured with lc hr ms ms two approaches were tested to identify otp signals that were formed in laboratory ozonation batch experiments and during ozonation in the wwtps the structures of identified otp signals were elucidated by interpretation of the ms2 spectra as well as expert knowledge on ozone chemistry the abatement of the otps in the differing post treatment steps was evaluated using the relative difference of the corresponding peak areas 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of micropollutants and their distribution into smart mixtures eighty seven organic mps were selected based on their abundance in municipal wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 and their relevance in aquatic ecosystems hollender et al 2018 an additional criterion for the selection of mps was the presence of different functional moieties in their chemical structures that are known to react with ozone such as primary secondary and tertiary amines olefins activated aromatic compounds and thioethers von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the selected mps are mainly pharmaceuticals and pesticides the 87 mps were separated into 19 different mixtures whereby each mp was present in two mixtures while no other mp occurred twice in these two mixtures details in

ozonation batch experiments 2 2 1 simulation of water matrix containing organic matter a simplified organic water matrix was simulated by substituting the organic matter with methanol radical chain carrier and acetate radical chain inhibitor staehelin and hoigne 1985 this matrix yields experimental solutions with ozonation conditions similar to real water matrices in terms of ozone and oh exposures and concentration ratios oh o3 known as rct elovitz and von gunten 1999 but with less interferences in the lc hr ms ms screening for otp signals the experimental solution consisted of 0 15 mm acetate and 0 029 mm methanol in phosphate buffer 1 5 mm depending on the experiment adjusted to ph 7 5 ozone exposure at full depletion was 0 035 ms with an rct of 1 3 10 8 representative for an environmental matrix elovitz et al 2000 lee et al 2013 details of this approach and another simulated matrix are provided in text s2 table s4 and figs s3 s9 si 2 2 2 ozonation batch experiments two types of ozonation batch experiments were conducted the first set of 19 ozonation batch experiments was spiked with the 19 different mp mixtures as described in section 2 1 these experiments are called o3bmix in the following and they were used to relate otps to the respective parent mps we targeted a final concentration of 10 µg l for each mp 0 013 0 084 µm additionally a second set of ozonation batch experiments was conducted where all mps were spiked together to a final target concentration of 1 µg l each these experiments are called o3ball in the following the o3ball samples were analyzed concurrently with the wwtp samples and processed simultaneously to enable an efficient screening for otp candidate signals the following experimental set up was similar for both types of ozonation batch experiments o3bmix and o3ball the mp spike solution o3bmix 32 µl of 100 mg l stock solution in methanol o3ball 40 µl of 8 mg l stock solution in methanol was added to an empty 250 ml schott bottle and left under a gentle nitrogen stream in the dark for 1 3 days to evaporate the organic solvent afterwards 250 ml of the experimental solution described in section 2 2 1 augmented with 0 5 µm para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was added for the dissolution of the mps the solution was kept on a circular shaker table at 130 rpm overnight the ozonation batch experiments were adopted from lee et al 2013 briefly we initiated the experiment by adding an ozone stock solution to a concentration of 1 3 mg o3 l in 250 ml batch reactors to follow the evolution of the reactions aliquots 6 ml were taken at multiple time points to quench ozone in these samples quenching reagents were previously added into the sample vials two kinds of quenching reagents were used first samples quenched with indigo were taken sampling times before ozone addition 15 45 90 150 240 300 480 900 1800 seconds after ozone addition to determine the residual ozone concentration via the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 from these the ozone exposures were obtained from the area under the ozone decay curves von gunten and hoigné 1994 second samples quenched with sulfite final concentration 0 16 mm were taken sampling times before ozone addition 23 53 98 158 248 308 488 908 1808 seconds after ozone addition to determine the oh exposures and consequently the rct value from the abatement of the ozone recalcitrant compound pcba measured with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an uv vis detector ultimate 3000 thermo scientific elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000 in addition five of these sulfite quenched samples sampling times before ozone addition 53 158 308 488 seconds after ozone addition were used for analyses by lc hr ms ms as described in section 2 4 unfortunately the ozone quenching with sulfite did not work in the o3bmix samples the sulfite solution was not fresh enough i e prepared a few hours before the start of the experiment therefore all samples except those collected prior to ozone addition reacted to full ozone depletion around 15 30 min therefore only one time point was available and a time dependent evaluation of otp formation was not possible in the o3bmix samples the o3ball experiments were not affected 2 3 wastewater treatment plant samples four municipal wwtps in switzerland with advanced treatment were sampled after biological treatment bio after ozonation ozo and after a post treatment eff one wwtp neugut dübendorf operates a full scale ozonation followed by sand filtration sf while the other three wwtps operated pilot

reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to a high resolution quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry lc hr ms ms was used for chemical analyses the acquisition method of the o3bmix samples that were used to relate otps to their respective parent mps differed slightly from the acquisition method of the o3ball and the wwtp samples which were used in combination to i identify otps forming in o3ball and the wwtp samples and ii to elucidate the structures via the acquired ms2 scans 2 4 1 method for the o3bmix samples after ozonation 1 ml from each o3bmix sample was taken and augmented with 20 µl internal standard istd stock solution 250 µg l in methanol and ethanol for details on the istds see table s1 si and stored at 4 c in the dark the analytical method was adopted from gulde et al 2014 a sample aliquot of 100 µl was directly injected onto a c18 atlantis t3 column particle size 3 µm 3 0 150 mm waters without enrichment mp concentration was 10 µg l before ozonation a gradient of nanopure water and methanol both augmented with 0 1 formic acid enabled chromatographic separation the eluate of the first 4 minutes was discarded to avoid salts from the phosphate buffer from entering the hr ms instrument qexactive thermo scientific detection was performed by full scan acquisition with a mass resolution r of 140 000 at m z 200 and data dependent ms ms r 17 500 top 10 the scan range was 50 750 m z and the dynamic exclusion was set to 3 s data dependent ms2 were triggered at masses of otps predicted by o3 pps lee et al 2014 schollée et al 2021a samples were measured in separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization whereby nine calibration standards 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 2 5 5 10 25 50 µg l were acquired in switch mode with r 70 000 details on method and mp quantification in text s3 1 and table s1 si 2 4 2 method for the o3ball the re measurement of the o3bmix and the wwtp samples the o3ball the re measured o3bmix and the wwtp samples were enriched by online solid phase extraction spe prior to the lc hr ms ms measurement as described by bourgin et al 2018 using 20 ml samples o3ball samples mp concentration of 1 µg l before ozonation were obtained by taking 2 5 ml of the sulfite quenched sample adding 16 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l and filling them up with nanopure water to a volume of 20 ml o3bmix samples were re measured with this method for ms2 acquisition and for relating otps to their respective parent mps here 16 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l and 17 5 ml nanopore water were added to a 2 5 ml sample this procedure resulted in o3bmix samples with concentrations 25 times higher than in the direct measurements the wwtp samples were filtered through two glass microfiber filters i e gf d top 2 7 µm pore size whatman and gf f bottom 0 7 µm pore size whatman the filtrate 50 ml was diluted with 50 ml nanopure water and spiked with 80 µl istd stock solution 250 µg l the spe cartridge was filled with four absorbents 9 mg oasis

triggered at identified otp masses see section 2 5 for details samples were measured in separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization a calibration row consisting of eleven standards 1 2 5 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 750 1000 ng l was measured at the beginning of each run for details on method and mp quantification see text s3 2 and table s1 si 2 5 identification of ozonation transformation products in principle otps can be identified in wwtp samples by the two approaches shown in fig 1 approach 1 resulted in a list of suspect otps by selecting signals that were formed in the o3bmix experiments for each parent mp approach 1a c due to time constrains this approach was only done for 70 of 87 mps after generation of the list of suspect otps approach 2 was applied however strictly following approach 1 would also enable the identification of otps present in wwtps within approach 2 otp signals were identified that were simultaneously formed in the o3ball experiments for all 87 mps and the wwtps a re measurement of o3bmix samples together with the wwtp samples was necessary to acquire ms2 scans on all identified otp masses and to assign them to their corresponding parent mps 2 5 1 generation of a list of suspect otps using laboratory ozonation batch experiments o3bmix in approach 1 a c for the identification of otp signals in laboratory batch experiments we further developed the method from gulde et al 2016 by using the software compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific otp signals were identified for each parent mp and separately for positive and negative ionization mode to do so the samples of the two mixtures in which the respective mp was spiked and the sample of another mixture where no structurally related mp was spiked used as control were uploaded to identify likely otp signals a non target approach i e without previous knowledge or expectation of e g otp masses was used on these o3bmix samples by applying the following automatic and manual filter criteria i a minimal five fold increase in peak area for the ozonated samples compared to the non ozonated samples ii presence in both mixtures containing the respective mp iii absence in the control mixture and iv reasonable peak shape for details see text s4 1 figs s10 13 and table s5 si in general the goal of this evaluation was to get a complete list while accepting a certain number of false positives since confirmation of the signal being a relevant otp followed only after its detection in wwtp samples therefore also no component i e isotope and or adduct grouping was performed at this stage 2 5 2 identification and confirmation of otp signals in wwtp samples using approach 2 to identify otp signals that were formed in our reference laboratory ozonation batch experiment o3ball and in the wwtps we used compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific for a separate evaluation in positive and negative mode we uploaded the samples from the o3ball experiments and from the four different wwtps for signal identification an automatic filter and a manual selection was applied the automatic filter had the following criteria i presence of a signal in at least one o3ball sample after ozone addition ii a minimal two fold increase in peak area in the o3ball experiment for the ozonated samples compared to the non ozonated samples iii a minimal five fold increase in peak area in the o3ball samples compared to the blank samples 20 ml nanopure water spiked with 16 µl istd stock solution iv peak retention time between 4 and 28 min and v a maximal peak area of at least 10000 1000 in positive negative mode for details see text s4 2 figs s14 16 and table s6 si signals were manually selected based on their pattern over time in the ozonation batch experiments and their occurrence in the wwtp samples since we had knowledge of suspect otps of 70 mps from approach 1 we used this information by uploading the list of all exact masses of the identified otp signals that way an easier selection of matching otp signals was possible since ms2 spectra were available however approach 2 can be applied without this prior knowledge for the parent mp assignment as well as for the confirmation of identified otp signals in the wwtp samples a sample of each of the 19 o3bmix experiments the o3ball samples and an ozo sample of all wwtp campaigns were re measured for ms2 spectra acquisition for all otps of the 87 mps the samples were then uploaded into compound discoverer 2 1 the assignment of otps to their respective parent mps was achieved by examining which parent mp was spiked into the o3bmix experiments in which the otp signal was observed for confirmation of the otp signal a clean ms2 spectrum of the o3bmix or o3ball samples was manually selected as a reference spectrum afterwards the reference ms2 spectrum was compared to the highest acquired ms2 spectrum for the respective mass of each wwtp ozo sample similarity of the ms2 spectra were calculated using the modified cosine or dot product using the msmssim package schollée 2017 weighting factors for m z and intensity were 0 and 0 75 respectively further details are available in schollée et al 2017 generally the better the agreement between the ms2 spectra the closer are the scores to 1 0 the scores were categorized in the following five groups by visual inspection of ms2 spectra of known compounds 1 0 0 6 very good 0 6 0 4 good 0 4 0 2 ok 0 2 0 1 bad and 0 1 0 0 very bad all values 0 2 were treated as sufficient the ms2 spectra match of the whole otp was classified as sufficient if 40 of all ms2 scores of ozo samples for which a signal was detected were rated as sufficient 0 2 2 6 structure elucidation of otps multiple components of an otp e g different adducts also in both modes or in source fragments could be identified as otp signals by our approaches therefore related signals were grouped manually by comparing rts and peak shapes within compound discoverer 2 1 assumed adducts e g m h m h or m fa h were assigned and chemical formulas were proposed using xcalibur qualbrowser 4 1 thermo scientific based on the ms2 spectra and on known ozonation reaction pathways plausible otp structures were proposed either using compound discoverer 2 1 or by visual interpretation confidence levels were assigned as proposed by schymanski et al 2014 2 7 evaluation of the fate of the otps in the wwtps to investigate the fate of the identified otps during ozonation and the different wwtp post treatment steps the peak areas as calculated by compound discoverer 2 1 were used the percent difference between the wwtp samples bio and ozo or between the wwtp samples ozo and eff were calculated as a r e a b i o a r e a o z o max a r e a b i o a r e a o z o 100 or a r e a o z o a r e a e f f max a r e a o z o a r e a e f f 100 respectively signals were defined as predominately forming during the ozonation step of the wwtps if their relative difference between bio and ozo samples was 33 in 50 of the wwtp samples only these signals were used for further analyses to evaluate the fate in the different wwtp post treatment steps a classification of relative differences was introduced see section 3 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation conditions of the laboratory ozonation batch experiments otp identification is simplified if experimental solutions are free of dom however the ozonation conditions i e ozone exposure oh exposure and rct value are controlled by complicated interactions between o3 oh with dom elovitz and von gunten 1999 elovitz et al 2000 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to overcome the inherent problems of dom for the chemical analysis of otps the ozone relevant properties of dom were simulated by methanol and acetate as promoter and inhibitor respectively thereby adjusting the ozone and oh exposures to values similar to real water matrices see text s2 1 for details the resulting ozone exposures were 0 011 0 003 ms in the o3bmix experiments note that the samples of all 19 experiments reacted to complete ozone depletion due to problems with ozone quenching and in the o3ball experiment 0 00048 0 0024 0 0058 0 0071 and 0 023 ms in the samples at 45 s 150 s 300 s 480 s and at full ozone depletion respectively these results are in the range of ozone exposures determined for nine different municipal wastewaters lee et al 2013 which were reported to be 0 0002 0 0028 ms for a specific ozone dose of 0 5 go3 gdoc and 0 004 0 013 ms for a specifc ozone dose of 1 go3 gdoc also the ozone exposures of 0 0015 0 024 ms determined by elovitz et al 2000 for five lake and two river waters with specific ozone doses of 0 67 1 0 go3 gdoc were in the same range the estimated average rct value for the o3bmix experiments was 2 3 0 7 10 8 and for the o3ball experiments 1 4 10 8 which is in a similar range as for nine municipal wastewater effluents 2 2 10 8 19 10 8 lee et al 2013 and seven surface waters 0 12 10 8 5 8 10 8 elovitz et al 2000 overall the ozonation conditions in the simulated water matrix were similar to those in municipal wastewater effluents and surface waters indicating that the simulated water matrices were representative of real water matrices furthermore the good agreement between the observed and predicted abatement of four mps from experimentally determined second order rate constants for their reactions with ozone and oh radicals see text s5 and fig s17 si confirms the significance of such batch experiments 3 2 detected suspect otps using laboratory ozonation batch experiments o3bmix in approach 1 a c the 87 mps were divided into 19 smart mixtures for individual ozonation batch experiments o3bmix the distribution in mixtures significantly reduced the number of batch experiments needed to relate the otps to the corresponding parent mps a list of suspect otps was generated by identification of signals that were formed in the o3bmix experiments for each parent mp the 70 selected parent mps which are expected to occur in the highest concentrations in wastewater bourgin et al 2018 resulted in 1749 otp signals these otp signals are listed in table s2 si and were identified in positive 777 and negative 972 modes different components e g isotopes adducts in source fragments were not grouped together since a rather comprehensive list is beneficial for a subsequent screening in wwtp samples for our final identification of otps in wwtps approach 2 was taken see section 3 3 however the list generated with approach 1 was also consulted and can be used in other studies to screen for potential otps 3 3 results from ozonated wwtps samples 3 3 1 identification of otps in ozonated samples from wwtps the samples of four wwtps were screened for the 87 selected parent mps and for otps formed from them that had matching signals in the ozonation batch experiments o3ball containing all mps as described in approach 2 in fig 1 in the wwtp neugut the full scale ozonation 0 5 go3 gdoc was followed by sand filtration sf while the other three wwtps operated pilot plants with a pre ozonation 0 21 0 33 go3 gdoc followed by activated carbon treatment different numbers of mps from the selected 87 mps were abundant in the samples after biological treatment bio in the different wwtps 71 73 in neugut 64 68 in glarnerland 59 in altenrhein and 63 in prorheno concentrations are provided in table s1 and text s6 si mps found in the highest average concentrations of 1 µg l were acesulfame metformin sucralose and 2 7 naphthalic disulfonic acid in total 153 otp signals matching with signals formed in the o3ball samples were detected in the wwtp samples table s3 si after grouping component signals together and filtering for signals that were predominantly formed during the ozonation step 84 otps remained which originated from 40 of the 87 investigated mps of the 47 mps for which no otp was assigned 15 mps were not detected or detected in bio with average concentrations 10 ng l and 19 mps 50 ng l no otps were assigned to atenolol acid and valsartan acid however their otps could be the same as for atenolol and valsartan four mps occurring in higher concentrations in bio with no otp assigned were poorly abated on average by 30 during ozonation 2 7 naphthalic disulfonic acid acesulfame levetiracetam and metformin and two mps by 40 50 4 5 methylbenzotriazole and benzotriazole these are mps known to exhibit low reactivity with ozone at the ph of the wastewater effluents bourgin et al 2018 lee et al 2014 mathon et al 2021 between 1 and 7 of the detected 84 otps were assigned to the same parent mps fig s18 and text s6 si for most parents 22 only 1 otp was found for 17 mps 2 4 otps while 6 otps were observed for carbamazepine and 7 otps for sitagliptin from the 84 otps 22 were not found in the evaluation of the o3bmix samples in approach 1 ten of them were assigned to six parent mps which were not evaluated only 70 of all 87 mps expected to occur in the highest concentrations in wastewater were screened in approach 1 due to time constraints the other 12 otps may be fast reacting otps since the o3bmix samples reacted until full ozone depletion and fast forming otps which further degraded at higher ozone exposure were most likely abated again and hence not identified in these samples moreover otps with less intense signals might be found by approach 2 since the o3ball samples measured with online spe enrichment were concentrated by a factor of 2 5 compared to o3bmix samples in approach 1 3 3 2 chemical structure of identified otps in wwtps the structures of 84 otps were elucidated figs 2 and 3 show the available data exemplarily for otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 details for all otps in table s3 text s6 and fig s19 si table 1 summarizes the most relevant data for all 84 otps otp name parent mp adduct formula confidence level reference evaluation of the ms2 match of the ozo wwtp samples to the ozonation batch sample fate of otps in the different wwtps and proposed structure otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 was detected in positive mode at a measured m z 195 1491 and rt 12 8 min fig 2 since it was present in the o3bmix samples where irbesartan was spiked it was assigned to this mp the formula c11h18on2 h fit best to the measured mass δppm 0 31 a modification of c14h10n4 between the parent irbesartan c25h28n6o and this otp likely results from a cleavage of the tetrazolebiphenylmethyl moiety which was also detected as an otp sartans p 251 0924 17 9 this moiety is common for all sartans and its cleavage was also observed for candesartan can p 207 0766 17 0 and valsartan val n 200 1289 18 1 the ms2 spectrum of rb p 195 1491 12 8 is shown in fig 2a and is publicly available on massbank together with all available spectra of the other otps massbank 2006 for the structure elucidation ms2 fragments were annotated by compound discoverer 2 1 and compared with the measured fragments the predicted structures of the ms2 fragments are drawn above the fragments highlighted in green are measured ms2 fragments that can be explained by predicted fragments for the proposed structure showing a fit for all relevant fragments for irb p 195 1491 12 8 the proposed structure fig 2b was assigned a confidence level 3 according to schymanski et al 2014 the ms2 fragments and neutral losses of other otps were also manually annotated if the compound discoverer 2 1 annotation was not sufficient from the 84 identified and structure elucidated otps 6 were assigned with level 1 confirmed structure by reference standard 6 with level 2a probable structure by library spectrum match 71 with level 3 tentative candidate structure and one with level 5 exact mass the otp without structure assignment nk n 293 1148 16 2 will not be further discussed below only 35 42 of the remaining 83 otps with proposed structure from 40 mps were previously reported in literature table 1 and text s6 si otps of 20 mps have to the best of our knowledge not been previously described and for 8 mps additional novel otps were observed however we did not find all otps that were proposed in literature for diclofenac for example diclofenac 2 5 quinone imine was reported elsewhere as a major otp coelho et al 2009 el taliawy et al 2018 faber et al 2014 sein et al 2008 we saw a signal for this otp in some wastewater samples however it was not present in our batch experiments and was therefore not discovered with our workflow cleavage of part of the molecule was observed for more than half of the parent mps 52 14 of which were n dealkylations a well known ozone reaction lim et al 2019 nearly all cleavages co occurred with an oxidation the following atomic modifications of the otp relative to its parent were observed plus one oxygen o minus two hydrogens plus one oxygen h2 o minus two hydrogens plus two oxygens h2 o2 minus two hydrogens h2 or a combination thereof a modification of o can occur through the formation of an n oxide an s oxide or a hydroxylation n oxides were found in 13 otps 7 otps with only this modification their formation from mps with tertiary amine functional groups is well known and has been detected in wastewater previously bollmann et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 hörsing et al 2012 knopp et al 2016 lajeunesse et al 2013 lester et al 2013 lim et al 2019 merel et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2012 zucker et al 2018 n oxides of amisulpride citalopram clindamycin diphenhydramine fenpropidin lidocaine sulpride tramadol and venlafaxine were also detected in the current study table 1 for clindamycin the formation of a sulfoxide s oxide from the thioether was observed hydroxylation can occur via reaction with oh at aromatic rings forming a phenol on an aliphatic carbon or on a nitrogen and was observed in 13 otps since phenols react further quickly during ozonation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and therefore are unlikely to be found hydroxylations are expected to mostly occur on aliphatic carbons through various oh induced pathways von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 in 10 otps table 1 a modification of h2 o can be assigned to a formation of a carbonyl group 11 otps or an aldehyde 7 otps for another 10 otps this modification could not be definitively assigned such modifications were observed for aliskiren bezafibrate carbamazepine azais et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 citalopram caffeine rosal et al 2009 cyprodinil diclofenac fenprodin flufenamic acid gabapentin lidocaine phenazone favier et al 2015 miao et al 2015 propyzamide rosuvastatin sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 tramadol venlafaxine and the sartans diehle et al 2019 table 1 the same modification was observed in sitagliptin for the potential formation of a nitroso or an oxime group from the primary amine also postulated by hermes et al 2020 a modification of h2 o2 can be observed for the formation of a carboxylic acid as detected in 13 otps of aliskiren candesartan carbamazepine azais et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 fenfluramine flecainide irbesartan lidocaine phenazone miao et al 2015 propyzamide sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 and valsartan diehle et al 2019 table 1 benzisothiazolone was transformed into an otp with a benzoquinone type structure with the same atomic modification which could occur via an ozone reaction of a phenol which is formed as a transient product by ozone and or oh ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 ten more otps showed the addition of oxygen atoms that could not be precisely localized especially in otps after a cleavage of the molecule for candesartan carbamazepine clindamycin diclofenac flufenamic acid levamisole mefenamic acid and rosuvastatin table 1 the modification h2 o2 can also be a combination of a formation of a carbonyl group and the addition of a hydroxyl group it also occurs in the transformation of a primary amine to a nitro group which is a common reaction pathway lim et al 2019 and was observed for 2 otps of sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 3 otps of sulfamethoxazole abellan et al 2008 gao et al 2014 gomez ramos et al 2011 rodayan et al 2010 willach et al 2017 and 1 otp of amisulpride here from an aniline type moiety which is not very common a modification of h2 occurs by a transformation of an alcohol to a carbonyl group via h abstraction at the c h by oh formation of a peroxy radical from the reaction of the carbon centered radical with oxygen and the formation of the corresponding carbonyl compound von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 as in otps of oxazepam and potentially of aliskiren and sucralose hu et al 2017 an abstraction of hydrogen atoms was observed in 6 more otps which cannot be easily explained an transformation of a c c or c n bond to a double bond is not likely an exception is the formation of chlorothiazide from hydrochlorothiazide by the oxidation of a c n bond borowska et al 2016 the modification of h2 observed in 5 otps for aliskiren n desmethyltramadol lidocaine and sitagliptin hermes et al 2020 is unclear finally the formation of a sulfonic acid h2 o3 was found for levamisole table 1 3 3 3 abatement of parent mp and formation of otps in fig 3a the evolution of irbesartan otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 is shown in the o3ball experiment it is formed quickly and peak area remains rather stable with increasing ozone exposure for other otps text s6 si a continuous formation or a formation followed by a decrease can be observed the concentrations of the corresponding parent compound irbesartan after biological treatment bio ozonation ozo and post treatment in the four investigated wwtps are shown in fig 3b irbesartan as well as most other investigated mps were still present after biological treatment in all measurement campaigns of the four wwtps the selected mps were abated to different extents during ozonation in general abatement was smaller in wwtps glarnerland and altenrhein since the specific ozone doses were lower 0 23 0 33 go3 gdoc compared to wwtp neugut 0 5 0 55 go3 gdoc wwtp prorheno claimed to have applied low specific ozone doses 0 21 go3 gdoc however the evaluation of parent mps here and in krahnstöver et al 2018 revealed that the specific ozone doses must have been higher than planned please note that the quantification of the parent mps included correction through internal standard in this study 27 of the 40 mps had matching isotopically labeled istd however no corrections for matrix factors or relative recoveries for mps without matching istd were performed to keep a rather similar level of uncertainty as for the otp area estimation nevertheless the results are in agreement with full quantification results including recoveries done elsewhere for selected mps krahnstöver et al 2018 oltramare et al 2021 schollée et al 2021b 3 3 4 fate of the otp of irbesartan in different post treatments the fate of otp irb p 195 1491 12 8 of irbesartan in the post treatments of the four wwtps is shown in fig 3c different post treatments were investigated wwtp neugut had a sand filter sf while the other wwtps either had gac filtration sampled at different bed volumes gac1 at wwtp glarnerland and gac2 at wwtp altenrhein or pac dosed onto a sand filter at wwtp prorheno irb p 195 1491 12 8 was already present in small amounts in the bio samples of some wwtps this can occur if the otp is also formed during biological transformation in the human body or the activated sludge treatment all transformation products that were not predominately increasing during the ozonation step were already filtered out during the processing of the data because this study focuses only on otps irb p 195 1491 12 8 was mainly formed during ozonation in each wwtp different patterns were observed in the subsequent post treatments in wwtp neugut the peak area of the otp was rather stable during sand filtration in wwtp glarnerland with gac1 filtration the otp was abated to a certain extent or was stable while in wwtp altenrhein with gac2 filtration at higher bed volumes the otp was stable in wwtp prorheno with a pac treatment it was significantly abated since the fate of the otps in the different post treatments is of special interest the relative difference between the ozo and eff i e sf gac1 gac2 and pac samples was further evaluated and illustrated in fig 3d for irb p 195 1491 12 8 the relative difference was categorized as abatement if 50 stable between 50 and 50 and formation 50 a rather broad range of 50 to 50 was chosen as stable to account for the uncertainties of the estimated otp peak areas which arise through the automatic fitting of the signal peaks the lack of correction with internal standards and for matrix effects and the lack of loq values the fate of each otp categorized as abatement a stable s and formation f in the seven different sampling campaigns is also summarized in table 1 and will be further discussed below 3 3 5 verification of otp occurrence in wwtps via ms2 spectra comparison to confirm that an otp signal in the wwtp samples and the ozonation batch samples truly originated from the same otp precursor the ms2 spectra were compared an ms2 score was calculated for the otp signal measured in the ozo sample of each wwtp campaign and a selected reference ms2 spectrum of an ozonated batch sample the results of the ms2 spectra match for irb p 195 1491 12 8 for all ozo samples are provided in fig 3e and was rated overall as sufficient five out of the seven samples resulted in a very good ms2 score see section 2 5 2 for details on categorization the rating of the ms2 spectra match for all otps is summarized in table 1 from the 84 otps the ms2 spectra match was sufficient for 56 however the remaining 28 otps might still be present in the wwtps but possibly in low concentrations leading to meaningless ms2 spectra or with an interfering compound at a similar mass 3 4 overall fate of otps in the different post treatments after ozonation to assess the fate of otps during post treatment the 56 otps with sufficient ms2 spectra matches were used fig 4 illustrates the fate of these otps in the seven wwtp campaigns assigned according to their relative signal reduction into abatement 50 stable between 50 and 50 and formation 50 between 42 and 53 otps were identified in seven wwtp campaigns these numbers can differ due to varying occurrence and concentration patterns of parent compounds in the wastewater effluents and due to different specific ozone doses ph of wastewater and matrix compositions at wwtp neugut which has a sand filtration as post treatment the result of the two campaigns were very consistent most 89 of the 53 identified otps were stable during sand filtration n oxides for example and most other otps were found to have low abatement as has been observed previously for ate p 283 1666 21 2 lam p 259 9988 13 7 phe p 165 1021 17 6 and smx n 282 0188 18 0 bollmann et al 2016 bourgin et al 2018 merel et al 2017 only 6 were abated most probably through biotransformation namely cbz p 251 0812 17 9 known as bqm for which a biological transformation to baqm and further to baqd here cbz p 283 0711 17 3 was previously reported hübner et al 2014 fad n 232 0224 21 7 fad n 258 038 19 6 and lid p 247 1438 17 8 furthermore 6 of the identified otps were formed during post treatment which is possible if these transformation products are forming through biotransformation from either remaining parent mps or other otps e g otp cbz p 283 0711 17 3 above a systematic evaluation of the abatement of otps in comparison to their parent mps based on ozone reactive functional groups was conducted in another study for ozonated surface water followed by a biological sand filter gulde et al 2021 at wwtp glarnerland a gac filter gac1 was used as a post treatment samples were taken at three different run times at a 16 000 b 25 000 and c 35 000 bv with 40 58 abatement of the 42 43 identified otps a better abatement was observed than in the biological sand filter described above less otps 33 45 were stable and 7 14 were formed when comparing the abatement of otps as a function of the bed volumes treated similar results were obtained at 16 000 and at 25 000 bv 23 25 otps abated 53 58 but less abatement was observed at 35 000 bv 17 otps abated 40 wwtp altenrhein was also equipped with gac filtration gac2 and was sampled once at 48 000 bv in this wwtp the share of abatement was smaller 23 11 otps than for wwtp glarnerland more otps were stable 53 25 otps or formed 23 11 otps this confirms the trend of less efficient otp abatement with longer gac filter run times which can be explained by the lower sorption capacities of gac filters over time crittenden et al 2005 the otps chlorothiazide hct n 293 9415 10 8 tramadol n oxide tra p 280 1905 14 4 and venlafaxine n oxide ven p 294 2064 16 1 were found to sorb well on gac in agreement with bourgin et al 2018 and knopp et al 2016 and consequently showed also a clear drop of abatement at higher bed volumes in addition to adsorption sites gac filters exhibit a biofilm that may enable biotransformation which can enhance abatement reungoat et al 2012 however it is difficult to delineate sorption and biotransformation several otps that were formed in ozonation were also formed during gac filtration four of them had a pronounced increase with a tendency of higher formation with higher bed volumes can p 207 0766 17 0 cbz p 283 0711 17 3 see also discussion of sand filtration above dic n 257 9729 16 7 and phe p 237 0868 15 1 most probably these otps are also biotransformation products of the parent mps or other otps in general it can be concluded that gac filtration is more efficient in abating otps than biological sand filtration this is in agreement with a previous study based on a trend analysis of unknown otp signals schollée et al 2018 note that in the wwtp with sand filtration a higher specific ozone dose was used than in the wwtps with gac filtration yielding different otp peak areas which may have partly biased the results in the wwtp prorheno the ozonated water was treated with 13 mg l pac dosed onto a sand filter the pac performed significantly better than gac or sf with 87 abatement of otps 46 of 53 otps were abated this result was expected because fresh pac is continuously dosed to the sand filter enabling better sorption of mps and otps compared to a gac filter which loses adsorption capacity with increasing operation time 4 conclusion laboratory experiments with aqueous solutions containing acetate and methanol to simulate real water ozonation conditions o3 oh exposure rct are adequate to mimic ozonation conditions in wastewater treatment and enable the detection of environmentally relevant otps laboratory ozonation experiments with 87 micropollutants mps were performed by dividing them into 19 smart mp mixtures this approach allows identification of otps as well as assignment of otps to their corresponding parent mps while reducing the number of necessary experiments and sample analyses two data evaluation approaches for the identification of otps in wwtps with aid of laboratory ozonation experiments were developed approach 1 lc hr ms signals formed in laboratory batch experiments were identified as otp candidates for each parent mp this resulted in a comprehensive list of otp signals 1749 otp signals for 70 mps without ms2 spectra which can be used for suspect screening in other studies this approach was not further applied but a workflow was proposed for the identification of otps in wwtps approach 2 relevant otps were identified by directly screening for lc hr ms signals that were present in the wwtp samples and were formed in the batch experiments even though a re measurement of the samples was necessary for the acquisition of ms2 spectra for otp confirmation this is a very efficient high throughput approach eighty four otps from 40 different mps could be identified during ozonation of secondary wastewater effluents from four different wwtps specific ozone doses 0 23 0 55 go3 gdoc structure elucidation via interpretation of ms2 spectra and expert knowledge on ozone chemistry revealed 6 confirmed structures level 1 reference standard 6

16923,dental unit water systems are prone to biofilm formation during use of the dental unit clumps of biofilm slough off and can subsequently be aerosolized and inhaled by both patient and staff potentially causing infections the aim of this study was to determine the microbial load and microbiome of dental unit water in the netherlands and the factors influencing these parameters in total 226 dental units were sampled and heterotrophic plate counts hpc were determined on the traditional effluent sample of all dental units 61 exceeded the recommended microbiological guidelines of 100 colony forming units per milliliter in addition the microbiome with additional q pcr analysis for specific species was determined on an effluent sample taken immediately after an overnight stagnancy period in which the biofilm is in its relaxed state these relaxed biofilm samples showed that each dental unit had a unique microbiome legionella spp amoeba and fungi were found in 71 43 and 98 of all units respectively the presence of amoeba was positively associated with nine bacterial biomarkers and correlated positively with bacterial and fungal dna and legionella spp concentrations but not with hpc only when adhering to disinfection protocols statistically significant effects on the microbial load and microbiome were seen the relaxed biofilm sample in combination with molecular techniques gives better insight in the presence of opportunistic pathogens when compared to the heterotrophic plate counts infection control measures should focus on biofilm analysis and control in order to guarantee patient safety graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbiome biofilm legionella amoeba fungi dental unit 1 introduction the dental unit is an indispensable piece of equipment for the dentist supplying water air and electric power needed to perform treatment when using sonic scalers and high speed rotating instruments heat is being generated which can be detrimental to the dental tissue siegel and von fraunhofer 2002 to avoid overheating water is used to cool and irrigate the surgical site this water is usually derived from the municipal water supply either by a direct connection or by filling an external reservoir walker and marsh 2004 although the quality of this potable water is regulated in for example the european drinking water directive the council directive of the european union 1998 and usually free of pathogens it is not sterile during use of the dental unit this water is transported to the instruments through the dental unit water system duws an intricate network of narrow bore plastic tubing valves and connectors the combination of the intrinsic properties of the different materials used and the intermittent laminar flow of the water make the duws prone to biofilm formation micro organisms in the water will form once adhered a matrix encapsulated biofilm capable of withstanding a range of external stresses such as antimicrobial treatment flemming and wingender 2010 walker and marsh 2004 with biofilm forming on all surfaces of the duws anti retraction valves start to fail panagakos et al 2001 subsequently patient material such as blood and saliva can be sucked back into the duws giving oral micro organisms the chance to colonize the aquatic biofilms spratt et al 2004 walker et al 2004 if left undisturbed these biofilms can evolve in multi kingdom biofilms containing pathogenic bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa azeredo et al 2017 barbeau and buhler 2001 pankhurst and coulter 2007 and will serve as a reservoir for continuous bacterial contamination of the effluent water fish et al 2016 during treatment this contaminated effluent including clumps of shedding biofilm is aerosolized and inhaled by both patient and dental staff kimmerle et al 2012 with increased aging and immunosenescence of the patient population the chance on infection is also increasing kline and bowdish 2016 to control biofilm formation and guarantee patient safety as required by the european medical aid directive eu 2017 745 duws manufacturers have to supply a disinfection protocol the council directive of the european union 1993 which is performed through the daily addition of a low dose of an antimicrobial agent to the water additionally a weekly decontamination with a high concentration of antimicrobial agent shock dose to reduce the biofilm load in the duws can be performed to monitor duws water quality dental associations such as the royal dutch dental association knmt provide guidelines for infection control these guidelines advise that dental practices monitor the microbiological quality of the dental unit water twice a year and that the water should not contain more than 100 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 based on heterotrophic plate count hpc if more than 104 cfu ml 1 are present an additional test for the presence of legionella should take place if positive the practice has to halt all clinical procedures until the hpc and legionella counts are below the prescribed limits however while hpc provides a general indication of the water quality it only supports the growth of 0 25 of the aquatic microorganisms douterelo et al 2018 and is considered a poor indicator of legionella spp presence pierre et al 2019 therefore to gain insight into the degree of bacterial contamination and the possible presence of opportunistic pathogens such as fungi amoeba and legionella in the dental unit water we set out to perform this study to determine the microbial load and microbiome of dental unit water and the factors influencing these parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing a randomly drawn list from members of the royal dutch dental society knmt was provided by the knmt n 921 practices were sent a sampling kit to sample individual dental units and a questionnaire on the water management protocols in use to avoid external contamination dental practices were given clear instructions on how to disinfect and sample the air rotor handpiece to prevent skewed results due to residual antimicrobial activity of a possible biofilm disinfection step performed in the weekend sampling had to be performed on the second day of operation in the week no neutralizer to prevent residual antimicrobial activity was added to the samples as i no infection control measures were taken prior to sampling ii dutch drinking water does not contain chlorine smeets et al 2009 and iii a high diversity of antimicrobial agents were expected needing their own specific neutralizer fernández crehuet et al 2013 to obtain a proxy sample of the biofilm in its relaxed state relaxed biofilm sample rbs a 50 ml effluent sample was taken a septically from the air rotor handpiece preceding any flushing or disinfection of the unit then following infection control guidelines the units were flushed for 30 s and a second 10 ml effluent sample was taken that same day the samples and questionnaire were returned for analysis by regular mail upon arrival in the laboratory the questionnaire and samples were coded and blinded to the operator transit time was recorded and both the 50 ml and 10 ml samples were processed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 in short the rbs sample was concentrated by filtration using a 0 2 µm filter sarstedt nümbrecht germany and the filter was stored at 80 c till further processing and the 10 ml sample was used to determine the hpc in duplicate wille et al 1996 on r2a agar bd sparks il usa to assess the effect of transit time on the sample quality throughout the study non potable lab water 500 ml was taken from the preventive dentistry lab of the academic centre for dentistry in amsterdam the netherlands and distributed over several sampling sets baseline hpc and microbiome of two sampling sets were determined and the other sets were posted in duplicate before and after the mail pick up time to simulate the postal transit times of the dental unit samples upon arrival these control samples n 62 were processed similarly to the dental unit samples 2 2 molecular dna analysis microbiome analysis and quantitative pcr q pcr on specific target organisms was performed only on rbs samples the dna isolation 16s v4 rdna pcr sequencing and processing of microbiome samples with the inclusion of appropriate kit blanks filter and pcr controls was performed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 in short the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified paired end reads 251 bp of equimolarly pooled amplicons were generated using the illumina miseq platform and the v3 reagent kit illumina inc san diego ca sequence data were processed and a taxonomic name was assigned to the representative most abundant sequence of the operational taxonomic unit otu based on the silva ribosomal rna database ordination of the data was performed using principal component analysis pca permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the bray curtis distance for samples and the shannon diversity index was calculated on the non log2 transformed data all data handling and statistical analysis was performed in r v3 6 0 linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse of the microbiome data to detect biomarkers associated with the presence of amoeba was performed on the processed data with an additional filtering on operational taxonomic units abundance of 0 05 segata et al 2011 to determine the presence of specific target species q pcr was performed using lightcycler technology and chemistry roche almere the netherlands all rbs samples were analyzed in duplicate using molecular grade water thermo scientific as a negative control the presence of legionella spp l pneumophila and l pneumophila sg1 was determined according to collins and co workers using 10 µl template dna collins et al 2015 calibration curves were constructed using l pneumophila dsm 7513 dna dsmz braunsweig germany with a detection limit of 10 genomic unit numbers gu per reaction 2000 gu l 1 for legionella spp and 1 gu for l pneumophila positive samples were verified by melting point analysis and gu were calculated based on the inclusion of certified genome unit numbers lgc standards wesel germany the fungal concentration in the rbs sample was determined using the 18s rdna fungiquant primer set liu et al 2012 in combination with a roche lightcycler protocol wagner et al 2018 calibration curves were constructed using c albicans sc5314 dna detection limit 1 fg µl 1 18s rdna to detect the presence of the amoeba acanthamoeba and naegleria a conventional pcr was used le calvez et al 2012 escherichia coli dh5α containing a puc54 kan vector with the respective target sequences based on 18s rdna from acanthamoeba castellanii castellanii atcc 50 374 genbank u07413 1 and naegleria fowleri genbank af338423 1 with 20 bp flanking regions and a hindiii restriction site on both ends were constructed baseclear leiden the netherlands plasmid dna of both clones was isolated using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit thermo scientific landsmeer the netherlands and served as a positive control presence of both amoebal species was determined by dna gel electrophoresis 60 min 100 v 3 tris acetate edta agarose fisher scientific on the pcr samples the presence of hartmannella was detected using a q pcr specific for h vermiformis kuiper et al 2006 with the modification for roche lightcycler technology using 5 µl dna template ren et al 2018 2 3 statistics overall the data had a non normal distribution prior to statistical tests hpc data and q pcr data for legionella spp were log10 transformed values below the detection limit were set at the detection limit to allow for successful log10 transformation unless stated otherwise for among group comparisons the kruskal wallis test was used and when significant differences were observed a bonferroni post hoc test was applied to determine the relation between parameters both the pearson and spearman correlation coefficient were determined statistical analysis on hpc and q pcr data were performed using spss 26 0 ibm amsterdam the netherlands microbiome analyses was performed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 differences between groups were deemed statistically significantly different at p 0 005 ioannidis 2018 3 results 3 1 unit samples in total 226 dental unit water samples were returned of which most samples 97 within 2 days analysis of the control samples n 62 revealed that the average hpc of samples which were in transit less than 3 days did not increase significantly p 0 005 seven samples which were in transit for more than 2 days were therefore removed from the study two additional samples were removed due to incomplete questionnaires and another 4 samples were lost for hpc due to leakage during transit resulting in a total of 213 samples analyzed for hpc for sample information on distribution per province unit brand the type of disinfectants used average unit age see suppl file data summary the complete metadata file can be found under ncbi bioproject prjna690093 3 2 heterotrophic plate counts as can be seen in table 1 39 of the samples contained less than 102 cfu ml 1 and are considered safe according to infection control guidelines while only 28 units 13 could be considered clean as no colonies were detected on plate to determine the influence of the type of disinfectant used either as a daily low dose disinfectant dldd or as a weekly shock dose treatment the samples were grouped based on the active ingredient in the disinfectant used as can be seen in table 2 and depicted in fig 1 dental units which received a dldd with or without a shock dose contained a significantly lower amount of heterotrophic plate counts as compared to units which received no treatment p 0 005 only units receiving a dldd with hydrogen peroxide based products with and without silver ions contained a significantly lower hpc p 0 005 as compared to units which received no treatment data not shown 3 3 molecular dna analysis 3 3 1 microbiome analysis in total all 236 rbs samples 226 samples and 10 pcr controls filter and kit blanks were processed for microbiome analysis pcr controls kit and filter blanks contained at most 97 reads average 19 7 range 1 97 and had no predominant otus after quality control filtering at 10 5 and subsampling at 8100 reads sample 131 samples remained next samples n 7 which were in transit for more than 2 days were removed from the study most rbs samples lost n 79 contained very few reads 1000 which correlated to low amounts of dna after isolation the paired end reads and metadata are available under ncbi bioproject prjna690093 the final otu table contained 1340 otus with an average of 159 122 otu per sample a summary of the bacterial taxa and their presence in the dental units analyzed can be found in suppl file bacterial composition the bacterial taxa found in the sampled dental units included genera commonly found in water such as burkholderiaceae and sphingomonadaceae but also opportunistic pathogens such as legionella mycobacterium serratia pseudomonas aeruginosa coxiella and staphylococcus dental units which received a different treatment regime had a significantly different biofilm composition n 124 permanova 9999 permutations df 4 f 2 4 p 0 005 pairwise permanovas of the different treatment regimens showed that the composition of units that were treated with a single agent either as a dldd shock dose or a combination of both with the same disinfectant differed from the non treated units p 0 005 when looking closer principal component analysis on log2 transformed data revealed clear differences in composition between different disinfectants used as a dldd with 22 32 and 8 74 of variance being explained by pc1 and pc2 respectively fig 2 a the differences were confirmed using permanova to be statistically significant n 34 9999 permutations df 5 f 2 1 p 0 005 no significant effect was found when only a shock dose was used n 20 9999 permutation df 6 f 2 4 p 0 074 further analysis of the shannon diversity fig 2b between the different daily low dose disinfectants used in more than 2 units revealed that units which received hydrogen peroxide silver ions as compared to no treatment had a statistically significant lower shannon diversity p 0 005 in an attempt to distinguish clusters of otus based on units which received a certain treatment regime a heatmap kolde 2015 was prepared of otus present in more than 30 of the rbs samples as can be seen in suppl file heatmap no clear clusters could be identified indicating the uniqueness of each rbs sample and indeed no grouping based on disinfection treatment regimens was visible either to assess whether the anti retraction valves of the air rotor handpiece prevented the backflush of patient material such as saliva the microbiome data was screened for the presence of human oral bacteria in 28 units trace amounts 8 reads after subsampling of streptococci porphyromonas and veillonella were found 3 3 2 quantitative pcr the microbial loads as determined by q pcr were compared between no treatment applied dldd only a shock dose both dldd and shock dose with a similar agent and an alternating agent for dldd and shock dose 3 3 2 1 bacterial 16s rdna concentration the bacterial 16s rdna concentration was determined as part of the sample processing for microbiome sequencing overall 96 of the samples were positive with an average of 1 3 3 3 ng µl 1 range 0 26 ng µl 1 bacterial 16s rdna a weak to moderate correlation was found between log10 hpc of the effluent sample and the bacterial 16s rdna concentration in the rbs samples rcpearson 0 451 rcspearman 0 708 both p 0 005 as can be seen in table 2 units receiving a weekly shock dose contained a significant lower bacterial 16s rdna concentration when compared to units which did not receive a treatment no differences were found between different active agents only units receiving hydrogen peroxide with silver ions as a dldd had a significantly lower bacterial 16s rdna concentration p 0 005 data not shown 3 3 2 1 fungal rdna concentration the fungal dna concentration in the rbs samples was assessed using 18s rdna as the target overall 98 1 of the samples tested positive with an average of 6 9 35 6 pg µl 1 range 0 482pg µl 1 fungal 18s rdna units which received a shock treatment alone or combined with a similar disinfectant for the dldd contained a lower fungal concentration compared to no treatment p 0 005 see table 2 however no significant differences were found between individual disinfectants 3 3 2 3 presence of legionella spp legionella spp were detected in 71 of the 213 samples containing more than 2000 gu l 1 legionella spp on average 1 1 107 5 7 107 gu l 1 legionella spp range 2 7 103 6 3 108gu l 1 were detected of these samples 6 units tested positive for l pneumophila of which two belonged to serogroup 1 samples which were considered safe based on hpc counts n 84

for acanthamoeba 2 units contained both hartmannella and naegleria vahlkampfia and the remainder contained only hartmannella bacterial fungal and legionella spp concentrations were significantly higher in the presence of amoeba p 0 005 yet no difference in average hpc p 0 333 was found between the presence or absence of amoeba lefse analysis fig 4 revealed that the bacterial families burkholderiaceae alphaproteobacteria incertae sedis bradyrhizobiaceae microbacteriaceae legionellaceae rhodocyclaceae sphingomonadaceae reyranellaceae were associated with the presence of amoeba in contrast geodermatophilaceae sphingomonadaceae beijerinckiaceae and mycobacteriaceae were positively associated with the absence of amoeba 4 discussion microbial aerosol formation during dental treatment can pose a risk to both the dental staff and patient pankhurst and coulter 2007 with an ageing population the patients immune system gradually deteriorates making them more vulnerable to infection kline and bowdish 2016 additionally the current covid 19 pandemic creates a whole new population of patients with long term pulmonary complications making them potentially vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections cox et al 2020 koehler et al 2020 in this study we set out to determine the microbial load and microbiome of dutch dental unit water and the factors influencing these parameters we found that 61 of the dental units sampled contained a higher hpc than recommended furthermore 71 of the dental units sampled contained legionella spp which could be a potential health issue muder and yu 2002 molecular analysis revealed that nearly all dental units 98 contained fungi and that each dental unit contained a unique microbiome off all factors studied only the treatment regime clearly altered the microbial load and had an influence on the microbiome further analysis showed that on genus level mycobacterium pseudomonas legionella spp coxiella and staphylococcus were found in the dental unit water with representatives of these genera being associated with community acquired pneumonia in the netherlands wiersinga et al 2018 case reports have linked legionnaires disease pneumonia eye infections and abscess formation to the presence of legionella pneumophila pseudomonas amoeba and non tuberculous mycobacteria in the dental unit water barbeau 2000 barbot et al 2012 martin 1987 petti 2017 the high prevalence of legionella spp found in the microbiome analysis was supported by q pcr analysis 73 vs 71 of units positive respectively as a primary source of these legionella spp the watermains is the most likely origin leoni et al 2015 and also in this study we found that dental units which were connected directly to the drinking watermains contained significantly more legionella spp even though 6 units 0 03 tested positive for l pneumophila and should raise concern it is a low prevalence when compared to studies reporting a prevalence of 22 78 spagnolo et al 2019 zanetti et al 2000 this difference might be explained by higher seasonal temperatures in italy as compared to the netherlands promoting the growth of legionella and amoeba karagiannis et al 2009 within the netherlands no geographic clustering on the prevalence of legionella was found data not shown which could be explained by the relatively small size of the netherlands resulting in small temperature differences proliferation of amoeba and legionella requires a minimum biofilm concentration of about 106 cfu cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 biofilms grown under hydrodynamic stress can contain 100 1000 times more bacterial cells as compared to the equivalent volume effluent from the same length of 4 mm inner diameter tubing hoogenkamp et al 2020 thus units containing more than 103 cfu ml 1 in the effluent could contain about 105 106 cfu cm 2 biofilm making 47 of the units eligible as a breeding ground for amoeba indeed in this study 43 of the units tested positive for the presence of amoeba and is supported by significant positive correlations between the presence of amoeba and high bacterial and fungal dna load amoeba resistant bacterial families burkholderiaceae alphaproteobacteria incertae sedis bradyrhizobiaceae microbacteriaceae legionellaceae and sphingomonadaceae and the amoebal prey organisms reynanellaceae 86 of units and rhodocyclaceae bacterium 80 of units were more abundant in the presence of amoeba as delineated by lefse analysis these results are in line with culturing studies showing similar associations paquet and charette 2016 van der kooij et al 2018 a duws biofilm is the causative source of the continuous contamination of the effluent the microbiological quality of the dental unit water is deemed adequate when the european drinking water standard is met traditionally the unit is flushed prior to sampling and determination of the hpc however flushing masks the extent of biofilm contamination in the unit as it temporarily washes out the planktonic bacteria rice et al 2006 subsequent culturing of the effluent on suboptimal culturing media could then lead to a false sense of security when judging microbial contamination of the unit water douterelo et al 2018 zanetti et al 2000 despite flushing for 30 s only 39 of the units sampled in this study complied to the drinking water standard which is comparable to other studies pasquarella et al 2012 walker et al 2004 alternatively analyzing the biofilm itself would give the best impression of the presence of possible opportunistic pathogens and the severity of biofilm formation especially considering that each dental unit has its own biofilm ecosystem however taking a biofilm sample from the duws is not feasible due to the destructive nature of sampling to the dental unit and collecting a whole day effluent sample is impossible hoogenkamp et al 2020 therefore a proxy sample for the biofilm should be used in this study an effluent sample was taken immediately after an overnight stagnancy period prior to any maintenance regime when the biofilm is in its relaxed state relaxed biofilm sample when analyzing the molecular dna parameters of the rbs sample and correlating this to the hpc only a weak correlation was found intriguingly 45 out of 84 units that had an hpc less than 100 cfu ml 1 contained more than 2000 gu l 1 legionella spp dna in daily practice the legionella spp contamination would not have been detected as additional testing for legionella in the netherlands is only performed when hpc levels exceed 104 cfu ml 1 growth of legionella is not supported by r2a agar on which hpc is determined the presence of legionella and other opportunistic micro organisms are more likely to be detected in a biofilm sample pierre et al 2019 walker et al 2004 the relaxed biofilm sample taken in this study could serve as a proxy as the overnight stagnancy of the unit water results in viscoelastic relaxation of the biofilm in which micro organisms can easily diffuse or migrate out of the biofilm into the lumen of the tube abe et al 2011 peterson et al 2015 to minimize bacterial growth in the duws manufacturers are obliged to provide a disinfection protocol to disinfect the waterlines of the dental unit the council directive of the european union 1993 units which get administered hydrogen peroxide based products as a dldd contained a significantly lower hpc bacterial 16s rdna and legionella spp dna concentration delivering an additional weekly shock dose treatment with hydrogen peroxide silver ions or hypochlorous acid seemed to further prevent bacterial growth hypochlorous acid is a strong oxidizing agent capable of destroying the membrane integrity and silver ions are known to interact with the bacterial membrane and bind to the phosphate groups during dna replication while the latter can inhibit legionella replication at relatively low concentrations intracellularly and biofilm grown legionellae are less sensitive to silver unger and lück 2012 amoeba are known to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than bacteria and feed on both live and dead biofilms cervero aragó et al 2015 biofilm removal rather than killing is of prime importance as no significant difference in the prevalence of amoeba was found between the different types of disinfectant applied currently the fungal load is not determined to assess the quality of the dental unit water being more complex organisms than bacteria fungi are less sensitive to water disinfecting agents hageskal et al 2012 nett et al 2008 this is supported by the finding that a shock dose treatment appears to be necessary to reduce the fungal load the use of a dldd disinfectant alone could even be unwanted as proliferation of fungi has been reported especially in situations where small amounts of prokaryotic organisms were found in the source water porteous et al 2003 this is supported by our finding that all samples with less than 0 5 µg ml 1 bacterial 16s rdna always contained detectable concentrations of fungal rdna see data in brief the relationship between the microbiological contamination of dental unit water and the risk for infection remains unclear pankhurst and coulter 2007 this ambiguity might result from a lack of awareness of a link between an infection in the aftermath of a dental treatment a strict adherence to an infection control protocol supported with frequent testing has proven effective in keeping biofilm growth under control within a dental school setting baudet et al 2020 volgenant and persoon 2019 as only half of the dental offices screened in this study applied some sort of infection control measure it is clear that they too have a vital role in ensuring water quality and safety moreover as participation in this study was voluntary it is to be expected that only dental offices which perform active infection control measures responded it may therefore be possible that other not tested units have an even worse outcome than reported here further research is needed to assess which disinfectants and treatment regimens are able to remove biofilm from the duws in order to help the general dentist practice to control biofilm formation and guarantee patient safety 5 conclusion the vast majority of dental unit water in the netherlands exceed infection control guidelines fungi legionella spp and amoeba are frequently detected in dutch dental units a risk assessment based only on determining the hpc in the effluent is underestimating the maximum possible biological load and is therefore not sufficient a proxy relaxed biofilm state sample in combination with q pcr techniques is a valuable tool to monitor the microbiological quality and the presence of opportunistic pathogens in dental unit water the use of generic disinfection protocols are likely to be ineffective in guaranteeing safe dental unit water infection control guidelines should focus on the presence and control of biofilm formation as this is the source of reinfection of the effluent water credit authorship contribution statement

the water make the duws prone to biofilm formation micro organisms in the water will form once adhered a matrix encapsulated biofilm capable of withstanding a range of external stresses such as antimicrobial treatment flemming and wingender 2010 walker and marsh 2004 with biofilm forming on all surfaces of the duws anti retraction valves start to fail panagakos et al 2001 subsequently patient material such as blood and saliva can be sucked back into the duws giving oral micro organisms the chance to colonize the aquatic biofilms spratt et al 2004 walker et al 2004 if left undisturbed these biofilms can evolve in multi kingdom biofilms containing pathogenic bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa azeredo et al 2017 barbeau and buhler 2001 pankhurst and coulter 2007 and will serve as a reservoir for continuous bacterial contamination of the effluent water fish et al 2016 during treatment this contaminated effluent including clumps of shedding biofilm is aerosolized and inhaled by both patient and dental staff kimmerle et al 2012 with increased aging and immunosenescence of the patient population the chance on infection is also increasing kline and bowdish 2016 to control biofilm formation and guarantee patient safety as required by the european medical aid directive eu 2017 745 duws manufacturers have to supply a disinfection protocol the council directive of the european union 1993 which is performed through the daily addition of a low dose of an antimicrobial agent to the water additionally a weekly decontamination with a high concentration of antimicrobial agent shock dose to reduce the biofilm load in the duws can be performed to monitor duws water quality dental associations such as the royal dutch dental association knmt provide guidelines for infection control these guidelines advise that dental practices monitor the microbiological quality of the dental unit water twice a year and that the water should not contain more than 100 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 based on heterotrophic plate count hpc if more than 104 cfu ml 1 are present an additional test for the presence of legionella should take place if positive the practice has to halt all clinical procedures until the hpc and legionella counts are below the prescribed limits however while hpc provides a general indication of the water quality it only supports the growth of 0 25 of the aquatic microorganisms douterelo et al 2018 and is considered a poor indicator of legionella spp presence pierre et al 2019 therefore to gain insight into the degree of bacterial contamination and the possible presence of opportunistic pathogens such as fungi amoeba and legionella in the dental unit water we set out to perform this study to determine the microbial load and microbiome of dental unit water and the factors influencing these parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing a randomly drawn list from members of the royal dutch dental society knmt was provided by the knmt n 921 practices were sent a sampling kit to sample individual dental units and a questionnaire on the water management protocols in use to avoid external contamination dental practices were given clear instructions on how to disinfect and sample the air rotor handpiece to prevent skewed results due to residual antimicrobial activity of a possible biofilm disinfection step performed in the weekend sampling had to be performed on the second day of operation in the week no neutralizer to prevent residual antimicrobial activity was added to the samples as i no infection control measures were taken prior to sampling ii dutch drinking water does not contain chlorine smeets et al 2009 and iii a high diversity of antimicrobial agents were expected needing their own specific neutralizer fernández crehuet et al 2013 to obtain a proxy sample of the biofilm in its relaxed state relaxed biofilm sample rbs a 50 ml effluent sample was taken a septically from the air rotor handpiece preceding any flushing or disinfection of the unit then following infection control guidelines the units were flushed for 30 s and a second 10 ml effluent sample was taken that same day the samples and questionnaire were returned for analysis by regular mail upon arrival in the laboratory the questionnaire and samples were coded and blinded to the operator transit time was recorded and both the 50 ml and 10 ml samples were processed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 in short the rbs sample was concentrated by filtration using a 0 2 µm filter sarstedt nümbrecht germany and the filter was stored at 80 c till further processing and the 10 ml sample was used to determine the hpc in duplicate wille et al 1996 on r2a agar bd sparks il usa to assess the effect of transit time on the sample quality throughout the study non potable lab water 500 ml was taken from the preventive dentistry lab of the academic centre for dentistry in amsterdam the netherlands and distributed over several sampling sets baseline hpc and microbiome of two sampling sets were determined and the other sets were posted in duplicate before and after the mail pick up time to simulate the postal transit times of the dental unit samples upon arrival these control samples n 62 were processed similarly to the dental unit samples 2 2 molecular dna analysis microbiome analysis and quantitative pcr q pcr on specific target organisms was performed only on rbs samples the dna isolation 16s v4 rdna pcr sequencing and processing of microbiome samples with the inclusion of appropriate kit blanks filter and pcr controls was performed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 in short the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified paired end reads 251 bp of equimolarly pooled amplicons were generated using the illumina miseq platform and the v3 reagent kit illumina inc san diego ca sequence data were processed and a taxonomic name was assigned to the representative most abundant sequence of the operational taxonomic unit otu based on the silva ribosomal rna database ordination of the data was performed using principal component analysis pca permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the bray curtis distance for samples and the shannon diversity index was calculated on the non log2 transformed data all data handling and statistical analysis was performed in r v3 6 0 linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse of the microbiome data to detect biomarkers associated with the presence of amoeba was performed on the processed data with an additional filtering on operational taxonomic units abundance of 0 05 segata et al 2011 to determine the presence of specific target species q pcr was performed using lightcycler technology and chemistry roche almere the netherlands all rbs samples were analyzed in duplicate using molecular grade water thermo scientific as a negative control the presence of legionella spp l pneumophila and l pneumophila sg1 was determined according to collins and co workers using 10 µl template dna collins et al 2015 calibration curves were constructed using l pneumophila dsm 7513 dna dsmz braunsweig germany with a detection limit of 10 genomic unit numbers gu per reaction 2000 gu l 1 for legionella spp and 1 gu for l pneumophila positive samples were verified by melting point analysis and gu were calculated based on the inclusion of certified genome unit numbers lgc standards wesel germany the fungal concentration in the rbs sample was determined using the 18s rdna fungiquant primer set liu et al 2012 in combination with a roche lightcycler protocol wagner et al 2018 calibration curves were constructed using c albicans sc5314 dna detection limit 1 fg µl 1 18s rdna to detect the presence of the amoeba acanthamoeba and naegleria a conventional pcr was used le calvez et al 2012 escherichia coli dh5α containing a puc54 kan vector with the respective target sequences based on 18s rdna from acanthamoeba castellanii castellanii atcc 50 374 genbank u07413 1 and naegleria fowleri genbank af338423 1 with 20 bp flanking regions and a hindiii restriction site on both ends were constructed baseclear leiden the netherlands plasmid dna of both clones was isolated using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit thermo scientific landsmeer the netherlands and served as a positive control presence of both amoebal species was determined by dna gel electrophoresis 60 min 100 v 3 tris acetate edta agarose fisher scientific on the pcr samples the presence of hartmannella was detected using a q pcr specific for h vermiformis kuiper et al 2006 with the modification for roche lightcycler technology using 5 µl dna template ren et al 2018 2 3 statistics overall the data had a non normal distribution prior to statistical tests hpc data and q pcr data for legionella spp were log10 transformed values below the detection limit were set at the detection limit to allow for successful log10 transformation unless stated otherwise for among group comparisons the kruskal wallis test was used and when significant differences were observed a bonferroni post hoc test was applied to determine the relation between parameters both the pearson and spearman correlation coefficient were determined statistical analysis on hpc and q pcr data were performed using spss 26 0 ibm amsterdam the netherlands microbiome analyses was performed as described previously hoogenkamp et al 2020 differences between groups were deemed statistically significantly different at p 0 005 ioannidis 2018 3 results 3 1 unit samples in total 226 dental unit water samples were returned of which most samples 97 within 2 days analysis of the control samples n 62 revealed that the average hpc of samples which were in transit less than 3 days did not increase significantly p 0 005 seven samples which were in transit for more than 2 days were therefore removed from the study two additional samples were removed due to incomplete questionnaires and another 4 samples were lost for hpc due to leakage during transit resulting in a total of 213 samples analyzed for hpc for sample information on distribution per province unit brand the type of disinfectants used average unit age see suppl file data summary the complete metadata file can be found under ncbi bioproject prjna690093 3 2 heterotrophic plate counts as can be seen in table 1 39 of the samples contained less than 102 cfu ml 1 and are considered safe according to infection control guidelines while only 28 units 13 could be considered clean as no colonies were detected on plate to determine the influence of the type of disinfectant used either as a daily low dose disinfectant dldd or as a weekly shock dose treatment the samples were grouped based on the active ingredient in the disinfectant used as can be seen in table 2 and depicted in fig 1 dental units which received a dldd with or without a shock dose contained a significantly lower amount of heterotrophic plate counts as compared to units which received no treatment p 0 005 only units receiving a dldd with hydrogen peroxide based products with and without silver ions contained a significantly lower hpc p 0 005 as compared to units which received no treatment data not shown 3 3 molecular dna analysis 3 3 1 microbiome analysis in total all 236 rbs samples 226 samples and 10 pcr controls filter and kit blanks were processed for microbiome analysis pcr controls kit and filter blanks contained at most 97 reads average 19 7 range 1 97 and had no predominant otus after quality control filtering at 10 5 and subsampling at 8100 reads sample 131 samples remained next samples n 7 which were in transit for more than 2 days were removed from the study most rbs samples lost n 79 contained very few reads 1000 which correlated to low amounts of dna after isolation the paired end reads and metadata are available under ncbi bioproject prjna690093 the final otu table contained 1340 otus with an average of 159 122 otu per sample a summary of the bacterial taxa and their presence in the dental units analyzed can be found in suppl file bacterial composition the bacterial taxa found in the sampled dental units included genera commonly found in water such as burkholderiaceae and sphingomonadaceae but also opportunistic pathogens such as legionella mycobacterium serratia pseudomonas aeruginosa coxiella and staphylococcus dental units which received a different treatment regime had a significantly different biofilm composition n 124 permanova 9999 permutations df 4 f 2 4 p 0 005 pairwise permanovas of the different treatment regimens showed that the composition of units that were treated with a single agent either as a dldd shock dose or a combination of both with the same disinfectant differed from the non treated units p 0 005 when looking closer principal component analysis on log2 transformed data revealed clear differences in composition between different disinfectants used as a dldd with 22 32 and 8 74 of variance being explained by pc1 and pc2 respectively fig 2 a the differences were confirmed using permanova to be statistically significant n 34 9999 permutations df 5 f 2 1 p 0 005 no significant effect was found when only a shock dose was used n 20 9999 permutation df 6 f 2 4 p 0 074 further analysis of the shannon diversity fig 2b between the different daily low dose disinfectants used in more than 2 units revealed that units which received hydrogen peroxide silver ions as compared to no treatment had a statistically significant lower shannon diversity p 0 005 in an attempt to distinguish clusters of otus based on units which received a certain treatment regime a heatmap kolde 2015 was prepared of otus present in more than 30 of the rbs samples as can be seen in suppl file heatmap no clear clusters could be identified indicating the uniqueness of each rbs sample and indeed no grouping based on disinfection treatment regimens was visible either to assess whether the anti retraction valves of the air rotor handpiece prevented the backflush of patient material such as saliva the microbiome data was screened for the presence of human oral bacteria in 28 units trace amounts 8 reads after subsampling of streptococci porphyromonas and veillonella were found 3 3 2 quantitative pcr the microbial loads as determined by q pcr were compared between no treatment applied dldd only a shock dose both dldd and shock dose with a similar agent and an alternating agent for dldd and shock dose 3 3 2 1 bacterial 16s rdna concentration the bacterial 16s rdna concentration was determined as part of the sample processing for microbiome sequencing overall 96 of the samples were positive with an average of 1 3 3 3 ng µl 1 range 0 26 ng µl 1 bacterial 16s rdna a weak to moderate correlation was found between log10 hpc of the effluent sample and the bacterial 16s rdna concentration in the rbs samples rcpearson 0 451 rcspearman 0 708 both p 0 005 as can be seen in table 2 units receiving a weekly shock dose contained a significant lower bacterial 16s rdna concentration when compared to units which did not receive a treatment no differences were found between different active agents only units receiving hydrogen peroxide with silver ions as a dldd had a significantly lower bacterial 16s rdna concentration p 0 005 data not shown 3 3 2 1 fungal rdna concentration the fungal dna concentration in the rbs samples was assessed using 18s rdna as the target overall 98 1 of the samples tested positive with an average of 6 9 35 6 pg µl 1 range 0 482pg µl 1 fungal 18s rdna units which received a shock treatment alone or combined with a similar disinfectant for the dldd contained a lower fungal concentration compared to no treatment p 0 005 see table 2 however no significant differences were found between individual disinfectants 3 3 2 3 presence of legionella spp legionella spp were detected in 71 of the 213 samples containing more than 2000 gu l 1 legionella spp on average 1 1 107 5 7 107 gu l 1 legionella spp range 2 7 103 6 3 108gu l 1 were detected of these samples 6 units tested positive for l pneumophila of which two belonged to serogroup 1 samples which were considered safe based on hpc counts n 84 100 cfu ml 1 45 units contained more than 2000 gu l 1 legionella spp units connected directly to the drinking water supply n 145 contained significantly more legionella spp as to units which were connected to an external reservoir n 68 with respectively 4 9 1 5 vs 3 9 1 6 log10 gu l 1 mann whitney u test p 0 005 as can be seen in table 2 and depicted in fig 3 units which received a dldd as compared to no disinfectant contained an almost statistically significant different legionella spp load p 0 005 units receiving a shock dose with or without a dldd also contained significantly less legionella spp as compared to units receiving no treatment p 0 005 between the different types of disinfectants units receiving products based on hypochlorous acid both as a dldd and shock dose treatment contained a legionella spp load below the detection limit p 0 005 units receiving high doses of silver ions delivered as a weekly shock dose also contained a lower legionella spp load 2 8 0 7 log10 gu l 1 as compared to the units which received no treatment p 0 005 3 3 2 4 presence of amoeba dna the presence of amoeba was confirmed in 92 out of 213 units 43 tested one unit was positive for acanthamoeba 2 units contained both hartmannella and naegleria vahlkampfia and the remainder contained only hartmannella bacterial fungal and legionella spp concentrations were significantly higher in the presence of amoeba p 0 005 yet no difference in average hpc p 0 333 was found between the presence or absence of amoeba lefse analysis fig 4 revealed that the bacterial families burkholderiaceae alphaproteobacteria incertae sedis bradyrhizobiaceae microbacteriaceae legionellaceae rhodocyclaceae sphingomonadaceae reyranellaceae were associated with the presence of amoeba in contrast geodermatophilaceae sphingomonadaceae beijerinckiaceae and mycobacteriaceae were positively associated with the absence of amoeba 4 discussion microbial aerosol formation during dental treatment can pose a risk to both the dental staff and patient pankhurst and coulter 2007 with an ageing population the patients immune system gradually deteriorates making them more vulnerable to infection kline and bowdish 2016 additionally the current covid 19 pandemic creates a whole new population of patients with long term pulmonary complications making them potentially vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections cox et al 2020 koehler et al 2020 in this study we set out to determine the microbial load and microbiome of dutch dental unit water and the factors influencing these parameters we found that 61 of the dental units sampled contained a higher hpc than recommended furthermore 71 of the dental units sampled contained legionella spp which could be a potential health issue muder and yu 2002 molecular analysis revealed that nearly all dental units 98 contained fungi and that each dental unit contained a unique microbiome off all factors studied only the treatment regime clearly altered the microbial load and had an influence on the microbiome further analysis showed that on genus level mycobacterium pseudomonas legionella spp coxiella and staphylococcus were found in the dental unit water with representatives of these genera being associated with community acquired pneumonia in the netherlands wiersinga et al 2018 case reports have linked legionnaires disease pneumonia eye infections and abscess formation to the presence of legionella pneumophila pseudomonas amoeba and non tuberculous mycobacteria in the dental unit water barbeau 2000 barbot et al 2012 martin 1987 petti 2017 the high prevalence of legionella spp found in the microbiome analysis was supported by q pcr analysis 73 vs 71 of units positive respectively as a primary source of these legionella spp the watermains is the most likely origin leoni et al 2015 and also in this study we found that dental units which were connected directly to the drinking watermains contained significantly more legionella spp even though 6 units 0 03 tested positive for l pneumophila and should raise concern it is a low prevalence when compared to studies reporting a prevalence of 22 78 spagnolo et al 2019 zanetti et al 2000 this difference might be explained by higher seasonal temperatures in italy as compared to the netherlands promoting the growth of legionella and amoeba karagiannis et al 2009 within the netherlands no geographic clustering on the prevalence of legionella was found data not shown which could be explained by the relatively small size of the netherlands resulting in small temperature differences proliferation of amoeba and legionella requires a minimum biofilm concentration of about 106 cfu cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 biofilms grown under hydrodynamic stress can contain 100 1000 times more bacterial cells as compared to the equivalent volume effluent from the same length of 4 mm inner diameter tubing hoogenkamp et al 2020 thus units containing more than 103 cfu ml 1 in the effluent could contain about 105 106 cfu cm 2 biofilm making 47 of the units eligible as a breeding ground for amoeba indeed in this study 43 of the units tested positive for the presence of amoeba and is supported by significant positive correlations between the presence of amoeba and high bacterial and fungal dna load amoeba resistant bacterial families burkholderiaceae alphaproteobacteria incertae sedis bradyrhizobiaceae microbacteriaceae legionellaceae and sphingomonadaceae and the amoebal prey organisms reynanellaceae 86 of units and rhodocyclaceae bacterium 80 of units were more abundant in the presence of amoeba as delineated by lefse analysis these results are in line with culturing studies showing similar associations paquet and charette 2016 van der kooij et al 2018 a duws biofilm is the causative source of the continuous contamination of the effluent the microbiological quality of the dental unit water is deemed adequate when the european drinking water standard is met traditionally the unit is flushed prior to sampling and determination of the hpc however flushing masks the extent of biofilm contamination in the unit as it temporarily washes out the planktonic bacteria rice et al 2006 subsequent culturing of the effluent on suboptimal culturing media could then lead to a false sense of security when judging microbial contamination of the unit water douterelo et al 2018 zanetti et al 2000 despite flushing for 30 s only 39 of the units sampled in this study complied to the drinking water standard which is comparable to other studies pasquarella et al 2012 walker et al 2004 alternatively analyzing the biofilm itself would give the best impression of the presence of possible opportunistic pathogens and the severity of biofilm formation especially considering that each dental unit has its own biofilm ecosystem however taking a biofilm sample from the duws is not feasible due to the destructive nature of sampling to the dental unit and collecting a whole day effluent sample is impossible hoogenkamp et al 2020 therefore a proxy sample for the biofilm should be used in this study an effluent sample was taken immediately after an overnight stagnancy period prior to any maintenance regime when the biofilm is in its relaxed state relaxed biofilm sample when analyzing the molecular dna parameters of the rbs sample and correlating this to the hpc only a weak correlation was found intriguingly 45 out of 84 units that had an hpc less than 100 cfu ml 1 contained more than 2000 gu l 1 legionella spp dna in daily practice the legionella spp contamination would not have been detected as additional testing for legionella in the netherlands is only performed when hpc levels exceed 104 cfu ml 1 growth of legionella is not supported by r2a agar on which hpc is determined the presence of legionella and other opportunistic micro organisms are more likely to be detected in a biofilm sample pierre et al 2019 walker et al 2004 the relaxed biofilm sample taken in this study could serve as a proxy as the overnight stagnancy of the unit water results in viscoelastic relaxation of the biofilm in which micro organisms can easily diffuse or migrate out of the biofilm into the lumen of the tube abe et al 2011 peterson et al 2015 to minimize bacterial growth in the duws manufacturers are obliged to provide a disinfection protocol to disinfect the waterlines of the dental unit the council directive of the european union 1993 units which get administered hydrogen peroxide based products as a dldd contained a significantly lower hpc bacterial 16s rdna and legionella spp dna concentration delivering an additional weekly shock dose treatment with hydrogen peroxide silver ions or hypochlorous acid seemed to further prevent bacterial growth hypochlorous acid is a strong oxidizing agent capable of destroying the membrane integrity and silver ions are known to interact with the bacterial membrane and bind to the phosphate groups during dna replication while the latter can inhibit legionella replication at relatively low concentrations intracellularly and biofilm grown legionellae are less sensitive to silver unger and lück 2012 amoeba are known to be more resistant to antimicrobial agents than bacteria and feed on both live and dead biofilms cervero aragó et al 2015 biofilm removal rather than killing is of prime importance as no significant difference in the prevalence of amoeba was found between the different types of disinfectant applied currently the fungal load is not determined to assess the quality of the dental unit water being more complex organisms than bacteria fungi are less sensitive to water disinfecting agents hageskal et al 2012 nett et al 2008 this is supported by the finding that a shock dose treatment appears to be necessary to reduce the fungal load the use of a dldd disinfectant alone could even be unwanted as proliferation of fungi has been reported especially in situations where small amounts of prokaryotic organisms were found in the source water porteous et al 2003 this is supported by our finding that all samples with less than 0 5 µg ml 1 bacterial 16s rdna always contained detectable concentrations of fungal rdna see data in brief the relationship between the microbiological contamination of dental unit water and the risk for infection remains unclear pankhurst and coulter 2007 this ambiguity might result from a lack of awareness of a link between an infection in the aftermath of a dental treatment a strict adherence to an infection control protocol supported with frequent testing has proven effective in keeping biofilm growth under control within a dental school setting baudet et al 2020 volgenant and persoon 2019 as only half of the dental offices screened in this study applied some sort of infection control measure it is clear that they too have a vital role in ensuring water quality and safety moreover as participation in this study was voluntary it is to be expected that only dental offices which perform active infection control measures responded it may therefore be possible that other not tested units have an even worse outcome than reported here further research is needed to assess which disinfectants and treatment regimens are able to remove biofilm from the duws in order to help the general dentist practice to control biofilm formation and guarantee patient safety 5 conclusion the vast majority of dental unit water in the netherlands exceed infection control guidelines fungi legionella spp and amoeba are frequently detected in dutch dental units a risk assessment based only on determining the hpc in the effluent is underestimating the maximum possible biological load and is therefore not sufficient a proxy relaxed biofilm state sample in combination with q pcr techniques is a valuable tool to monitor the microbiological quality and the presence of opportunistic pathogens in dental unit water the use of generic disinfection protocols are likely to be ineffective in guaranteeing safe dental unit water infection control guidelines should focus on the presence and control of biofilm formation as this is the source of reinfection of the effluent water credit authorship contribution statement

16924,the recent discovery of comammox nitrospira as complete nitrifiers has significantly enriched our understanding on the nitrogen cycle yet little is known about their metabolic transcripts in natural aquatic ecosystems using the genome centric metatranscriptomics we provided the first in situ expression patterns of comammox nitrospira along the yangtze river our study confirmed widespread expressions of comammox nitrospira with the highest transcription accounting for 33 3 and 63 8 of amoa and nxrab genes expressed in ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops and nitrospira sublineages i ii respectively moreover comammox two clades differed in nitrification with clade a acting as the dominator to ammonia oxidation in comammox and clade b contributing more transcripts to nitrite oxidation than to ammonia oxidation compared to canonical nitrospira comammox community had lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but far higher expressions in urea transport and hydrolysis facilitating to derivation of ammonia and energy mainly through intracellular ureolytic metabolism this suggests no need for reciprocal feeding between canonical nitrospira and aops in a natural river aerobic mixotrophy of comammox bacteria was suggested by expressions of genes coding for respiratory complexes i v oxidative reductive tca cycle oxygen stress defenses and transport catabolism of simple carbohydrates and low biosynthetic cost amino acids intriguingly significant positive correlations among expressions of ammonia monooxygenases hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and copper dependent nitrite reductase indicated that comammox nitrospira had the potential of converting nitrite to nitric oxide accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic conditions while gene expressions in this pathway were significantly and positively associated with ph overall this study illustrated novel transcriptional characteristics of comammox nitrospira and highlighted the necessity of reassessing their contributions to biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling with perspective of in situ meta omics as well as culture experiments key words genome centric metatranscriptomics complete nitrifiers comammox nitrospira in situ expression patterns environmental drivers yangtze river 1 introduction nitrification has been assumed as a two step process mediated by distinct chemolithoautotrophic microbes ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa könneke et al 2005 or bacteria aob followed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob teske et al 1994 however the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira catalyzing ammonia oxidation to nitrate in single organisms have fundamentally updated the long held dogma of two step nitrification daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 so far all known comammox bacteria belong to sublineage ii of nitrospira which represents the most diverse nob

et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the amo operons of comammox nitrospira form two divergent clades named as comammox clades a and b which are phylogenetically distant from homologs of aoa and aob daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 comammox nitrospira are the third group of ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops contributing largely to nitrifier abundances and activity on earth for example comammox nitrospira have been observed to be the most abundant aops or occupy high proportions in overall nitrospira of engineered habitats including drinking water systems wang et al 2017 groundwater wells

of nitrogen load in large rivers huang et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated the widespread existence of comammox nitrospira and the significant influences of environmental factors on their relative abundances and metabolic functions in rivers black and just 2018 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 moreover newly recovered comammox nitrospira genomes have improved the phylogenomic resolution to facilitate further research on biogeography liu et al 2020 nevertheless the lack of knowledge so far about the in situ expression profiles of comammox nitrospira in large rivers restrains our understanding of the ecological significances of complete nitrification in complex natural freshwater habitats to address this issue we implemented synchronous monitoring along the yangtze river the largest river in asia and obtained the first in situ expression profiles of comammox nitrospira using the genome centric metatranscriptomics our study demonstrated the widespread expressions of comammox nitrospira with the highest transcriptional level in the most upstream site of study area particularly a difference of nitrification characteristics between comammox clade a and b was found compared to canonical nitrospira comammox community had lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but higher expressions in urea degradation enabling them to derive ammonia and energy intracellularly this implied no need for reciprocal feeding between canonical nitrospira and aops comammox bacteria might potentially transform nitrite to nitric oxide no during ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic conditions and gene expressions in this pathway were closely related with ph 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and environmental data measurement the nitrogen load along the mainbody of the yangtze river has drawn great attention liu et al 2018 a thorough understanding of metabolic characteristics of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers is critical for optimizing nitrogen load management strategies therein in march 2018 planktonic microbial biomass for metatranscriptomic sequencing was synchronously sampled in ten national hydrologic stations from yibin yb in the upper reach to xuliujing xlj in the estuary fig 1 a table s1 where we could be aided with sufficient equipment and licenses from changjiang water

cdna was sequenced on the illumina hiseq x ten platform majorbio company shanghai china to generate 150 bp paired end reads with an insert size of 300 bp all raw metatranscriptomic datasets can be found at the ncbi sequence read archive under accession numbers srr13151498 srr13151507 raw paired end reads were initially pretreated using sickle v 1 200 q 20 l 50 https github com najoshi sickle and ngs qc toolkit v 2 3 3 l 70 s 20 patel and jain 2012 then rrna sequences were trimmed off using sortmerna v 2 0 num alignments 1 e 10 10 based on silva database for bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic sequences kopylova et al 2012 clean non rrna reads from large datasets were randomly split into small pieces and individually de novo assembled into transcript sequences with a minimum length of 500 bp using trinity v 2 8 1 grabherr et al 2011 statistics of raw rna reads clean non rrna reads and assemblies of each dataset were summarized in table s2 open reading frames orfs were predicted on the assembled sequences using transgenescan v 1 2 1 ismail et al 2014 clean non rrna reads were mapped back to the predicted nucleotide orfs using bbmap v 37 48 https sourceforge net projects bbmap with minimum identity of 90 read counts were calculated for each orf and normalized as rpkm values reads per kilobase per million mapped reads all orfs were searched against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database for functional annotation using diamond v 0 8 38 with the parameters e 1e 5 f 6 k 1 buchfink et al 2015 key ammonia oxidation transcript sequences were queried against the ncbi non redundant nr database using blastp v 2 2 31 for manual inspection 2 3 phylogenetic analysis of key ammonia oxidation transcript sequences all key amo and hao amino acid transcript orfs of comammox nitrospira were identified based on the above functional annotation results some reference and outgroup sequences were also downloaded from the ncbi protein database all sequences were aligned using mafft v 7 310 katoh and standley 2013 the alignments were then trimmed using trimal v 1 3 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 to remove poorly aligned regions i e columns composed of over 90 gaps maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were built based on 1 000 bootstraps using fasttree v 2 1 price et al 2010 where a jones taylor thornton evolutionary model and cat approximation with 20 rate categories were employed 2 4 evaluation of in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifier communities to compare the ammonia oxidation transcriptional abundances among comammox nitrospira aoa and aob communities a hybrid annotation pipeline yang et al 2014 was conducted to screen clean non rrna reads against our manually constructed amoa database detailed procedures and parameters refer to our previous study liu et al 2020 the amoa like hits were normalized by sequence depths among different samples which were expressed as the hit numbers per 108 clean non rrna reads to obtain the expression profiles of comammox versus canonical nitrospira genome centric metatranscriptomics strategies were executed as follows a wide range of 36 nitrospira genomes comprising of 27 separate species were downloaded from the available databases to form the reference pool table s3 which were the representatives covering the most concerning metabolic features of nitrospira orfs were predicted for all genomes using prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and queried against the kegg and clusters of orthologous groups cog databases using diamond as described above additionally a set of carbohydrate related genes were identified by profile hidden markov model searches against carbohydrate active enzymes cazy database lombard et al 2014 metabolic reconstruction was based on kegg pathway maps the subcellular localization of the identified glycoside hydrolases and peptidases were predicted using cello v 2 5 yu et al 2004 clean non rrna reads of each dataset were searched against the ncbi nr database using diamond with the following analysis in megan v 6 11 1 huson et al 2007 using the lowest common ancestor algorithm to extract nitrospira reads based on the taxonomy black and just 2018 bbmap was applied to align all these nitrospira reads against the genomic nucleotide orfs with a minimum identity of 90 such two stage alignments might facilitate to extract comammox reads more accurately according to liu et al 2020 cotto et al 2020 and controlled experiments in this study see supplementary information a minimum alignment identity of 90 could reduce cross assignments of reads between comammox and canonical nitrospira genomes used herein especially no cross assignments was observed for key nitrogen cycling genes between comammox and canonical nitrospira for comparisons of the ammonia or nitrite oxidation transcriptional abundances among distinct nitrospira communities read counts for the nitrospira amoabc or nxrab genes respectively were normalized by sequence depths and expressed as the hit numbers per 108 clean non rrna reads for profiling the expressions across different functional genes read counts were calculated for each genomic orf and normalized as the rpkm values by mapping reads and orf lengths functional gene expression levels were inferred based on the overall rpkm values of orfs assigned to a given orthologous gene of kegg or cog 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed based on the community wide expression profiles of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers using r language v 3 5 0 https www r project org or originpro 2018 p 0 05 with 999 permutations was considered significant for all statistical tests non metric multidimensional scaling nmds metamds function in vegan was used to visualize the bray curtis dissimilarities of orthologous gene expression compositions between comammox and canonical nitrospira analysis of similarity anosim anosim function in vegan was then conducted to test the significance of difference distance based redundancy analysis dbrda capscale function in vegan was executed to quantify the overall effects of environmental factors and geographic distance on orthologous gene expression compositions of comammox and canonical nitrospira supplementary information pairwise spearman s rcorr function in hmisc or pearson s correlations among the expressions of key nitrification related genes and environmental factors were calculated to identify niche preferences 3 results and discussion 3 1 evidence for transcription of comammox nitrospira comammox nitrospira transcription or activity has been detected in natural ecosystems such as soils and freshwater sediments whereas most studies relied on enrichment cultures or microcosm experiments instead of in situ yu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 li et al 2019 to deepen our understandings metatranscriptomics was utilized here to validate the in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river for all samples 547 transcript orfs were assigned to comammox nitrospira including 55 orfs affiliated with comammox amoabc and haoa genes table s4 both amo and hao operons are reliable biomarkers for comammox identification yu et al 2018 phylogenetic trees showed that all amoabc and haoa transcript orfs fell into comammox clade a clusters and were closely related to the genes on clade a i genomes e g yr whu yr jj yr xlj 3 fig s2 table s3 a total of 50 amoabc and haoa transcript orfs were assembled from the most upstream site yb of study area with exceptionally higher expressions average rpkm 115 8 and 30 4 whereas only five amoc transcript orfs were from other sites with lower expressions average rpkm 47 4 this might suggest a relatively high potential of ammonia oxidation activity of comammox nitrospira in the upper reach of the yangtze the number and expression of comammox related amoc transcript orfs were larger than those of amoa and amob which was consistent with the finding of a previous study yu et al 2018 and could be attributed to multicopy of amoc in most comammox genomes koch et al 2019 comammox affiliated transcript orfs were detected at all sites suggesting wide expressions of complete nitrifiers along the yangtze river we compared the transcriptional abundances of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers by searching clean non rrna reads against two constructed reference databases it should be noted that numbers of comammox reads obtained using the aop amoa amino acid database and amoabc gene sequences on all nitrospira reference genomes were significantly correlated spearman s r 0 97 p 0 001 fig s3 suggesting uniformity of these two methods in assessing comammox ammonia oxidation transcripts the nxr gene sequences have also been utilized to investigate the contribution of comammox to overall nitrospira in nitrite oxidation black and just 2018 yu et al 2018 fowler et al 2018 though more ideal methods are needed comammox nitrospira had relatively high transcriptional abundances in site yb constituting 33 3 and 63 8 of aops amoa and nitrospira nxrab gene expressions respectively fig 1b at those sites downstream yb the transcriptional abundances of canonical aoa aob and nitrospira sublineages i ii outnumbered comammox nitrospira by 4 0 69 6 and 14 7 149 9 folds separately these results suggested that comammox nitrospira might contribute more to nitrifying activity in the upper reach though they were found expressed widely which was consistent with the biogeographic pattern of comammox relative abundance obtained by metagenomics liu et al 2020 comammox nitrospira were less abundant and expressed than either aoa or aob in a few middle and lower reach locations along the yangtze river within comammox nitrospira clade a i was the most expressed community in ammonia oxidation accounting for an average of 79 5 50 100 of comammox amoabc gene expressions fig 1c this was generally uniform with the above results obtained through orfs identification clade a i was also the most abundant comammox community over the mainbody of this large river liu et al 2020 li et al 2019 and zheng et al 2019 reported that clade a were the most active comammox in some agricultural soils n inopinata cluster in a i and wwtps ca n nitrosa cluster in a ii but the dominant active species were quite different from those in the yangtze river yr whu yr jj yr xlj 3 sg bin2 in a i fig 1d table s3 these findings confirmed broad and flexible niches of comammox clade a in natural and engineered environments as also suggested by palomo et al 2019 based on the global survey the most expressed clade a species were all associated with groundwater drinking water and riverine ecosystems fig 1d table s3 indicating similar active comammox species among these environments notably clade b contributed far more to comammox nxrab gene expressions average 28 6 up to 60 6 than to amoabc gene expressions average 1 3 and outcompeted clade a in two sampling sites fig 1c which suggested a more critical role of clade b in nitrite oxidation than in ammonia oxidation no clade b amoabc orfs were found on the de novo assembled transcript contigs either fig s2 moreover the clade b nxrab expressions and its percentage in comammox nxrab expressions were all significantly and positively correlated with the amoa and nxrab expressions of canonical aops and nitrospira spearman s r 0 82 0 95 p 0 003 fig 2 thus clade b were speculated to perform the similar nitrifying feature as canonical nitrospira in this river reach where they might be fed by aoa and aob on one hand distinct nitrifying niches of comammox two clades might be due to the fact that they harbored different ammonia uptake systems clade b encode mep type ammonia transporters with higher affinity and lower uptake capacity while clade a encode rh type transporters with lower affinity and higher uptake capacity palomo et al 2018 clade a rather than clade b might adapt to the mainstream of the yangtze river with relatively higher ammonia contents liu et al 2020 on the other hand high dissimilarity of amoa gene sequences between clades a and b might be another reason for their distinct niches in the ammonia oxidation process palomo et al 2018 for instance clade b possessed more abundant amoa genes than clade a in relatively oligotrophic groundwater systems and upper yangtze river fowler et al 2018 liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 detected no ammonia oxidation activity of clade b but largely active clade a in various ammonia enriched wwtps wang et al 2019 revealed that clade b could autotrophically grow in forest and paddy soils only in the absence of ammonia amendment theoretically shortening nitrification pathway with loss of ammonia oxidation capacity might result in an increased atp production rate other than yield for clade b a phylogenetic group residing between canonical nitrospira sublineages i and ii palomo et al 2018 although more efforts are needed to illustrate the ammonia and nitrite oxidation kinetics of yet uncultured clade b the comammox two clades may differ in nitrification characteristics along the yangtze river and the nitrite oxidation ability of clade b should be highlighted 3 2 expression patterns of comammox nitrospira community we obtained an integrated transcriptional atlas of comammox nitrospira by gathering the data from all samples nmds showed that the orthologous gene expression compositions of comammox species were different from those of canonical nitrospira which were further confirmed by anosim r 0 28 p 0 004 fig s4 comammox and canonical nitrospira had 1 546 and 1 585 transcribed orthologous genes respectively in which clade a n 1 539 had a higher diversity of transcribed orthologous genes than clade b n 158 clade a active genes recruited 75 8 fold higher number of transcriptional sequences than clade b 3 2 1 nitrogen metabolism distinct expression patterns of the key nitrogen cycling genes were observed between comammox and canonical nitrospira depicting niche specialization among nitrifiers in this freshwater ecosystem fig 3 table 1 comammox nitrospira had large expressions of all key genes involved in complete nitrification occupying 11 0 of comammox transcripts amoc was the most transcribed gene for comammox fig s5 besides low amoabc expressions clade b also possessed a low expression level of haoa gene average rpkm 4 5 and were then confirmed to play a teeny role in ammonia and hydroxylamine oxidation for canonical nitrospira nxrab were the most transcribed genes the expressions of which accounted for 13 7 of total transcripts and displayed greater than those of complete nitrifiers similar to betaproteobacterial aob all studied comammox genomes harbor genes for either heme exporter ccmabcd or cytochrome c biogenesis ccmefgh proteins which are absent in most canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii fig s6 the expressions of all these genes were observed for comammox instead of canonical nitrospira comammox amo hao and ccm operons are located in the proximate genomic region and the expressions of almost full series of ccm genes may confer an advantage in biosynthesis or activation of amo and hao van kessel et al 2015 compared to canonical nitrospira comammox nitrospira had a higher diversity and transcriptional level of expressed copper homeostasis genes e g copacd such gene expressions might confer increasing cu2 uptake or higher cu2 tolerance in large rivers as comammox bacteria may demand more copper as cofactor for amo biosynthesis than canonical nitrospira palomo et al 2018 besides nitrification related genes all analyzed nitrospira genomes encode copper dependent nitrite reductases nirk that form no from nitrite in denitrifying organisms and some other nitrifiers fig s6 interestingly comammox nitrospira possessed a high expression for nirk average rpkm 3871 0 which was the fourth most transcribed gene in comammox transcripts and exhibited 55 0 fold larger than that of canonical nitrospira fig s5 table 1 a no responsive regulator nnrs associated with nitrosative stress resistance was also expressed similarly black and just 2018 observed highly abundant nirk genes of comammox nitrospira within the mussel sediment of upper mississippi river umr kits et al 2019 suggested that the purely cultured comammox n inopinata could release no under oxic conditions and nirk was the second most abundant protein in its proteome which supported the above finding in oxygen saturated river water consequently all metagenomic metatranscriptomic and kinetic studies implied that nitrate was not the only obligate product during nitrification in comammox nitrospira and the denitrification could lead to no accumulation as for other denitrifying genes all nitrospira lack the key no reductases norbc but encode either a no reductase activation protein or transcriptional regulator fig s6 comammox nitrospira had 3 7 22 1 fold lower expressions of these genes than canonical nitrospira in the yangtze river they are possibly involved in no detoxification it was reported that the isolated comammox n inopinata could not denitrify no to nitrous oxide n2o but produced low n2o by abiotic conversion of hydroxylamine kits et al 2019 more roles of these no reduction chaperone genes in nitrospira remain to be determined in depth for ammonia uptake the expression of rh type transporter encoded by comammox clade a was 4 8 fold lower than that of mep type transporter of canonical nitrospira and its contribution to comammox transcripts 0 0036 was also lower than that to canonical nitrospira transcripts 0 0081 table 1 the expression of clade b ammonia transporter was not detected it was thus hypothesized that comammox bacteria had relatively weak capacity of utilizing extracellular ammonia sources in the yangtze river however ammonia can also originate from intracellular urea hydrolysis we detected relatively high expressions of high affinity urea transporters urtabcde ureases ureabcfgh and carbamate kinase arcc in comammox nitrospira meanwhile no expressions of the corresponding genes were observed for canonical nitrospira comammox organisms were reported to have an order of magnitude greater potentials for urea degradation than canonical nitrospira in mussel habitats of umr black and just 2018 which was similar with our results urea transport and hydrolysis are more common metabolisms in comammox than in canonical nitrospira fig s6 the observed niche separation in genomes and transcriptomes indicated that complete nitrifiers had advantages in deriving ammonia and energy through ureolytic activity in a natural large river koch et al 2015 had proposed a reciprocal feeding interaction between nob and aops in which nitrospira could supply ammonia to aops by hydrolyzing urea while aops would subsequently oxidize ammonia to nitrite offering energy sources for nitrospira in the yangtze river such reciprocal feeding seemed not established due to much higher expressions of ureolytic genes in comammox bacteria compared to canonical nitrospira a significant and positive correlation was observed between expressions of canonical aops amoa and nitrospira nxrab genes pearson s adjusted r 2 0 80 p 0 001 data source from fig 1b therefore canonical aops might oxidize ammonia to nitrite providing canonical nitrospira with energy sources but no ammonia was produced by canonical nitrospira through ureolytic activity possibly due to the existence of comammox bacteria in the yangtze river for ammonia assimilation comammox nitrospira possessed 3 2 7 8 fold lower expressions of glutamate synthase gltbd glutamine synthase glna and nitrogen regulatory protein p ii than canonical nitrospira the contributions of such gene expressions to comammox transcripts 0 096 were also lower than those to canonical nitrospira transcripts 0 28 kits et al 2017 suggested that the growth rate of comammox n inopinata was slower than those of canonical nitrifiers in oligotrophic and dynamic habitats more energy production through ammonia oxidation might help comammox organisms especially clade a to survive in various environments with many competitors e g canonical nitrifiers for nitrite uptake assimilation no expression was observed for comammox nitrite transporter nark but a range of nitrite transporters i e nrtabc nirc and nark of canonical nitrospira were all expressed more importantly all studied comammox nitrospira lack the assimilatory nitrite reductase nira and cytochrome c nitrite reductases nrfah fig s6 and canonical nitrospira harbored an 18 9 fold higher expression of dissimilatory nitrite reductase nird than comammox organisms these transcriptomic findings demonstrated that comammox nitrospira could not utilize nitrite as sole nitrogen source for growth as proposed by palomo et al 2018 3 2 2 energy and carbon metabolisms genes coding for respiratory complexes i v are highly conserved in nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 in the yangtze river they were more expressed in canonical nitrospira 2 0 of transcripts than in comammox nitrospira 1 4 fig 3 table s5 besides h translocating nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductases nuo ten comammox genomes harbor an additional type of complex i i e na transporting nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductases nqr though the expressions were relatively low the prototype of nqr operons is from the marine aerobic bacteria vibrio alginolyticus steuber 2001 and all identified nqra sequences on comammox genomes are most closely related to β aob by blastp to ncbi nr database identity 68 2 71 5 implying acquisition by horizontal gene transfer additionally comammox nitrospira possessed 8 1 fold higher expressions of hydrogenase related genes e g hypf hyfr than canonical nitrospira these genes might confer comammox bacteria the potential of hydrogen oxidation coupled to sulfur reduction camejo et al 2017 glycoside hydrolases glycosyltransferases and carbohydrate esterases dominated the transcriptional pool of carbohydrate active enzymes in nitrospira fig 3 table s5 for comammox gh23 gh109 and gh74 were the most transcribed glycoside hydrolase families encoding chitin peptidoglycan lyase acetyl galactosaminidase hexosaminidase or glucanase etc genes coding for glucosidase gh3 amylomaltase gh77 and amylase gh13 were also expressed although most of them were predicted to be cytoplasmic some gh23 and gh74 could play important roles in periplasmic or extracellular environments fig 3 fig s7 thus complete nitrifiers might participate in carbohydrate breakdown for riverine bacterial community notably whether microbes can take up and utilize carbohydrates should depend on transporter activity lücker et al 2010 we indeed detected the expression of a monosaccharide atp dependent transport system in comammox rather than canonical nitrospira indicating a potential of metabolizing simple sugars gt2 gt4 and gt51 were the most expressed glycosyltransferase families for comammox nitrospira acting on the formation of glycosidic bonds particularly comammox bacteria expressed almost full genes for cellulose glycogen dap type peptidoglycan or kdo2 lipid a a precursor of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis while genes encoding lipoprotein releasing and lipopolysaccharide export systems were also transcribed which suggested carbon storage as cell walls membranes intracellular and extracellular polymeric substances moreover comammox bacteria expressed genes encoding catechol 2 3 dioxygenase monomeric catechol outer membrane receptor and protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase the ability of hydrolyzing aromatic rings has been also demonstrated for n inopinata by han et al 2019 gaining fundamental insights into micropollutant transformation by nitrifiers comammox and canonical nitrospira expressed almost full genes encoding central carbon metabolic pathways including the glycolysis gluconeogenesis pentose phosphate pathway and tca cycle fig 3 table s5 suggesting they should be able to metabolize hexose sugars lücker et al 2010 they could also use ethanol acetate and pyruvate for replenishing tca cycle intermediates high expressions of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductases were observed average rpkm 200 4 5384 9 some uncultured nitrospira have been reported to take up pyruvate in wastewater treatment plants daims et al 2001 the oxidative tca cycle shares most enzymes with the reductive tca rtca cycle except for citrate synthase cs and 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex ogdc while the corresponding key enzymes for rtca cycle were atp citrate lyase acl and 2 oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase ofor respectively lücker et al 2010 we found that comammox bacteria possessed 5 7 fold higher expression of acl than cs and 6 0 fold higher activity of ofor than ogdc similar results were observed for canonical nitrospira although complete nitrifiers might benefit from a mixotrophic lifestyle by utilizing extracellular urea or carbohydrates their autotrophic process by co2 fixation through rtca cycle was putatively dominant in the yangtze river peptides and amino acids are important carbon or energy sources for organisms although comammox and canonical nitrospira expressed many cytoplasmic peptidases some murein endopeptidases zn dependent carboxypeptidases and aminopeptidases were predicted to be located in outer membrane periplasmic or extracellular environments fig 3 fig s7 furthermore comammox bacteria expressed genes for a range of amino acid transporters and catabolic pathways linking alanine aspartate asparagine glutamate glutamine glycine serine threonine cysteine and proline to central metabolisms fig 3 table s5 this could allow them to utilize proteins and amino acids as alternative carbon or energy sources four most highly biosynthetic cost amino acids i e phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan and histidine akashi and gojobori 2002 could be synthesized by comammox bacteria but the degradation pathways were incomplete and not that expressing for all genomes this suggested that complete nitrifiers have been selected to potentially degrade low biosynthetic cost amino acids interestingly the expressions of alanine dehydrogenase glutamate dehydrogenase l aspartate oxidase glycine dehydrogenase as well as predicted amidohydrolases average rpkm 20 7 306 8 table s5 involved in deamination suggested that amino acids were the critical nitrogen and energy source besides urea and free ammonia for comammox nitrospira seven newly recovered comammox genomes from the yangtze river harbored 1 3 peptidases within their ammonia oxidation gene clusters for possible co expressions of peptidases amo and hao liu et al 2020 which would provide genomic evidence for the above transcriptomic findings 3 2 3 stress response defense and resistance for response to environmental stress 50 genes encoding oxygen stress defense multidrug efflux system metal resistance salt resistance and cold and heat shock resistance were mostly expressed in comammox and canonical nitrospira fig 3 table s6 planktonic nitrospira were exposed to a plethora of do in water of the yangtze river monitoring data 10 0 0 5 mg l accordingly catalases peroxidases peroxiredoxins cu zn family superoxide dismutase chlorite dismutase or bacterioferritin were highly expressed 1 3 of transcripts protecting comammox nitrospira from radicals and reactive oxygen species palomo et al 2018 compared to comammox no catalase or superoxide dismutase was transcribed in canonical nitrospira both comammox and canonical nitrospira also possessed a very high expression of cytochrome bd type quinol oxidase average rpkm 1292 9 and 3153 1 respectively table s5 all studied genomes encode 4 10 copies of this high affinity enzyme some of which not only allows organisms to respire oxygen under aerobic states but also has evolved for oxidative stress protection richardson 2000 moreover for response to temperature fluctuation 10 4 15 0 c the heat and cold shock resistance genes were highly expressed in nitrospira 0 56 1 1 of transcripts comammox nitrospira had 3 4 fold lower transcripts of cold shock resistance genes but higher expressions of heat shock resistance genes than canonical nitrospira suggesting distinct optimum metabolizing temperatures between them indeed our previous study demonstrated that temperature was one of the key factors determining niche separation between planktonic comammox and canonical nitrospira liu et al 2020 relatively low expressions of the multidrug efflux system metal and salt resistance genes were observed for nitrospira because the potentially toxic substances e g antibiotics and metals were not so enriched in fluvial water as sewage lücker et al 2010 3 3 environmental effects on expressions of comammox nitrospira community we further explored how environmental factors influenced the in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira community along the yangtze river the dbrda showed that ph and no2 n were significantly associated with the compositional variation of orthologous gene expressions of both comammox and canonical nitrospira p 0 002 0 038 while temperature and tn were only related to that of comammox nitrospira p 0 020 table s7 the above environmental factors explained a total of 53 2 and 34 5 of expression variation for comammox and canonical nitrospira respectively which were much higher than the overall explanatory proportions by geographic distance fig s8 moreover the pure effect 49 3 of environmental factors on comammox nitrospira was about 2 fold higher than that 25 1 on canonical nitrospira these observations suggested a critical role of environmental selection in shaping the expression pattern of comammox rather than canonical nitrospira combined with our metagenomic study liu et al 2020 we confirmed that environmental selection determined the community abundance and expression variation of comammox nitrospira along the yangtze river furthermore specific associations between the expressions of comammox nitrification related genes and environmental variables were investigated fig 4 fig s9 we found significant and positive correlations between ph and the expressions of comammox amoa amoc amoabc haoa and nirk genes spearman s r 0 72 0 89 p 0 020 while no significant correlations were identified between these gene expressions and any other factors including nutrients p 0 11 no significant relationships were found between comammox nitrite oxidation expression level and all analyzed environmental factors p 0 13 comammox amoa abundance was also significantly and positively correlated with ph in the yangtze river liu et al 2020 s xu et al 2020 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira preferred to grow in slightly alkaline environments the optimal ph values for amo and hao of canonical aops are around 7 0 8 0 however it remains unknown about that of comammox nitrospira blum et al 2018 for the freshwater ammonia oxidizers the influence of ph 7 0 8 5 on the reaction activity should not be ignored jones and hood 1980 as relatively rare species comammox bacteria could be sensitive to environmental variation although further experiments are needed to verify our observations ph could be an important indicator for comammox amo and hao expressions in large rivers no directly significant correlations were observed between tn or nh3 n and the ammonia oxidation transcriptional abundances of comammox nitrospira because comammox bacteria were likely to have multiple nitrogen sources like ammonia urea and amino acids from extracellular or intracellular environments however we found that the overall expressions of ccmabcdefgh genes were significantly and negatively correlated with nutrient gradients such as tn nh3 n and tp spearman s r 0 66 0 82 p 0 040 which indicated oligotrophic dynamics of heme export and cytochrome c type biogenesis processes in comammox nitrospira these genes are involved in energy transduction e g respiration co2 binding and hydroxylamine oxidation as well as other cellular processes sanders et al 2010 intriguingly we obtained significant and positive correlations among expressions of comammox amoa amob amoc amoabc haoa and nirk genes spearman s r 0 73 0 93 p 0 020 fig 4 meanwhile the expressions of these genes were less or not significantly correlated with comammox nxra nxrb and nxrab expressions spearman s r 0 33 0 66 p 0 038 0 987 significant positive correlations among amoabc haoa and nirk expressions implied that comammox nitrospira had the potential to transform nitrite to no accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n 1 2 and aerobic conditions along the yangtze river despite previous studies did not propose this hypothesis for riverine comammox nitrospira the newly recovered bins yr whu and yr xlj 3 from the yangtze river indeed encode a fkpa cytochrome c nirk gene set in proximate to amo or hao operons within their ammonia oxidation gene clusters possibly for stable co expressions liu et al 2020 fig 1d also showed that both yr whu and yr xlj 3 were the major expressed species these observations suggested that the potential of no production during ammonia oxidation should not be ignored for comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river kits et al 2019 demonstrated that comammox n inopinata does accumulate no under aerobic conditions and highlighted the dependency of no production on oxygen however they did not indicate co varied expressions of amoabc haoa and nirk genes aob mainly perform nitrifier denitrification under oxygen limited conditions liu et al 2021 which seems very different from comammox nitrospira although further experiments are needed to demonstrate the process of nitrite reduction to no for comammox nitrospira in large rivers we expect a possible cooperation among comammox nitrospira complete and truncated denitrifiers in an appropriate way as denitrifiers could transform comammox terminal products no3 n no or n2o into n2 this would facilitate a re evaluation of nitrogen transforming processes in natural ecosystems and even potentially upgrade and retrofit current schemes for better management of tn 4 conclusions genome centric metatranscriptomics was utilized to reveal the wide in situ expressions and novel transcriptional characters of comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river our study demonstrated a difference of nitrification characteristics between comammox two clades namely clade a were the most expressed comammox community in ammonia oxidation while clade b contributed more transcripts to nitrite oxidation than to ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira possessed lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but quite higher expressions in urea transport and degradation than canonical nitrospira which implied the restriction of reciprocal feeding between canonical nob and aops in large rivers aerobic mixotrophic lifestyle of comammox bacteria was suggested based on the expressions of genes for respiratory complexes i v oxidative reductive tca cycle transport and catabolism of simple carbohydrates and amino acids and oxygen stress defense comammox nitrospira had the potential of nitrite reduction to no accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic

16924,the recent discovery of comammox nitrospira as complete nitrifiers has significantly enriched our understanding on the nitrogen cycle yet little is known about their metabolic transcripts in natural aquatic ecosystems using the genome centric metatranscriptomics we provided the first in situ expression patterns of comammox nitrospira along the yangtze river our study confirmed widespread expressions of comammox nitrospira with the highest transcription accounting for 33 3 and 63 8 of amoa and nxrab genes expressed in ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops and nitrospira sublineages i ii respectively moreover comammox two clades differed in nitrification with clade a acting as the dominator to ammonia oxidation in comammox and clade b contributing more transcripts to nitrite oxidation than to ammonia oxidation compared to canonical nitrospira comammox community had lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but far higher expressions in urea transport and hydrolysis facilitating to derivation of ammonia and energy mainly through intracellular ureolytic metabolism this suggests no need for reciprocal feeding between canonical nitrospira and aops in a natural river aerobic mixotrophy of comammox bacteria was suggested by expressions of genes coding for respiratory complexes i v oxidative reductive tca cycle oxygen stress defenses and transport catabolism of simple carbohydrates and low biosynthetic cost amino acids intriguingly significant positive correlations among expressions of ammonia monooxygenases hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and copper dependent nitrite reductase indicated that comammox nitrospira had the potential of converting nitrite to nitric oxide accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic conditions while gene expressions in this pathway were significantly and positively associated with ph overall this study illustrated novel transcriptional characteristics of comammox nitrospira and highlighted the necessity of reassessing their contributions to biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling with perspective of in situ meta omics as well as culture experiments key words genome centric metatranscriptomics complete nitrifiers comammox nitrospira in situ expression patterns environmental drivers yangtze river 1 introduction nitrification has been assumed as a two step process mediated by distinct chemolithoautotrophic microbes ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa könneke et al 2005 or bacteria aob followed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob teske et al 1994 however the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira catalyzing ammonia oxidation to nitrate in single organisms have fundamentally updated the long held dogma of two step nitrification daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 so far all known comammox bacteria belong to sublineage ii of nitrospira which represents the most diverse nob clade poghosyan et al 2019 comammox nitrospira harbor a full series of ammonia monooxygenases amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenases hao and nitrite oxidoreductases nxr driving complete nitrification daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the amo operons of comammox nitrospira form two divergent clades named as comammox clades a and b which are phylogenetically distant from homologs of aoa and aob daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 comammox nitrospira are the third group of ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes aops contributing largely to nitrifier abundances and activity on earth for example comammox nitrospira have been observed to be the most abundant aops or occupy high proportions in overall nitrospira of engineered habitats including drinking water systems wang et al 2017 groundwater wells daims et al 2015 groundwater fed rapid gravity sand filters palomo et al 2016 fowler et al 2018 recirculating aquaculture systems bartelme et al 2017 and biological nutrient removal systems daims et al 2015 camejo et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 cotto et al 2020 global continental or region scale studies have indicated that comammox nitrospira outnumber canonical aops or nitrospira in natural ecosystems including freshwater palomo et al 2019 soils hu and he 2017 palomo et al 2019 osburn and barrett 2020 and sediments shi et al 2020 y xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 higher ammonia oxidation activity of comammox nitrospira than those of either aoa or aob has been demonstrated in some wastewater treatment plants wwtps zheng et al 2019 as well as pasture arable forest and paddy soils li et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in recent years genome centric metagenomics has been utilized to gain the taxonomic and functional information of uncultured species from complex microbial assemblages speth et al 2016 to date multiple high quality draft genomes of comammox nitrospira have been reconstructed to interpret their taxonomic affiliations metabolic potentials evolutionary history besides relative abundances in environments daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 camejo et al 2017 wang et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 palomo et al 2018 koch et al 2019 comparative genomics has demonstrated the niche specialization among comammox clades and canonical nitrifiers in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms alternative electron donors energy conservation and transduction and stress response and defense mechanisms camejo et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 palomo et al 2018 koch et al 2019 comammox nitrospira might utilize mixotrophic metabolisms as well as tolerate microaerobic and oligotrophic conditions palomo et al 2018 the identification of novel metabolic pathways and interactions among key nitrifiers has revolutionized our understandings of nitrogen cycling microbes requiring further validation at the transcriptional level lawson and lücker 2018 koch et al 2019 genome centric metatranscriptomics can provide exact information about the in situ expression patterns of a vast number of functional genes comprehensively it is urgent to characterize the community wide expression profiles of comammox nitrospira by a combination of genomic and transcriptomic data in the environments rivers are of primary importance in coupling the biogeochemical cycle between continents and oceans li et al 2020 global rivers transport millions of tons of bioavailable nitrogen annually meybeck 1982 in which human activities contribute to increasing nitrogen input koch et al 2015 nitrifiers associated with denitrifiers and anammox bacteria are crucial to maintain the balance of nitrogen load in large rivers huang et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated the widespread existence of comammox nitrospira and the significant influences of environmental factors on their relative abundances and metabolic functions in rivers black and just 2018 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 moreover newly recovered comammox nitrospira genomes have improved the phylogenomic resolution to facilitate further research on biogeography liu et al 2020 nevertheless the lack of knowledge so far about the in situ expression profiles of comammox nitrospira in large rivers restrains our understanding of the ecological significances of complete nitrification in complex natural freshwater habitats to address this issue we implemented synchronous monitoring along the yangtze river the largest river in asia and obtained the first in situ expression profiles of comammox nitrospira using the genome centric metatranscriptomics our study demonstrated the widespread expressions of comammox nitrospira with the highest transcriptional level in the most upstream site of study area particularly a difference of nitrification characteristics between comammox clade a and b was found compared to canonical nitrospira comammox community had lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but higher expressions in urea degradation enabling them to derive ammonia and energy intracellularly this implied no need for reciprocal feeding between canonical nitrospira and aops comammox bacteria might potentially transform nitrite to nitric oxide no during ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic conditions and gene expressions in this pathway were closely related with ph 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and environmental data measurement the nitrogen load along the mainbody of the yangtze river has drawn great attention liu et al 2018 a thorough understanding of metabolic characteristics of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers is critical for optimizing nitrogen load management strategies therein in march 2018 planktonic microbial biomass for metatranscriptomic sequencing was synchronously sampled in

found at the ncbi sequence read archive under accession numbers srr13151498 srr13151507 raw paired end reads were initially pretreated using sickle v 1 200 q 20 l 50 https github com najoshi sickle and ngs qc toolkit v 2 3 3 l 70 s 20 patel and jain 2012 then rrna sequences were trimmed off using sortmerna v 2 0 num alignments 1 e 10 10 based on silva database for bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic sequences kopylova et al 2012 clean non rrna reads from large datasets were randomly split into small pieces and individually de novo assembled into transcript sequences with a minimum length of 500 bp using trinity v 2 8 1 grabherr et al 2011 statistics of raw rna reads clean non rrna reads and assemblies of each dataset were summarized in table s2 open reading frames orfs were predicted on the assembled sequences using transgenescan v 1 2 1 ismail et al 2014 clean non rrna reads were mapped back to the predicted nucleotide orfs using bbmap v 37 48 https sourceforge net projects bbmap with minimum identity of 90 read counts were calculated for each orf and normalized as rpkm values reads per kilobase per million mapped reads all orfs were searched against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database for functional annotation using diamond v 0 8 38 with the parameters e 1e 5 f 6 k 1 buchfink et al 2015 key ammonia oxidation transcript sequences were queried against the ncbi non redundant nr database using blastp v 2 2 31 for manual inspection 2 3 phylogenetic analysis of key ammonia oxidation transcript sequences all key amo and hao amino acid transcript orfs of comammox nitrospira were identified based on the above functional annotation results some reference and outgroup sequences were also downloaded from the ncbi protein database all sequences were aligned using mafft v 7 310 katoh and standley 2013 the alignments were then trimmed using trimal v 1 3 capella gutiérrez et al 2009 to remove poorly aligned regions i e columns composed of over 90 gaps maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were built based on 1 000 bootstraps using fasttree v 2 1 price et al 2010 where a jones taylor thornton evolutionary model and cat approximation with 20 rate categories were employed 2 4 evaluation of in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifier communities to compare the ammonia oxidation transcriptional abundances among comammox nitrospira aoa and aob communities a hybrid annotation pipeline yang et al 2014 was conducted to screen clean non rrna reads against our manually constructed amoa database detailed procedures and parameters refer to our previous study liu et al 2020 the amoa like hits were normalized by sequence depths among different samples which were expressed as the hit numbers per 108 clean non rrna reads to obtain the expression profiles of comammox versus canonical nitrospira genome centric metatranscriptomics strategies were executed as follows a wide range of 36 nitrospira genomes comprising of 27 separate species were downloaded from the available databases to form the reference pool table s3 which were the representatives covering the most concerning metabolic features of nitrospira orfs were predicted for all genomes using prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and queried against the kegg and clusters of orthologous groups cog databases using diamond as described above additionally a set of carbohydrate related genes were identified by profile hidden markov model searches against carbohydrate active enzymes cazy database lombard et al 2014 metabolic reconstruction was based on kegg pathway maps the subcellular localization of the identified glycoside hydrolases and peptidases were predicted using cello v 2 5 yu et al 2004 clean non rrna reads of each dataset were searched against the ncbi nr database using diamond with the following analysis in megan v 6 11 1 huson et al 2007 using the lowest common ancestor algorithm to extract nitrospira reads based on the taxonomy black and just 2018 bbmap was applied to align all these nitrospira reads against the genomic nucleotide orfs with a minimum identity of 90 such two stage alignments might facilitate to extract comammox reads more accurately according to liu et al 2020 cotto et al 2020 and controlled experiments in this study see supplementary information a minimum alignment identity of 90 could reduce cross assignments of reads between comammox and canonical nitrospira genomes used herein especially no cross assignments was observed for key nitrogen cycling genes between comammox and canonical nitrospira for comparisons of the ammonia or nitrite oxidation transcriptional abundances among distinct nitrospira communities read counts for the nitrospira amoabc or nxrab genes respectively were normalized by sequence depths and expressed as the hit numbers per 108 clean non rrna reads for profiling the expressions across different functional genes read counts were calculated for each genomic orf and normalized as the rpkm values by mapping reads and orf lengths functional gene expression levels were inferred based on the overall rpkm values of orfs assigned to a given orthologous gene of kegg or cog 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed based on the community wide expression profiles of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers

function in vegan was used to visualize the bray curtis dissimilarities of orthologous gene expression compositions between comammox and canonical nitrospira analysis of similarity anosim anosim

environmental factors and geographic distance on orthologous gene expression compositions of comammox and canonical nitrospira supplementary information pairwise spearman s rcorr function in hmisc or pearson s correlations among the expressions of key nitrification related genes and environmental factors were calculated to identify niche preferences 3 results and discussion 3 1 evidence for transcription of comammox nitrospira comammox nitrospira transcription or activity has been detected in natural ecosystems such as soils and freshwater sediments whereas most studies relied on enrichment cultures or microcosm experiments instead of in situ yu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 li et al 2019 to deepen our understandings metatranscriptomics was utilized here to validate the in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river for all samples 547 transcript orfs were assigned to comammox nitrospira including 55 orfs affiliated with comammox amoabc and haoa genes table s4 both amo and hao operons are reliable biomarkers for comammox identification yu et al 2018 phylogenetic trees showed that all amoabc and haoa transcript orfs fell into comammox clade a clusters and were closely related to the genes on clade a i genomes e g yr whu yr jj yr xlj 3 fig s2 table s3 a total of 50 amoabc and haoa transcript orfs were assembled from the most upstream site yb of study area with exceptionally higher expressions average rpkm 115 8 and 30 4 whereas only five amoc transcript orfs were from other sites with lower expressions average rpkm 47 4 this might suggest a relatively high potential of ammonia oxidation activity of comammox nitrospira in the upper reach of the yangtze the number and expression of comammox related amoc transcript orfs were larger than those of amoa and amob which was consistent with the finding of a previous study yu et al 2018 and could be attributed to multicopy of amoc in most comammox genomes koch et al 2019 comammox affiliated transcript orfs were detected at all sites suggesting wide expressions of complete nitrifiers along the yangtze river we compared the transcriptional abundances of comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrifiers by searching clean non rrna reads against two constructed reference databases it should be noted that numbers of comammox reads obtained using the aop amoa amino acid database and amoabc gene sequences on all nitrospira reference genomes were significantly correlated spearman s r 0 97 p 0 001 fig s3 suggesting uniformity of these two methods in assessing comammox ammonia oxidation transcripts the nxr gene sequences have also been utilized to investigate the contribution of comammox to overall nitrospira in nitrite oxidation black and just 2018 yu et al 2018 fowler et al 2018 though more ideal methods are needed comammox nitrospira had relatively high transcriptional abundances in site yb constituting 33 3 and 63 8 of aops amoa and nitrospira nxrab gene expressions respectively fig 1b at those sites downstream yb the transcriptional abundances of canonical aoa aob and nitrospira sublineages i ii outnumbered comammox nitrospira by 4 0 69 6 and 14 7 149 9 folds separately these results suggested that comammox nitrospira might contribute more to nitrifying activity in the upper reach though they were found expressed widely which was consistent with the biogeographic pattern of comammox relative abundance obtained by metagenomics liu et al 2020 comammox nitrospira were less abundant and expressed than either aoa or aob in a few middle and lower reach locations along the yangtze river within comammox nitrospira clade a i was the most expressed community in ammonia oxidation accounting for an average of 79 5 50 100 of comammox amoabc gene expressions fig 1c this was generally uniform with the above results obtained through orfs identification clade a i was also the most abundant comammox community over the mainbody of this large river liu et al 2020 li et al 2019 and zheng et al 2019 reported that clade a were the most active comammox in some agricultural soils n inopinata cluster in a i and wwtps ca n nitrosa cluster in a ii but the dominant active species were quite different from those in the yangtze river yr whu yr jj yr xlj 3 sg bin2 in a i fig 1d table s3 these findings confirmed broad and flexible niches of comammox clade a in natural and engineered environments as also suggested by palomo et al 2019 based on the global survey the most expressed clade a species were all associated with groundwater drinking water and riverine ecosystems fig 1d table s3 indicating similar active comammox species among these environments notably clade b contributed far more to comammox nxrab gene expressions average 28 6 up to 60 6 than to amoabc gene expressions average 1 3 and outcompeted clade a in two sampling sites fig 1c which suggested a more critical role of clade b in nitrite oxidation than in ammonia oxidation no clade b amoabc orfs were found on the de novo assembled transcript contigs either fig s2 moreover the clade b nxrab expressions and its percentage in comammox nxrab expressions were all significantly and positively correlated with the amoa and nxrab expressions of canonical aops and nitrospira spearman s r 0 82 0 95 p 0 003 fig 2 thus clade b were speculated to perform the similar nitrifying feature as canonical nitrospira in this river reach where they might be fed by aoa and aob on one hand distinct nitrifying niches of comammox two clades might be due to the fact that they harbored different ammonia uptake systems clade b encode mep type ammonia transporters with higher affinity and lower uptake capacity while clade a encode rh type transporters with lower affinity and higher uptake capacity palomo et al 2018 clade a rather than clade b might adapt to the mainstream of the yangtze river with relatively higher ammonia contents liu et al 2020 on the other hand high dissimilarity of amoa gene sequences between clades a and b might be another reason for their distinct niches in the ammonia oxidation process palomo et al 2018 for instance clade b possessed more abundant amoa genes than clade a in relatively oligotrophic groundwater systems and upper yangtze river fowler et al 2018 liu et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 detected no ammonia oxidation activity of clade b but largely active clade a in various ammonia enriched wwtps wang et al 2019 revealed that clade b could autotrophically grow in forest and paddy soils only in the absence of ammonia amendment theoretically shortening nitrification pathway with loss of ammonia oxidation capacity might result in an increased atp production rate other than yield for clade b a phylogenetic group residing between canonical nitrospira sublineages i and ii palomo et al 2018 although more efforts are needed to illustrate the ammonia and nitrite oxidation kinetics of yet uncultured clade b the comammox two clades may differ in nitrification characteristics along the yangtze river and the nitrite oxidation ability of clade b should be highlighted 3 2 expression patterns of comammox nitrospira community we obtained an integrated transcriptional atlas of comammox nitrospira by gathering the data from all samples nmds showed that the orthologous gene expression compositions of comammox species were different from those of canonical nitrospira which were further confirmed by anosim r 0 28 p 0 004 fig s4 comammox and canonical nitrospira had 1 546 and 1 585 transcribed orthologous genes respectively in which clade a n 1 539 had a higher diversity of transcribed orthologous genes than clade b n 158 clade a active genes recruited 75 8 fold higher number of transcriptional sequences than clade b 3 2 1 nitrogen metabolism distinct expression patterns of the key nitrogen cycling genes were observed between comammox and canonical nitrospira depicting niche specialization among nitrifiers in this freshwater ecosystem fig 3 table 1 comammox nitrospira had large expressions of all key genes involved in complete nitrification occupying 11 0 of comammox transcripts amoc was the most transcribed gene for comammox fig s5 besides low amoabc expressions clade b also possessed a low expression level of haoa gene average rpkm 4 5 and were then confirmed to play a teeny role in ammonia and hydroxylamine oxidation for canonical nitrospira nxrab were the most transcribed genes the expressions of which accounted for 13 7 of total transcripts and displayed greater than those of complete nitrifiers similar to betaproteobacterial aob all studied comammox genomes harbor genes for either heme exporter ccmabcd or cytochrome c biogenesis ccmefgh proteins which are absent in most canonical nitrospira sublineages i ii fig s6 the expressions of all these genes were observed for comammox instead of canonical nitrospira comammox amo hao and ccm operons are located in the proximate genomic region and the expressions of almost full series of ccm genes may confer an advantage in biosynthesis or activation of amo and hao van kessel et al 2015 compared to canonical nitrospira comammox nitrospira had a higher diversity and transcriptional level of expressed copper homeostasis genes e g copacd such gene expressions might confer increasing cu2 uptake or higher cu2 tolerance in large rivers as comammox bacteria may demand more copper as cofactor for amo biosynthesis than canonical nitrospira palomo et al 2018 besides nitrification related genes all analyzed nitrospira genomes encode copper dependent nitrite reductases nirk that form no from nitrite in denitrifying organisms and some other nitrifiers fig s6 interestingly comammox nitrospira possessed a high expression for nirk average rpkm 3871 0 which was the fourth most transcribed gene in comammox transcripts and exhibited 55 0 fold larger than that of canonical nitrospira fig s5 table 1 a no responsive regulator nnrs associated with nitrosative stress resistance was also expressed similarly black and just 2018 observed highly abundant nirk genes of comammox nitrospira within the mussel sediment of upper mississippi river umr kits et al 2019 suggested that the purely cultured comammox n inopinata could release no under oxic conditions and nirk was the second most abundant protein in its proteome which supported the above finding in oxygen saturated river water consequently all metagenomic metatranscriptomic and kinetic studies implied that nitrate was not the only obligate product during nitrification in comammox nitrospira and the denitrification could lead to no accumulation as for other denitrifying genes all nitrospira lack the key no reductases norbc but encode either a no reductase activation protein or transcriptional regulator fig s6 comammox nitrospira had 3 7 22 1 fold lower expressions of these genes than canonical nitrospira in the yangtze river they are possibly involved in no detoxification it was reported that the isolated comammox n inopinata could not denitrify no to nitrous oxide n2o but produced low n2o by abiotic conversion of hydroxylamine kits et al 2019 more roles of these no reduction chaperone genes in nitrospira remain to be determined in depth for ammonia uptake the expression of rh type transporter encoded by comammox clade a was 4 8 fold lower than that of mep type transporter of canonical nitrospira and its contribution to comammox transcripts 0 0036 was also lower than that to canonical nitrospira transcripts 0 0081 table 1 the expression of clade b ammonia transporter was not detected it was thus hypothesized that comammox bacteria had relatively weak capacity of utilizing extracellular ammonia sources in the yangtze river however ammonia can also originate from intracellular urea hydrolysis we detected relatively high expressions of high affinity urea transporters urtabcde ureases ureabcfgh and carbamate kinase arcc in comammox nitrospira meanwhile no expressions of the corresponding genes were observed for canonical nitrospira comammox organisms were reported to have an order of magnitude greater potentials for urea degradation than canonical nitrospira in mussel habitats of umr black and just 2018 which was similar with our results urea transport and hydrolysis are more common metabolisms in comammox than in canonical nitrospira fig s6 the observed niche separation in genomes and transcriptomes indicated that complete nitrifiers had advantages in deriving ammonia and energy through ureolytic activity in a natural large river koch et al 2015 had proposed a reciprocal feeding interaction between nob and aops in which nitrospira could supply ammonia to aops by hydrolyzing urea while aops would subsequently oxidize ammonia to nitrite offering energy sources for nitrospira in the yangtze river such reciprocal feeding seemed not established due to much higher expressions of ureolytic genes in comammox bacteria compared to canonical nitrospira a significant and positive correlation was observed between expressions of canonical aops amoa and nitrospira nxrab genes pearson s adjusted r 2 0 80 p 0 001 data source from fig 1b therefore canonical aops might oxidize ammonia to nitrite providing canonical nitrospira with energy sources but no ammonia was produced by canonical nitrospira through ureolytic activity possibly due to the existence of comammox bacteria in the yangtze river for ammonia assimilation comammox nitrospira possessed 3 2 7 8 fold lower expressions of glutamate synthase gltbd glutamine synthase glna and nitrogen regulatory protein p ii than canonical nitrospira the contributions of such gene expressions to comammox transcripts 0 096 were also lower than those to canonical nitrospira transcripts 0 28 kits et al 2017 suggested that the growth rate of comammox n inopinata was slower than those of canonical nitrifiers in oligotrophic and dynamic habitats more energy production through ammonia oxidation might help comammox organisms especially clade a to survive in various environments with many competitors e g canonical nitrifiers for nitrite uptake assimilation no expression was observed for comammox nitrite transporter nark but a range of nitrite transporters i e nrtabc nirc and nark of canonical nitrospira were all expressed more importantly all studied comammox nitrospira lack the assimilatory nitrite reductase nira and cytochrome c nitrite reductases nrfah fig s6 and canonical nitrospira harbored an 18 9 fold higher expression of dissimilatory nitrite reductase nird than comammox organisms these transcriptomic findings demonstrated that comammox nitrospira could not utilize nitrite as sole nitrogen source for growth as proposed by palomo et al 2018 3 2 2 energy and carbon metabolisms genes coding for respiratory complexes i v are highly conserved in nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 in the yangtze river they were more expressed in canonical nitrospira 2 0 of transcripts than in comammox nitrospira 1 4 fig 3 table s5 besides h translocating nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductases nuo ten comammox genomes harbor an additional type of complex i i e na transporting nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductases nqr though the expressions were relatively low the prototype of nqr operons is from the marine aerobic bacteria vibrio alginolyticus steuber 2001 and all identified nqra sequences on comammox genomes are most closely related to β aob by blastp to ncbi nr database identity 68 2 71 5 implying acquisition by horizontal gene transfer additionally comammox nitrospira possessed 8 1 fold higher expressions of hydrogenase related genes e g hypf hyfr than canonical nitrospira these genes might confer comammox bacteria the potential of hydrogen oxidation coupled to sulfur reduction camejo et al 2017 glycoside hydrolases glycosyltransferases and carbohydrate esterases dominated the transcriptional pool of carbohydrate active enzymes in nitrospira fig 3 table s5 for comammox gh23 gh109 and gh74 were the most transcribed glycoside hydrolase families encoding chitin peptidoglycan lyase acetyl galactosaminidase hexosaminidase or glucanase etc genes coding for glucosidase gh3 amylomaltase gh77 and amylase gh13 were also expressed although most of them were predicted to be cytoplasmic some gh23 and gh74 could play important roles in periplasmic or extracellular environments fig 3 fig s7 thus complete nitrifiers might participate in carbohydrate breakdown for riverine bacterial community notably whether microbes can take up and utilize carbohydrates should depend on transporter activity lücker et al 2010 we indeed detected the expression of a monosaccharide atp dependent transport system in comammox rather than canonical nitrospira indicating a potential of metabolizing simple sugars gt2 gt4 and gt51 were the most expressed glycosyltransferase families for comammox nitrospira acting on the formation of glycosidic bonds particularly comammox bacteria expressed almost full genes for cellulose glycogen dap type peptidoglycan or kdo2 lipid a a precursor of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis while genes encoding lipoprotein releasing and lipopolysaccharide export systems were also transcribed which suggested carbon storage as cell walls membranes intracellular and extracellular polymeric substances moreover comammox bacteria expressed genes encoding catechol 2 3 dioxygenase monomeric catechol outer membrane receptor and protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase the ability of hydrolyzing aromatic rings has been also demonstrated for n inopinata by han et al 2019 gaining fundamental insights into micropollutant transformation by nitrifiers comammox and canonical nitrospira expressed almost full genes encoding central carbon metabolic pathways including the glycolysis gluconeogenesis pentose phosphate pathway and tca cycle fig 3 table s5 suggesting they should be able to metabolize hexose sugars lücker et al 2010 they could also use ethanol acetate and pyruvate for replenishing tca cycle intermediates high expressions of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductases were observed average rpkm 200 4 5384 9 some uncultured nitrospira have been reported to take up pyruvate in wastewater treatment plants daims et al 2001 the oxidative tca cycle shares most enzymes with the reductive tca rtca cycle except for citrate synthase cs and 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex ogdc while the corresponding key enzymes for rtca cycle were atp citrate lyase acl and 2 oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase ofor respectively lücker et al 2010 we found that comammox bacteria possessed 5 7 fold higher expression of acl than cs and 6 0 fold higher activity of ofor than ogdc similar results were observed for canonical nitrospira although complete nitrifiers might benefit from a mixotrophic lifestyle by utilizing extracellular urea or carbohydrates their autotrophic process by co2 fixation through rtca cycle was putatively dominant in the yangtze river peptides and amino acids are important carbon or energy sources for organisms although comammox and canonical nitrospira expressed many cytoplasmic peptidases some murein endopeptidases zn dependent carboxypeptidases and aminopeptidases were predicted to be located in outer membrane periplasmic or extracellular environments fig 3 fig s7 furthermore comammox bacteria expressed genes for a range of amino acid transporters and catabolic pathways linking alanine aspartate asparagine glutamate glutamine glycine serine threonine cysteine and proline to central metabolisms fig 3 table s5 this could allow them to utilize proteins and amino acids as alternative carbon or energy sources four most highly biosynthetic cost amino acids i e phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan and histidine akashi and gojobori 2002 could be synthesized by comammox bacteria but the degradation pathways were incomplete and not that expressing for all genomes this suggested that complete nitrifiers have been selected to potentially degrade low biosynthetic cost amino acids interestingly the expressions of alanine dehydrogenase glutamate dehydrogenase l aspartate oxidase glycine dehydrogenase as well as predicted amidohydrolases average rpkm 20 7 306 8 table s5 involved in deamination suggested that amino acids were the critical nitrogen and energy source besides urea and free ammonia for comammox nitrospira seven newly recovered comammox genomes from the yangtze river harbored 1 3 peptidases within their ammonia oxidation gene clusters for possible co expressions of peptidases amo and hao liu et al 2020 which would provide genomic evidence for the above transcriptomic findings 3 2 3 stress response defense and resistance for response to environmental stress 50 genes encoding oxygen stress defense multidrug efflux system metal resistance salt resistance and cold and heat shock resistance were mostly expressed in comammox and canonical nitrospira fig 3 table s6 planktonic nitrospira were exposed to a plethora of do in water of the yangtze river monitoring data 10 0 0 5 mg l accordingly catalases peroxidases peroxiredoxins cu zn family superoxide dismutase chlorite dismutase or bacterioferritin were highly expressed 1 3 of transcripts protecting comammox nitrospira from radicals and reactive oxygen species palomo et al 2018 compared to comammox no catalase or superoxide dismutase was transcribed in canonical nitrospira both comammox and canonical nitrospira also possessed a very high expression of cytochrome bd type quinol oxidase average rpkm 1292 9 and 3153 1 respectively table s5 all studied genomes encode 4 10 copies of this high affinity enzyme some of which not only allows organisms to respire oxygen under aerobic states but also has evolved for oxidative stress protection richardson 2000 moreover for response to temperature fluctuation 10 4 15 0 c the heat and cold shock resistance genes were highly expressed in nitrospira 0 56 1 1 of transcripts comammox nitrospira had 3 4 fold lower transcripts of cold shock resistance genes but higher expressions of heat shock resistance genes than canonical nitrospira suggesting distinct optimum metabolizing temperatures between them indeed our previous study demonstrated that temperature was one of the key factors determining niche separation between planktonic comammox and canonical nitrospira liu et al 2020 relatively low expressions of the multidrug efflux system metal and salt resistance genes were observed for nitrospira because the potentially toxic substances e g antibiotics and metals were not so enriched in fluvial water as sewage lücker et al 2010 3 3 environmental effects on expressions of comammox nitrospira community we further explored how environmental factors influenced the in situ expressions of comammox nitrospira community along the yangtze river the dbrda showed that ph and no2 n were significantly associated with the compositional variation of orthologous gene expressions of both comammox and canonical nitrospira p 0 002 0 038 while temperature and tn were only related to that of comammox nitrospira p 0 020 table s7 the above environmental factors explained a total of 53 2 and 34 5 of expression variation for comammox and canonical nitrospira respectively which were much higher than the overall explanatory proportions by geographic distance fig s8 moreover the pure effect 49 3 of environmental factors on comammox nitrospira was about 2 fold higher than that 25 1 on canonical nitrospira these observations suggested a critical role of environmental selection in shaping the expression pattern of comammox rather than canonical nitrospira combined with our metagenomic study liu et al 2020 we confirmed that environmental selection determined the community abundance and expression variation of comammox nitrospira along the yangtze river furthermore specific associations between the expressions of comammox nitrification related genes and environmental variables were investigated fig 4 fig s9 we found significant and positive correlations between ph and the expressions of comammox amoa amoc amoabc haoa and nirk genes spearman s r 0 72 0 89 p 0 020 while no significant correlations were identified between these gene expressions and any other factors including nutrients p 0 11 no significant relationships were found between comammox nitrite oxidation expression level and all analyzed environmental factors p 0 13 comammox amoa abundance was also significantly and positively correlated with ph in the yangtze river liu et al 2020 s xu et al 2020 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira preferred to grow in slightly alkaline environments the optimal ph values for amo and hao of canonical aops are around 7 0 8 0 however it remains unknown about that of comammox nitrospira blum et al 2018 for the freshwater ammonia oxidizers the influence of ph 7 0 8 5 on the reaction activity should not be ignored jones and hood 1980 as relatively rare species comammox bacteria could be sensitive to environmental variation although further experiments are needed to verify our observations ph could be an important indicator for comammox amo and hao expressions in large rivers no directly significant correlations were observed between tn or nh3 n and the ammonia oxidation transcriptional abundances of comammox nitrospira because comammox bacteria were likely to have multiple nitrogen sources like ammonia urea and amino acids from extracellular or intracellular environments however we found that the overall expressions of ccmabcdefgh genes were significantly and negatively correlated with nutrient gradients such as tn nh3 n and tp spearman s r 0 66 0 82 p 0 040 which indicated oligotrophic dynamics of heme export and cytochrome c type biogenesis processes in comammox nitrospira these genes are involved in energy transduction e g respiration co2 binding and hydroxylamine oxidation as well as other cellular processes sanders et al 2010 intriguingly we obtained significant and positive correlations among expressions of comammox amoa amob amoc amoabc haoa and nirk genes spearman s r 0 73 0 93 p 0 020 fig 4 meanwhile the expressions of these genes were less or not significantly correlated with comammox nxra nxrb and nxrab expressions spearman s r 0 33 0 66 p 0 038 0 987 significant positive correlations among amoabc haoa and nirk expressions implied that comammox nitrospira had the potential to transform nitrite to no accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n 1 2 and aerobic conditions along the yangtze river despite previous studies did not propose this hypothesis for riverine comammox nitrospira the newly recovered bins yr whu and yr xlj 3 from the yangtze river indeed encode a fkpa cytochrome c nirk gene set in proximate to amo or hao operons within their ammonia oxidation gene clusters possibly for stable co expressions liu et al 2020 fig 1d also showed that both yr whu and yr xlj 3 were the major expressed species these observations suggested that the potential of no production during ammonia oxidation should not be ignored for comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river kits et al 2019 demonstrated that comammox n inopinata does accumulate no under aerobic conditions and highlighted the dependency of no production on oxygen however they did not indicate co varied expressions of amoabc haoa and nirk genes aob mainly perform nitrifier denitrification under oxygen limited conditions liu et al 2021 which seems very different from comammox nitrospira although further experiments are needed to demonstrate the process of nitrite reduction to no for comammox nitrospira in large rivers we expect a possible cooperation among comammox nitrospira complete and truncated denitrifiers in an appropriate way as denitrifiers could transform comammox terminal products no3 n no or n2o into n2 this would facilitate a re evaluation of nitrogen transforming processes in natural ecosystems and even potentially upgrade and retrofit current schemes for better management of tn 4 conclusions genome centric metatranscriptomics was utilized to reveal the wide in situ expressions and novel transcriptional characters of comammox nitrospira in the yangtze river our study demonstrated a difference of nitrification characteristics between comammox two clades namely clade a were the most expressed comammox community in ammonia oxidation while clade b contributed more transcripts to nitrite oxidation than to ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira possessed lower expressions of ammonia nitrite transporters and nitrogen assimilatory genes but quite higher expressions in urea transport and degradation than canonical nitrospira which implied the restriction of reciprocal feeding between canonical nob and aops in large rivers aerobic mixotrophic lifestyle of comammox bacteria was suggested based on the expressions of genes for respiratory complexes i v oxidative reductive tca cycle transport and catabolism of simple carbohydrates and amino acids and oxygen stress defense comammox nitrospira had the potential of nitrite reduction to no accompanied by ammonia oxidation under low c n and aerobic
