23545,in this work a single degree of freedom dof underwater manipulator operating in still water is considered the paper presents the method of determination of transient hydrodynamic coefficients for the robotic arm based on previously established time dependent hydrodynamic load which can be obtained either from experiments or numerical simulations the method involves normalization of the coefficients by the relative distance traveled by the center of mass of the arm this enables us to form an approximation function for each coefficient dependent only on the shape of the manipulator the so obtained approximation functions allow computing the hydrodynamic load and coefficients for the particular manipulator operating under any kinematic conditions or for the manipulator of different size but geometrically similar to the investigated one without the need of repeating expensive experimental research or complex simulations in the present study the transient hydrodynamic load was obtained by the use of cfd simulations with dynamic mesh employed to generate the motion of the arm performed for several kinematic conditions differing in angular velocity and angular acceleration keywords underwater manipulator hydrodynamic coefficients cfd dynamic mesh 1 introduction underwater robotic arms have become an area of intense research for the development and deployment of auvs autonomous underwater vehicles which protect humans from dangerous environmental conditions during deep sea exploration a desirable replication of the function of human arms requires defining control strategies for position of the end effector which in sub sea applications means taking into account additional effects of water environment the underwater manipulators have to perform their task not only overcoming their weight and payload but also the hydrodynamic forces and moments exerted by the surrounding fluid land based manipulators operate in the air thus their lumped models do not include such environmental contributions in water however large hydrodynamic forces and torques may develop especially for fast high performance manipulators determination of their motion performance requires the knowledge of hydrodynamic forces torques usually expressed in terms of drag and added mass inertia coefficients most of the studies conducted in order to describe underwater manipulator dynamics have modeled them as composed of cylindrical links this assumption allowed applying 2d potential inviscid flow theory to calculate in line and transverse hydrodynamic forces exerted on infinitely thin segments of the arm strip theory approach and after integration along the length of the arm on the entire link hence it follows the great role of the research on flow over cylindrical bodies e g sarpkaya 1963 which had given the background to all works in the area early works on the subject e g schjolberg and egeland 1996 richard and levesque 1996 based on strip theory used hoerner s cross flow principle according to this principle drag depends only on the component of velocity normal to the axis of the cylinder the drag coefficient is constant and equal to 1 1 which was achieved for infinitely long translating cylinder the commonly used the added mass coefficient of 1 was also derived from potential flow theory the nature of the flow over the manipulator is much more complex than around the translating infinitely long cylinder the action of the robotic arms consists of relative rotational motion of neighboring links their rotation is typically limited to small angles and they seldom move at constant angular velocities but rather rapidly accelerate and decelerate which significantly affects the dynamics of the system mclain and rock 1998 were the first who conducted experiments on the motion of a single dof rotating cylindrical arm and proved that drag and added mass coefficients for all segments of the arm are not constant but dependent on distance traveled according to sarpkaya s assumption 1963 experimental results allowed them to extend the strip theory to 3d flow over the arm the modeling of underwater manipulators has been studied in many works leabourne and rock 1998 have estimated added mass and drag contributions for two link arm using and developing potential flow theory and experimental tests vossoughi et al 2004 investigated the dynamics of underwater robotic arm incorporating results obtained by mclain and rock 1998 to design velocity control system santhakumar and kim 2012 developed indirect adaptive control system for underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms in order to compensate disturbances caused among others by currents underwater manipulators usually have links of a shape different from a cylinder for that reason a choice of coefficients is not an easy task for the robotic arm of an arbitrary shape the total hydrodynamic load on the moving link required to obtain added inertia and drag coefficients can be received from water tunnel trials for a full scale manipulator or for a scaled model experimental methods require laboratory or in field testing facilities which can be prohibitive for cost reasons the other way is to adopt the methods commonly used for underwater vehicles although they give the best results for streamlined bodies which is not the case for underwater arms a comprehensive overview of these methods is provided by jones et al 2002 some general recommendations one can also find in american petroleum institute s recipe api rp 2a lrfd 1993 or det norske veritas 2010 the comparison of earlier approaches used by api and dnv can be found in gudmestad and moe 1995 an alternative approach is to use cfd based method which after reaching the today s degree of maturity can be considered as a tool in scientific investigations allowing reducing the cost of the research in comparison to the experimental methods currently this method has been developed rapidly due to advancement of computer technology and cfd commercial and open source codes e g irwin and chauvet 2007 examined the effect of various computational codes models of turbulence and grid refinements on the resultant hydrodynamic coefficients and compared them with engineering publications e g dnv they concluded that engineering approach is unconservative in comparison to cfd for drag coefficients and in good agreement with cfd results for added mass coefficients tang et al 2009 identified all damping and added inertia coefficients for autonomous underwater vehicle from the results of cfd simulations zhang et al 2010 used cdf methods to simulate hydrodynamic tests and calculate hydrodynamic coefficients for a long endurance underwater vehicle in order to predict the vehicle s maneuverability nazir et al 2010 developed cfd tests of 3d body in a viscous fluid to find the hydrodynamic coefficients of the fins and control surfaces of underwater vehicles saltaren pazmino et al 2011 used cfd software to compute the hydrodynamic parameters for designing and developing an underwater robot of 6dof lin and liao 2011 applied multiple boundary element method to calculate the added mass coefficients of a submarine suzuki et al 2013 calculated hydrodynamic force and added mass coefficients for an underwater vehicle by the use of cfd simulations and then applied them in lumped simulations of 6dof motion of auv cfd methods for estimating the added mass and drag coefficients is rapidly developed and attracts interest of many researchers as can be seen by numerous reports in conference proceedings avila et al 2005 raza et al 2012 yue et al 2013 tan et al 2013 hosny et al 2014 in this paper cfd simulations were used to obtain the hydrodynamic load on the rotating single dof underwater arm in order to work out a method which would allow predicting the hydrodynamic load for any kinematic parameters not just for particular case used during the preparations this has been achieved by the detailed study of the period of accelerated motion and the motion with constant angular velocity of the arm the results of numerical calculations were formulated in terms of relationships between the hydrodynamic coefficients and the relative distance traveled by the centroid of the arm treated as a homogeneous body although in this article numerical simulations have been applied as a tool to determine the load of the arm due to operating in water the results of experimental research could also be used for this purpose the article is a continuation of our previous works in which we studied hydrodynamic load on an underwater manipulator subject to current of water kolodziejczyk 2015 2016 the paper was organized as follows the next section gives the detailed description of the problem the third section describes the method used in cfd simulations the fourth section presents results and discussion and the last one conclusion 2 description of the problem the hydrodynamic load and hydrodynamic coefficients depend on the shape of the manipulator and should be established for each case separately moreover they depend on the time of the motion and the relationship with respect to time is usually presented as dependence on distance traveled e g mclain and rock 1998 the proposed method for determining the hydrodynamic load and coefficients for a manipulator operating at any kinematic conditions requires some input data which can be obtained either from measurements or simulations these data have to be acquired for each manipulator of a particular shape separately the experimental research cost is excessively high but numerical analysis is much more accessible these days and slowly becomes an alternative to the expensive measurements for this reason cfd simulations were chosen to learn time history of accelerated and steady state motion of the arm needed to work out a method it should also be mentioned that manipulator used in this paper serves only as an example on which the proposed method has been worked out but we believe that the method can be adopted to the robotic arm of any diameter and length the manipulator under considerations shown in fig 1 is a single dof rotating cylindrical arm mounted to a column put on a solid base the total height of the column was 24 7 cm and its diameter was 8 cm the basic dimensions of the arm are shown in table 1 the moving link was set in rotational motion in the water being initially at rest the initial position of the arm was assumed as α 45 fig 1 the arm begins to accelerate at a constant rate ω reaching a prescribed angular velocity ω after the phase of motion with constant angular speed the arm decelerates at the same rate as in the initial period of motion and stops at the position indicated by the angle α 135 several angular velocities and several angular accelerations were considered the kinematic input data are presented in table 1 for a robotic arm rotating in water the driving force has to overcome not only the body s inertia and the drag forces but also the inertia of the water accelerated by the arm in underwater robotics the common form of dynamic model is written as schjolberg and egeland 1996 1 m q q c q q q g q d q q τ r where q is the vector of generalized coordinates for the arm the symbols m m m m a c c m c a denote as follows m m and c m are the rigid body mass matrix and the coriolis centripetal matrix respectively whilst m a denotes the added mass matrix and c a the added coriolis centripetal matrix d q q stands for the hydrodynamic damping terms g q is the vector of gravity and buoyant forces τ r is the resultant vector of applied torques influencing the manipulator the resultant torques τ r consist of two parts one responsible for moving the weight of the arm and its payload and the second one the additional torques which have to be applied to overcome hydrodynamic load of water in the case of manipulator under considerations the generalized coordinate of the arm q means the angle of rotation α fig 1 and as a consequence q is the angular velocity ω and q the angular acceleration ω the lumped model for the underwater robotic arm shown in fig 1 can be described by the simple equation 2 i α m g l c o s α b r c c o s α τ τ r where i means the moment of inertia of the arm m is its mass l is the distance of the center of mass of the arm from an axis of rotation b is a buoyant force r c is a distance between the centroid of the water displaced by the arm and the axis of rotation z 1 and τ is the torque exerted by the water on the rotating arm all torques considered are defined with respect to z 1 axis shown in fig 1 the supplementary torque τ due to hydrodynamic effects is usually computed by summing up moments of hydrodynamic forces acting on the moving link divided into n segments τ i 1 n δ τ i where δ τ i is calculated as total drag and added inertia torques exerted on the individual segment of the arm and expressed in terms of drag and added inertia coefficients for cylindrical links they are commonly obtained from strip theory extended by mclain and rock 1998 to 3d flows by the use of experiments carried out for a single link cylindrical manipulator with a slender rotating arm their results are most frequently applied in underwater manipulator calculations by the whole community working on these problems according to sarpkaya 1963 hydrodynamic coefficients for a moving cylinder are functions of distance traveled thus for each segment of the rotating link different coefficients have to be taken into account at each moment of time in this study hydrodynamic coefficients were computed not for some number of separated individual thin segments of the arm which seems to be not very useful from a practical point of view but for the entire rotating link using the center of mass of the link treated as a homogeneous body as a reference point for which the reference dynamic pressure and the reference arm of the hydrodynamic moment were calculated bearing in mind the fact that hydrodynamic load and coefficients are functions of distance traveled it would be very beneficial to know how the coefficients related to the center of mass of the arm depend on time for different kinematic conditions if there is some regularity in their behavior permitting us to draw general conclusions it will lead to the development of the method allowing us to compute coefficients for any kinematic conditions without the need for complex calculations or measurements the total moment τ of hydrodynamic forces on the arm is usually divided into two terms τ m torque dependent on the angular acceleration of the arm and τ d torque induced by the resistance of water dependent on the angular velocity of the link τ τ m τ d there is no additional inertia torques τ m in the lumped model 1 of the rigid body motion in a liquid when the arm operates at a constant speed in a stationary motion of the arm τ m does not exist and τ τ d if the torque τ d can be treated as given measured or calculated drag coefficient c d for the entire link of the manipulator can be determined from the known formula 3 c d τ d 1 2 ρ v c 2 r c a where ρ is density of water v c is velocity of the centroid of the water displaced by the rotating arm r c is a distance between the centroid and the axis of rotation z 1 and a stands for the rotating arm projected frontal area the moment due to acceleration of the arm can be computed as a difference τ m τ τ d and added inertia coefficient can be expressed as 4 c m τ m i w ω where i w means the moment of inertia of water displaced by the arm and ω stands for the angular acceleration sarpkaya 1963 proved that coefficients of the drag c d f s d and added inertia c m f s d for translating cylinder are functions of distance traveled measured in numbers of its diameters in the present paper both coefficients for the rotating arm were normalized in the way shown below 5 c d s d c d s d c m s d c m s d where s is the path of the centroid of the rotating arm treated as a homogeneous body and d is the diameter of the arm in motion with constant ω the distance s was computed with respect to the position of the centroid at the end of acceleration the normalization of this kind allows using the coefficients in predicting the hydrodynamic load for other kinematic conditions knowing a distance traveled by the center of mass which is usually easily obtained this is the essence of the method presented in the paper in order to calculate the total moment of hydrodynamic forces τ needed to determine the coefficients c d and c m cfd simulations were conducted in the way described in the following section 3 numerical determination of hydrodynamic load on the moving arm cfd simulation makes it possible to calculate total torques due to hydrodynamic forces both during the phase of accelerated motion and in motion with constant angular velocity and as a result to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients for this purpose several simulations of 3d transient flow generated by the rotating arm of the manipulator were executed the rotating arm started from rest in initially motionless water the angular velocity varied from 2 to 4 rad s and accelerations from 40 to 160 rad s2 all geometric and kinematic data are gathered in table 1 since all described in previous section hydrodynamic coefficients were related to the arm center of mass the reynolds numbers were also determined with respect to its linear velocity with arm diameter as geometric scale reynolds number for considered motion of the center of the arm ranged between 9198 and 28905 table 1 the flow generated by rotating cylindrical arm is often compared with the stationary flow past infinitely long or at least very long and slender circular cylinder although the flow around the real robotic arm is different for several reasons firstly because of the rotating not linear motion secondly for unsteady boundary conditions accelerated period of arm motion thirdly due to the geometry usually short arm and the presence of other links nevertheless bearing in mind these limitations it can be stated that the flow around considered manipulator s arm falls within the range of sub critical flow past circular cylinder it is known from numerous experimental research and numerical simulations that for the sub critical flow the transition to turbulence takes place in the boundary layer at re 100000 200000 the transition in the wake begins around re 200 and in the shear layer at re 400 the flow far away from the arm and on its upwind side may remain laminar in this flow regime but on the grounds that the problem has to be solved numerically the flow induced by the rotating arm was considered as turbulent the computational domain in the shape of a box has been bounded by the solid base as it is shown in fig 2 the column of the manipulator is attached to the base in the middle of the width of the base at a distance 0 7 m from front side and 1 6 m from the back for the basic geometry the other sides of computational domain were in contact with the surroundings in order to allow the fluid to flow into and out of the domain the equations governing the unsteady flow of an incompressible fluid can be described by the continuity equation 6 v 0 the navier stokes equation of motion 7 v t v v 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 v f where v v x v y v z is the velocity vector ρ is the density of fluid p is the pressure μ the viscosity f the body force in this case apparent weight per unit mass and is the vector differential operator gradient the direct numerical simulations dns of navier stokes equation 6 7 even for a flow in a relatively simple geometry as it is in the case of the considered manipulator are impossible today because of the limited capacity of the most powerful computers currently available therefore some method of averaging has to be applied usually it is the time averaging rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations or the space filtering les large eddy simulation approach in rans all length scales are modeled and this allows mesh to be coarser compared with dns or les in les only small scale motions are modeled whereas large eddies are solved exactly for that reason les is capable of capturing the dynamic characteristics of flow better than rans and is currently widely used in many simulations for example in high accuracy calculations of the flow past circular cylinder bai et al 2016 in the present investigation it was decided because of rather coarse grid distribution dictated by the insufficient computing resources that less demanding rans approach will be applied closed by the model of turbulence calculations presented in the paper were carried out in order to obtain the hydrodynamic load and it is known from many research works that all two equation eddy viscosity based models of turbulence have a reasonable capability in prediction of mean flow characteristics e g muddada and patnaik 2010 of all the models available the realizable k ε model of turbulence k is turbulence kinetic energy and ε is its dissipation rate with enhanced wall treatment was utilized for it is recommended for flows with strong streamline curvature vortices and rotation for separated flows and flows with complex secondary flow features which is the case of the flow generated by the manipulator these were the deciding factors in choosing the model of turbulence the models designed for transition from laminar to turbulent flow are much more demanding computationally they have three or four equations and they also have their limitations e g the k kl ω transition model cannot be applied in the present calculations because it is dedicated to predict boundary layer development and the onset of transition in the boundary layer which does not occur in sub critical flow past circular cylinder and the other transition sst model is only applicable to wall bounded flows ansys fluent theory guide ansys inc 2016 simulations were conducted for 9 cases numbered in table 1 which differ from each other by the size of the manipulator by the size of the domain of solution the grids and by the kinematic parameters 1 for cases 1 to 5 calculations were performed for basic geometry of the manipulator and the domain and a basic grid but for three different angular velocities of the arm and for three angular accelerations initial mesh for these cases is shown in fig 3 a 2 case 6 was executed for the basic geometry but for a dense grid in order to check a grid effect initial dense mesh in the vicinity of the manipulator is shown in fig 3b 3 case 7 was carried out for the basic manipulator but for an enlarged domain to test a domain effect 4 case 8 was calculated for the manipulator of the same shape and the domain as the basic ones but scaled by the factor of 1 2 5 case 9 was conducted for the manipulator with the longer arm so not geometrically similar to the basic one although the other details of the shape remained unchanged simulations of the motion of the rotating arm were completed using ansys cfd software ansys canonsburg pa and with the use of dynamic meshes the number of computational cells indicated in table 1 concerns the initial moment of the rotational motion of the arm this number has changed with the progress of computations computations were executed in parallel fluent 17 2 with 8 parallel processes utilizing second order implicit transient formulation with time step 1 0 10 4s and at least 40 iterations per time step the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations was used as a method of solution with second order upwind discretization schemes for momentum pressure and for the model of turbulence dynamic meshes used for simulation of the motion of the arm were generated using diffusion as a smoothing method local face and cell methods were used for remeshing the rotation of the arm was imposed by the user defined function udf employing grid motion method for the moving link the other surfaces of the manipulator and the area around it were affected by deformation the examples of dynamic meshes for three instances of time are shown in fig 4 moments of hydrodynamic forces τ due to pressure and viscosity with respect to the axis z 1 are determined as the dot products of a unit vector in the direction of the axis and the net values of the moments computed by summing the cross products of the position vector of the pressure and viscous forces origins with respect to the moment center with the pressure and viscous force vectors for each boundary cell face belonging to the discretized surface of the arm 4 results and discussion in this study the hydrodynamic load τ was obtained for all geometric and motion parameters shown in table 1 by the use of transient cfd simulations with dynamic meshes method employed to perform the rotation of the arm all torque and coefficient distributions presented in this section are plotted with respect to instantaneous locations of the arm expressed either by the angle α or by the distance traveled by the centroid s d in fact they indirectly describe time history of manipulator s motion the effects of the size of the domain and the computational mesh resolution were checked by comparison with the results obtained for basic manipulator basic domain for angular velocity ω 4 rad s and angular acceleration ω 160 rad s2 computational case 5 calculations 7 were carried out for basic manipulator but for an enlarged domain in order to test the effect of the size of the domain the results were expressed in terms of the torque τ and compared with the results of the case 5 for the basic manipulator and the basic domain and the same kinematic conditions the relative difference between these two compared results at any instant of time during the period of accelerated motion ranged between 0 1 and 0 9 with the averaged value 0 6 thus it can be stated that in this period of motion the domain effect is negligible for steady state motion with angular velocity ω 4 rad s the relative differences of compared results at any time were in the range from 0 5 to 5 7 with average value 2 7 for this period of motion the effect of the domain was greater but acceptable in order to prove grid independence the simulations for the basic manipulator and the basic domain but for dense grid were conducted case 6 in table 1 they were compared with the calculations 5 for the basic mesh resolution the relative differences of resulting torques τ for the basic and dense grids at any time were in the range from 0 0 to 1 4 for the initial period of motion the average value was 0 5 for motion with constant angular velocity the differences of results ranged between 0 8 and 7 9 with average value 4 8 the differences for the accelerated motion were negligible and for the steady state motion sufficiently low the hydrodynamic torques on the moving link of the manipulator for cases 1 2 and 3 i e for the same acceleration ω 40 rad s 2 and three different angular velocities ω 2 3 and 4 rad s are presented in fig 5 the moments induced by the rotational motion were negative with respect to z 1 axis except for the period of deceleration the division to three periods of link motion is clearly seen in the first one that is in the period of accelerated motion the hydrodynamic torques increased almost linearly to the value 0 3 nm for ω 4 rad s at the same rate for all angular velocities after reaching the final speed the magnitude of the torques for all ω rapidly dropped to the value several times smaller than for accelerated motion for motion with constant velocity the magnitude of the average torque for ω 2 rad s was 0 024 nm for ω 3 rad s was equal to 0 053 nm and for ω 4 rad s 0 089 nm during this period the magnitudes of the torques grew a little but continuously the moments induced by the rotational motion of the arm changed their signs during the period of deceleration and at the same time their magnitudes grew abruptly the nature of changes of the torques with time are almost the same as obtained by lin et al 1999 during measurements performed also for a single dof manipulator arm the effect of different accelerations ω 40 80 and 160 rad s2 for the same angular velocity ω 4 rad s is presented in fig 6 cases 3 4 and 5 the maximum of the torque magnitude for ω 80 rad s2 was equal to 0 53 nm whilst for ω 40 rad s2 it was 0 3 nm the highest value of the torque was 0 98 nm for ω 160 rad s2 after reaching the constant angular velocity all the torques were almost identical for all tested cases the graphical results of cfd simulations were presented in figs 7 9 pressure distributions shown in fig 7 make it clear why there is such a high drop in torque magnitudes during motion with constant angular speed in comparison to the periods of accelerated motion the largest part of the hydrodynamic torque is induced by the pressure distribution over the arm surface and in steady state motion fig 7b pressure is very uniform along the whole moving link during the accelerated and decelerated motion the large pressure differences between the active and the passive sides of the arm are clearly seen and they are responsible for the large magnitude of the torques fig 7a and c velocity distributions on the manipulator and in the plane cutting through the arm is shown in fig 8 during motion with steady ω 4 rad s at the beginning of motion with constant angular speed fig 8a and at the end of it fig 8b the movement of the arm induces the velocity field around it which is very similar to those presented by mclain and rock 1998 obtained through dye visualization the moving arm pulls the water behind and the wake in the form of a braid develops as in fig 9 separation reported by mclain and rock 1998 was not observed possibly due to small range of motion considered the maximum distance traveled by the centroid of the arm was in our case s d 1 15 whilst mclain and rock tested the distance up to 10 diameters the torques computed for all cfd simulations for the constant angular velocity motion were used to calculate the drag coefficients according to eq 3 the drag coefficients for ω 2 3 and 4 rad s plotted vs diameters of travel are shown in fig 10 in the case of steady state period of motion the distance was measured from the beginning of it there is a rapid drop in the magnitude of the c d at the beginning of this period and then after a while drag coefficients generally grow irregularly with some temporary decreases in values it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these plots as to how these results may be used to predict the torques for the same manipulator rotating with different angular velocity than during the simulations for that reason drag coefficients for steady state period of motion for all the cases computed were normalized by dividing them by the distance traveled by the center of mass as in eq 5 the results are presented in fig 11 for all the cases computed for the basic manipulator case 1 7 and the manipulator similar to the basic one case 8 the points on the graph form one curve of power function type regardless of the angular velocities and the angular accelerations it can be approximated by the formula 8 c d s d 5 3318 s d 0 907 only the points for the case 9 obtained for the manipulator with longer arm so not geometrically similar to the basic one are located behind this curve they also form a function with almost the same power but of different constant coefficient c d s d 2 8313 s d 0 901 the impact of angular velocity and angular acceleration on the added inertia coefficients is shown in figs 12 and 13 the added inertia coefficients were calculated according to eq 4 assuming that torques due to drag are computed by the use of average drag coefficient obtained for motion with constant angular velocity from both figs 12 and 13 it can be seen that c m ranges from 0 62 for initial moment of motion to 0 6 for the end of acceleration with the maximum equal to approx 0 66 for s d 0 02 there is only a little difference between curves after reaching the maximum for motion with constant acceleration fig 12 but for motion with different accelerations fig 13 the differences are more visible the magnitude of the added inertia coefficients decreases with increasing acceleration generally in view of the fact that these results are going to be used in subsequent computations of the hydrodynamic load for kinematic parameters other than considered in cfd simulations all the added inertia coefficients for all the cases were normalized in the same way as drag coefficients that is by dividing them by s d according to 5 normalized added inertia coefficients c m s d are plotted in fig 14 as a function of s d they also form a power function for all the computations performed for the same basic manipulator and for the manipulator similar to the basic one irrespective of the angular velocity and acceleration only the points for the motion of the manipulator with longer arm are placed a little bit behind the curve the function representing the relationship between the normalized added inertia coefficient and s d can be expressed by the formula 9 c m s d 0 624 s d 1 011 on the basis of the presented results it can be concluded that the normalization of the drag and added inertia coefficients obtained for a particular manipulator employing cfd simulations allows one to use them for calculations of the hydrodynamic loads on the same manipulator for other kinematic parameters e g for different angular velocity in order to prove this statement the calculations of hydrodynamic load on the basic manipulator for motion with angular velocity ω 2 rad s and angular acceleration ω 40 rad s2 were performed by the use of power function obtained from cfd results for cases 2 8 so with exception of the cfd results for the investigated case 1 and compared with cfd results for this case the functions approximating the relationships between hydrodynamic coefficients and distance traveled s d have in this case a little different form c d s d 5 2103 s d 0 965 and c m s d 0 6662 s d 0 993 than in eqs 8 and 9 comparison with cfd results case 1 for the same ω 2 rad s conducted for c d s d show that relative differences during motion with constant ω ranged between 0 52 and 7 77 with average value 4 8 for added inertia coefficients c m s d the relative differences between approximated and obtained from cfd results changed from 0 06 to 1 70 during the period of accelerated motion with average value of 0 83 this example demonstrates that cfd simulations carried out for some particular manipulator and for some kinematic conditions may give useful results in terms of approximation function for normalized hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to distance traveled by the centroid of moving arm which can be used to predict the hydrodynamic load for other kinematic parameters in a very easy way this conclusion may be extended to calculations for the manipulator which is geometrically similar to the considered one the cfd simulations 1 7 served as the basis for obtaining the power function approximating the relationship between added inertia and drag coefficients and s d the resulting functions took the form of c d s d 5 009 s d 0 936 and c m s d 0 6767 s d 0 99 these functions were used to conduct calculations of hydrodynamic coefficients and hydrodynamic load for the manipulator geometrically similar to the basic one scaled by the factor of 1 2 the results were compared with the results obtained from cfd calculations case 8 the relative differences between compared results for motion with steady angular velocity thus for the drag coefficient c d s d ranged between 0 0 and 6 96 with average value 2 56 for the added inertia coefficient c m s d the relative difference was between 0 01 and 1 75 during the period of accelerated motion with average value of 0 81 the calculations for the manipulator of different geometry not geometrically similar to one used in simulations may give the results beyond the limit of acceptability as it is apparent from the graphs obtained for the case 9 shown in figs 11 and 14 5 conclusions hydrodynamic coefficients for a single dof underwater robotic arm depend on the shape of the manipulator and are variable in time for the arms of the shape other than cylindrical they may be obtained only through measurements or assumed on the base of general normative recommendations time dependence is not included in any of these ways in this paper we have proposed the method of processing the time history of the load on a single dof underwater manipulator for a small number of kinematic conditions leading to the approximation functions for computing transient added inertia and drag coefficients the most important factor of the method is the normalization of the coefficients by the dimensionless distance traveled by the centroid of the arm normalization of the coefficients allowed us to form the approximation functions with respect to distance traveled only independent of angular velocity or acceleration these approximation functions obtained once for the manipulator of some particular shape may be used for calculations of the load on its arm for any angular velocity and any angular acceleration at any instant of time knowing only the distance traveled by the center of arm moreover the same approximation function may also be used for the manipulator scaled in such a way that geometric similarity is maintained in the present paper cfd simulations were involved in the process of development of the method but it should be mentioned that the way of determining of input hydrodynamic load is not important in the process it may be either numerical simulations or experimental research hydrodynamic coefficients both drag and added inertia were computed not for the thin segments of the arm separately but for the entire link and referenced to the centroid of the arm treated as a homogeneous body this seems to be more convenient especially for the shapes of the arm different from cylindrical or for short not slender cylindrical links as it is often found in real underwater manipulators marani et al 2009 we believe that although the simulations in this paper were performed for cylindrical arm the method may be extended for the arm of different and more complicated shape as it is in the case of real underwater robotic arms it puts forward the direction of our further investigations acknowledgements this work has been supported by the bialystok university of technology grant no s wm 1 2012 
23545,in this work a single degree of freedom dof underwater manipulator operating in still water is considered the paper presents the method of determination of transient hydrodynamic coefficients for the robotic arm based on previously established time dependent hydrodynamic load which can be obtained either from experiments or numerical simulations the method involves normalization of the coefficients by the relative distance traveled by the center of mass of the arm this enables us to form an approximation function for each coefficient dependent only on the shape of the manipulator the so obtained approximation functions allow computing the hydrodynamic load and coefficients for the particular manipulator operating under any kinematic conditions or for the manipulator of different size but geometrically similar to the investigated one without the need of repeating expensive experimental research or complex simulations in the present study the transient hydrodynamic load was obtained by the use of cfd simulations with dynamic mesh employed to generate the motion of the arm performed for several kinematic conditions differing in angular velocity and angular acceleration keywords underwater manipulator hydrodynamic coefficients cfd dynamic mesh 1 introduction underwater robotic arms have become an area of intense research for the development and

lumped models do not include such environmental contributions in water however large hydrodynamic forces and torques may develop especially for fast high performance manipulators determination of their motion performance requires the knowledge of hydrodynamic forces torques usually expressed in terms of drag and added mass inertia coefficients most of the studies conducted in order to describe underwater manipulator dynamics have modeled them as composed of cylindrical links this assumption allowed applying 2d potential inviscid flow theory to calculate in line and transverse hydrodynamic forces exerted on infinitely thin segments of the arm strip theory approach and after integration along the length of the arm on the entire link hence it follows the great role of the research on flow over cylindrical bodies e g sarpkaya 1963 which had given the background to all works in the area early works on the subject e g schjolberg and egeland 1996 richard and levesque 1996 based on strip theory used hoerner s cross flow principle according to this principle drag depends only on the component of velocity normal to the axis of the cylinder the drag coefficient is constant and equal to 1 1 which was achieved for infinitely long translating cylinder the commonly used the added mass coefficient of 1 was also derived from potential flow theory the nature of the flow over the manipulator is much more complex than around the translating infinitely long cylinder the action of the robotic arms consists of relative rotational motion of neighboring links their rotation is typically limited to small angles and they seldom move at constant angular velocities but rather rapidly accelerate and decelerate which significantly affects the dynamics of the system mclain and rock 1998 were the first who conducted experiments on the motion of a single dof rotating cylindrical arm and proved that drag and added mass coefficients for all segments of the arm are not constant but dependent on distance traveled according to sarpkaya s assumption 1963 experimental results allowed them to extend the strip theory to 3d flow over the arm the modeling of underwater manipulators has been studied in many works leabourne and rock 1998 have estimated added mass and drag contributions for two link arm using and developing potential flow theory and experimental tests vossoughi et al 2004 investigated the dynamics of underwater robotic arm incorporating results obtained by mclain and rock 1998 to design velocity control system santhakumar and kim 2012 developed indirect adaptive control system for underwater vehicle manipulator system uvms in order to compensate disturbances caused among others by currents underwater manipulators usually have links of a shape different from a cylinder for that reason a choice of coefficients is not an easy task for the robotic arm of an arbitrary shape the total hydrodynamic load on the moving link required to obtain added inertia and drag coefficients can be received from water tunnel trials for a full scale manipulator or for a scaled model experimental methods require laboratory or in field testing facilities which can be prohibitive for cost reasons the other way is to adopt the methods commonly used for underwater vehicles although they give the best results for streamlined bodies which is not the case for underwater arms a comprehensive overview of these methods is provided by jones et al 2002 some general recommendations one can also find in american petroleum institute s recipe api rp 2a lrfd 1993 or det norske veritas 2010 the comparison of earlier approaches used by api and dnv can be found in gudmestad and moe 1995 an alternative approach is to use cfd based method which after reaching the today s degree of maturity can be considered as a tool in scientific investigations allowing reducing the cost of the research in comparison to the experimental methods currently this method has been developed rapidly due to advancement of computer technology and cfd commercial and open source codes e g irwin and chauvet 2007 examined the effect of various computational codes models of turbulence and grid refinements on the resultant hydrodynamic coefficients and compared them with engineering publications e g dnv they concluded that engineering approach is unconservative in comparison to cfd for drag coefficients and in good agreement with cfd results for added mass coefficients tang et al 2009 identified all damping and added inertia coefficients for autonomous underwater vehicle from the results of cfd simulations zhang et al 2010 used cdf methods to simulate hydrodynamic tests and calculate hydrodynamic coefficients for a long endurance underwater vehicle in order to predict the vehicle s maneuverability nazir et al 2010 developed cfd tests of 3d body in a viscous fluid to find the hydrodynamic coefficients of the fins and control surfaces of underwater vehicles saltaren pazmino et al 2011 used cfd software to compute the hydrodynamic parameters for designing and developing an underwater robot of 6dof lin and liao 2011 applied multiple boundary element method to calculate the added mass coefficients of a submarine suzuki et al 2013 calculated hydrodynamic force and added mass coefficients for an underwater vehicle by the use of cfd simulations and then applied them in lumped simulations of 6dof motion of auv cfd methods for estimating the added mass and drag coefficients is rapidly developed and attracts interest of many researchers as can be seen by numerous reports in conference proceedings avila et al 2005 raza et al 2012 yue et al 2013 tan et al 2013 hosny et al 2014 in this paper cfd simulations were used to obtain the hydrodynamic load on the rotating single dof underwater arm in order to work out a method which would allow predicting the hydrodynamic load for any kinematic parameters not just for particular case used during the preparations this has been achieved by the detailed study of the period of accelerated motion and the motion with constant angular velocity of the arm the results of numerical calculations were formulated in terms of relationships between the hydrodynamic coefficients and the relative distance traveled by the centroid of the arm treated as a homogeneous body although in this article numerical simulations have been applied as a tool to determine the load of the arm due to operating in water the results of experimental research could also be used for this purpose the article is a continuation of our previous works in which we studied hydrodynamic load on an underwater manipulator subject to current of water kolodziejczyk 2015 2016 the paper was organized as follows the next section gives the detailed description of the problem the third section describes the method used in cfd simulations the fourth section presents results and discussion and the last one conclusion 2 description of the problem the hydrodynamic load and hydrodynamic coefficients depend on the shape of the manipulator and should be established for each case separately moreover they depend on the time of the motion and the relationship with respect to time is usually presented as dependence on distance traveled e g mclain and rock 1998 the proposed method for determining the hydrodynamic load and coefficients for a manipulator operating at any kinematic conditions requires some input data which can be obtained either from measurements or simulations these data have to be acquired for each manipulator of a particular shape separately the experimental research cost is excessively high but numerical analysis is much more accessible these days and slowly becomes an alternative to the expensive measurements for this reason cfd simulations were chosen to learn time history of accelerated and steady state motion of the arm needed to work out a method it should also be mentioned that manipulator used in this paper serves only as an example on which the proposed method has been worked out but we believe that the method can be adopted to the robotic arm of any diameter and length the manipulator under considerations shown in fig 1 is a single dof rotating cylindrical arm mounted to a column put on a solid base the total height of the column was 24 7 cm and its diameter was 8 cm the basic dimensions of the arm are shown in table 1 the moving link was set in rotational motion in the water being initially at rest the initial position of the arm was assumed as α 45 fig 1 the arm begins to accelerate at a constant rate ω reaching a prescribed angular velocity ω after the phase of motion with constant angular speed the arm decelerates at the same rate as in the initial period of motion and stops at the position indicated by the angle α 135 several angular velocities and several angular accelerations were considered the kinematic input data are presented in table 1 for a robotic arm rotating in water the driving force has to overcome not only the body s inertia and the drag forces but also the inertia of the water accelerated by the arm in underwater robotics the common form of dynamic model is written as schjolberg and egeland 1996 1 m q q c q q q g q d q q τ r where q is the vector of generalized coordinates for the arm the symbols m m m m a c c m c a denote as follows m m and c m are the rigid body mass matrix and the coriolis centripetal matrix respectively whilst m a denotes the added mass matrix and c a the added coriolis centripetal matrix d q q stands for the hydrodynamic damping terms g q is the vector of gravity and buoyant forces τ r is the resultant vector of applied torques influencing the manipulator the resultant torques τ r consist of two parts one responsible for moving the weight of the arm and its payload and the second one the additional torques which have to be applied to overcome hydrodynamic load of water in the case of manipulator under considerations the generalized coordinate of the arm q means the angle of rotation α fig 1 and as a consequence q is the angular velocity ω and q the angular acceleration ω the lumped model for the underwater robotic arm shown in fig 1 can be described by the simple equation 2 i α m g l c o s α b r c c o s α τ τ r where i means the moment of inertia of the arm m is its mass l is the distance of the center of mass of the arm from an axis of rotation b is a buoyant force r c is a distance between the centroid of the water displaced by the arm and the axis of rotation z 1 and τ is the torque exerted by the water on the rotating arm all torques considered are defined with respect to z 1 axis shown in fig 1 the supplementary torque τ due to hydrodynamic effects is usually computed by summing up moments of hydrodynamic forces acting on the moving link divided into n segments τ i 1 n δ τ i where δ τ i is calculated as total drag and added inertia torques exerted on the individual segment of the arm and expressed in terms of drag and added inertia coefficients for cylindrical links they are commonly obtained from strip theory extended by mclain and rock 1998 to 3d flows by the use of experiments carried out for a single link cylindrical manipulator with a slender rotating arm their results are most frequently applied in underwater manipulator calculations by the whole community working on these problems according to sarpkaya 1963 hydrodynamic coefficients for a moving cylinder are functions of distance traveled thus for each segment of the rotating link different coefficients have to be taken into account at each moment of time in this study hydrodynamic coefficients were computed not for some number of separated individual thin segments of the arm which seems to be not very useful from a practical point of view but for the entire rotating link using the center of mass of the link treated as a homogeneous body as a reference point for which the reference dynamic pressure and the reference arm of the hydrodynamic moment were calculated bearing in mind the fact that hydrodynamic load and coefficients are functions of distance traveled it would be very beneficial to know how the coefficients related to the center of mass of the arm depend on time for different kinematic conditions if there is some regularity in their behavior permitting us to draw general conclusions it will lead to the development of the method allowing us to compute coefficients for any kinematic conditions without the need for complex calculations or measurements the total moment τ of hydrodynamic forces on the arm is usually divided into two terms τ m torque dependent on the angular acceleration of the arm and τ d torque induced by the resistance of water dependent on the angular velocity of the link τ τ m τ d there is no additional inertia torques τ m in the lumped model 1 of the rigid body motion in a liquid when the arm operates at a constant speed in a stationary motion of the arm τ m does not exist and τ τ d if the torque τ d can be treated as given measured or calculated drag coefficient c d for the entire link of the manipulator can be determined from the known formula 3 c d τ d 1 2 ρ v c 2 r c a where ρ is density of water v c is velocity of the centroid of the water displaced by the rotating arm r c is a distance between the centroid and the axis of rotation z 1 and a stands for the rotating arm projected frontal area the moment due to acceleration of the arm can be computed as a difference τ m τ τ d and added inertia coefficient can be expressed as 4 c m τ m i w ω where i w means the moment of inertia of water displaced by the arm and ω stands for the angular acceleration sarpkaya 1963 proved that coefficients of the drag c d f s d and added inertia c m f s d for translating cylinder are functions of distance traveled measured in numbers of its diameters in the present paper both coefficients for the rotating arm were normalized in the way shown below 5 c d s d c d s d c m s d c m s d where s is the path of the centroid of the rotating arm treated as a homogeneous body and d is the diameter of the arm in motion with constant ω the distance s was computed with respect to the position of the centroid at the end of acceleration the normalization of this kind allows using the coefficients in predicting the hydrodynamic load for other kinematic conditions knowing a distance traveled by the center of mass which is usually easily obtained this is the essence of the method presented in the paper in order to calculate the total moment of hydrodynamic forces τ needed to determine the coefficients c d and c m cfd simulations were conducted in the way described in the following section 3 numerical determination of hydrodynamic load on the moving arm cfd simulation makes it possible to calculate total torques due to hydrodynamic forces both during the phase of accelerated motion and in motion with constant angular velocity and as a result to obtain hydrodynamic coefficients for this purpose several simulations of 3d transient flow generated by the rotating arm of the manipulator were executed the rotating arm started from rest in initially motionless water the angular velocity varied from 2 to 4 rad s and accelerations from 40 to 160 rad s2 all geometric and kinematic data are gathered in table 1 since all described in previous section hydrodynamic coefficients were related to the arm center of mass the reynolds numbers were also determined with respect to its linear velocity with arm diameter as geometric scale reynolds number for considered motion of the center of the arm ranged between 9198 and 28905 table 1 the flow generated by rotating cylindrical arm is often compared with the stationary flow past infinitely long or at least very long and slender circular cylinder although the flow around the real robotic arm is different for several reasons firstly because of the rotating not linear motion secondly for unsteady boundary conditions accelerated period of arm motion thirdly due to the geometry usually short arm and the presence of other links nevertheless bearing in mind these limitations it can be stated that the flow around considered manipulator s arm falls within the range of sub critical flow past circular cylinder it is known from numerous experimental research and numerical simulations that for the sub critical flow the transition to turbulence takes place in the boundary layer at re 100000 200000 the transition in the wake begins around re 200 and in the shear layer at re 400 the flow far away from the arm and on its upwind side may remain laminar in this flow regime but on the grounds that the problem has to be solved numerically the flow induced by the rotating arm was considered as turbulent the computational domain in the shape of a box has been bounded by the solid base as it is shown in fig 2 the column of the manipulator is attached to the base in the middle of the width of the base at a distance 0 7 m from front side and 1 6 m from the back for the basic geometry the other sides of computational domain were in contact with the surroundings in order to allow the fluid to flow into and out of the domain the equations governing the unsteady flow of an incompressible fluid can be described by the continuity equation 6 v 0 the navier stokes equation of motion 7 v t v v 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 v f where v v x v y v z is the velocity vector ρ is the density of fluid p is the pressure μ the viscosity f the body force in this case apparent weight per unit mass and is the vector differential operator gradient the direct numerical simulations dns of navier stokes equation 6 7 even for a flow in a relatively simple geometry as it is in the case of the considered manipulator are impossible today because of the limited capacity of the most powerful computers currently available therefore some method of averaging has to be applied usually it is the time averaging rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations or the space filtering les large eddy simulation approach in rans all length scales are modeled and this allows mesh to be coarser compared with dns or les in les only small scale motions are modeled whereas large eddies are solved exactly for that reason les is capable of capturing the dynamic characteristics of flow better than rans and is currently widely used in many simulations for example in high accuracy calculations of the flow past circular cylinder bai et al 2016 in the present investigation it was decided because of rather coarse grid distribution dictated by the insufficient computing resources that less demanding rans approach will be applied closed by the model of turbulence calculations presented in the paper were carried out in order to obtain the hydrodynamic load and it is known from many research works that all two equation eddy viscosity based models of turbulence have a reasonable capability in prediction of mean flow characteristics e g muddada and patnaik 2010 of all the models available the realizable k ε model of turbulence k is turbulence kinetic energy and ε is its dissipation rate with enhanced wall treatment was utilized for it is recommended for flows with strong streamline curvature vortices and rotation for separated flows and flows with complex secondary flow features which is the case of the flow generated by the manipulator these were the deciding factors in choosing the model of turbulence the models designed for transition from laminar to turbulent flow are much more demanding computationally they have three or four equations and they also have their limitations e g the k kl ω transition model cannot be applied in the present calculations because it is dedicated to predict boundary layer development and the onset of transition in the boundary layer which does not occur in sub critical flow past circular cylinder and the other transition sst model is only applicable to wall bounded flows ansys fluent theory guide ansys inc 2016 simulations were conducted for 9 cases numbered in table 1 which differ from each other by the size of the manipulator by the size of the domain of solution the grids and by the kinematic parameters 1 for cases 1 to 5 calculations were performed for basic geometry of the manipulator and the domain and a basic grid but for three different angular velocities of the arm and for three angular accelerations initial mesh for these cases is shown in fig 3 a 2 case 6 was executed for the basic geometry but for a dense grid in order to check a grid effect initial dense mesh in the vicinity of the manipulator is shown in fig 3b 3 case 7 was carried out for the basic manipulator but for an enlarged domain to test a domain effect 4 case 8 was calculated for the manipulator of the same shape and the domain as the basic ones but scaled by the factor of 1 2 5 case 9 was conducted for the manipulator with the longer arm so not geometrically similar to the basic one although the other details of the shape remained unchanged simulations of the motion of the rotating arm were completed using ansys cfd software ansys canonsburg pa and with the use of dynamic meshes the number of computational cells indicated in table 1 concerns the initial moment of the rotational motion of the arm this number has changed with the progress of computations computations were executed in parallel fluent 17 2 with 8 parallel processes utilizing second order implicit transient formulation with time step 1 0 10 4s and at least 40 iterations per time step the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations was used as a method of solution with second order upwind discretization schemes for momentum pressure and for the model of turbulence dynamic meshes used for simulation of the motion of the arm were generated using diffusion as a smoothing method local face and cell methods were used for remeshing the rotation of the arm was imposed by the user defined function udf employing grid motion method for the moving link the other surfaces of the manipulator and the area around it were affected by deformation the examples of dynamic meshes for three instances of time are shown in fig 4 moments of hydrodynamic forces τ due to pressure and viscosity with respect to the axis z 1 are determined as the dot products of a unit vector in the direction of the axis and the net values of the moments computed by summing the cross products of the position vector of the pressure and viscous forces origins with respect to the moment center with the pressure and viscous force vectors for each boundary cell face belonging to the discretized surface of the arm 4 results and discussion in this study the hydrodynamic load τ was obtained for all geometric and motion parameters shown in table 1 by the use of transient cfd simulations with dynamic meshes method employed to perform the rotation of the arm all torque and coefficient distributions presented in this section are plotted with respect to instantaneous locations of the arm expressed either by the angle α or by the distance traveled by the centroid s d in fact they indirectly describe time history of manipulator s motion the effects of the size of the domain and the computational mesh resolution were checked by comparison with the results obtained for basic manipulator basic domain for angular velocity ω 4 rad s and angular acceleration ω 160 rad s2 computational case 5 calculations 7 were carried out for basic manipulator but for an enlarged domain in order to test the effect of the size of the domain the results were expressed in terms of the torque τ and compared with the results of the case 5 for the basic manipulator and the basic domain and the same kinematic conditions the relative difference between these two compared results at any instant of time during the period of accelerated motion ranged between 0 1 and 0 9 with the averaged value 0 6 thus it can be stated that in this period of motion the domain effect is negligible for steady state motion with angular velocity ω 4 rad s the relative differences of compared results at any time were in the range from 0 5 to 5 7 with average value 2 7 for this period of motion the effect of the domain was greater but acceptable in order to prove grid independence the simulations for the basic manipulator and the basic domain but for dense grid were conducted case 6 in table 1 they were compared with the calculations 5 for the basic mesh resolution the relative differences of resulting torques τ for the basic and dense grids at any time were in the range from 0 0 to 1 4 for the initial period of motion the average value was 0 5 for motion with constant angular velocity the differences of results ranged between 0 8 and 7 9 with average value 4 8 the differences for the accelerated motion were negligible and for the steady state motion sufficiently low the hydrodynamic torques on the moving link of the manipulator for cases 1 2 and 3 i e for the same acceleration ω 40 rad s 2 and three different angular velocities ω 2 3 and 4 rad s are presented in fig 5 the moments induced by the rotational motion were negative with respect to z 1 axis except for the period of deceleration the division to three periods of link motion is clearly seen in the first one that is in the period of accelerated motion the hydrodynamic torques increased almost linearly to the value 0 3 nm for ω 4 rad s at the same rate for all angular velocities after reaching the final speed the magnitude of the torques for all ω rapidly dropped to the value several times smaller than for accelerated motion for motion with constant velocity the magnitude of the average torque for ω 2 rad s was 0 024 nm for ω 3 rad s was equal to 0 053 nm and for ω 4 rad s 0 089 nm during this period the magnitudes of the torques grew a little but continuously the moments induced by the rotational motion of the arm changed their signs during the period of deceleration and at the same time their magnitudes grew abruptly the nature of changes of the torques with time are almost the same as obtained by lin et al 1999 during measurements performed also for a single dof manipulator arm the effect of different accelerations ω 40 80 and 160 rad s2 for the same angular velocity ω 4 rad s is presented in fig 6 cases 3 4 and 5 the maximum of the torque magnitude for ω 80 rad s2 was equal to 0 53 nm whilst for ω 40 rad s2 it was 0 3 nm the highest value of the torque was 0 98 nm for ω 160 rad s2 after reaching the constant angular velocity all the torques were almost identical for all tested cases the graphical results of cfd simulations were presented in figs 7 9 pressure distributions shown in fig 7 make it clear why there is such a high drop in torque magnitudes during motion with constant angular speed in comparison to the periods of accelerated motion the largest part of the hydrodynamic torque is induced by the pressure distribution over the arm surface and in steady state motion fig 7b pressure is very uniform along the whole moving link during the accelerated and decelerated motion the large pressure differences between the active and the passive sides of the arm are clearly seen and they are responsible for the large magnitude of the torques fig 7a and c velocity distributions on the manipulator and in the plane cutting through the arm is shown in fig 8 during motion with steady ω 4 rad s at the beginning of motion with constant angular speed fig 8a and at the end of it fig 8b the movement of the arm induces the velocity field around it which is very similar to those presented by mclain and rock 1998 obtained through dye visualization the moving arm pulls the water behind and the wake in the form of a braid develops as in fig 9 separation reported by mclain and rock 1998 was not observed possibly due to small range of motion considered the maximum distance traveled by the centroid of the arm was in our case s d 1 15 whilst mclain and rock tested the distance up to 10 diameters the torques computed for all cfd simulations for the constant angular velocity motion were used to calculate the drag coefficients according to eq 3 the drag coefficients for ω 2 3 and 4 rad s plotted vs diameters of travel are shown in fig 10 in the case of steady state period of motion the distance was measured from the beginning of it there is a rapid drop in the magnitude of the c d at the beginning of this period and then after a while drag coefficients generally grow irregularly with some temporary decreases in values it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these plots as to how these results may be used to predict the torques for the same manipulator rotating with different angular velocity than during the simulations for that reason drag coefficients for steady state period of motion for all the cases computed were normalized by dividing them by the distance traveled by the center of mass as in eq 5 the results are presented in fig 11 for all the cases computed for the basic manipulator case 1 7 and the manipulator similar to the basic one case 8 the points on the graph form one curve of power function type regardless of the angular velocities and the angular accelerations it can be approximated by the formula 8 c d s d 5 3318 s d 0 907 only the points for the case 9 obtained for the manipulator with longer arm so not geometrically similar to the basic one are located behind this curve they also form a function with almost the same power but of different constant coefficient c d s d 2 8313 s d 0 901 the impact of angular velocity and angular acceleration on the added inertia coefficients is shown in figs 12 and 13 the added inertia coefficients were calculated according to eq 4 assuming that torques due to drag are computed by the use of average drag coefficient obtained for motion with constant angular velocity from both figs 12 and 13 it can be seen that c m ranges from 0 62 for initial moment of motion to 0 6 for the end of acceleration with the maximum equal to approx 0 66 for s d 0 02 there is only a little difference between curves after reaching the maximum for motion with constant acceleration fig 12 but for motion with different accelerations fig 13 the differences are more visible the magnitude of the added inertia coefficients decreases with increasing acceleration generally in view of the fact that these results are going to be used in subsequent computations of the hydrodynamic load for kinematic parameters other than considered in cfd simulations all the added inertia coefficients for all the cases were normalized in the same way as drag coefficients that is by dividing them by s d according to 5 normalized added inertia coefficients c m s d are plotted in fig 14 as a function of s d they also form a power function for all the computations performed for the same basic manipulator and for the manipulator similar to the basic one irrespective of the angular velocity and acceleration only the points for the motion of the manipulator with longer arm are placed a little bit behind the curve the function representing the relationship between the normalized added inertia coefficient and s d can be expressed by the formula 9 c m s d 0 624 s d 1 011 on the basis of the presented results it can be concluded that the normalization of the drag and added inertia coefficients obtained for a particular manipulator employing cfd simulations allows one to use them for calculations of the hydrodynamic loads on the same manipulator for other kinematic parameters e g for different angular velocity in order to prove this statement the calculations of hydrodynamic load on the basic manipulator for motion with angular velocity ω 2 rad s and angular acceleration ω 40 rad s2 were performed by the use of power function obtained from cfd results for cases 2 8 so with exception of the cfd results for the investigated case 1 and compared with cfd results for this case the functions approximating the relationships between hydrodynamic coefficients and distance traveled s d have in this case a little different form c d s d 5 2103 s d 0 965 and c m s d 0 6662 s d 0 993 than in eqs 8 and 9 comparison with cfd results case 1 for the same ω 2 rad s conducted for c d s d show that relative differences during motion with constant ω ranged between 0 52 and 7 77 with average value 4 8 for added inertia coefficients c m s d the relative differences between approximated and obtained from cfd results changed from 0 06 to 1 70 during the period of accelerated motion with average value of 0 83 this example demonstrates that cfd simulations carried out for some particular manipulator and for some kinematic conditions may give useful results in terms of approximation function for normalized hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to distance traveled by the centroid of moving arm which can be used to predict the hydrodynamic load for other kinematic parameters in a very easy way this conclusion may be extended to calculations for the manipulator which is geometrically similar to the considered one the cfd simulations 1 7 served as the basis for obtaining the power function approximating the relationship between added inertia and drag coefficients and s d the resulting functions took the form of c d s d 5 009 s d 0 936 and c m s d 0 6767 s d 0 99 these functions were used to conduct calculations of hydrodynamic coefficients and hydrodynamic load for the manipulator geometrically similar to the basic one scaled by the factor of 1 2 the results were compared with the results obtained from cfd calculations case 8 the relative differences between compared results for motion with steady angular velocity thus for the drag coefficient c d s d ranged between 0 0 and 6 96 with average value 2 56 for the added inertia coefficient c m s d the relative difference was between 0 01 and 1 75 during the period of accelerated motion with average value of 0 81 the calculations for the manipulator of different geometry not geometrically similar to one used in simulations may give the results beyond the limit of acceptability as it is apparent from the graphs obtained for the case 9 shown in figs 11 and 14 5 conclusions hydrodynamic coefficients for a single dof underwater robotic arm depend on the shape of the manipulator and are variable in time for the arms of the shape other than cylindrical they may be obtained only through measurements or assumed on the base of general normative recommendations time dependence is not included in any of these ways in this paper we have proposed the method of processing the time history of the load on a single dof underwater manipulator for a small number of kinematic conditions leading to the approximation functions for computing transient added inertia and drag coefficients the most important factor of the method is the normalization of the coefficients by the dimensionless distance traveled by the centroid of the arm normalization of the coefficients allowed us to form the approximation functions with respect to distance traveled only independent of angular velocity or acceleration these approximation functions obtained once for the manipulator of some particular shape may be used for calculations of the load on its arm for any angular velocity and any angular acceleration at any instant of time knowing only the distance traveled by the center of arm moreover the same approximation function may also be used for the manipulator scaled in such a way that geometric similarity is maintained in the present paper cfd simulations were involved in the process of development of the method but it should be mentioned that the way of determining of input hydrodynamic load is not important in the process it may be either numerical simulations or experimental research hydrodynamic coefficients both drag and added inertia were computed not for the thin segments of the arm separately but for the entire link and referenced to the centroid of the arm treated as a homogeneous body this seems to be more convenient especially for the shapes of the arm different from cylindrical or for short not slender cylindrical links as it is often found in real underwater manipulators marani et al 2009 we believe that although the simulations in this paper were performed for cylindrical arm the method may be extended for the arm of different and more complicated shape as it is in the case of real underwater robotic arms it puts forward the direction of our further investigations acknowledgements this work has been supported by the bialystok university of technology grant no s wm 1 2012 
23546,biomimetic caudal fin propulsion systems are a topic of growing interest recently however the choice of a particular caudal fin shape for a given robotized underwater vehicle is not straightforward in order to address this problem numerical simulations are performed assuming laminar flow considering the operational regimes of small underwater vehicles the numerical models are validated against results from literature and then used to compare the propulsive performance of caudal fin shapes ranging from a rectangular fin to a highly forked tail with various combinations of geometric parameters the optimal shape of the tail based on propulsive efficiency is shown to exist between these two extremes the presence of leading edge vortices in caudal fins is also shown to have an important role in achieving propulsive performance the underlying mechanisms and the cause for high thrust and power consumption are discussed in detail with more focus on relating such parameters directly with the geometrical features such as the amount of forking and fin leading edge angle researchers can use these insights to arrive at optimal designs for small robotic vehicles with flapping fin like propulsion as the relations between geometric features and swimming performance are clearly brought out keywords underwater caudal fin propulsion numerical simulation caudal fin

authors are interested in biomimetic propulsion systems for application in observation class underwater vehicles jhunjhunwala and rajagopal 2014 ravichandran and rajagopal 2015 although certain cetaceans have been shown to swim with high propulsive efficiency fish 1993 phillips et al 2015 very few biomimetic systems in literature are shown to have such performance this is perhaps due to the

develop underwater robotic vehicles with biomimetic propulsion of higher efficiency and speeds and hence bcf modes with caudal fin propulsion are of general interest for more information on bcf swimming modes see for e g lindsey 1978 a wide variety of caudal fin shapes are seen in bcf swimming modes especially carangiform and thunniform and choice of the shape for a particular application in robotics is often challenging in this regard this paper attempts to find the optimal shape of caudal fins in body and caudal fin propulsion systems through numerical simulations validated against published experimental results since propulsive efficiency is of primary concern analysis of flow around the caudal fin during the propulsion cycle is important in view of this the paper also attempts to study the flow patterns around the fin and their effect on power consumption and thrust produced since power consumption and thrust have a direct impact on the propulsive efficiency despite research interest in this area see for example borazjani 2013 lauder 2000 2015 lauder and drucker 2002 mittal 2004 the effect of fin shapes for optimal propulsive efficiency has not been widely studied as for e g mentioned in feilich and lauder 2015 numerical studies are often performed with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments using digital image particle velocimetry dpiv flammang et al 2011 willert and gharib 1991 in dpiv experimental results some critical regions including the regions near the leading edges of the caudal fins are often shadowed due to optical limitations see borazjani and daghooghi 2013 as mentioned in for e g in borazjani and daghooghi 2013 this limitation has diverted analysis more towards the trailing wake regions of flapping fins numerical simulations can provide visualization of the underlying flow mechanisms especially the vortex structures produced in these critical regions during the fin beat cycle borazjani and daghooghi 2013 feilich and lauder 2015 have attempted to compare different shapes also with different stiffnesses by analyzing robotized passive mechanical models of fish caudal fins they concluded that different shapes were optimal for certain functions and that the shape and stiffness of the foil have a complicated relationship on the overall swimming performance we believe that this is because their studies compared fins of different surface area and hence this does not help isolate the effects of the fin shape alone also scaling studies by geder et al state that a three fold increase in the surface area increased thrust production by nine times geder et al 2014 based on our survey of literature we find that other experimental studies relating swimming performance to different caudal fin shapes are limited the same is also mentioned in for e g feilich and lauder 2015 borazjani and daghooghi 2013 have found through numerical simulations that leading edge vortex lev reattachment is found in fish like swimming similar to that in insect flight see for e g sane 2003 for a discussion of lev in the context of insect flight this phenomenon is found to have positive effects on the thrust production mechanism in insect flight sane 2003 borazjani and daghooghi 2013 they have also shown that lev generation is found in the rectangular fins and that delta shapes are better in this aspect as they tend to stabilize levs for thrust augmentation borazjani and daghooghi 2013 although their study shows the existence of levs in fish like swimming they do not explicitly compare the shapes based on their maximum thrust capabilities and energetics nevertheless it opens avenues for a different perspective on the flow and in this paper we have utilized learnings from their observations to study the effects of lev on thrust capacity and energetics on the caudal fin shape it is important to recognize and understand the factors that affect the thrust production and power consumption of caudal fin propulsion in this paper we relate the thrust and energetics of a fin with its geometric features through an analysis of carefully chosen fin shapes of the same surface area analysis of fin shapes of the same area would isolate the effects of fin shape and would lead to a fair comparison these results can be vital in the design and choice of caudal fin shapes as they are directly relating the geometric parameters with its thrust capacity and power consumption also we seek to understand the source of propulsive performance of fins in terms of the underlying physics of vortex generation and shedding this paper is organized as follows firstly the details pertaining to geometry kinematics and numerical simulations are given in section 2 this section also presents results in grid independence and validation for the numerical modelling approach by comparison with experimental results from literature section 3 then presents results systematically comparing the effect of various candidate fin shapes finally the relationships between geometric features and propulsive performance of biomimetic fins are discussed in section 4 after which the paper concludes with directions for future work 2 methodology in thunniform and carangiform swimming modes the caudal fins undergo a heaving and pitching motion or swaying and yawing motion depending on the species during the thrust production cycle heaving and pitching type of motion of fins is chosen for this study the choice of magnitudes of such heaving and pitching to be used in this study depends on the range of optimal strouhal number st which is expected to be between 0 25 and 0 35 triantafyllou et al 1993 the strouhal number is chosen as the non dimensional parameter for quantifying the combinations of frequency swimming speed and amplitude of flapping for optimal performance of caudal fin shapes it is important to identify and choose the correct range of st two dimensional 2d cfd simulations were used to arrive at an approximate range of st and with this starting point 3d simulations were performed for various caudal fin shapes further details of the shapes chosen and the resulting kinematics are discussed in detail in this section numerical simulations were validated with experimental results of an oscillating foil from anderson et al 1998 grid independence is also demonstrated 2 1 geometric model observation class underwater vehicles which normally have dimensions in the range of 300 400 mm typically have with a tail fin of 100 mm chord length in view of this and in order to limit the reynolds number thereby controlling turbulence in the flow and also to minimize the computation time a chord length of 100 mm was chosen for both 2d and 3d simulations the fin models were assumed to have a nominal thickness of 2 mm the axes of motion and flow direction are as shown in fig 1 a number of shapes inspired by nature were considered featuring varying extents of caudal peduncle lengths and forking the basic shape used is a rectangular foil with a span and chord length of 100 mm with an aspect ratio of 1 this is in the range of low aspect ratios observed by sambilay in his examination of 129 species of fish sambilay 1990 drawing inspiration from a pioneering study by blake 1981 all the fin shapes considered have the same surface area the different shapes used for comparison are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 motion model although the actual motion of the fin is a combination of heaving and pitching motions a rigid fin was considered in our simulations for simplicity flexibility of the fins has a major effect on the performance of the fin esposito et al 2012 feilich and lauder 2015 heathcote and gursul 2007 tangorra et al 2010 but since the goal of this study is to identify only the optimal shape we limit our focus on rigid fins the swimming speed of the foil was simulated with a flow at velocity u m s through the inlet boundary condition the transverse motion of the foil which is referred to as heaving in this study is given by 1 h t a sin 2 π f ψ where a is the tail flapping amplitude f is the flapping frequency and ψ is the phase difference between heaving and pitching angular motion about span wise axis referred to as the pitching motion is given by 2 θ t θ max sin 2 π f t where θ max is the pitching amplitude the axis of pitching is placed at 50 of the chord length similar to akhtar et al 2007 the average output power over one cycle can be calculated directly as 3 p o 1 t 0 t f x t u d t where f x t is the thrust force generated at any time t the average input power delivered by the motors over a cycle on the other hand is a combination of power required for heaving and pitching calculated as 4 p i 1 t 0 t f y t d h d t d t 1 t 0 t m z t d θ d t d t where f y is the force required for heaving motions and m z is the moment required for pitching with h and θ as defined in equations 1 and 2 above efficiency is defined as 5 η p o p i heaving and pitching velocities were imparted from a user defined function in ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 and f x and f y forces were obtained from fluent force monitor however the moment obtained from fluent monitor is about the center of rotation at t 0 say point b o the value of m z needed is about the center of pitching at any time instant say point b t recognizing that the moment due to f y is unchanged at either point and that the moment due to f x would be different by a term corresponding to the distance of b t from b o we have 6 m z t m z f l u e n t t f x t h t a where m z t is the required moment at time t and m z fluent t is the moment returned from fluent monitor at time t as mentioned earlier the strouhal number is chosen as the non dimensional number to quantify the combinations of frequency swimming speed and amplitude of flapping here the magnitudes of heaving pitching and frequency of flapping were fixed and the swimming speed was varied this method was adopted considering the requirements in bio inspired underwater vehicles where the swimming speed is dependant on the drag characteristics of the body for a given propulsion system since different bodies could result in different swimming speeds to have independence on the choice of the body swimming speed was chosen to be the variable this is also the reason for not considering the self propelling speed of the fin also at self propelling speeds the propulsive efficiency becomes zero and an alternative definition of propulsive efficiency quasi propulsive efficiency would be required maertens et al 2015 therefore other parameters except swimming speed were fixed assuming that for a given vehicle with certain body and actuator characteristics the only variable of choice is the shape of the caudal fin in this regard we varied the swimming speeds to manipulate the strouhal number and to understand the performance of fin shapes at different swimming speeds nevertheless to ensure the invariability of the optimal propulsion range within the range of strouhal number for different combinations of its parameters two separate simulations were carried out one with a 0 075 m and another with f 1 5 hz keeping all other parameters same further explanation on this is provided in section 3 2d cfd simulations were employed with a 0 05 m f 1 hz maximum pitching angle θ max 25 and phase difference between heaving and pitching ψ 90 where heaving leads pitching swimming speeds were varied from 0 25 m s to 0 56 m s to realize strouhal numbers st from 0 4 to 0 18 respectively optimal propulsive performance was expected in this range which could then be used for 3d simulations 3d simulations were run at a subset of the primary motion parameters of 2d simulations in which optimal performance was observed for each shape three simulations were run on the basis of the range of st values obtained from the 2d simulations performed earlier we expect that the optimum point for most of the shapes would lie in this range 2 3 details of cfd simulation implementation ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 has been widely used for the numerical simulations of the type of interest to this paper see for e g li et al 2009 xia et al 2015 yang et al 2011 the implementation used a pressure based solver which is relevant in view of our interest in incompressible flows the model assumed laminar flow fields considering the operational regimes involved mittal et al 2006 particularly with the fact that we do not account for appendages or highly flexible oscillations also recently heathcote and gursul see heathcote and gursul 2007 showed that experimental results measuring propulsion parameters of a flapping foil compare favourably against simulations assuming laminar flow at a similar reynolds number re 20 000 the reynolds number value used in all our cases is also 20 000 thereby justifying our assumption of laminar flow also comparison of our numerical method against an oscillating foil experiment as shown in section 2 3 3 shows that our numerical method yields results close to the experiment even at re 40 000 the governing equation is discretized using a first order implicit formulation in time and second order upwind scheme in space with the simple algorithm employed for pressure velocity coupling similar to zhou et al 2016 appropriate under relaxation factors were used to obtain solutions that converge in optimum time the domain surrounding the foil which is described later was set to be a fluid zone and the fluid properties were set for water automatic unstructured meshing was used for both 2d and 3d simulations triangular meshes were used in 2d while tetrahedral meshes were used in 3d simulations except for the inlet boundary which was set to have the velocity inlet boundary condition all the other surfaces were set to be pressure outlets f x f y and m z for axis orientations see fig 1 were monitored on the surface of the foil with the reference values set appropriately the foil was imparted motion through the use of a user defined function udf ansys inc 2009 the sub routine define cg motion was used for giving heaving and pitching motions to the required point on the rigid body ansys inc 2009 dynamic meshing enabled the fluid surrounding the foil to be appropriately deformed and capture the effects of these motions a combination of smoothing layering and remeshing was used to modify the grids after each time step smoothing and remeshing parameters were critical in avoiding negative cell volumes a spring constant of 1 which imposes the default damping factor obtained from equilibrium of the springs attached to a node was found to be most effective this value of spring constant deforms the fin boundary cells along with the interior cells of the mesh thereby avoiding negative cell volumes during fin motion lower values generated the negative cell volume error more information on choosing this spring constant value is provided in the ansys fluent manual ansys inc 2009 local cell remeshing based on length and skewness scales appropriate for the mesh was considered enabling the mesh structure to be maintained over time 2 3 1 simulation setup 2d simulations employed a domain of size 4c 2c along the longitudinal and transverse axes respectively where c represents the chord length of the foil an unstructured triangular mesh was employed using the body of influence method to distinguish kernel and non kernel areas using the knowledge of the grid independence study see section 2 3 2 below for details a minimum element size of 3 mm at a growth rate of 8 was used which gave rise to a total of 3 2 104 elements time step sizes in transient simulations were employed from 0 005 s to 0 0075 s depending on the frequency and amplitude of motion the motion was repeated for three cycles and results were computed over the latter two for 3d simulations the domain size in a span wise symmetric plane was the same for all shapes and was equivalent to the one employed in the 2d case the spanwise lengths varied depending on the shape but were sufficiently large to contain the shape and exclude boundary effects an unstructured tetrahedral mesh was employed in each case with a minimum element size of 4 mm at a growth rate of 8 the total number of elements varied from about 10 105 to 15 105 which is finer than the mesh used by zhou et al in their numerical study zhou et al 2016 to obtain appreciable results both 2d and 3d meshes were sufficiently refined as per the requirement that the size of the cells surrounding the body should be at least 1 25 to 1 30 of the characteristic chord length yang et al 2011 a time step size of 0 005 s was found to be acceptable for all simulations and the results were computed in a manner similar to 2d this value of time step is calculated based on the flow and the fin s velocity to avoid negative cell volume errors with this time step the ratio of the smallest mesh size to flow velocity is around 0 02 s the time taken for a fluid particle to cover a single mesh element the time step used in our simulations is well below this value also the fin boundary displacement should be less than half of the size of the boundary cells in a single time step a general rule of thumb our value of time step ensures this criterion 2 3 2 grid independence motion parameters employed in the grid independence study were f 1 5 hz a 0 075 st 0 18 table 1 gives the description of the two meshes which were compared note that the element size mentioned is for the domain of influence which forms the kernel area it is seen that there is not much variation in the force obtained for the two mesh sizes considered fig 3 table 1 shows that the average values are also within 3 of one another 2 3 3 validation with well refined grids fluent is known to perform well for various other studies including analysis of vortex street behind bluff bodies to appreciable accuracy for validation results from oscillating foil experiments conducted by anderson et al 1998 were used a naca0012 profile with chord length c 0 1 m amplitude a 0 075 m velocity u 0 4 m s reynolds number re 40 000 phase angle between heaving and pitching ψ 90 st 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 is used for each st the frequency of oscillation f was varied to be 0 533 hz 0 67 hz and 0 8 hz respectively other parameters were similar to those used in their experiments a coefficient of thrust as defined by anderson et al is given in eq 7 where f x is the average thrust force over a cycle 7 c x f x 1 2 ρ c s u 2 a sufficiently refined mesh obtained from the grid independence study was used for validation define cg motion ansys inc 2009 was used for imparting motion through the udf with the pitching distance b 0 033 m efficiency η and thrust coefficient c x as defined in eqs 5 and 7 were compared between results from our numerical scheme and previously published experimental results as shown in fig 4 we observe that numerical values are in good agreement with experimental results for both c x and η further we note that our results are within a margin of 10 from those of anderson et al 1998 however their experiment is at re 40 000 which could involve higher turbulence than the cases considered in this paper where re 20 000 therefore the error percentage of the simulations in our study would be much lesser than 10 assuming that turbulence could be the major source of error moreover these results show similarities with those for near fin flow visualizations and with delta wings this gives confidence in our numerical model to represent the process well in the range of flow and motion parameters considered it was however not possible to further validate the results using non rectangular fins due to lack of experimental or theoretical studies for such cases 3 results in this section the thrust force power consumption and efficiency results from the numerical simulations of the shapes in comparison are reported results are first presented for 2d simulations from which the appropriate range of strouhal numbers is derived and then used for the 3d computational study 3 1 2d simulations 2d simulations were performed with the conditions listed in the previous section and thrust force f x heaving force f y and pitching moment m z values were obtained for the first set of 2d simulations having f 1 hz and a 0 05 m the optimal efficiency range was observed to be between st 0 2 0 25 fig 5 b which is within the predicted range of optimal st triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 to test the validity of this range simulations at f 1 5 hz and a 0 075 m were carried out fig 5 b the optimal range of efficiency was still found to lie between st 0 2 0 25 though it was observed that thrust forces produced increased with an increase in either frequency or amplitude of motion the purpose of 2d simulations was also to devise a computationally less intensive procedure to understand the range of optimal st to be used for 3d simulations in the comparative study of various shapes it was observed that the range to be used is between st 0 2 0 25 but from fig 5 b it was seen that there is a fall in the propulsive performance beyond st 0 2 in addition triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 have observed that the range of optimal st in many species of fish is between 0 25 and 0 35 thus an intersection range of 0 2 0 3 was used for 3d simulations where a peak in efficiency was expected to be observed corresponding to the optimal efficiency 3 2 3d simulations simulations were run between st 0 2 and st 0 3 the nature of the plots observed for each simulation was similar to the ones obtained for the 2d case and an averaging was performed over the second and third cycle for obtaining f x f y m z and η estimates the thrust power consumption and efficiency for all shapes are plotted against the aforementioned range of strouhal numbers in fig 6 shape 4 was found to be the most efficient shape 7 to produce the highest thrust and shape 6 to have the highest power consumption shape 4 has an overall increase in efficiency by 11 3 from the basic rectangular plate shape 1 also shape 1 is found to produce the lowest thrust consuming least power while shape 6 being the least efficient the optimal shape obtained confirms that fishes obtain an advantage in propulsive performance through a narrower caudal peduncle intermediate leading edge angle and a small amount of forking as predicted by the 2d studies 3d simulations show that the optimal range of strouhal number is between 0 2 st 0 3 thereby saving computational resources while all the shapes obtained a peak in propulsive performance around st 0 25 fig 6 the values for efficiency were different for different shapes showing that the shape plays a major role in fin based motion although fins of the same area were used more discussion and observations on the possible reasons for such behavior are given in the following section 4 discussion it was shown in the previous section that shape 4 with moderate forking and medium delta angle value yields the most efficient propulsive performance fig 6 it can be seen that shapes with low leading edge angles generate higher thrust and also consume more power noting similar results for delta wings of aircraft here we relate thrust production in fins to behavior of the leading edge vortices levs during the cycle this section is dedicated to a discussion of this relation using numerical simulations the presence of levs and their benefits have been extensively studied for delta wings of aircraft experiments on delta wings show that decreasing the leading edge angle results in an increase in the lift and drag forces polhamus 1966 this is found to be because of stronger vortices separating early from the surface of wings with low leading edge angles hemsch and luckring 1990 as the vortices separate and convect backward they impart a low pressure on the downstream surfaces of the fin and produce additional thrust this mechanism generates additional lift and is referred to as augmented vortex lift lamar 2012 however if there is a reduction of area in the downstream direction in the case of arrow wings for example the amount of lift produced would be lower than normal delta wings and vice versa lamar 1976 here we wish to draw an analogy for our underwater flapping fin problem with that of the aircraft delta wing thielicke et al 2011 claim that the vortex lift modelling as used for delta wings with a quasi steady approach provides good agreement with experiments of flapping bird wings at reynolds number in ranges of about 103 104 we first observe that the behavior of levs and the thrust production mechanism of flapping fins from our simulations are very similar to the flow dynamics of a delta wing the decrease of leading edge angle leads to an increase in the thrust produced fig 7 whereas for the same delta angle an increase of forking yields a decrease in thrust see for example the thrust generated by shape 4 and 5 fig 8 despite having the same delta angle shape 4 produces a lower thrust compared to shape 5 and also consumes lesser power the same trend is observed in the case of shape 6 and shape 7 shape 6 despite having a slightly lower leading edge angle produces lesser thrust than shape 7 due to increased forking in shape 6 these trends are coherent with the trends observed for forces generated by delta wings fig 7 shows this trend for all shapes considered let us now make a detailed comparison of shapes 5 and 6 which lie at two different ends in terms of the leading edge angle and amount of forking it can be seen that levs start separating from the leading edge of shape 5 at around 0 18 s see fig 9 whereas those from shape 6 grow faster and start separating at an earlier time value of around 0 14 s see fig 10 in shape 5 at a time value of 0 22 s the separated vortex with the recognizable shape of the leading edge can also be seen to convect downstream this vortex can also be seen to generate low pressure regions on the surface of the fin we can observe green spots below the vortex at 0 28 s in fig 9 thereby generating vortex augmented thrust similar to vortex augmented lift in delta wings such additional thrusts are found to be lesser in shape 6 due to the amount of forking lesser downstream area this argument is also consistent with thrust production time for these shapes where shape 5 due to delayed separation and vortex thrust augmentation generates thrust for a longer time than shape 6 see fig 8 this shows that a lower delta angle generates vortices which could grow faster and separate earlier while generating low pressures for high thrust at the cost of higher power consumption this trend is shown in figs 7 and 8 the effect of forking has been shown to reduce thrust for the same delta angle but the effect of trailing edge shape is not clear from our study in an experimental study van buren et al 2017 show that the thrust produced and efficiencies improve from more concave shapes to more convex shapes their result is also consistent with the conclusions from our analysis in terms of thrust production where more convex shapes would have more downstream area for increased vortex augmented thrust from separated leading edge vortices in their study certain convex shapes have been found to be more efficient for which they have explained the energetics based on downstream wake patterns our analysis cannot be extended to support their conclusion on efficiency as we have not studied the downstream wake patterns 5 conclusion this paper is set in the context of the development of biomimetic propulsion for compact underwater automated and remotely operated vehicles caudal fin shapes of the same surface area but differing in the aspects of fin leading edge angle or delta angle and nature of forking were compared in the range of motion and flow parameters suitable for bio inspired vehicles using 2d computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the range of strouhal numbers for which high efficiencies exist was obtained this range was consistent with the findings of triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 this input was then used in 3d simulations where a peak in propulsive performance was observed close to st value of 0 25 peak efficiency was obtained for an intermediate shape having moderate caudal peduncle and small forking the physics of this process was investigated using numerical simulations and the role of leading edge vortices levs was shown to be vital and directly linked to the geometric features of the fin from our analysis we learn that fins produce majority of the thrust by pushing fluid downstream added mass forces by generating levs and through augmented thrust from these convecting downstream over the fin surface lowering the leading edge angle was found to increase the power consumption and increase thrust in certain cases where enough chordwise downstream surface area was present on the fin for augmented vortex thrust by separated leading edge vortices turbulence was not modelled in our simulations in published literature studies on the effect of turbulence on propulsive performance of fins are rare most of the studies deal only with the effect of flow turbulence from the surrounding environment on the propulsive efficiency and not the turbulence generated by the body fin itself borazjani et al 2012 is one such work which talks about turbulence generated by the body fin they show that as the reynolds number increases the vortex structures separate from the fin and breakdown more easily as the inertial forces dominate the viscous forces at low re the vortices are stabilized by the viscous forces whereas at high re the viscous forces would not be able to stabilize the flow therefore leading to turbulence mittal 2004 is another such work but does not talk much about the details of these effects the effect of fin flexibility was also not studied as the aim here was to isolate and understand the effects of fin shape on propulsive performance however the effects of fin flexibility have been studied in literature feilich and lauder 2015 kancharala and roy 2015 another limitation of the current study is the choice of pitching axis location here the pitching axis is chosen to be at the mid chord position but placing an actuator at this position is challenging in reality the motivation for our choice has been from literature which says that the mid chord position for pitching axis would be the most efficient xiao and zhu 2014 also other shapes such as diamond like or shapes with convex trailing edges were not studied in our analysis where vortex augmented thrust may yield advantageous results in certain cases van buren et al 2017 finally it would be interesting to introduce efficiency loss through the effect of leading edge vortices however the growth of leading edge vortices and their separation would depend on the flapping frequency flow velocity and the leading edge angle among other parameters thus quantifying such a term would be challenging and this could be material for further work apart from such limitations conclusions and understanding from our study could be helpful to biomimetic roboticists in the choice of an appropriate fin shape acknowledgements the authors thank the office of alumni and international affairs iit madras for an initial

23546,biomimetic caudal fin propulsion systems are a topic of growing interest recently however the choice of a particular caudal fin shape for a given robotized underwater vehicle is not straightforward in order to address this problem numerical simulations are performed assuming laminar flow considering the operational regimes of small underwater vehicles the numerical models are validated against results from literature and then used to compare the propulsive performance of caudal fin shapes ranging from a rectangular fin to a highly forked tail with various combinations of geometric parameters the optimal shape of the tail based on propulsive efficiency is shown to exist between these two extremes the presence of leading edge vortices in caudal fins is also shown to have an important role in achieving propulsive performance the underlying mechanisms and the cause for high thrust and power consumption are discussed in detail with more focus on relating such parameters directly with the geometrical features such as the amount of forking and fin leading edge angle researchers can use these insights to arrive at optimal designs for small robotic vehicles with flapping fin like propulsion as the relations between geometric features and swimming performance are clearly brought out keywords underwater caudal fin propulsion numerical simulation caudal fin shape comparison 1 introduction inspired by the effectiveness of biological organisms in solving engineering challenges biomimetic systems are gaining more focus in recent times bar cohen 2006 the authors are interested in biomimetic propulsion systems for application in observation class underwater vehicles jhunjhunwala and rajagopal 2014 ravichandran and rajagopal 2015 although certain cetaceans have been shown to swim with high propulsive efficiency fish 1993 phillips et al 2015 very few biomimetic systems in literature are shown to have such performance this is perhaps due to the fact that the underlying physics of such systems are not still very well understood for instance the choice of a particular bio inspired propulsion mechanism for a given application is not straightforward body and or caudal fin bcf propulsion systems and pectoral and or median fin pmf propulsion systems are the two major options available for biomimetic propulsion systems roper et al 2011 lindsey 1978 pmf propulsion systems are widely used in applications demanding more maneuverability while bcf systems are preferred for better efficiency and higher speeds the authors seek to develop underwater robotic vehicles with biomimetic propulsion of higher efficiency and speeds and hence bcf modes with caudal fin propulsion are of general interest for more information on bcf swimming modes see for e g lindsey 1978 a wide variety of caudal fin shapes are seen in bcf swimming modes especially carangiform and thunniform and choice of the shape for a particular application in robotics is often challenging in this regard this paper attempts to find the optimal shape of caudal fins in body and caudal fin propulsion systems through numerical simulations validated against published experimental results since propulsive efficiency is of primary concern analysis of flow around the caudal fin during the propulsion cycle is important in view of this the paper also attempts to study the flow patterns around the fin and their effect on power consumption and thrust produced since power consumption and thrust have a direct impact on the propulsive efficiency despite research interest in this area see for example borazjani 2013 lauder 2000 2015 lauder and drucker 2002 mittal 2004 the effect of fin shapes for optimal propulsive efficiency has not been widely studied as for e g mentioned in feilich and lauder 2015 numerical studies are often performed with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments using digital image particle velocimetry dpiv flammang et al 2011 willert and gharib 1991 in dpiv experimental results some critical regions including the regions near the leading edges of the caudal fins are often shadowed due to optical limitations see borazjani and daghooghi 2013 as mentioned in for e g in borazjani and daghooghi 2013 this limitation has diverted analysis more towards the trailing wake regions of flapping fins numerical simulations can provide visualization of the underlying flow mechanisms especially the vortex structures produced in these critical regions during the fin beat cycle borazjani and daghooghi 2013 feilich and lauder 2015 have attempted to compare different shapes also with different stiffnesses by analyzing robotized passive mechanical models of fish caudal fins they concluded that different shapes were optimal for certain functions and that the shape and stiffness of the foil have a complicated relationship on the overall swimming performance we believe that this is because their studies compared fins of different surface area and hence this does not help isolate the effects of the fin shape alone also scaling studies by geder et al state that a three fold increase in the surface area increased thrust production by nine times geder et al 2014 based on our survey of literature we find that other experimental studies relating swimming performance to different caudal fin shapes are limited the same is also mentioned in for e g feilich and lauder 2015 borazjani and daghooghi 2013 have found through numerical simulations that leading edge vortex lev reattachment is found in fish like swimming similar to that in insect flight see for e g sane 2003 for a discussion of lev in the context of insect flight this phenomenon is found to have positive effects on the thrust production mechanism in insect flight sane 2003 borazjani and daghooghi 2013 they have also shown that lev generation is found in the rectangular fins and that delta shapes are better in this aspect as they tend to stabilize levs for thrust augmentation borazjani and daghooghi 2013 although their study shows the existence of levs in fish like swimming they do not explicitly compare the shapes based on their maximum thrust capabilities and energetics nevertheless it opens avenues for a different perspective on the flow and in this paper we have utilized learnings from their observations to study the effects of lev on thrust capacity and energetics on the caudal fin shape it is important to recognize and understand the factors that affect the thrust production and power consumption of caudal fin propulsion in this paper we relate the thrust and energetics of a fin with its geometric features through an analysis of carefully chosen fin shapes of the same surface area analysis of fin shapes of the same area would isolate the effects of fin shape and would lead to a fair comparison these results can be vital in the design and choice of caudal fin shapes as they are directly relating the geometric parameters with its thrust capacity and power consumption also we seek to understand the source of propulsive performance of fins in terms of the underlying physics of vortex generation and shedding this paper is organized as follows firstly the details pertaining to geometry kinematics and numerical simulations are given in section 2 this section also presents results in grid independence and validation for the numerical modelling approach by comparison with experimental results from literature section 3 then presents results systematically comparing the effect of various candidate fin shapes finally the relationships between geometric features and propulsive performance of biomimetic fins are discussed in section 4 after which the paper concludes with directions for future work 2 methodology in thunniform and carangiform swimming modes the caudal fins undergo a heaving and pitching motion or swaying and yawing motion depending on the species during the thrust production cycle heaving and pitching type of motion of fins is chosen for this study the choice of magnitudes of such heaving and pitching to be used in this study depends on the range of optimal strouhal number st which is expected to be between 0 25 and 0 35 triantafyllou et al 1993 the strouhal number is chosen as the non dimensional parameter for quantifying the combinations of frequency swimming speed and amplitude of flapping for optimal performance of caudal fin shapes it is important to identify and choose the correct range of st two dimensional 2d cfd simulations were used to arrive at an approximate range of st and with this starting point 3d simulations were performed for various caudal fin shapes further details of the shapes chosen and the resulting kinematics are discussed in detail in this section numerical simulations were validated with experimental results of an oscillating foil from anderson et al 1998 grid independence is also demonstrated 2 1 geometric model observation class underwater vehicles which normally have dimensions in the range of 300 400 mm typically have with a tail fin of 100 mm chord length in view of this and in order to limit the reynolds number thereby controlling turbulence in the flow and also to minimize the computation time a chord length of 100 mm was chosen for both 2d and 3d simulations the fin models were assumed to have a nominal thickness of 2 mm the axes of motion and flow direction are as shown in fig 1 a number of shapes inspired by nature were considered featuring varying extents of caudal peduncle lengths and forking the basic shape used is a rectangular foil with a span and chord length of 100 mm with an aspect ratio of 1 this is in the range of low aspect ratios observed by sambilay in his examination of 129 species of fish sambilay 1990 drawing inspiration from a pioneering study by blake 1981 all the fin shapes considered have the same surface area the different shapes used for comparison are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 motion model although the actual motion of the fin is a combination of heaving and pitching motions a rigid fin was considered in our simulations for simplicity flexibility of the fins has a major effect on the performance of the fin esposito et al 2012 feilich and lauder 2015 heathcote and gursul 2007 tangorra et al 2010 but since the goal of this study is to identify only the optimal shape we limit our focus on rigid fins the swimming speed of the foil was simulated with a flow at velocity u m s through the inlet boundary condition the transverse motion of the foil which is referred to as heaving in this study is given by 1 h t a sin 2 π f ψ where a is the tail flapping amplitude f is the flapping frequency and ψ is the phase difference between heaving and pitching angular motion about span wise axis referred to as the pitching motion is given by 2 θ t θ max sin 2 π f t where θ max is the pitching amplitude the axis of pitching is placed at 50 of the chord length similar to akhtar et al 2007 the average output power over one cycle can be calculated directly as 3 p o 1 t 0 t f x t u d t where f x t is the thrust force generated at any time t the average input power delivered by the motors over a cycle on the other hand is a combination of power required for heaving and pitching calculated as 4 p i 1 t 0 t f y t d h d t d t 1 t 0 t m z t d θ d t d t where f y is the force required for heaving motions and m z is the moment required for pitching with h and θ as defined in equations 1 and 2 above efficiency is defined as 5 η p o p i heaving and pitching velocities were imparted from a user defined function in ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 and f x and f y forces were obtained from fluent force monitor however the moment obtained from fluent monitor is about the center of rotation at t 0 say point b o the value of m z needed is about the center of pitching at any time instant say point b t recognizing that the moment due to f y is unchanged at either point and that the moment due to f x would be different by a term corresponding to the distance of b t from b o we have 6 m z t m z f l u e n t t f x t h t a where m z t is the required moment at time t and m z fluent t is the moment returned from fluent monitor at time t as mentioned earlier the strouhal number is chosen as the non dimensional number to quantify the combinations of frequency swimming speed and amplitude of flapping here the magnitudes of heaving pitching and frequency of flapping were fixed and the swimming speed was varied this method was adopted considering the requirements in bio inspired underwater vehicles where the swimming speed is dependant on the drag characteristics of the body for a given propulsion system since different bodies could result in different swimming speeds to have independence on the choice of the body swimming speed was chosen to be the variable this is also the reason for not considering the self propelling speed of the fin also at self propelling speeds the propulsive efficiency becomes zero and an alternative definition of propulsive efficiency quasi propulsive efficiency would be required maertens et al 2015 therefore other parameters except swimming speed were fixed assuming that for a given vehicle with certain body and actuator characteristics the only variable of choice is the shape of the caudal fin in this regard we varied the swimming speeds to manipulate the strouhal number and to understand the performance of fin shapes at different swimming speeds nevertheless to ensure the invariability of the optimal propulsion range within the range of strouhal number for different combinations of its parameters two separate simulations were carried out one with a 0 075 m and another with f 1 5 hz keeping all other parameters same further explanation on this is provided in section 3 2d cfd simulations were employed with a 0 05 m f 1 hz maximum pitching angle θ max 25 and phase difference between heaving and pitching ψ 90 where heaving leads pitching swimming speeds were varied from 0 25 m s to 0 56 m s to realize strouhal numbers st from 0 4 to 0 18 respectively optimal propulsive performance was expected in this range which could then be used for 3d simulations 3d simulations were run at a subset of the primary motion parameters of 2d simulations in which optimal performance was observed for each shape three simulations were run on the basis of the range of st values obtained from the 2d simulations performed earlier we expect that the optimum point for most of the shapes would lie in this range 2 3 details of cfd simulation implementation ansys fluent 14 5 ansys inc 2009 has been widely used for the numerical simulations of the type of interest to this paper see for e g li et al 2009 xia et al 2015 yang et al 2011 the implementation used a pressure based solver which is relevant in view of our interest in incompressible flows the model assumed laminar flow fields considering the operational regimes involved mittal et al 2006 particularly with the fact that we do not account for appendages or highly flexible oscillations also recently heathcote and gursul see heathcote and gursul 2007 showed that experimental results measuring propulsion parameters of a flapping foil compare favourably against simulations assuming laminar flow at a similar reynolds number re 20 000 the reynolds number value used in all our cases is also 20 000 thereby justifying our assumption of laminar flow also comparison of our numerical method against an oscillating foil experiment as shown in section 2 3 3 shows that our numerical method yields results close to the experiment even at re 40 000 the governing equation is discretized using a first order implicit formulation in time and second order upwind scheme in space with the simple algorithm employed for pressure velocity coupling similar to zhou et al 2016 appropriate under relaxation factors were used to obtain solutions that converge in optimum time the domain surrounding the foil which is described later was set to be a fluid zone and the fluid properties were set for water automatic unstructured meshing was used for both 2d and 3d simulations triangular meshes were used in 2d while tetrahedral meshes were used in 3d simulations except for the inlet boundary which was set to have the velocity inlet boundary condition all the other surfaces were set to be pressure outlets f x f y and m z for axis orientations see fig 1 were monitored on the surface of the foil with the reference values set appropriately the foil was imparted motion through the use of a user defined function udf ansys inc 2009 the sub routine define cg motion was used for giving heaving and pitching motions to the required point on the rigid body ansys inc 2009 dynamic meshing enabled the fluid surrounding the foil to be appropriately deformed and capture the effects of these motions a combination of smoothing layering and remeshing was used to modify the grids after each time step smoothing and remeshing parameters were critical in avoiding negative cell volumes a spring constant of 1 which imposes the default damping factor obtained from equilibrium of the springs attached to a node was found to be most effective this value of spring constant deforms the fin boundary cells along with the interior cells of the mesh thereby avoiding negative cell volumes during fin motion lower values generated the negative cell volume error more information on choosing this spring constant value is provided in the ansys fluent manual ansys inc 2009 local cell remeshing based on length and skewness scales appropriate for the mesh was considered enabling the mesh structure to be maintained over time 2 3 1 simulation setup 2d simulations employed a domain of size 4c 2c along the longitudinal and transverse axes respectively where c represents the chord length of the foil an unstructured triangular mesh was employed using the body of influence method to distinguish kernel and non kernel areas using the knowledge of the grid independence study see section 2 3 2 below for details a minimum element size of 3 mm at a growth rate of 8 was used which gave rise to a total of 3 2 104 elements time step sizes in transient simulations were employed from 0 005 s to 0 0075 s depending on the frequency and amplitude of motion the motion was repeated for three cycles and results were computed over the latter two for 3d simulations the domain size in a span wise symmetric plane was the same for all shapes and was equivalent to the one employed in the 2d case the spanwise lengths varied depending on the shape but were sufficiently large to contain the shape and exclude boundary effects an unstructured tetrahedral mesh was employed in each case with a minimum element size of 4 mm at a growth rate of 8 the total number of elements varied from about 10 105 to 15 105 which is finer than the mesh used by zhou et al in their numerical study zhou et al 2016 to obtain appreciable results both 2d and 3d meshes were sufficiently refined as per the requirement that the size of the cells surrounding the body should be at least 1 25 to 1 30 of the characteristic chord length yang et al 2011 a time step size of 0 005 s was found to be acceptable for all simulations and the results were computed in a manner similar to 2d this value of time step is calculated based on the flow and the fin s velocity to avoid negative cell volume errors with this time step the ratio of the smallest mesh size to flow velocity is around 0 02 s the time taken for a fluid particle to cover a single mesh element the time step used in our simulations is well below this value also the fin boundary displacement should be less than half of the size of the boundary cells in a single time step a general rule of thumb our value of time step ensures this criterion 2 3 2 grid independence motion parameters employed in the grid independence study were f 1 5 hz a 0 075 st 0 18 table 1 gives the description of the two meshes which were compared note that the element size mentioned is for the domain of influence which forms the kernel area it is seen that there is not much variation in the force obtained for the two mesh sizes considered fig 3 table 1 shows that the average values are also within 3 of one another 2 3 3 validation with well refined grids fluent is known to perform well for various other studies including analysis of vortex street behind bluff bodies to appreciable accuracy for validation results from oscillating foil experiments conducted by anderson et al 1998 were used a naca0012 profile with chord length c 0 1 m amplitude a 0 075 m velocity u 0 4 m s reynolds number re 40 000 phase angle between heaving and pitching ψ 90 st 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 is used for each st the frequency of oscillation f was varied to be 0 533 hz 0 67 hz and 0 8 hz respectively other parameters were similar to those used in their experiments a coefficient of thrust as defined by anderson et al is given in eq 7 where f x is the average thrust force over a cycle 7 c x f x 1 2 ρ c s u 2 a sufficiently refined mesh obtained from the grid independence study was used for validation define cg motion ansys inc 2009 was used for imparting motion through the udf with the pitching distance b 0 033 m efficiency η and thrust coefficient c x as defined in eqs 5 and 7 were compared between results from our numerical scheme and previously published experimental results as shown in fig 4 we observe that numerical values are in good agreement with experimental results for both c x and η further we note that our results are within a margin of 10 from those of anderson et al 1998 however their experiment is at re 40 000 which could involve higher turbulence than the cases considered in this paper where re 20 000 therefore the error percentage of the simulations in our study would be much lesser than 10 assuming that turbulence could be the major source of error moreover these results show similarities with those for near fin flow visualizations and with delta wings this gives confidence in our numerical model to represent the process well in the range of flow and motion parameters considered it was however not possible to further validate the results using non rectangular fins due to lack of experimental or theoretical studies for such cases 3 results in this section the thrust force power consumption and efficiency results from the numerical simulations of the shapes in comparison are reported results are first presented for 2d simulations from which the appropriate range of strouhal numbers is derived and then used for the 3d computational study 3 1 2d simulations 2d simulations were performed with the conditions listed in the previous section and thrust force f x heaving force f y and pitching moment m z values were obtained for the first set of 2d simulations having f 1 hz and a 0 05 m the optimal efficiency range was observed to be between st 0 2 0 25 fig 5 b which is within the predicted range of optimal st triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 to test the validity of this range simulations at f 1 5 hz and a 0 075 m were carried out fig 5 b the optimal range of efficiency was still found to lie between st 0 2 0 25 though it was observed that thrust forces produced increased with an increase in either frequency or amplitude of motion the purpose of 2d simulations was also to devise a computationally less intensive procedure to understand the range of optimal st to be used for 3d simulations in the comparative study of various shapes it was observed that the range to be used is between st 0 2 0 25 but from fig 5 b it was seen that there is a fall in the propulsive performance beyond st 0 2 in addition triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 have observed that the range of optimal st in many species of fish is between 0 25 and 0 35 thus an intersection range of 0 2 0 3 was used for 3d simulations where a peak in efficiency was expected to be observed corresponding to the optimal efficiency 3 2 3d simulations simulations were run between st 0 2 and st 0 3 the nature of the plots observed for each simulation was similar to the ones obtained for the 2d case and an averaging was performed over the second and third cycle for obtaining f x f y m z and η estimates the thrust power consumption and efficiency for all shapes are plotted against the aforementioned range of strouhal numbers in fig 6 shape 4 was found to be the most efficient shape 7 to produce the highest thrust and shape 6 to have the highest power consumption shape 4 has an overall increase in efficiency by 11 3 from the basic rectangular plate shape 1 also shape 1 is found to produce the lowest thrust consuming least power while shape 6 being the least efficient the optimal shape obtained confirms that fishes obtain an advantage in propulsive performance through a narrower caudal peduncle intermediate leading edge angle and a small amount of forking as predicted by the 2d studies 3d simulations show that the optimal range of strouhal number is between 0 2 st 0 3 thereby saving computational resources while all the shapes obtained a peak in propulsive performance around st 0 25 fig 6 the values for efficiency were different for different shapes showing that the shape plays a major role in fin based motion although fins of the same area were used more discussion and observations on the possible reasons for such behavior are given in the following section 4 discussion it was shown in the previous section that shape 4 with moderate forking and medium delta angle value yields the most efficient propulsive performance fig 6 it can be seen that shapes with low leading edge angles generate higher thrust and also consume more power noting similar results for delta wings of aircraft here we relate thrust production in fins to behavior of the leading edge vortices levs during the cycle this section is dedicated to a discussion of this relation using numerical simulations the presence of levs and their benefits have been extensively studied for delta wings of aircraft experiments on delta wings show that decreasing the leading edge angle results in an increase in the lift and drag forces polhamus 1966 this is found to be because of stronger vortices separating early from the surface of wings with low leading edge angles hemsch and luckring 1990 as the vortices separate and convect backward they impart a low pressure on the downstream surfaces of the fin and produce additional thrust this mechanism generates additional lift and is referred to as augmented vortex lift lamar 2012 however if there is a reduction of area in the downstream direction in the case of arrow wings for example the amount of lift produced would be lower than normal delta wings and vice versa lamar 1976 here we wish to draw an analogy for our underwater flapping fin problem with that of the aircraft delta wing thielicke et al 2011 claim that the vortex lift modelling as used for delta wings with a quasi steady approach provides good agreement with experiments of flapping bird wings at reynolds number in ranges of about 103 104 we first observe that the behavior of levs and the thrust production mechanism of flapping fins from our simulations are very similar to the flow dynamics of a delta wing the decrease of leading edge angle leads to an increase in the thrust produced fig 7 whereas for the same delta angle an increase of forking yields a decrease in thrust see for example the thrust generated by shape 4 and 5 fig 8 despite having the same delta angle shape 4 produces a lower thrust compared to shape 5 and also consumes lesser power the same trend is observed in the case of shape 6 and shape 7 shape 6 despite having a slightly lower leading edge angle produces lesser thrust than shape 7 due to increased forking in shape 6 these trends are coherent with the trends observed for forces generated by delta wings fig 7 shows this trend for all shapes considered let us now make a detailed comparison of shapes 5 and 6 which lie at two different ends in terms of the leading edge angle and amount of forking it can be seen that levs start separating from the leading edge of shape 5 at around 0 18 s see fig 9 whereas those from shape 6 grow faster and start separating at an earlier time value of around 0 14 s see fig 10 in shape 5 at a time value of 0 22 s the separated vortex with the recognizable shape of the leading edge can also be seen to convect downstream this vortex can also be seen to generate low pressure regions on the surface of the fin we can observe green spots below the vortex at 0 28 s in fig 9 thereby generating vortex augmented thrust similar to vortex augmented lift in delta wings such additional thrusts are found to be lesser in shape 6 due to the amount of forking lesser downstream area this argument is also consistent with thrust production time for these shapes where shape 5 due to delayed separation and vortex thrust augmentation generates thrust for a longer time than shape 6 see fig 8 this shows that a lower delta angle generates vortices which could grow faster and separate earlier while generating low pressures for high thrust at the cost of higher power consumption this trend is shown in figs 7 and 8 the effect of forking has been shown to reduce thrust for the same delta angle but the effect of trailing edge shape is not clear from our study in an experimental study van buren et al 2017 show that the thrust produced and efficiencies improve from more concave shapes to more convex shapes their result is also consistent with the conclusions from our analysis in terms of thrust production where more convex shapes would have more downstream area for increased vortex augmented thrust from separated leading edge vortices in their study certain convex shapes have been found to be more efficient for which they have explained the energetics based on downstream wake patterns our analysis cannot be extended to support their conclusion on efficiency as we have not studied the downstream wake patterns 5 conclusion this paper is set in the context of the development of biomimetic propulsion for compact underwater automated and remotely operated vehicles caudal fin shapes of the same surface area but differing in the aspects of fin leading edge angle or delta angle and nature of forking were compared in the range of motion and flow parameters suitable for bio inspired vehicles using 2d computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations the range of strouhal numbers for which high efficiencies exist was obtained this range was consistent with the findings of triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 this input was then used in 3d simulations where a peak in propulsive performance was observed close to st value of 0 25 peak efficiency was obtained for an intermediate shape having moderate caudal peduncle and small forking the physics of this process was investigated using numerical simulations and the role of leading edge vortices levs was shown to be vital and directly linked to the geometric features of the fin from our analysis we learn that fins produce majority of the thrust by pushing fluid downstream added mass forces by generating levs and through augmented thrust from these convecting downstream over the fin surface lowering the leading edge angle was found to increase the power consumption and increase thrust in certain cases where enough chordwise downstream surface area was present on the fin for augmented vortex thrust by separated leading edge vortices turbulence was not modelled in our simulations in published literature studies on the effect of turbulence on propulsive performance of fins are rare most of the studies deal only with the effect of flow turbulence from the surrounding environment on the propulsive efficiency and not the turbulence generated by the body fin itself borazjani et al 2012 is one such work which talks about turbulence generated by the body fin they show that as the reynolds number increases the vortex structures separate from the fin and breakdown more easily as the inertial forces dominate the viscous forces at low re the vortices are stabilized by the viscous forces whereas at high re the viscous forces would not be able to stabilize the flow therefore leading to turbulence mittal 2004 is another such work but does not talk much about the details of these effects the effect of fin flexibility was also not studied as the aim here was to isolate and understand the effects of fin shape on propulsive performance however the effects of fin flexibility have been studied in literature feilich and lauder 2015 kancharala and roy 2015 another limitation of the current study is the choice of pitching axis location here the pitching axis is chosen to be at the mid chord position but placing an actuator at this position is challenging in reality the motivation for our choice has been from literature which says that the mid chord position for pitching axis would be the most efficient xiao and zhu 2014 also other shapes such as diamond like or shapes with convex trailing edges were not studied in our analysis where vortex augmented thrust may yield advantageous results in certain cases van buren et al 2017 finally it would be interesting to introduce efficiency loss through the effect of leading edge vortices however the growth of leading edge vortices and their separation would depend on the flapping frequency flow velocity and the leading edge angle among other parameters thus quantifying such a term would be challenging and this could be material for further work apart from such limitations conclusions and understanding from our study could be helpful to biomimetic roboticists in the choice of an appropriate fin shape acknowledgements the authors thank the office of alumni and international affairs iit madras for an initial

author response surface method rsm is introduced to develop prediction equations in order to estimate nearshore wave height from offshore wave data when the nearshore measurement data were not available or sufficient the main idea of introducing rsm and developing such prediction equations is to gain a practical and fast estimation of nearshore wave height for a specific region as a substitute for the time consuming and sophisticated numerical wave model in the case of long term wave estimation or frequent wave forecasts a numerical wave model and a semi analytic fit model derived from the wave energy flux conservation equation were used to fit the response surface of nearshore wave height and develop the prediction equations the haitan strait located in the nearshore area of china east sea was selected as the studying area a series of measured wave data obtained from an offshore buoy and 2 nearshore ultrasonic wave gauges from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were taken as an example the predictions given by the proposed equations have correlation coefficients of more than 0 85 and root mean square errors of less than 0 19m which are very reasonable when the equations are considered to be concise efficient and practical keywords wave prediction response surface method fit model wave measurement wave transformation mike21 sw 1 introduction wave height is one of the most important environmental parameters for ocean and coastal engineering the assessment of wave height in project site is a primary task for the design planning and construction of coastal and ocean structures unfortunately in most nearshore regions wave data are not always available or sufficient to determine the wave heights due to the paucity of measurement or limited length of records one of the most common and reasonable way to determine the wave height is to estimate from nearby offshore buoy by considering the wave propagation process browne et al 2007 jts 145 2015 strauss et al 2007 however in nearshore area seabed topography can be very rugged and complex including hilltops slopes valleys etc previous studies show that the wave heights in nearshore area vary spatially due to the complicated bathymetry berkhoff 1973 de león et al 2005 and are greatly affected by the wave transformation processes for example shoaling refraction diffraction and islands sheltering rusu et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 thus making the estimation of nearshore wave height a complicated problem the most challenging part in estimating nearshore wave height from offshore waves is the accurate calculation of offshore nearshore relationship by considering the wave transformation processes theoretical attempts were reported in previous literature based on a 2 dimensional theory and mild slope assumptions arthur et al 1952 jts 145 2015 koh and le méhauté 1966 but in complicated seabed areas these theoretical methods may cause notable errors innovative methods such as artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy logic fl have become a practical and popular tool in recent decades in solving complex correlation problems in ocean engineering previous literatures show that anns and fl can give reasonable predictions in wave propagation and wave forecast problems in nearshore regions browne et al 2006 jain and deo 2006 londhe and deo 2004 makarynskyy 2004 özger 2010 özger and şen 2007 however the model training procedures usually require a large amount of nearshore measurement data which are not always available besides these innovation methods based on machine learning languages are not very user friendly and practical for engineers to apply over the recent decades significant advances have been made in the simulation of wave propagation the third generation spectral wave prediction models such as wam and wavewatch have been widely used for large scale wave forecasts and hindcasts all around the world group 1988 based on the spectral wave model efforts had been devoted to adding shallow water physics to meet the needs for simulation in nearshore areas such as swan and mike21 spectral wave module booij et al 1999 dhi 2012 based on these models successful simulations of nearshore wave propagation and predictions in various regions around the world have been conducted aboobacker et al 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 manson 2012 strauss et al 2007 numerical wave models were proved to be an effective and powerful tool to solve wave propagation problems however in the simulation of nearshore waves very fine mesh is usually required in order to capture the complicated seabed topography which always leads to a great number of computational time and memory allocation the computational time can be extremely long and unacceptable for long term data estimation in another case wave forecasts in the construction site are always not available and engineers have to estimate from offshore wave forecast frequently during the construction chen et al 2015 it may cost too much time and labor for an engineer to use the time consuming and sophisticated numerical model to make frequent like hourly nearshore wave forecast under these circumstances the numerical wave model may not be an efficient and practical tool to apply güner et al 2013 in statistics the response surface methodology rsm is used to explore the relationship between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables box and wilson 1992 in general such a relationship is always unknown but can be approximated by a proper fit model and virtualized as a surface namely response surface khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 with the response surface one can easily obtain the response value on the surface through the fitting function of the surface instead of exploring the explicit relationship the general strategy of rsm is 1 gain a series of sample points of the response variable y against input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x k 2 find a proper fit model y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x k of the response surface to describe the relationship between input and response variables 3 process a best fit procedure to test the fitting goodness and obtain the fitting equation of response surface 4 use the equation to predict the response for various applications in the light of the rsm strategy if the complicated offshore nearshore wave height relationship is regarded as a nonlinear input response system with the response surface of this system the output nearshore wave height can be conveniently gained on response surface and the mathematical expression of the response surface can be regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height to apply the rsm the response surface usually needs a series of sample points to fit but the nearshore wave data are not always available to provide sufficient sample points by taking advantage of the advanced numerical wave model these sample points can be easily obtained in a well calibrated numerical wave model by running a series of specific wave cases then the response surface can be developed by processing a best fit procedure to the sample points with a proper fit model and the fitting function can be regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height in the present work the offshore nearshore wave relationship is regarded as an input response system in which the input parameters are offshore significant wave height h 0 corresponding wave period t 0 and water level l and response parameter is nearshore significant wave height h then the response surface method rsm was introduced to develop concise and practical prediction equations as a substitute for the sophisticated and time consuming numerical wave model the process and methodology to develop and validate such equations are illustrated in fig 1 firstly a numerical wave model in the studying site was developed and well calibrated using 10 day wave data then a series of sample points of nearshore wave height h against input offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 were generated in the numerical wave model for the fitting of response surface secondly based on wave energy flux conservation an equation with undetermined coefficients was derived as a fit model for the response surface the response surface and its mathematical expression were then gained through the best fit procedure to the sample points and the fitting equation was regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave heights to further improve the model the effect of water level changing on wave height was linearized and introduced in the fit model as well finally the results using the proposed prediction equations were compared with measurements from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 2 example site and data sets 2 1 description of the site the example site lies in the haitan strait between fuzhou city and pingtan city in the nearshore area of china east sea as demonstrated in fig 2 it is an island area the seabed in this region is rugged and complex with slopes and valleys the example site has limited fetch in most of the directions but is directly open to the china east sea in the northeast the destructive waves generated by strong monsoon from the northeast in offshore propagate into haitan strait and bring high waves in nearshore area influenced by the complex terrain wave height in this area becomes difficult to determine 2 2 wave data sets in this study a wave measurement campaign was performed in the studying area as illustrated in fig 2 two sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauges were installed at the location m1 119 619 e 25 709 n and m2 119 634 e 25 686 n between the islands the mean water depths at m1 and m2 are 18m and 31m respectively the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauges record the sea surface elevations and automatically compute and output significant wave heights and peak wave periods hourly sun and sun 2007 the hourly offshore wave data were obtained from an offshore buoy named 3 buoy 120 26 e 25 55 n belonging to fjmf fujian marine forecasts which lies at the southeastern corner of the example domain the example site is subjected to tides the hourly water level records were obtained from china sea service website ocean cnss com cn in total 3597 records of wave and water level data from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were gathered during this time period influenced by the strong monsoon from ne the offshore incident waves come from three directions namely ne ene and e the histogram of incident offshore wave directions was calculated and illustrated in fig 3 3 numerical model the numerical wave model applied in this study is set up using software mike21 sw mike21 sw is a state of the art numerical module for analysis and prediction of wave conditions in offshore and coastal areas it includes spectral wind wave model and allows the unstructured mesh the model is able to simulate the transformation of wind generated waves and swells dhi 2012 3 1 governing equation there are two kinds of governing equations for wave transformation in mike21 sw fully spectral formulation and directional decoupled parametric formulation the fully spectral formulation is based on the wave action conservation equation as described in komen et al 1996 and young and verhagen 1996 the directional decoupled parametric formulation is based on a parameterization of the wave action conservation equation the parameterization is made in the frequency domain by considering the zeroth and first moment of the wave action spectrum as independent variables holthuijsen et al 1989 theoretically all problems in coastal and offshore region can be solved by the fully spectral formulation however solving the fully spectral formulation is time consuming and costs more than 8 times the computation time of solving the directional decoupled parametric formulation in the present study case since this study focuses on the nearshore wave propagation the directionally decoupled parametric formulation was selected in order to archive the computation efficiency dhi 2012 the governing equations in directional decoupled parametric formulation are given by holthuijsen et al 1989 as followings 1 c g x m 0 x c g y m 0 y c θ m 0 θ s 0 2 c g x m 1 x c g y m 1 y c θ m 1 θ s 1 where m 0 and m 1 are the zeroth and first moment of the action spectrum respectively x and y are cartesian coordinates θ is the wave direction c g x and c g y are the x and y components of the group velocity c θ is the propagation speed representing the change of action in θ direction and s 0 and s 1 are source terms based on the action spectrum the propagation speeds c g x c g y and c θ are introduced based on the assumption of linear wave theory 3 2 model configuration fig 4 shows the computation domain of the numerical model the dimensions of the computation domain are 50 km across shore by 70 km along shore the digital elevation model dem data and coastal lines datasets are extracted from the latest high resolution nautical charts published by the navigation guarantee department of the chinese navy headquarters in 2014 the dem resolution near the project site is refined using a 1 2000 scaled nautical charts to capture the topography effect on the wave propagation the mesh size of the elements is refined incrementally from offshore to nearshore area to meet a balance between accuracy and efficiency the size of elements near the bridge site are set to be approximately 60m the element size in offshore region is set to 600m the elements around the islands are further refined with a size of 20m to describe the shape of islands the final mesh consists of 37323 triangular elements and 19899 nodes as illustrated in fig 4 the model has 3 types of boundaries 1 inlet wave boundary in the east 2 lateral boundary in the north and south and 3 closed boundary in the west the model is driven by waves on the inlet wave boundary in the east the inlet wave boundary is approximately along the isobaths of 60m depth and therefore wave conditions along the inlet wave boundary are assumed the same this assumption has been widely used in many previous literatures manson 2012 panigrahi and misra 2010 strauss et al 2007 vicinanza et al 2013 the inlet boundary uses the hourly wave conditions from offshore 3 buoy including wave height wave period and wave direction the northern and southern boundaries were defined as lateral boundaries to which a one dimensional transformation is applied from the eastern boundary to zero at the dynamic water line the western land is defined as a closed boundary no wave enter the model from this boundary and waves are fully absorbed at the boundary quasi stationary time formulation is less computationally demanding and works well in nearshore wave transformation simulations according to previous successful studies aboobacker et al 2009 johnson 1998 manson 2012 panigrahi and misra 2010 strauss et al 2007 ti et al 2017 vicinanza et al 2013 the time formulation is using the quasi stationary formulation with low order fast algorithm newton raphson iteration solution technique the environmental parameters used in the simulation are carefully calibrated as follow wave breaking parameters of 1 and γ w s 0 8 bottom roughness k n 0 025m diffraction activated all the directional spreading index uses the default value 7 in mike21 sw since the studying area is small due to a previous work on input sensitivity of this numerical model nearshore waves are dominated by offshore incident waves and wind wave generation can be neglected therefore the wind effect on waves is excluded in the study the input water level uses the water level records to evaluate the performance of numerical model 10 day waves from 30th october 2015 0 00 to 8th november 2015 23 00 in the example site are chosen to run the model 3 3 numerical results as illustrated in fig 5 good agreement can be seen between the modeled and measured curves a regression analysis in terms of r correlation coefficient and rmse root mean square error is used to evaluate the modeled results these parameters are defined as follow 3 r h 0 h 0 h 1 h 1 h 0 h 0 2 h 1 h 1 2 4 rmse h 0 h 1 2 n where h 0 is the measured significant wave height h 1 is the modeled significant wave height n is the number of records as shown in table 1 the regression analysis between the measured and modeled significant wave heights gives the correlation coefficients r of 0 90 and 0 86 at m1 and m2 respectively the rmse are 0 17m and 0 19 m at m1 and m2 respectively the results indicate that the calibrated numerical model is able to give satisfactory nearshore wave heights in the example site 4 response surface method rsm and prediction equation wave transformation in nearshore is a complicated process including multiple physical effect like shoaling refraction diffraction bottom friction and so on and it is hard to give an explicit function to express the nearshore offshore relationship in the light of rsm if the complicated relationship of nearshore propagation process is regarded as a nonlinear input response system the response of nearshore wave height can be gained on the response surface and the mathematical expression of the response surface can be regarded as a prediction model of wave propagation in this section firstly the prediction equations at m1 are developed as a demonstration to show the procedure then the prediction equations at both m1 and m2 are developed for wave predictions 4 1 sample points to obtain the response surface of nearshore significant wave height h some sample points on the response surface are required at first generally nearshore significant wave heights h depend on four variations offshore significant wave height h 0 corresponding wave period t 0 wave direction and water level l a simple situation that the incident wave direction and water level l are determined is discussed at first when wave direction and water level are determined nearshore significant wave height h only depends on input offshore significant wave height h 0 and corresponding wave period t 0 the sample points were generated in the calibrated numerical model by running a series of numerical cases the sample points can be denoted using input parameters h 0 and t 0 5 p h 0 i t 0 j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where h 0 i is the ith input offshore h 0 t 0 j is the jth input offshore t 0 n is the quantity of input offshore h 0 and m is the quantity of input offshore t 0 then the total quantity of sample points is n m to make it brief the input h 0 are denoted as h 0 m i n δ h 0 h 0 m a x using minimum value h 0 m i n step δ h 0 and maximum value h 0 m a x for example the input h 0 of 1 1 5 represents 1m 2m 3m 4m 5m t 0 are denoted in a same way the offshore wave direction and water level were set to ne and 0m respectively a dense scheme of sample points listed in table 2 were generated in numerical model note that the offshore significant wave heights and periods used in table 2 cover almost all the h 0 and t 0 that may possibly occur in the data records fig 6 illustrates the sample points and an imaginary response surface sketched with the sample points with any given input offshore significant wave heights and corresponding periods one can easily gain the response of nearshore wave height h on this response surface however the surface in fig 6 is just an imaginary one and its mathematical expression is unknown 4 2 approach of a fit model for response surface in order to obtain the mathematical expression of the response surface a fit model is developed in this section a proper fit model is important for a successful response surface fitting a good fit model can significantly improve the fitting goodness and reduce the number of required sample data the fit model should also be able to describe the underlying physical processes and are flexible and practical at the same time box and wilson 1992 in rsm the high degree polynomial model is commonly used as a fit model due to its flexibility khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 however the high degree polynomial model contains too many terms and fitting coefficients and usually requires massive sample points thus making it unpractical for wave prediction it needs an efficient and practical fit model for wave prediction according to burnside 1915 and goda 2010 neglecting wind energy input the wave energy flux between two wave rays during wave propagation from offshore to nearshore is a conserved quantity 6 p b p 0 b 0 s d i s where p is nearshore wave energy flux per unit crest length p 0 is offshore wave energy flux per unit crest length b 0 is the distance between two wave rays in offshore b is the distance between two wave rays in nearshore s d i s is the dissipation of wave energy flux during the propagation due to the complicated wave physics during propagation and the diversity of seabed topography it is very difficult to directly determine the value of variations b b 0 and s d i s in eq 6 to simplify this problem and obtain a concise expression eq 6 can be also written as 7 p p 0 1 where 1 is defined as an unknown function representing the total dissipation of wave energy flux per unit crest length during nearshore wave propagation given the knowledge of wave energy flux eq 7 can be also written as 8 e c n 1 e c n 0 where e is wave energy c is phase speed n is the ratio of wave group speed and phase speed wave energy is formulated as 9 e 1 8 ρ g h 2 where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration h is wave height according to airy wave theory n is 10 n 1 2 1 2 k d s i n h 2 k d where d is water depth and k is wave number in offshore deep water n 0 1 2 assume that wave period stay constant during wave propagation goda 2010 given the basic knowledge of airy wave with eq 8 10 nearshore wave height h can be written as 11 h 1 1 2 π d l sinh 2 π d l h 0 tanh k d given the dispersion relation of airy waves 12 l gt 2 2 π tanh k d gt 2 2 π tanh 2 π l d as discussed before the main aim is to obtain a concise fit model for nearshore wave height h containing input parameters of offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 however from eq 12 we can see that wave length l has no explicit expression against period t 0 a good model should be not only embedded with the explicit physical process between inputs and response but also need to be flexible enough with adequate coefficients for a closer and better fitting bollen and long 1993 in the light of this statement to simplify this problem in eq 11 and eq 12 tanh k d is substituted by an undetermined function 2 with eq 11 and eq 12 the nearshore wave height h can be written as 13 h h 0 1 8 π 2 d g 2 t 2 0 sinh 8 π 2 d g 2 t 2 0 1 2 eq 13 is a concise and simple formulation of nearshore h against offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 the unknown functions 1 and 2 are hard to obtain and explicitly express in terms of h 0 and t 0 therefore they are defined as fitting coefficients after constant folding eq 13 is written as 14 h h 0 1 b 2 t 2 0 sinh b t 2 0 a where a and b are fitting coefficients given the relationship 15 sinh x e x e x 2 e x 2 1 e 2 x e x 2 3 where 3 1 e 2 x then eq 14 becomes 16 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e b t 2 0 2 3 a where 3 1 e 2 x to make the model more flexible and improve the fitting goodness function 3 is regarded as a fitting coefficient as well after constant folding the fit model can be written as 17 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 a where a b and c are independent fitting coefficients note that eq 17 is derived under a regular wave situation the waves are all irregular in real world however according to goda 2010 and jts 145 2015 2015 in a simplified way we can solve wave propagation problems by using representative regular wave parameters e g offshore significant wave height h 0 and corresponding wave period t 0 therefore the fit model for nearshore significant wave height h response surface can be written as 18 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 a 4 3 fitting tests to test the validation of the fit model the fit model is used to fit the response surface with the sample points which were generated previously in table 2 all the fittings in this study use the method of least squares in software matlab fitting tools fitzgibbon et al 1999 the fitting results and fitting goodness are illustrated in fig 7 and listed in table 3 the fitting goodness is evaluated in terms of determination coefficient r 2 and rmse the determination coefficient is defined as follow 19 r 2 1 h 1 h 0 2 h 0 h 0 2 where h 0 is the significant wave height of sample points h 1 is the significant wave height given by fitted model it can be observed that the fitting surface perfectly covers the almost all the sample points the fitting results show a very satisfactory goodness with a r 2 of 0 99 and a rmse of 0 015m it indicates that the proposed fit model correctly reflect the basic relationship of offshore nearshore waves and can be used as an effective fit model for the response surface with the fitting coefficients in table 3 eq 18 can be used as a prediction equation for the nearshore wave height at m1 under wave direction ne and water level 0m 4 4 linearization of water level changing effect many nearshore areas are subjected to tidal variation the changes in water level have obvious influences on nearshore wave propagation once the water level has changed the offshore nearshore relationship during wave propagation will change as well consequently the response surface of nearshore wave heights have to be refitted at each water level which makes the whole procedure sophisticated and unpractical in this section a simplified linear function was introduced into the fit model to consider the water level changing effect following the fitting procedure as introduced previously the response surface at each water level were carried out the maximum range of water level in the example area is from about 3m to 3m due to tides the input water levels were set from 3m to 3m with an interval of 1m in the wave model to generate sample points the generation plans of sample points at each water level were listed in table 4 then the sample points were used to fit the response surface at each water level respectively using eq 18 the fitting results were shown in table 5 it can be seen that the fitting goodness at each water level are all very satisfactory an important phenomenon should be noticed that fitting coefficients b and c barely change compared with their own magnitudes at different water levels it reveals that the changes of water level only have significant effect on the coefficient a to find out the relationship between coefficient a and water level l a linear fitting attempt of the coefficient a against water level l was implemented and visualized in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the coefficient a is approximately linearly related with water level l regarding this relationship the fit model eq 18 can be further written into a more generalized way by considering the linear effect of water level l 20 h h 0 m l n 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 where l is water level m and n are new fitting coefficients eq 20 can be regarded as a new fit model of response surface with the consideration of water level changing effect then use eq 20 to fit all the sample points generated previously in table 4 and the fitting equation is obtained as follow 21 h m 1 n e h 0 0 039 l 0 590 1 1907 t 2 0 e 173 6 t 2 0 the fitting goodness still turned out to be very good with r 2 of 0 99 and rmse of 0 09m now there are 3 input parameters in eq 21 namely offshore significant wave height response surface h 0 corresponding period t 0 and water level l and the response surface will be a 4 dimensional surface which cannot be visualized directly note that eq 21 is only applicable for offshore waves coming from direction ne eq 21 can be used as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height at m1 under wave direction ne it is important to understand that the linearization of water level changing effect is just an approximation in order to approach a concise and practical fit model theoretically the effect of water level changing on wave heights should be a complicated nonlinear function rather than a linear one one reasonable explanation for this linearization is that compared with the water depth 18m the changes of water level 3m to 3m due to tide is a relatively small value the effect on wave height induced by such a small variation in water depth can be approximately simplified as a linear one nevertheless in terms of the fitting goodness the linearization of water level changing effect works very well 4 5 comparison between prediction equation and numerical wave model since the prediction equation eq 21 is fitted based on the sample points generated in numerical wave model it is necessary to compare the equation against numerical results to testify the accuracy the significant wave heights at m1 during a 3 day high energetic wave event from 0 00 30th october 2015 to 23 00 2nd november 2015 were predicted by numerical wave model and the prediction equation eq 21 respectively the reasons to choose this time period for validation are 1 during this wave event the incident wave directions are consistent ne so eq 21 is applicable 2 this wave event includes the growing fully developed and decaying period of waves which is representative the results are illustrated in fig 9 the figure shows very good agreement between the modeled and predicted results with a r value of 0 98 and a rmse value of 0 04m it indicates that the prediction equation eq 21 performs very well 4 6 sensitivity of prediction performance to the quantity of sample points in the introduced procedure to gain the prediction equation using rsm the sample points need to be generated in numerical wave model at first generally the more sample points are used the more accurate a fitting response surface will be khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 however although a dense scheme of sample points can ensure an accurate response surface and a good prediction performance the computational time spent on generating the sample points will also be too massive and unworthy to meet a balance between accuracy and efficiency it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of prediction performance to the quantity of sample points in a similar way as before the input parameters were denoted using minimum value step and maximum value for example the input offshore significant wave heights were denoted as h 0 m i n δ h 0 h 0 m a x to make h 0 evenly spaced given the number of input significant wave height n h 0 δ h 0 can be schemed as 22 δ h 0 h 0 m a x h 0 m i n n h 0 1 the input parameters wave period t 0 and water level l were schemed in a similar way according to the measurement data the ranges of significant wave height wave period and water level in the studying area are 1 5m 5 12s and 3 3m respectively then the input h 0 t 0 and l can be denoted as 23 h 0 1 4 n h 0 1 5 24 t 0 5 7 n t 0 1 12 24 l 3 6 n l 1 3 where n t 0 and n l are the quantity of input wave period t 0 and water level l respectively the total quantity of sample points is n h 0 n t 0 n l sample point plans s1 s6 with different n h 0 n t 0 and n l are listed in table 6 the sample points in each plan were used to process the response surface fitting procedure and then the prediction equations for each plan were obtained these prediction equations were used to predict the significant wave height at m1 during the 3 day wave event from 0 00 30th october 2015 to 23 00 2nd november 2015 the performance of these prediction equations were evaluated by being compared with the numerical wave model results in terms of r and rmse the fitting coefficients and prediction performance are illustrated in table 6 the time series given by different prediction equations from s1 s6 are demonstrated in fig 10 it can be observed in table 6 that the prediction performance of s1 s6 are all very good in terms of r and rmse in fig 10 very small differences are found between these prediction curves and they are all very close to the curve of numerical model these results indicate that the prediction performance is not sensitive to sample points when the quantity of sample points is more than 16 by using only 16 sample points a very satisfactory fitting equation can be gained it also implies that the proposed fit model is very efficient to give an accurate response surface with very few sample points since the proposed fit model is derived based on the nearshore wave propagation process it effectively reflects the basic physical relationship between nearshore and offshore waves and therefore can perform efficiently in the fitting procedure 4 7 prediction equations the prediction equation eq 21 is unidirectional and is only applicable to one offshore wave direction ne considering the possible offshore incident wave directions include ne ene and e in this area a total number of 3 equations are required to estimate the nearshore significant wave height following the fitting procedures as introduced by generating another 2 16 32 sample points using plan s6 for direction ene and e the predicion equations for wave directions ene and e were carried out following the same fitting procedures the prediction equations at m2 can be obtained as well note that the significant wave height at m1 and m2 can be output at the same time in the numerical wave model so there is no need to run another series of numerical cases to obtain the sample points at m2 finally the fitting coefficients for prediction equations at m1 and m2 from ne ene and e are listed in table 7 with the coefficients in table 7 and eq 20 the significant wave heights at m1 and m2 can be predicted easily 5 results and discussions 5 1 predicted results using the prediction equation eq 20 and coefficients in table 7 the significant wave heights at m1 and m2 from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were predicted and validated against measurements as shown in fig 11 the figure shows good agreement between the predicted and the measured significant wave height time series table 8 gives the linear regression analysis between the predicted and measured results the linear regression shows r values of 0 90 and 0 85 at m1 and m2 respectively rmse values are 0 17 m at m1 and 0 21 m at m2 these results indicate that the significant wave heights predicted by the proposed prediction equations are satisfactory 5 2 computational efficiency the main idea of developing such prediction equations is to gain a rapid and practical estimation of nearshore wave heights therefore it is necessary to discuss the computational efficiency the computations in this study are performed on an intel xeon e5 2603 1 60ghz 16 gb workstation 6 cores the computational time of wave estimation from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 is discussed considering the computation for such a long period in numerical model is extremely time consuming the total computational time is estimated from single step computational time and total time steps the average computational time of a single step or one sample point in the numerical model is 1 75 min and the computation includes 3624 steps the comparison of computational times using wave model and prediction equations are shown in table 9 from table 9 it can be seen that using the proposed prediction equation can significantly reduce the computational time the prediction equations only require insignificant time on generating the sample points for rsm fitting procedure in the studying site the incident offshore waves are coming from 3 directions so 16 3 48 sample points need to be generated using plan s6 in table 6 moreover the developing of the prediction equations is a once and for all process once they have been developed these equations can be used repeatedly note that the prediction equations developed in this study only focuses on wave height which is a predominant wave parameter in engineering it is important to understand that the prediction equation is not an alternative to the numerical wave model which can provide comprehensive spatial wave information however using numerical wave model to estimate the long term data can be extremely time consuming besides nearshore wave forecast is always required during engineering construction and it may be too sophisticated and inefficient for engineers to apply a numerical model for the forecast in case of these situations the prediction equations are efficient and practical to use as a substitute for the numerical wave model 6 summary and conclusions wave height data in nearshore areas are not always available or sufficient for ocean and coastal engineering application due to the paucity of measurement or limited length of records and sometimes may need to estimate from offshore wave data by considering the complicated wave propagation process within the scope of this study response surface method was introduced to explore the offshore nearshore relationship and a set of prediction equations were developed based on the response surface method in order to gain a rapid and practical estimation of the nearshore wave heights for a specific region at first a well calibrated mike21 sw numerical wave model in the studying area was setup to obtain the sample points for response surface fitting based on wave energy flux conservation a concise equation with undetermined coefficients was derived as a fit model for the nearshore wave height response surface furthermore the effect of water level changing due to tides was linearized and introduced into the fit model fitting tests indicate that the proposed fit model performs very well and sensitivity analysis shows that the fit model can efficiently give an accurate fitting equation by using only 16 sample points finally the prediction equations at m1 and m2 were developed and significant wave heights from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were predicted and validated against measurements the results show that the proposed prediction equations based on rsm give satisfactory predictions of significant wave heights at m1 and m2 with r values more than 0 85 and rmse values less than 0 19m the proposed equations are efficient and can reduce significant computational time compared with numerical wave model note that since wave breaking is not considered in the fit model the prediction may not be applicable in breaking zone also this method was only testified at two locations in the nearshore area of china east sea as a demonstration in this study in the future this method should be also validated in various coastal environments and improved by considering more wave situations realistic validation for longer time period should be also employed as well acknowledgements this work was financially

author response surface method rsm is introduced to develop prediction equations in order to estimate nearshore wave height from offshore wave data when the nearshore measurement data were not available or sufficient the main idea of introducing rsm and developing such prediction equations is to gain a practical and fast estimation of nearshore wave height for a specific region as a substitute for the time consuming and sophisticated numerical wave model in the case of long term wave estimation or frequent wave forecasts a numerical wave model and a semi analytic fit model derived from the wave energy flux conservation equation were used to fit the response surface of nearshore wave height and develop the prediction equations the haitan strait located in the nearshore area of china east sea was selected as the studying area a series of measured wave data obtained from an offshore buoy and 2 nearshore ultrasonic wave gauges from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were taken as an example the predictions given by the proposed equations have correlation coefficients of more than 0 85 and root mean square errors of less than 0 19m which are very reasonable when the equations are considered to be concise efficient and practical keywords wave prediction response surface method fit model wave measurement wave transformation mike21 sw 1 introduction wave height is one of the most important environmental parameters for ocean and coastal engineering the assessment of wave height in project site is a primary task for the design planning and construction of coastal and ocean structures unfortunately in most nearshore regions wave data are not always available or sufficient to determine the wave heights due to the paucity of measurement or limited length of records one of the most common and reasonable way to determine the wave height is to estimate from nearby offshore buoy by considering the wave propagation process browne et al 2007 jts 145 2015 strauss et al 2007 however in nearshore area seabed topography can be very rugged and complex including hilltops slopes valleys etc previous studies show that the wave heights in nearshore area vary spatially due to the complicated bathymetry berkhoff 1973 de león et al 2005 and are greatly affected by the wave transformation processes for example shoaling refraction diffraction and islands sheltering rusu et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 thus making the estimation of nearshore wave height a complicated problem the most challenging part in estimating nearshore wave height from offshore waves is the accurate calculation of offshore nearshore relationship by considering the wave transformation processes theoretical attempts were reported in previous literature based on a 2 dimensional theory and mild slope assumptions arthur et al 1952 jts 145 2015 koh and le méhauté 1966 but in complicated seabed areas these theoretical methods may cause notable errors innovative methods such as artificial neural networks anns and fuzzy logic fl have become a practical and popular tool in recent decades in solving complex correlation problems in ocean engineering previous literatures show that anns and fl can give reasonable predictions in wave propagation and wave forecast problems in nearshore regions browne et al 2006 jain and deo 2006 londhe and deo 2004 makarynskyy 2004 özger 2010 özger and şen 2007 however the model training procedures usually require a large amount of nearshore measurement data which are not always available besides these innovation methods based on machine learning languages are not very user friendly and practical for engineers to apply over the recent decades significant advances have been made in the simulation of wave propagation the third generation spectral wave prediction models such as wam and wavewatch have been widely used for large scale wave forecasts and hindcasts all around the world group 1988 based on the spectral wave model efforts had been devoted to adding shallow water physics to meet the needs for simulation in nearshore areas such as swan and mike21 spectral wave module booij et al 1999 dhi 2012 based on these models successful simulations of nearshore wave propagation and predictions in various regions around the world have been conducted aboobacker et al 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 manson 2012 strauss et al 2007 numerical wave models were proved to be an effective and powerful tool to solve wave propagation problems however in the simulation of nearshore waves very fine mesh is usually required in order to capture the complicated seabed topography which always leads to a great number of computational time and memory allocation the computational time can be extremely long and unacceptable for long term data estimation in another case wave forecasts in the construction site are always not available and engineers have to estimate from offshore wave forecast frequently during the construction chen et al 2015 it may cost too much time and labor for an engineer to use the time consuming and sophisticated numerical model to make frequent like hourly nearshore wave forecast under these circumstances the numerical wave model may not be an efficient and practical tool to apply güner et al 2013 in statistics the response surface methodology rsm is used to explore the relationship between several explanatory variables and one or more response variables box and wilson 1992 in general such a relationship is always unknown but can be approximated by a proper fit model and virtualized as a surface namely response surface khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 with the response surface one can easily obtain the response value on the surface through the fitting function of the surface instead of exploring the explicit relationship the general strategy of rsm is 1 gain a series of sample points of the response variable y against input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x k 2 find a proper fit model y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x k of the response surface to describe the relationship between input and response variables 3 process a best fit procedure to test the fitting goodness and obtain the fitting equation of response surface 4 use the equation to predict the response for various applications in the light of the rsm strategy if the complicated offshore nearshore wave height relationship is regarded as a nonlinear input response system with the response surface of this system the output nearshore wave height can be conveniently gained on response surface and the mathematical expression of the response surface can be regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height to apply the rsm the response surface usually needs a series of sample points to fit but the nearshore wave data are not always available to provide sufficient sample points by taking advantage of the advanced numerical wave model these sample points can be easily obtained in a well calibrated numerical wave model by running a series of specific wave cases then the response surface can be developed by processing a best fit procedure to the sample points with a proper fit model and the fitting function can be regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height in the present work the offshore nearshore wave relationship is regarded as an input response system in which the input parameters are offshore significant wave height h 0 corresponding wave period t 0 and water level l and response parameter is nearshore significant wave height h then the response surface method rsm was introduced to develop concise and practical prediction equations as a substitute for the sophisticated and time consuming numerical wave model the process and methodology to develop and validate such equations are illustrated in fig 1 firstly a numerical wave model in the studying site was developed and well calibrated using 10 day wave data then a series of sample points of nearshore wave height h against input offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 were generated in the numerical wave model for the fitting of response surface secondly based on wave energy flux conservation an equation with undetermined coefficients was derived as a fit model for the response surface the response surface and its mathematical expression were then gained through the best fit procedure to the sample points and the fitting equation was regarded as a prediction equation of nearshore wave heights to further improve the model the effect of water level changing on wave height was linearized and introduced in the fit model as well finally the results using the proposed prediction equations were compared with measurements from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 2 example site and data sets 2 1 description of the site the example site lies in the haitan strait between fuzhou city and pingtan city in the nearshore area of china east sea as demonstrated in fig 2 it is an island area the seabed in this region is rugged and complex with slopes and valleys the example site has limited fetch in most of the directions but is directly open to the china east sea in the northeast the destructive waves generated by strong monsoon from the northeast in offshore propagate into haitan strait and bring high waves in nearshore area influenced by the complex terrain wave height in this area becomes difficult to determine 2 2 wave data sets in this study a wave measurement campaign was performed in the studying area as illustrated in fig 2 two sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauges were installed at the location m1 119 619 e 25 709 n and m2 119 634 e 25 686 n between the islands the mean water depths at m1 and m2 are 18m and 31m respectively the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauges record the sea surface elevations and automatically compute and output significant wave heights and peak wave periods hourly sun and sun 2007 the hourly offshore wave data were obtained from an offshore buoy named 3 buoy 120 26 e 25 55 n belonging to fjmf fujian marine forecasts which lies at the southeastern corner of the example domain the example site is subjected to tides the hourly water level records were obtained from china sea service website ocean cnss com cn in total 3597 records of wave and water level data from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were gathered during this time period influenced by the strong monsoon from ne the offshore incident waves come from three directions namely ne ene and e the histogram of incident offshore wave directions was calculated and illustrated in fig 3 3 numerical model the numerical wave model applied in this study is set up using software mike21 sw mike21 sw is a state of the art numerical module for analysis and prediction of wave conditions in offshore and coastal areas it includes spectral wind wave model and allows the unstructured mesh the model is able to simulate the transformation of wind generated waves and swells dhi 2012 3 1 governing equation there are two kinds of governing equations for wave transformation in mike21 sw fully spectral formulation and directional decoupled parametric formulation the fully spectral formulation is based on the wave action conservation equation as described in komen et al 1996 and young and verhagen 1996 the directional decoupled parametric formulation is based on a parameterization of the wave action conservation equation the parameterization is made in the frequency domain by considering the zeroth and first moment of the wave action spectrum as independent variables holthuijsen et al 1989 theoretically all problems in coastal and offshore region can be solved by the fully spectral formulation however solving the fully spectral formulation is time consuming and costs more than 8 times the computation time of solving the directional decoupled parametric formulation in the present study case since this study focuses on the nearshore wave propagation the directionally decoupled parametric formulation was selected in order to archive the computation efficiency dhi 2012 the governing equations in directional decoupled parametric formulation are given by holthuijsen et al 1989 as followings 1 c g x m 0 x c g y m 0 y c θ m 0 θ s 0 2 c g x m 1 x c g y m 1 y c θ m 1 θ s 1 where m 0 and m 1 are the zeroth and first moment of the action spectrum respectively x and y are cartesian coordinates θ is the wave direction c g x and c g y are the x and y components of the group velocity c θ is the propagation speed representing the change of action in θ direction and s 0 and s 1 are source terms based on the action spectrum the propagation speeds c g x c g y and c θ are introduced based on the assumption of linear wave theory 3 2 model configuration fig 4 shows the computation domain of the numerical model the dimensions of the computation domain are 50 km across shore by 70 km along shore the digital elevation model dem data and coastal lines datasets are extracted from the latest high resolution nautical charts published by the navigation guarantee department of the chinese navy headquarters in 2014 the dem resolution near the project site is refined using a 1 2000 scaled nautical charts to capture the topography effect on the wave propagation the mesh size of the elements is refined incrementally from offshore to nearshore area to meet a balance between accuracy and efficiency the size of elements near the bridge site are set to be approximately 60m the element size in offshore region is set to 600m the elements around the islands are further refined with a size of 20m to describe the shape of islands the final mesh consists of 37323 triangular elements and 19899 nodes as illustrated in fig 4 the model has 3 types of boundaries 1 inlet wave boundary in the east 2 lateral boundary in the north and south and 3 closed boundary in the west the model is driven by waves on the inlet wave boundary in the east the inlet wave boundary is approximately along the isobaths of 60m depth and therefore wave conditions along the inlet wave boundary are assumed the same this assumption has been widely used in many previous literatures manson 2012 panigrahi and misra 2010 strauss et al 2007 vicinanza et al 2013 the inlet boundary uses the hourly wave conditions from offshore 3 buoy including wave height wave period and wave direction the northern and southern boundaries were defined as lateral boundaries to which a one dimensional transformation is applied from the eastern boundary to zero at the dynamic water line the western land is defined as a closed boundary no wave enter the model from this boundary and waves are fully absorbed at the boundary quasi stationary time formulation is less computationally demanding and works well in nearshore wave transformation simulations according to previous successful studies aboobacker et al 2009 johnson 1998 manson 2012 panigrahi and misra 2010 strauss et al 2007 ti et al 2017 vicinanza et al 2013 the time formulation is using the quasi stationary formulation with low order fast algorithm newton raphson iteration solution technique the environmental parameters used in the simulation are carefully calibrated as follow wave breaking parameters of 1 and γ w s 0 8 bottom roughness k n 0 025m diffraction activated all the directional spreading index uses the default value 7 in mike21 sw since the studying area is small due to a previous work on input sensitivity of this numerical model nearshore waves are dominated by offshore incident waves and wind wave generation can be neglected therefore the wind effect on waves is excluded in the study the input water level uses the water level records to evaluate the performance of numerical model 10 day waves from 30th october 2015 0 00 to 8th november 2015 23 00 in the example site are chosen to run the model 3 3 numerical results as illustrated in fig 5 good agreement can be seen between the modeled and measured curves a regression analysis in terms of r correlation coefficient and rmse root mean square error is used to evaluate the modeled results these parameters are defined as follow 3 r h 0 h 0 h 1 h 1 h 0 h 0 2 h 1 h 1 2 4 rmse h 0 h 1 2 n where h 0 is the measured significant wave height h 1 is the modeled significant wave height n is the number of records as shown in table 1 the regression analysis between the measured and modeled significant wave heights gives the correlation coefficients r of 0 90 and 0 86 at m1 and m2 respectively the rmse are 0 17m and 0 19 m at m1 and m2 respectively the results indicate that the calibrated numerical model is able to give satisfactory nearshore wave heights in the example site 4 response surface method rsm and prediction equation wave transformation in nearshore is a complicated process including multiple physical effect like shoaling refraction diffraction bottom friction and so on and it is hard to give an explicit function to express the nearshore offshore relationship in the light of rsm if the complicated relationship of nearshore propagation process is regarded as a nonlinear input response system the response of nearshore wave height can be gained on the response surface and the mathematical expression of the response surface can be regarded as a prediction model of wave propagation in this section firstly the prediction equations at m1 are developed as a demonstration to show the procedure then the prediction equations at both m1 and m2 are developed for wave predictions 4 1 sample points to obtain the response surface of nearshore significant wave height h some sample points on the response surface are required at first generally nearshore significant wave heights h depend on four variations offshore significant wave height h 0 corresponding wave period t 0 wave direction and water level l a simple situation that the incident wave direction and water level l are determined is discussed at first when wave direction and water level are determined nearshore significant wave height h only depends on input offshore significant wave height h 0 and corresponding wave period t 0 the sample points were generated in the calibrated numerical model by running a series of numerical cases the sample points can be denoted using input parameters h 0 and t 0 5 p h 0 i t 0 j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where h 0 i is the ith input offshore h 0 t 0 j is the jth input offshore t 0 n is the quantity of input offshore h 0 and m is the quantity of input offshore t 0 then the total quantity of sample points is n m to make it brief the input h 0 are denoted as h 0 m i n δ h 0 h 0 m a x using minimum value h 0 m i n step δ h 0 and maximum value h 0 m a x for example the input h 0 of 1 1 5 represents 1m 2m 3m 4m 5m t 0 are denoted in a same way the offshore wave direction and water level were set to ne and 0m respectively a dense scheme of sample points listed in table 2 were generated in numerical model note that the offshore significant wave heights and periods used in table 2 cover almost all the h 0 and t 0 that may possibly occur in the data records fig 6 illustrates the sample points and an imaginary response surface sketched with the sample points with any given input offshore significant wave heights and corresponding periods one can easily gain the response of nearshore wave height h on this response surface however the surface in fig 6 is just an imaginary one and its mathematical expression is unknown 4 2 approach of a fit model for response surface in order to obtain the mathematical expression of the response surface a fit model is developed in this section a proper fit model is important for a successful response surface fitting a good fit model can significantly improve the fitting goodness and reduce the number of required sample data the fit model should also be able to describe the underlying physical processes and are flexible and practical at the same time box and wilson 1992 in rsm the high degree polynomial model is commonly used as a fit model due to its flexibility khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 however the high degree polynomial model contains too many terms and fitting coefficients and usually requires massive sample points thus making it unpractical for wave prediction it needs an efficient and practical fit model for wave prediction according to burnside 1915 and goda 2010 neglecting wind energy input the wave energy flux between two wave rays during wave propagation from offshore to nearshore is a conserved quantity 6 p b p 0 b 0 s d i s where p is nearshore wave energy flux per unit crest length p 0 is offshore wave energy flux per unit crest length b 0 is the distance between two wave rays in offshore b is the distance between two wave rays in nearshore s d i s is the dissipation of wave energy flux during the propagation due to the complicated wave physics during propagation and the diversity of seabed topography it is very difficult to directly determine the value of variations b b 0 and s d i s in eq 6 to simplify this problem and obtain a concise expression eq 6 can be also written as 7 p p 0 1 where 1 is defined as an unknown function representing the total dissipation of wave energy flux per unit crest length during nearshore wave propagation given the knowledge of wave energy flux eq 7 can be also written as 8 e c n 1 e c n 0 where e is wave energy c is phase speed n is the ratio of wave group speed and phase speed wave energy is formulated as 9 e 1 8 ρ g h 2 where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration h is wave height according to airy wave theory n is 10 n 1 2 1 2 k d s i n h 2 k d where d is water depth and k is wave number in offshore deep water n 0 1 2 assume that wave period stay constant during wave propagation goda 2010 given the basic knowledge of airy wave with eq 8 10 nearshore wave height h can be written as 11 h 1 1 2 π d l sinh 2 π d l h 0 tanh k d given the dispersion relation of airy waves 12 l gt 2 2 π tanh k d gt 2 2 π tanh 2 π l d as discussed before the main aim is to obtain a concise fit model for nearshore wave height h containing input parameters of offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 however from eq 12 we can see that wave length l has no explicit expression against period t 0 a good model should be not only embedded with the explicit physical process between inputs and response but also need to be flexible enough with adequate coefficients for a closer and better fitting bollen and long 1993 in the light of this statement to simplify this problem in eq 11 and eq 12 tanh k d is substituted by an undetermined function 2 with eq 11 and eq 12 the nearshore wave height h can be written as 13 h h 0 1 8 π 2 d g 2 t 2 0 sinh 8 π 2 d g 2 t 2 0 1 2 eq 13 is a concise and simple formulation of nearshore h against offshore wave height h 0 and period t 0 the unknown functions 1 and 2 are hard to obtain and explicitly express in terms of h 0 and t 0 therefore they are defined as fitting coefficients after constant folding eq 13 is written as 14 h h 0 1 b 2 t 2 0 sinh b t 2 0 a where a and b are fitting coefficients given the relationship 15 sinh x e x e x 2 e x 2 1 e 2 x e x 2 3 where 3 1 e 2 x then eq 14 becomes 16 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e b t 2 0 2 3 a where 3 1 e 2 x to make the model more flexible and improve the fitting goodness function 3 is regarded as a fitting coefficient as well after constant folding the fit model can be written as 17 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 a where a b and c are independent fitting coefficients note that eq 17 is derived under a regular wave situation the waves are all irregular in real world however according to goda 2010 and jts 145 2015 2015 in a simplified way we can solve wave propagation problems by using representative regular wave parameters e g offshore significant wave height h 0 and corresponding wave period t 0 therefore the fit model for nearshore significant wave height h response surface can be written as 18 h h 0 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 a 4 3 fitting tests to test the validation of the fit model the fit model is used to fit the response surface with the sample points which were generated previously in table 2 all the fittings in this study use the method of least squares in software matlab fitting tools fitzgibbon et al 1999 the fitting results and fitting goodness are illustrated in fig 7 and listed in table 3 the fitting goodness is evaluated in terms of determination coefficient r 2 and rmse the determination coefficient is defined as follow 19 r 2 1 h 1 h 0 2 h 0 h 0 2 where h 0 is the significant wave height of sample points h 1 is the significant wave height given by fitted model it can be observed that the fitting surface perfectly covers the almost all the sample points the fitting results show a very satisfactory goodness with a r 2 of 0 99 and a rmse of 0 015m it indicates that the proposed fit model correctly reflect the basic relationship of offshore nearshore waves and can be used as an effective fit model for the response surface with the fitting coefficients in table 3 eq 18 can be used as a prediction equation for the nearshore wave height at m1 under wave direction ne and water level 0m 4 4 linearization of water level changing effect many nearshore areas are subjected to tidal variation the changes in water level have obvious influences on nearshore wave propagation once the water level has changed the offshore nearshore relationship during wave propagation will change as well consequently the response surface of nearshore wave heights have to be refitted at each water level which makes the whole procedure sophisticated and unpractical in this section a simplified linear function was introduced into the fit model to consider the water level changing effect following the fitting procedure as introduced previously the response surface at each water level were carried out the maximum range of water level in the example area is from about 3m to 3m due to tides the input water levels were set from 3m to 3m with an interval of 1m in the wave model to generate sample points the generation plans of sample points at each water level were listed in table 4 then the sample points were used to fit the response surface at each water level respectively using eq 18 the fitting results were shown in table 5 it can be seen that the fitting goodness at each water level are all very satisfactory an important phenomenon should be noticed that fitting coefficients b and c barely change compared with their own magnitudes at different water levels it reveals that the changes of water level only have significant effect on the coefficient a to find out the relationship between coefficient a and water level l a linear fitting attempt of the coefficient a against water level l was implemented and visualized in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the coefficient a is approximately linearly related with water level l regarding this relationship the fit model eq 18 can be further written into a more generalized way by considering the linear effect of water level l 20 h h 0 m l n 1 b t 2 0 e c t 2 0 where l is water level m and n are new fitting coefficients eq 20 can be regarded as a new fit model of response surface with the consideration of water level changing effect then use eq 20 to fit all the sample points generated previously in table 4 and the fitting equation is obtained as follow 21 h m 1 n e h 0 0 039 l 0 590 1 1907 t 2 0 e 173 6 t 2 0 the fitting goodness still turned out to be very good with r 2 of 0 99 and rmse of 0 09m now there are 3 input parameters in eq 21 namely offshore significant wave height response surface h 0 corresponding period t 0 and water level l and the response surface will be a 4 dimensional surface which cannot be visualized directly note that eq 21 is only applicable for offshore waves coming from direction ne eq 21 can be used as a prediction equation of nearshore wave height at m1 under wave direction ne it is important to understand that the linearization of water level changing effect is just an approximation in order to approach a concise and practical fit model theoretically the effect of water level changing on wave heights should be a complicated nonlinear function rather than a linear one one reasonable explanation for this linearization is that compared with the water depth 18m the changes of water level 3m to 3m due to tide is a relatively small value the effect on wave height induced by such a small variation in water depth can be approximately simplified as a linear one nevertheless in terms of the fitting goodness the linearization of water level changing effect works very well 4 5 comparison between prediction equation and numerical wave model since the prediction equation eq 21 is fitted based on the sample points generated in numerical wave model it is necessary to compare the equation against numerical results to testify the accuracy the significant wave heights at m1 during a 3 day high energetic wave event from 0 00 30th october 2015 to 23 00 2nd november 2015 were predicted by numerical wave model and the prediction equation eq 21 respectively the reasons to choose this time period for validation are 1 during this wave event the incident wave directions are consistent ne so eq 21 is applicable 2 this wave event includes the growing fully developed and decaying period of waves which is representative the results are illustrated in fig 9 the figure shows very good agreement between the modeled and predicted results with a r value of 0 98 and a rmse value of 0 04m it indicates that the prediction equation eq 21 performs very well 4 6 sensitivity of prediction performance to the quantity of sample points in the introduced procedure to gain the prediction equation using rsm the sample points need to be generated in numerical wave model at first generally the more sample points are used the more accurate a fitting response surface will be khuri and mukhopadhyay 2010 however although a dense scheme of sample points can ensure an accurate response surface and a good prediction performance the computational time spent on generating the sample points will also be too massive and unworthy to meet a balance between accuracy and efficiency it is necessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis of prediction performance to the quantity of sample points in a similar way as before the input parameters were denoted using minimum value step and maximum value for example the input offshore significant wave heights were denoted as h 0 m i n δ h 0 h 0 m a x to make h 0 evenly spaced given the number of input significant wave height n h 0 δ h 0 can be schemed as 22 δ h 0 h 0 m a x h 0 m i n n h 0 1 the input parameters wave period t 0 and water level l were schemed in a similar way according to the measurement data the ranges of significant wave height wave period and water level in the studying area are 1 5m 5 12s and 3 3m respectively then the input h 0 t 0 and l can be denoted as 23 h 0 1 4 n h 0 1 5 24 t 0 5 7 n t 0 1 12 24 l 3 6 n l 1 3 where n t 0 and n l are the quantity of input wave period t 0 and water level l respectively the total quantity of sample points is n h 0 n t 0 n l sample point plans s1 s6 with different n h 0 n t 0 and n l are listed in table 6 the sample points in each plan were used to process the response surface fitting procedure and then the prediction equations for each plan were obtained these prediction equations were used to predict the significant wave height at m1 during the 3 day wave event from 0 00 30th october 2015 to 23 00 2nd november 2015 the performance of these prediction equations were evaluated by being compared with the numerical wave model results in terms of r and rmse the fitting coefficients and prediction performance are illustrated in table 6 the time series given by different prediction equations from s1 s6 are demonstrated in fig 10 it can be observed in table 6 that the prediction performance of s1 s6 are all very good in terms of r and rmse in fig 10 very small differences are found between these prediction curves and they are all very close to the curve of numerical model these results indicate that the prediction performance is not sensitive to sample points when the quantity of sample points is more than 16 by using only 16 sample points a very satisfactory fitting equation can be gained it also implies that the proposed fit model is very efficient to give an accurate response surface with very few sample points since the proposed fit model is derived based on the nearshore wave propagation process it effectively reflects the basic physical relationship between nearshore and offshore waves and therefore can perform efficiently in the fitting procedure 4 7 prediction equations the prediction equation eq 21 is unidirectional and is only applicable to one offshore wave direction ne considering the possible offshore incident wave directions include ne ene and e in this area a total number of 3 equations are required to estimate the nearshore significant wave height following the fitting procedures as introduced by generating another 2 16 32 sample points using plan s6 for direction ene and e the predicion equations for wave directions ene and e were carried out following the same fitting procedures the prediction equations at m2 can be obtained as well note that the significant wave height at m1 and m2 can be output at the same time in the numerical wave model so there is no need to run another series of numerical cases to obtain the sample points at m2 finally the fitting coefficients for prediction equations at m1 and m2 from ne ene and e are listed in table 7 with the coefficients in table 7 and eq 20 the significant wave heights at m1 and m2 can be predicted easily 5 results and discussions 5 1 predicted results using the prediction equation eq 20 and coefficients in table 7 the significant wave heights at m1 and m2 from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were predicted and validated against measurements as shown in fig 11 the figure shows good agreement between the predicted and the measured significant wave height time series table 8 gives the linear regression analysis between the predicted and measured results the linear regression shows r values of 0 90 and 0 85 at m1 and m2 respectively rmse values are 0 17 m at m1 and 0 21 m at m2 these results indicate that the significant wave heights predicted by the proposed prediction equations are satisfactory 5 2 computational efficiency the main idea of developing such prediction equations is to gain a rapid and practical estimation of nearshore wave heights therefore it is necessary to discuss the computational efficiency the computations in this study are performed on an intel xeon e5 2603 1 60ghz 16 gb workstation 6 cores the computational time of wave estimation from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 is discussed considering the computation for such a long period in numerical model is extremely time consuming the total computational time is estimated from single step computational time and total time steps the average computational time of a single step or one sample point in the numerical model is 1 75 min and the computation includes 3624 steps the comparison of computational times using wave model and prediction equations are shown in table 9 from table 9 it can be seen that using the proposed prediction equation can significantly reduce the computational time the prediction equations only require insignificant time on generating the sample points for rsm fitting procedure in the studying site the incident offshore waves are coming from 3 directions so 16 3 48 sample points need to be generated using plan s6 in table 6 moreover the developing of the prediction equations is a once and for all process once they have been developed these equations can be used repeatedly note that the prediction equations developed in this study only focuses on wave height which is a predominant wave parameter in engineering it is important to understand that the prediction equation is not an alternative to the numerical wave model which can provide comprehensive spatial wave information however using numerical wave model to estimate the long term data can be extremely time consuming besides nearshore wave forecast is always required during engineering construction and it may be too sophisticated and inefficient for engineers to apply a numerical model for the forecast in case of these situations the prediction equations are efficient and practical to use as a substitute for the numerical wave model 6 summary and conclusions wave height data in nearshore areas are not always available or sufficient for ocean and coastal engineering application due to the paucity of measurement or limited length of records and sometimes may need to estimate from offshore wave data by considering the complicated wave propagation process within the scope of this study response surface method was introduced to explore the offshore nearshore relationship and a set of prediction equations were developed based on the response surface method in order to gain a rapid and practical estimation of the nearshore wave heights for a specific region at first a well calibrated mike21 sw numerical wave model in the studying area was setup to obtain the sample points for response surface fitting based on wave energy flux conservation a concise equation with undetermined coefficients was derived as a fit model for the nearshore wave height response surface furthermore the effect of water level changing due to tides was linearized and introduced into the fit model fitting tests indicate that the proposed fit model performs very well and sensitivity analysis shows that the fit model can efficiently give an accurate fitting equation by using only 16 sample points finally the prediction equations at m1 and m2 were developed and significant wave heights from 30th october 2015 to 28th march 2016 were predicted and validated against measurements the results show that the proposed prediction equations based on rsm give satisfactory predictions of significant wave heights at m1 and m2 with r values more than 0 85 and rmse values less than 0 19m the proposed equations are efficient and can reduce significant computational time compared with numerical wave model note that since wave breaking is not considered in the fit model the prediction may not be applicable in breaking zone also this method was only testified at two locations in the nearshore area of china east sea as a demonstration in this study in the future this method should be also validated in various coastal environments and improved by considering more wave situations realistic validation for longer time period should be also employed as well acknowledgements this work was financially

23548,this article presents the results of a preliminary investigation on the use of the motions of a large volume semi submersible platform as the basis for estimating waves on site the main focus of the application is on the harsher wave conditions for which other measurement devices are known to present limitations as a first step in this investigation a series of tests were performed with a scaled model in a wave basin a wide range of waves was tested in order to evaluate how the estimation errors behave with respect to wave period and amplitude moreover since the statistical inference relies on a linear dynamic model the influence of uncertainties on the unit s raos must be assessed since the non linear viscous effect on resonant responses is known to be one of the main sources of error in this regard different approaches for predefining the viscous damping levels are tested and compared the results attest that at least in the controlled conditions of the tests the inference method is able to provide accurate estimations of the extreme waves conditions that were tested a simple method for predicting the damping based on the recorded motions is shown to improve the estimations keywords semi submersible platform damping estimation bayesian modelling directional wave spectra severe sea states 1 introduction directional wave inference obtained from the records of vessels motions is a technique that has seen its application grow significantly over the last years usually the main interest in this approach comes from the fact that this sort of estimation only requires simple instrumentation and hardware which can be easily installed on board and require little maintenance most of the previous works on the method based their estimations on ships or ship shaped platforms due to the fact that these vessels are known to have significant response even for mild wave conditions the major shortcoming of the method is that only waves that impose a reasonable level of motions to the vessel may be inferred this is due to the fact that the vessel usually acts as a low pass filter filtering the high frequency components that do not excite the vessels first order responses therefore the larger the vessel or the lower its response in waves the more restricted will be the estimation range the main motivation for this paper however arises from the fact that although a semi submersible is designed for responding only weakly to the incoming waves it will still present significant motions in more severe wave conditions and in these situations it may perhaps provide a reliable account on the sea state that imposed such motions for this reason this method of wave inference is not intended for providing broad oceanographic records but rather to be used as a means for identifying wave conditions that impose considerable motions on the vessel in which the system is based on another practical reason that motivates the adoption of a large semi submersible platform as a motion based wave sensor is that the measuring systems that are widely considered as a global standard for wave data such as wave buoys gemmrich et al 2016 and wave radar systems fucile et al 2016 may present some drawbacks in extreme weather conditions for instance wave buoys may be dragged through or swerve around the 3d peaks of waves allender et al 1989 in addition eventual presence of a spike in the raw accelerometer data mackay 2009 may produce erratic maximum wave height measurements rough sea states and adverse weather conditions are also among the possible sources of errors in wave measurements from wave radar systems since errors can be attributed to the shadowing effects produced by rain large waves or sea spray as well as the inherent bias of the system that could be increased by extreme sea conditions magnusson 2008 furthermore all of them require important initial investments and or high maintenance costs consequences of these shortcomings are either way important for marine operations engineering design and validation of forecasts of extreme wave events in addition comparisons between estimations obtained with wave buoys and wave radars have shown some important discrepancies durrant et al 2009 chen et al 2013 wijaya 2009 highlighting the inherent biasses and differences in the performance of the sensors for the reasons exposed above if proven feasible for real conditions wave estimations obtained from the motions of a semi submersible platform may provide an interesting complement to the readings of other devices in harsh seas in fact they are not expected to be affected by some of the factors mentioned above on the other hand it may have to deal with other problems as for example the non linear behavior of the motions especially due to viscous damping effects induced by the flow on the hull risers and mooring lines these aspects will be discussed with detail in this article from a general point of view there are several approaches that may be considered for performing the wave inference based on the recorded motions of a vessel as a first option the wave spectrum can be estimated with a parametric modelling with some examples of this method provided by hua and palmquist 1994 where the wave conditions are estimated using the full scale data applying a variational method another work based in this research topic is presented by tannuri et al 2003 who used the data from a moored fpso with a non linear parametric model to estimate the directional wave spectrum montazeri and nielsen 2014 use the parametric approach to estimate the directional wave spectrum from full scale response measurements carried out on a container ship one additional example of the parametric modelling approach can be found in montazeri et al 2015 which presents a trend analysis for prediction of sea state parameters using a jonswap model finally montazeri et al 2016 is another recent work in which a parametric model of the directional wave spectrum is calibrated to estimate wind sea and swell based on motions of a ship alternatively another line of works proposes the estimation of the directional wave spectrum based on non parametric modelling methods the inference is then made using either the wave buoy analogy or the bayesian modelling procedure regarding the wave buoy analogy nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 obtain the estimations from full scale motions measurements the results are compared with real wave rider buoys and radar data they show that the statistical parameters are accurately estimated when compared with the wave rider buoy and the method provides a slightly better estimation when compared to the wave radar systems furthermore nielsen et al 2016 aim to evaluate a novel concept for wave estimation using the wave buoy analogy using shipboard measurements which in this case is formulated directly in the time domain combining different techniques and the least squares fitting to estimate wave amplitude and phase the so called bayesian modelling procedure has been adopted by nielsen 2006 who presented derivations of both parametric and non parametric theories the theories for both methods are applied in order to obtain the directional wave spectrum from real scale data radar and numerical simulations the same researcher nielsen 2007 carried out a detailed study of numerical simulations of time histories providing an estimation of the sea state parameters in this work two approaches are considered the parametric procedure and the non parametric one the paper finally concludes that it is difficult to favor one particular method since both of them provide similar results simos et al 2010 present a complete analysis of the sea states estimated from the motions of a model scale fpso these estimations are performed using the bayesian inference method with two hyperparameters as proposed by nielsen 2008 but with a relevant conceptual change different from the original proposal they have set a pre calibration of these hyperparameters meaning that the values of both were prescribed for each wave estimation from a conceptual point of view although the mathematical structure of the bayesian model was preserved an important feature of the bayesian approach was abandoned namely the adoption of an information criterion for searching the best values of the hyperparameters in each estimation event this approach however led to a much more expedite estimation procedure meanwhile the results obtained in the experimental campaign attested that the wave conditions could still be inferred with good accuracy later simos et al 2012 used full scale data from an fpso operating in brazil s campos basin for a first evaluation of the performance of this method in field conditions however due to the lack of alternative wave sensors the comparison of the results was made almost exclusively with hindcast predictions provided by noaa for the same region where the fpso was operating the authors concluded that the method was capable of inferring the sea states with a good agreement with the noaa predictions despite the inherent limitations concerning the estimation of sea states with low peak periods bispo et al 2016 presents the first part of the results from a new field campaign started in december 2014 again results are obtained from full scale fpso motions using the bayesian inference approach the performance of the motion based method is checked against the wave estimations provided by a commercial marine radar system comparisons between both systems attest an adequate identification of mean wave conditions the use of a semi submersible platform to estimate extreme wave conditions was initially investigated by wijaya 2009 as for the present paper their work was also based in large part on model scale tests however the analysis was based on a set of final design tests performed for the platform which only comprised a short range of wave conditions in the present study a scaled model of the same semi submersible unit was built and tested in a large set of experimental conditions at the ch tpn wave basin of the university of são paulo the experiments were specifically conceived for verifying the feasibility of performing the motion based estimations putting special emphasis on more severe wave conditions next a brief description of the statistical inference approach is presented section 2 followed by the presentation of the semi submersible unit adopted as a case study section 3 section 4 discusses the numerical modelling leading to the linear motion raos it also addresses the importance of a proper damping estimation for predicting the heave resonant motions and the difficulties imposed by the non linear character of the viscous effects the experimental setup and the main features of the test campaign are presented in section 5 section 6 brings the main results confronting the directional wave spectra estimated by the model motions to those obtained from a set of conventional wave probes finally section 7 draws the main conclusions and discusses further steps that should be taken in the continuity of the research 2 bayesian inference method the non parametric approach adopted in this study follows the bayesian modelling procedure as proposed by akaike 1980 which essentially aims at introducing different kinds of a priori information to improve the ill conditioned problem as well as to reduce the influence of noise this central idea was used for the first time by iseki and ohtsu 2000 to estimate the wave spectrum from measured motions of a ship with forward speed in their approach the prior information essentially concerns the fact that the spreading of wave energy in direction should happen smoothly the trade off between the good fit to the data and the smoothness of the solution is then controlled through a single hyperparameter following these works nielsen 2008 proposed the introduction of an additional hyperparameter which in its turn controls the smoothness of the energy distribution regarding the wave frequency common to all these previous applications of motion based wave inference is the fact that the determination of the optimal value of the hyperparameters have been done by minimizing akaike s bayesian information criterion abic see e g akaike 1980 despite the expensive computational cost that is required by this procedure simos et al 2012 and bispo et al 2016 used an approach similar to the one proposed by nielsen 2008 in their case however applications were made for moored floating systems therefore without advance speed and a third hyperparameter was included which avoids excessive energy estimation at frequency boundaries apart from these differences the main modification proposed concerned the estimation of the hyperparamters which in the case of simos et al 2012 and bispo et al 2016 are defined prior to the estimations following the procedure proposed by bispo et al 2012 the method adopted in the present article follows closely the one proposed in simos et al 2012 for moored floating units for this reason only a short introduction to the method will be presented next for the reader who is interested in a more detailed description of the statistical inference approach it is important to mention that a concise derivation of the formulae concerning the bayesian method can also be found in nielsen 2008 assuming that the relation between the waves and the ship response is linear the directional wave spectrum s ω θ and the raos response amplitude operators are related to the cross spectra derived from the ship motions records ϕ i j through the integral 1 ϕ i j ω π π rao i ω θ rao j ω θ s ω θ d θ where rao i ω θ corresponds to the response amplitude operator of the motion i at frequency ω and direction of incidence θ the relation presented by equation 1 can be rewritten in discrete form assuming the integrand to be constant in each slice δ θ 2 π k leading to 2 ϕ i j ω δ θ k 1 k rao i ω θ k rao j ω θ k s ω θ k where θ k π k 1 δ θ if a certain range of m wave frequencies is specified previously being δ ω ω m ω 1 m 1 equation 2 can be expressed in a matrix form as follows 3 b a x u here the vector b contains a total of n 2 m elements which are related to the spectrum and the cross spectrum and can be expressed as 4 b b 1 b 2 b m with b m ϕ i i ω m re ϕ i j ω m im ϕ i j ω m the rao matrix is represented by the matrix a which has n 2 m k m elements 5 a a 1 0 0 0 0 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a m 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a m where the 0 represents the n 2 k matrix with null elements the other matrices represented in a are given by 6 a m rao i ω m θ 1 2 rao i ω m θ k 2 rao i ω m θ k 2 re rao i ω m θ 1 rao j ω m θ 1 re rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k re rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k im rao i ω m θ 1 rao j ω m θ 1 im rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k im rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k the vector x of equation 3 represents the unknown wave spectrum evaluated at the k m pairs of frequencies and directions 7 x s ω 1 θ 1 s ω 1 θ 2 s ω m θ k 1 s ω m θ k finally u is a vector with n 2 m elements representing the measurement noise which is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean value and variance σ 2 as suggested by akaike 1980 the bayes procedure can be applied in the singular system presented by equation 3 with such procedure the estimation of the vector x is obtained maximizing the product of the likelihood function l x b by the prior distribution where the likelihood function represents the probability of occurrence of the spectrum given a specific measurement b as pointed out above the measurement noise is assumed gaussian with zero mean and variance σ 2 therefore see akaike 1980 the likelihood function is given by 8 l x b 1 2 π σ 2 n 2 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 b a x 2 the prior distribution p x brings information about the unknown coefficients in this case the information known a priori relates to the assumption that the wave spectrum is smooth both in direction and frequency for implementing this the method makes use of the second order differences ε 1 m k and ε 2 m k which are associated to the direction k and frequency m and can be simply defined as 9 ε 1 m k s ω m θ k 1 2 s ω m θ k s ω m θ k 1 ε 2 m k s ω m 1 θ k 2 s ω m θ k s ω m 1 θ k the smoothness condition is equivalent to keeping the following relations as small as possible 10 k 1 k m 1 m ε 1 m k x t h 1 x k 1 k m 1 m ε 2 m k x t h 2 x where s ω m θ 0 s ω m θ k the matrices h 1 and h 2 can be easily computed considering the definition of the vector x for more information see nielsen 2008 finally one must take care of another practical problem in frequencies for which part or all the motions of the vessel are null any estimation is possible and therefore invalid thus in order to avoid an over prediction of the spectrum energy or inconsistent results due to the null or very small response of the platform the total energy of the spectrum is minimized in a pre defined range of low and high frequencies a third hyperparameter simos et al 2012 is then introduced in order to control the influence of this request in the final solution 11 k 1 k m 1 l s ω m θ k 2 k 1 k m h m s ω m θ k 2 x t h 3 x considering that each one is a gaussian variable with zero mean and variances σ 1 u 1 2 σ 2 u 2 2 and σ 3 u 3 2 for the distributions presented in equations 10 and 11 the product of the likelihood function see equation 8 by the prior distribution p x is given by 12 l x b p x c exp 1 2 σ 2 b a x 2 x t u 1 2 h 1 u 2 2 h 2 u 3 2 h 3 x where c represents a factor that is independent of the unknown in the model x the hyperparameters u 1 and u 2 control the compromise between a good fit to the data and the smoothness of the estimated spectrum in direction and frequency respectively these hyperparameters should be properly calibrated some works that have been presented in the literature deal with the estimation of the optimal hyperparameters for a specific type of ship vlcc see e g bispo et al 2012 in this case an extensive sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to obtain the optimal values of the hyperparameters which are equal to u 1 remains equal as the one presented by bispo et al 2012 for u 2 the optimal value is given by 1 10 5 and u 3 is equal to 0 0035 the almost negligible value of u 2 arises from the narrow differences between the beam and length of the platform which produce similar raos for roll and pitch motions this resemblance maintains the information level provided by these motions always equilibrated avoiding inconsistent results and therefore larger values of u 2 are no longer needed finally it should be noticed that the total size of the maximization problem is defined by the number of directions k and frequencies m considered being the number of variables equal to k m from equation 12 this problem can be interpreted as the minimization of the following functional 13 j x b a x 2 x t u 1 2 h 1 u 2 2 h 2 u 3 2 h 3 x which is feasible by means of a conventional quadratic programming algorithm 3 case study the model employed during the experimental campaign at the ch tpn was a precise scale 1 120 model of the åsgard b large semi submersible processing platform see fig 1 the main dimensions of the platform are given in table 1 also a 3d sketch and a photo of the model are presented in fig 2 the structure of the semi submersible platform model is mainly composed by a rectangular ring pontoon connected to the deck by six box shaped columns 4 corner columns and 2 center columns wave inference will be made based on the three most significant motions namely heave roll and pitch for this reason an analysis of the dynamic characteristics of these motions is important the hydrodynamic properties of the semi submersible unit are documented in wijaya 2009 with a heave natural period equal to 24 s the natural periods for the roll and pitch motions are both above the wave frequency range being defined as 74 s and 88 s respectively since it is known that the estimation of a linearized viscous damping is an important source of errors concerning the prediction of the resonant responses one may realize that this platform indeed has good response characteristics for being used as a wave sensor in fact the very large natural periods in roll and pitch are well above the periods of the sea waves thus increasing the reliability of the raos of angular motions within the wave frequency range nonetheless damping corrections in heave motion are still necessary for this motion presents its resonance inside the range of interest of the current study focused on large period waves these corrections were evaluated considering two different approaches a constant external damping equivalent to 5 of the critical damping determined experimentally and a linear damping estimated as a function of the heave amplitude further details about the damping corrections will be presented in sections 4 and 5 together with results obtained from decay tests 3 1 scaled model the manufacturing process for the model construction took into account the geometrical complexity of the hull and the need to keep the model mass low in order to guarantee a proper margin for ballast calibration considering these restraints the 3d printing with nylon sintered material was selected as the best method of construction except for the deck which was made of medium density fiberboard top sides were not modeled as the tests did not include wind effects the main features of the real scale semi submersible platform and the model are given in table 1 the mass properties of the model no ballast were confirmed experimentally through two bifilar pendulum test roll and pitch inclination tests in the water were made in order to verify the metacentric heights the model was moored to the tank by means of a soft spring horizontal system above the waterline the objective of the mooring was only to keep the model offsets within the range of optical motion tracking system the stiffness of the system was kept as low as possible in order to have little effect on the first order motions the overall stiffness in both horizontal directions was confirmed by means of pull out tests 4 numerical modelling motion raos and external damping the motion based wave estimation is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the raos which characterize the dynamic behavior of the semi submersible platform in the present study the hydrodynamical properties have been obtained with two different approaches frequency and time domain analyses the former was performed to obtain the set of motion raos that were used in the wave inference process on the other hand time domain simulations were also made in order to support the analysis of the non linear drag effects especially those associated with large amplitudes of heave motions near resonance this section provides a general description of the procedures followed during the numerical modelling including the analysis of the main results 4 1 frequency domain first order raos raos were computed in frequency domain using the software wamit the numerical model was made using the higher order method which allows the approximation of the geometry by b splines functions in our case the hull geometry was represented by 52 different patches in this approach the velocity potential and the fluid velocity on the body are described in a continuous manner inside each patch fig 3 shows the geometry considered in this numerical model fig 4 shows the raos computed in frequency domain for the heave roll and pitch motions results are presented for five different wave directions from 180 deg bow seas to 90 deg waves one should remind that the hull is symmetric in both x and y directions for the sake of illustration raos were computed with external damping equal to 0 and 5 dashed black line which is a typical value for the external damping and therefore provides a useful reference please notice that the raos with 5 of external damping are only provided for the most unfavorable direction regarding each motion i e 180 deg for heave and pitch and 90 deg for roll motion the raos reflect the dynamic characteristics of the platform that were emphasized before the heave motion is the only one with resonance inside the wave frequency range therefore the external damping effect is only significant for the heave rao roll and pitch have natural periods around 74 and 88 s respectively and therefore their motions within the frequency range are not supposed to be strongly affected by viscous effects 4 2 time domain analysis viscous effects as explained before the aim of the time domain analysis is to evaluate the viscous drag forces acting on the pontoons of the platform and its impact on the motions especially when large amplitudes are involved the impact of the viscous forces on motion raos is widely documented in the literature see for example clauss et al 1992 in the present case as mentioned above the major influence of the drag forces should be found in the heave motion a proper evaluation of these effects is necessary especially because heave is the most determinant motion for the estimation of wave amplitudes the software used during this stage was the ansys aqwa hydrodynamic time response package in order to perform the analysis in aqwa 11 830 panels were used in the model in addition some parts of the pontoons were modeled as morison elements in order to introduce the quadratic drag effects fig 5 provides an illustration of the heave rao only the heading equal to 180 is evaluated here because the heave responses for the other angles of incidence show only narrow differences if compared to this direction see fig 4 the wamit frequency domain analysis with 0 and 5 of fixed external damping provides a basis of comparison for the time domain study it can be seen that both codes provide similar results for the computations in frequency domain with 5 fixed external damping the figure also presents the results obtained for different regular wave amplitudes using the aqwa time domain package indicated by aqwa td a first set of results was obtained for a wave steepness of 2 without considering the morison elements on the pontoons blue circles it can be seen that the rao results obtained this way agree quite well with the results obtained from frequency domain a second set of results was generated including the morison elements of the pontoon for wave steepnesses of 0 64 and 2 magenta rhombus and orange squares respectively these results on the one hand make the effects of the non linear drag on the resonant amplification clear for periods above 24s on the other hand they also show that the cancelation point period of zero heave motion slightly above 22s expected from the potential flow analysis ceases to exist when the drag forces are considered the same figure presents a set of experimental results obtained in regular wave tests green triangles all the experimental tests for different wave periods were conducted considering a fixed wave steepness of 2 one may notice that the experimental results confirm the main trends obtained from the time domain simulations as expected these experimental results attest that a proper consideration of the non linear viscous effects is necessary for a good prediction of the resonant motions in general therefore the experimental results agree well with those obtained from the time domain analysis they attest that the viscous effects may indeed induce significant differences in the vertical motions of the platform for high wave periods these differences include not only an attenuation of the resonant amplification that can be emulated by means of external linearized damping but also the suppression of the cancellation point of the rao the latter effect results from the differences in the hydrodynamic exciting force and cannot be reproduced by merely adding an external damping since it is known beforehand that the heave motion is very important for the prediction of wave amplitude the problem of obtaining a proper representation of the heave raos becomes an important issue especially considering the goal of estimating severe sea states with good accuracy this is not straightforward task considering the limitations imposed by the supposition of a linear dynamic model for this reason irregular wave tests with many of the extreme sea conditions including 100yr conditions were tested in the basin aiming at quantifying the influence of the errors in the heave rao model on the wave estimation moreover two different approaches for defining the heave damping were tested the first considering a mean value independent of the heave amplitude as presented in the frequency domain results above the second with a simplified model that captures the variation of the linearized damping values as a function of the motion amplitude that is measured this approach will be discussed in more details next 4 3 variable damping estimation the reasons why a more refined damping model is needed for the heave motion were already pointed out from the experimental data obtained during the decay tests it can be observed that the damping factor is strongly correlated with the motion amplitude thus a method to account for this matter and obtain an estimation of the linearized equivalent external damping is needed a correction for the damping factor in the heave motion can be obtained as follows using the morison quadratic drag force formula morison et al 1950 14 f d 1 2 ρ s c d z z the linearization of the drag force is obtained using the well known method of equivalent energy dissipation presented for instance in faltinsen 1993 by means of an equivalent drag factor d equiv the drag factor d is linearized as function of frequency ω and amplitude a obtaining that 15 d equiv 8 3 π ω a d then the drag is rewritten as follows 16 f d l d equiv z d equiv ω a finally the damping ratio can be expressed as 17 ξ ξ equiv ξ crit f d l 2 ω n m t ω a 2 3 π ρ c d a l pont h pot b pot m a 33 where h pont and b pont represents the height and the beam of the pontoon respectively l pont is the length of the pontoons in between columns c d represents the cross sectional drag coefficient of the pontoon a 33 is the heave added mass for the heave natural frequency and m the total mass of the platform whose sum is equal to m t finally a stands for the representative amplitude of motion therefore with an appropriate value of c d an estimation of the heave external damping can be made based on a certain representative amplitude in an irregular sea state waves with different frequencies have different mean amplitudes nonetheless for the purpose of estimating the damping the most interesting frequency is the resonant frequency of motion keeping this in mind an approximation for the representative amplitude of resonance heave motion a h can be proposed as 18 a h 2 s h ω n δ ω n where s h ω n is the power spectrum of the heave motion at the natural frequency and δ ω n is the frequency interval of the spectral analysis close to the natural frequency ω n or ω n ω n 1 ω n 1 ω n in section 5 the results of this analysis are confronted with the damping estimated from the experimental decay tests in heave showing that a very good fit is obtained it should be noted that since the heave amplitude a h can be obtained directly from the platform motion records the procedure above can be used for pre calibrating the damping level prior to each wave estimation event in this way the implementation is quite simple all that is needed is a database of raos computed for different damping levels defined within a specified range at the moment of the wave estimation the inference algorithm computes the heave motion amplitude and selects the most appropriate heave rao for that particular estimation 5 experimental setup and tests performed 5 1 general the model tests were carried out in the numerical offshore tank tpn facilities in the university of são paulo usp the wave basin is a squared 14 0 m 14 0 m 4 1 m tank able to generate and absorb waves from 0 5 hz to 2 0 hz by means of a set of 148 flap type wavemakers fig 6 shows a sketch of the wave basin and one of the horizontal mooring arrangements adopted during the experimental campaign the model was placed in the middle of the basin and its horizontal excursions were restricted by a soft mooring system the campaign comprised only one draft operational and five wave headings from bow waves to beam waves in this case 180 150 135 120 and 90 during the tests the motions of the model were recorded with a qualisys optical tracking system 5 2 free floating decay tests decay tests were performed in still water for motions in the 6 dof in order to determine the natural periods and the damping characteristics of the semi submersible platform model for each motion tests with four different initial amplitudes were carried out with 3 repetitions each for avoiding spurious excitation of motions other than the ones being tested a specific set up was used for the decay tests this set up essentially comprised a set of bars and pulleys with a high resistance wire used for moving the model and keeping it in the required initial position for each test after releasing the model all the motions were tracked by the qualisys optical system the method adopted for characterizing the non linear damping in each test is essentially the one described in faltinsen 1993 which considers a linear and a quadratic damping term the former is supposed constant while the later is expressed as a function of the motion amplitude for illustration purposes fig 7 presents the results obtained in tests for four different motions namely heave roll pitch and yaw in this case however instead of presenting linear and quadratic damping coefficients the results are combined and expressed in terms of the critical damping ratio for each amplitude 5 2 1 variable damping model a comparison with the results from decay tests given the geometry of the semi submersible platform with the pontoons placed at relatively large depth a comparison between damping estimations obtained from tests in waves and in calm water decay tests is illustrative for doing this the method proposed in the previous section for computing the heave damping from drag estimations was applied the results were generated considering all the 32 different irregular waves tested in the wave basin for each one of them a representative resonant amplitude was obtained according to equation 18 and the damping ratio computed with equation 17 the damping ratios obtained from the irregular wave tests as a function of the resonant heave amplitudes may then be compared to the estimations derived from the decay tests see fig 7 the agreement between the different methods is shown in fig 8 next one may note that the damping ratio estimated from the irregular wave tests black dots indeed presents narrow differences with the linear fitting red line of the data obtained in the heave decay tests performed in calm water blue triangles the small differences between the experimental results and the output of the variable damping model are attested by the comparison of the linear and quadratic damping coefficients the values of these coefficients have been obtained following the procedure proposed by faltinsen 1993 which assumes that the motion can be written as 19 x p 1 x p 2 x x p 3 x 0 by fitting the results obtained in the decay tests and those of the damping model according to this procedure the coefficients obtained are given in table 2 where the linear damping coefficient is named p 1 and the quadratic damping coefficient is given by p 2 despite the differences in the linear coefficient it is clear that the damping is dominated by the quadratic term especially for the larger amplitudes velocities of motion the agreement regarding p 2 is indeed remarkable once again attesting the conclusions derived from the graphical representation of the results the good agreement obtained with the variable damping model also attests that the heave damping is dominated by the platform motions and that the effects of the wave induced flow on the damping force are indeed small even for the largest wave amplitudes that were tested in this sense the good fit with the decay data indicates that the method proposed represents a proper means of estimating the resonant heave damping in waves 5 3 wave tests 5 3 1 transient and regular wave tests transient wave tests were used to verify the accuracy of the motion raos obtained with the numerical model for this reason the wave steepness was kept below 4 during all the tests the range of periods for the generation of the transient waves was set from 8 to 24 s in real scale with a constant wave amplitude equal to 1 68 m these tests had a full scale equivalent duration of 240 s thus comprising at least ten waves cycles for each condition in addition a set of 33 tests in regular waves was carried out for a better evaluation of the non linear effects on the raos again the wave period ranged from 8 to 24 s but different wave amplitudes were tested considering wave steepness of 2 4 and 6 fig 9 illustrates the level of agreement obtained between the motion raos derived from the wave tests both for transient and regular waves and those derived numerically results correspond to a wave heading of 135 deg and comprise only the three motions that were used for the purpose of wave inference heave roll and pitch it can be seen that the agreement for the angular motions is good for the whole range of frequencies as mentioned before this was indeed expected because neither roll or pitch resonate in the wave frequency range for the heave motion on the other hand the agreement is good for wave periods up to 20 s as anticipated in section 4 2 discrepancies rise for larger periods and are associated to viscous effects within the resonant range regarding the use of the heave motion for wave inference part of these discrepancies will be mitigated with the use of a proper damping model which should provide a better adjustment of the resonant amplification for wave periods around the natural one another source of error however namely the one related to the motions observed closer to the numerical cancellation point are more difficult to mitigate when using the linear frequency domain results 5 3 2 irregular wave tests the selection process of irregular waves sea states was based on the wave statistics for the åsgard field in the norwegian sea from mathiesen and nygaard 2013 a set of 32 sea conditions with corresponding peak periods t p and significant wave heights h s was selected see table 3 ranging from mild waves with high probability of occurrence to extreme 100yr return events following the recommendation proposed in torsethaugen et al 2004 for a proper representation of each sea condition the limiting spectral peak period defined by the relation t p f 6 6 h s 1 3 was estimated using the theoretical significant wave height value then if the expected peak period of the sea t p was located within a band given by t p f 2 seconds the jonswap standard model was adopted to generate the spectrum otherwise the spectrum was generated using the torsethaugen spectrum fig 10 provides a comparison between the torsethaugen spectrum and an equivalent jonswap spectrum for the same significant wave height and peak period one should note that the torsethaugen spectrum is a bimodal sea spectrum composed by a swell energy around the peak in the low frequency range and a wind sea energy components given in the high frequency range 5 3 3 wave calibration wave calibration tests were performed in the absence of the semi submersible model and the evaluation of the wave spectrum within the test zone was performed by means of an array of three wave probes the quality of the waves generated in the basin was checked considering the main statistical parameters each condition was repeated at least twice in this calibration procedure the maximum frequency of the spectrum was 2 hz corresponding to 5 5 s in full scale the procedure has guaranteed that errors in the values of t p and h s were lower than 5 for all tests 5 3 3 1 experimental measurements of the directional wave spectrum in order to provide a reference for evaluating the accuracy of the sea conditions estimated using the motion based wave inference algorithm an array of eight wave probes has been used to measure the directional wave spectrum in the ch tpn basin in the absence of the semi submersible model the procedure adopted to measure directional waves follows the one proposed by nwogu 1989 applying the maximum entropy method mem a good explanation of the procedure adopted for estimating the spectrum from the wave records can be found in tannuri et al 2007 the disposition of the wave probes is similar to the one proposed in stansberg et al 1998 with six wave probes placed in the vertices of a regular hexagon with a circumradius equal to 0 4 m plus two central ones fig 11 provides a view of the wave probes arrangement installed in the basin for illustrative purposes fig 12 presents the results obtained with mem method for the irregular waves generated in four different tests which were selected among the 32 tests in order to provide a representative sample of the whole range of periods that was tested in these polar plots the wave energy in each wave frequency radial coordinate in rad s with values given in real scale is depicted for all wave directions as a convention the wave direction in the tank was considered as 180 deg in addition the main statistical parameters for each wave condition are presented at the top of each figure it should be stressed that instead of the peak period the mean central period t 1 will be used for evaluating the results the reasons for that are explained in the next section all waves generated in the basin were long crested meaning that no directional energy spread was considered in the wave generation for this reason one may realize that the wave spectra measured with the mem method have energy concentrated in a very narrow range around the mean direction the directional resolution considered in the spectral analysis corresponded to δ θ 5 deg the same that was employed for the motion based wave inference whose results will be presented next 6 results wave inference based on the motions of the model in the following the main results obtained with the wave inference method based on the motions of the semi submersible model are presented and confronted to the measurements performed in the wave basin with conventional wave probes it is worth remembering that the motion basis adopted for the analysis comprised only three motions namely heave roll and pitch the mathematical algorithm was implemented in matlab 2014a twenty different wave frequencies were considered with a spatial resolution of δ θ 5 degrees corresponding to m 20 and k 72 see section 2 moreover three different sets of raos were employed as alternatives for modelling the heave motions one with a constant external damping coefficient corresponding to 5 of the critical damping a second one obtained with the variable damping method computed according to the procedure presented in section 4 and also the raos obtained with the time domain analysis considering the pontoon drag forces see fig 5 regarding the values of the hyperparameters an extensive error analysis was carried out to determine the most favorable values as a result the calibration of u 1 was made based on the period of the motions according to the procedure defined by bispo et al 2012 whereas for u 2 the best value was given by 1 10 5 and for u 3 it was equal to 0 0035 with this set of input parameters the mean computational time required for the estimation of one wave condition using a conventional desktop pc was around 30 s for all the results showed ahead the motion based wave estimations have been made considering the first 30 min of data acquisition 1 1 time span that assures that a minimum number of 200 wave cycles are used to estimate the wave conditions as suggested in ittc 2014 period of time that is typically assumed as the length of the stationary period e g soares and fricke 2011 in fig 13 and fig 14 the reliability of the estimations was evaluated by means of relative errors accordingly the vertical axes of these figures provide the relative errors for the following statistics significant wave height h s that leads to the following relative error 20 η h s h m h s h m where h m stands for the significant wave height obtained from the measurements in the basin with wave probes and h s is the value of the significant wave height estimated by means of the motion based method mean wave period t 1 which relative error is given by 21 η t 1 t m t 1 t m where t m is the mean wave period measured in the basin and t 1 is the value estimated with the motion based method it must be emphasized once more that the platform is expected to filter certain part of the energy placed in high frequency range for this reason t 1 has been adopted as a reference for the errors instead of t p obtaining a better indicator of the distribution of the energy in the different frequencies the relative errors in the wave statistics are presented as a function of the measured mean period t 1 of the waves in each test given in the lower horizontal axis the upper axis indicates the corresponding measured significant wave heights in meters in this way the reader can assess the agreement obtained with the motion based method for different wave periods and heights moreover it should be noticed that these figures present three sets of results that correspond to the estimations obtained using the different raos described above finally it must be realized that the results are clustered into two different sets with different colors indicating whether the waves generated in the basin corresponded to a jonswap blue or torsethaugen empty red power spectrum the figures referred above only include information for waves coming from 90 and 135 because other headings conditions tested during the experimental campaign did not provide any meaningful new information see fig 19 fig 15 next presents a polar plot for the directional wave spectra estimated in a few selected cases among the beam sea tests once again the results include conditions that are representative of cases with low and high peak periods for an easier comparison the maps correspond to the same sea states presented before in fig 12 in this figure the accuracy regarding the estimation of the mean wave direction θ can be assessed reminding that the expected wave direction in the tank is 180 in addition one may also evaluate the results in terms of the energy spreading both in frequency and direction fig 16 provides the same results for the tests with quartering sea conditions heading of 135 figs 17 and 18 show the 2d wave spectra estimated dashed blue line for sea conditions 6 12 15 and 30 see table 3 also aiming at providing a reference for the posterior analysis the sea spectra obtained from the wave probes records are also included in these figures black lines in addition to the graphical results table 4 provides the mean values of the errors obtained not only for beam and quartering wave conditions but also for the other wave headings adopted in the tests it presents the mean relative errors for significant wave height mean wave period peak period and also the absolute error of the estimated direction it should be realized that the results displayed for each heading combines all the tests within a certain range of peak wave period this was made in order to allow an easier evaluation of how the errors behave as the wave period changes finally the results are presented separately for jonswap and torsethaugen spectra the presentation of the results is concluded with fig 19 that was conceived in order to provide a practical way for the analysis involving the five different headings and all the 32 different sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign in this case once again only the results with the variable damping method are presented moreover one may infer not only the mean errors and how they change with the wave period but also the variations induced by the different wave headings based on these figures and on the results in table 4 a detailed discussion of the performance of the motion based method will be presented next 6 1 discussion many aspects of the results presented above deserve attention first by inspecting the error statistics obtained with the wave inference method table 4 it can be concluded that the overall agreement with the expected values is indeed very good for all the different headings considering the whole range of wave periods tested the maximum errors involved in the prediction of wave height and mean wave period are around 10 for jonswap seas and 15 for the conditions corresponding to the bimodal torsethaugen spectra regarding only the significant wave height the inference method usually underestimates the experimental values the errors being below 16 for the most unfavorable headings 90 and 180 and below 7 for the most favorable one 135 it must be stressed that the underestimation observed is indeed consistent with the expected bias of the method since part of the energy in the high frequency wave components is filtered as these waves do not impose motions of the hull it is also important to observe that the level of underestimation and the differences between the headings tend to decrease as the wave period increases favoring the results for the most severe sea states this trend can be readily attested by observing the variation of the errors in fig 13 and also by comparing the errors for different period ranges in table 4 the results obtained for the predicted mean wave periods t 1 are also consistent with the bias of the method since energy is filtered from the wave components with higher frequencies the mean frequency of the estimated spectrum tends to be lower than the real one and consequently the mean period tends to be higher nonetheless the results show that differences are not large the errors being always below 15 once again the errors decrease for larger wave periods as should be expected on the other hand table 4 also provides the relative error concerning the estimated peak period t p the results show that the peak period is always estimated accurately with an error below 4 another important characteristic of these estimations is that there is no significant variation between the outputs obtained with different headings and for different wave periods attesting that the prediction of t p is less sensitive to these factors figs 13 and 14 also allow an assessment of the influence of the different heave rao models on the motion based predictions it is interesting to realize that the main influence arising from the consideration of pontoon drag effects occurs in the estimation of the significant wave height neither the mean wave direction nor the mean wave period are substantially changed by the use of alternative raos moreover one may realize that the discrepancies in the wave height predicted by the different models increase for larger periods this was already expected and happens due to the fact that these waves induce resonant heave motions that are more pronounced for the larger periods results indicate that the variable damping model provided the smallest errors in the wave height if compared to the other models that were tested constant damping or the raos corrected by means of time domain simulations regarding the shape of the wave spectrum the relative errors for significant wave height and mean period are amplified by torsethaugen model for all the wave headings again this is not surprising since compared to the jonswap model see fig 10 the torsethaugen spectrum places a larger amount of energy in the high frequency range in which the dynamic response of the model is less pronounced figs 17 and 18 reflect this filtering effect in the high frequency range for both heading conditions furthermore both figures show an example of a 100yr condition test case 30 which attests that for the most extreme conditions only a small amount of energy is filtered from the sea spectrum due to the large peak periods typically observed in these situations regarding the energy distribution in the frequency range one may realize that it changes according to the wave heading resulting in the variations of the estimations of t 1 showed in table 4 nevertheless as mentioned before the peak period is always captured correctly by the method furthermore the whole set of results shows that the most unfavorable headings are those of bow 180 and beam 90 waves once again this was expected because these are the situations when only 2 of the 3 motions used for the estimations are excited by the waves for the 180 heading there are no significant roll motions for the 90 heading there are no significant pitch motions on the other hand the most favorable conditions are those closer to 135 or 45 degrees when all the 3 motions are excited and thus the amount of information available for the estimations is larger when the mean wave direction is concerned see figs 15 and 16 although the estimated spectra present a somewhat larger spreading of energy if compared to those obtained from the wave probes see fig 12 for a proper comparison the prediction of the mean direction was very accurate for all the conditions tested this is because only long crested sea conditions were tested during the experimental campaign in short crested seas one may expect that the filtering effects of the platform dynamics on the high frequency energy components may in some cases lead to poorer estimations of the mean wave direction on the other hand the larger spreading of wave energy observed when using the bayesian inference method is related to the calibration of the hyperparameter u 1 which controls the level of smoothness of the spectrum with respect to the wave direction in this case the pre calibration of the hyperparameter was made seeking to improve the accuracy in the prediction of the main statistical wave parameters t 1 and h s a procedure that ultimately led to a somewhat larger wave spreading this trade off between accurate energy predictions and smoothness of the spectrum is a particular feature of the present version of the bayesian inference method at the present moment an investigation on alternative prior distributions is being made as an attempt of improving this trade off however in face of the good results obtained so far this is considered to be a secondary aspect finally to conclude the discussion of the main aspects some additional comments regarding the prediction of the most extreme conditions must be made in fact it is important to realize that the 100yr wave conditions could be captured by the motion based method with errors lower than 5 in both wave height and period for the jonswap model these conditions involved waves with h s over 16 m and peak periods close to 20 s obviously one must remind that these good results were obtained in model scale in very controlled conditions when considering the estimations made aboard a real unit other factors like the presence of risers and mooring lines and the effects of wind and current on the motions for example will certainly impose a more demanding scenario for the predictions nonetheless the favorable results obtained in the tests are certainly promising enough to motivate the continuity of the research during which these other factors must be properly addressed 7 conclusions an experimental study about the usefulness of employing a semi submersible platform for motion based estimations of local sea spectrum was presented and the results were evaluated by means of an extensive set of model scale tests performed in a wave basin for this purpose a 1 120 scale model of a semi submersible unit has been tested in five different headings comprising waves that ranged from typical to severe wave conditions representative of the åsgard field in norway waves were generated considering both unimodal jonswap and bimodal torsethaugen spectral models the directional wave spectra estimated from the model motions were directly confronted to the experimental measurements obtained by means of conventional wave probes a bayesian inference model with three hyperparameters as proposed by simos et al 2012 was adopted for the estimations this method includes the addition of a third hyperparameter which indeed improved the results compared to those obtained with only two hyperparameters the predictions considered a basis composed of three motions heave roll pitch which proved to be appropriate for all the sea conditions tested results have shown that all the wave conditions tested could be accurately inferred from the bayesian method keeping the errors below reasonable limits the errors were larger in the most unfavorable conditions which correspond to the ones with small motions small periods or mild seas and in the cases when the sea only excited two of the three motions bow and beam waves the errors are reduced in the cases were the platform presents larger motions or provide more information which were given when the heading was close to 135 and for the more severe wave conditions when the wave induce more pronounced motions all the results confirmed the expected biases of overestimating the wave period while underestimating the wave height deviations that are progressively smaller as the wave period increases the analysis of the results with raos obtained from different approaches also highlighted the importance of a proper modelling of transfer functions of motion in the experimental setup a soft mooring system was used and the major source of drag was the platform itself in this condition the results obtained when using the variable external damping method a damping ratio proportional to the recorded heave amplitude in each test proved to be a good option for dealing with effects of the non linear viscous damping so far as a general conclusion one may state that the results obtained with the small scale tests indicate that semi submersible platform indeed may be considered as a good choice for the motion based wave inference in addition the results for more severe sea states are promising even when the raos are modeled in a conventional linear analysis in frequency domain naturally a substantial amount of future work threads arise from the topics discussed in this paper on the one hand an experimental analysis of the effects the moorings and risers may have on the motions of the unit is envisaged and the same is true regarding the action of wind and current the impact that these effects may have on the wave frequency motions and as a consequence on the motion based inference must be properly quantified a field campaign supported by alternative wave sensors such as buoys or wave radars is also desirable for a proper validation of the method finally further attention should also be paid to the mathematical approach of the problem which in principle could be modified in order to include the uncertainty in the prediction of the raos a first step in this attempt was made by iseki 2012 who addressed this challenge with an error matrix c composed of products of the response functions and the estimation errors achieving a modified likelihood function by the summation of the rao matrix a and this error matrix i e b a c x u however different approaches may be proposed based on alternative prior distributions investigations on this topic are currently being made acknowledgments authors

23548,this article presents the results of a preliminary investigation on the use of the motions of a large volume semi submersible platform as the basis for estimating waves on site the main focus of the application is on the harsher wave conditions for which other measurement devices are known to present limitations as a first step in this investigation a series of tests were performed with a scaled model in a wave basin a wide range of waves was tested in order to evaluate how the estimation errors behave with respect to wave period and amplitude moreover since the statistical inference relies on a linear dynamic model the influence of uncertainties on the unit s raos must be assessed since the non linear viscous effect on resonant responses is known to be one of the main sources of error in this regard different approaches for predefining the viscous damping levels are tested and compared the results attest that at least in the controlled conditions of the tests the inference method is able to provide accurate estimations of the extreme waves conditions that were tested a simple method for predicting the damping based on the recorded motions is shown to improve the estimations keywords semi submersible platform damping estimation bayesian modelling directional wave spectra severe sea states 1 introduction directional wave inference obtained from the records of vessels motions is a technique that has seen its application grow significantly over the last years usually the main interest in this approach comes from the fact that this sort of estimation only requires simple instrumentation and hardware which can be easily installed on board and require little maintenance most of the previous works on the method based their estimations on ships or ship shaped platforms due to the fact that these vessels are known to have significant response even for mild wave conditions the major shortcoming of the method is that only waves that impose a reasonable level of motions to the vessel may be inferred this is due to the fact that the vessel usually acts as a low pass filter filtering the high frequency components that do not excite the vessels first order responses therefore the larger the vessel or the lower its response in waves the more restricted will be the estimation range the main motivation for this paper however arises from the fact that although a semi submersible is designed for responding only weakly to the incoming waves it will still present significant motions in more severe wave conditions and in these situations it may perhaps provide a reliable account on the sea state that imposed such motions for this reason this method of wave inference is not intended for providing broad oceanographic records but rather to be used as a means for identifying wave conditions that impose considerable motions on the vessel in which the system is based on another practical reason that motivates the adoption of a large semi submersible platform as a motion based wave sensor is that the measuring systems that are widely considered as a global standard for wave data such as wave buoys gemmrich et al 2016 and wave radar systems fucile et al 2016 may present some drawbacks in extreme weather conditions for instance wave buoys may be dragged through or swerve around the 3d peaks of waves allender et al 1989 in addition eventual presence of a spike in the raw accelerometer data mackay 2009 may produce erratic maximum wave height measurements rough sea states and adverse weather conditions are also among the possible sources of errors in wave measurements from wave radar systems since errors can be attributed to the shadowing effects produced by rain large waves or sea spray as well as the inherent bias of the system that could be increased by extreme sea conditions magnusson 2008 furthermore all of them require important initial investments and or high maintenance costs consequences of these shortcomings are either way important for marine operations engineering design and validation of forecasts of extreme wave events in addition comparisons between estimations obtained with wave buoys and wave radars have shown some important discrepancies durrant et al 2009 chen et al 2013 wijaya 2009 highlighting the inherent biasses and differences in the performance of the sensors for the reasons exposed above if proven feasible for real conditions wave estimations obtained from the motions of a semi submersible platform may provide an interesting complement to the readings of other devices in harsh seas in fact they are not expected to be affected by some of the factors mentioned above on the other hand it may have to deal with other problems as for example the non linear behavior of the motions especially due to viscous damping effects induced by the flow on the hull risers and mooring lines these aspects will be discussed with detail in this article from a general point of view there are several approaches that may be considered for performing the wave inference based on the recorded motions of a vessel as a first option the wave spectrum can be estimated with a parametric modelling with some examples of this method provided by hua and palmquist 1994 where the wave conditions are estimated using the full scale data applying a variational method another work based in this research topic is presented by tannuri et al 2003 who used the data from a moored fpso with a non linear parametric model to estimate the directional wave spectrum montazeri and nielsen 2014 use the parametric approach to estimate the directional wave spectrum from full scale response measurements carried out on a container ship one additional example of the parametric modelling approach can be found in montazeri et al 2015 which presents a trend analysis for prediction of sea state parameters using a jonswap model finally montazeri et al 2016 is another recent work in which a parametric model of the directional wave spectrum is calibrated to estimate wind sea and swell based on motions of a ship alternatively another line of works proposes the estimation of the directional wave spectrum based on non parametric modelling methods the inference is then made using either the wave buoy analogy or the bayesian modelling procedure regarding the wave buoy analogy nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 obtain the estimations from full scale motions measurements the results are compared with real wave rider buoys and radar data they show that the statistical parameters are accurately estimated when compared with the wave rider buoy and the method provides a slightly better estimation when compared to the wave radar systems furthermore nielsen et al 2016 aim to evaluate a novel concept for wave estimation using the wave buoy analogy using shipboard measurements which in this case is formulated directly in the time domain combining different techniques and the least squares fitting to estimate wave amplitude and phase the so called bayesian modelling procedure has been adopted by nielsen 2006 who presented derivations of both parametric and non parametric theories the theories for both methods are applied in order to obtain the directional wave spectrum from real scale data radar and numerical simulations the same researcher nielsen 2007 carried out a detailed study of numerical simulations of time histories providing an estimation of the sea state parameters in this work two approaches are considered the parametric procedure and the non parametric one the paper finally concludes that it is difficult to favor one particular method since both of them provide similar results simos et al 2010 present a complete analysis of the sea states estimated from the motions of a model scale fpso these estimations are performed using the bayesian inference method with two hyperparameters as proposed by nielsen 2008 but with a relevant conceptual change different from the original proposal they have set a pre calibration of these hyperparameters meaning that the values of both were prescribed for each wave estimation from a conceptual point of view although the mathematical structure of the bayesian model was preserved an important feature of the bayesian approach was abandoned namely the adoption of an information criterion for searching the best values of the hyperparameters in each estimation event this approach however led to a much more expedite estimation procedure meanwhile the results obtained in the experimental campaign attested that the wave conditions could still be inferred with good accuracy later simos et al 2012 used full scale data from an fpso operating in brazil s campos basin for a first evaluation of the performance of this method in field conditions however due to the lack of alternative wave sensors the comparison of the results was made almost exclusively with hindcast predictions provided by noaa for the same region where the fpso was operating the authors concluded that the method was capable of inferring the sea states with a good agreement with the noaa predictions despite the inherent limitations concerning the estimation of sea states with low peak periods bispo et al 2016 presents the first part of the results from a new field campaign started in december 2014 again results are obtained from full scale fpso motions using the bayesian inference approach the performance of the motion based method is checked against the wave estimations provided by a commercial marine radar system comparisons between both systems attest an adequate identification of mean wave conditions the use of a semi submersible platform to estimate extreme wave conditions was initially investigated by wijaya 2009 as for the present paper their work was also based in large part on model scale tests however the analysis was based on a set of final design tests performed for the platform which only comprised a short range of wave conditions in the present study a scaled model of the same semi submersible unit was built and tested in a large set of experimental conditions at the ch tpn wave basin of the university of são paulo the experiments were specifically conceived for verifying the feasibility of performing the motion based estimations putting special emphasis on more severe wave conditions next a brief description of the statistical inference approach is presented section 2 followed by the presentation of the semi submersible unit adopted as a case study section 3 section 4 discusses the numerical modelling leading to the linear motion raos it also addresses the importance of a proper damping estimation for predicting the heave resonant motions and the difficulties imposed by the non linear character of the viscous effects the experimental setup and the main features of the test campaign are presented in section 5 section 6 brings the main results confronting the directional wave spectra estimated by the model motions to those obtained from a set of conventional wave probes finally section 7 draws the main conclusions and discusses further steps that should be taken in the continuity of the research 2 bayesian inference method the non parametric approach adopted in this study follows the bayesian modelling procedure as proposed by akaike 1980 which essentially aims at introducing different kinds of a priori information to improve the ill conditioned problem as well as to reduce the influence of noise this central idea was used for the first time by iseki and ohtsu 2000 to estimate the wave spectrum from measured motions of a ship with forward speed in their approach the prior information essentially concerns the fact that the spreading of wave energy in direction should happen smoothly the trade off between the good fit to the data and the smoothness of the solution is then controlled through a single hyperparameter following these works nielsen 2008 proposed the introduction of an additional hyperparameter which in its turn controls the smoothness of the energy distribution regarding the wave frequency common to all these previous applications of motion based wave inference is the fact that the determination of the optimal value of the hyperparameters have been done by minimizing akaike s bayesian information criterion abic see e g akaike 1980 despite the expensive computational cost that is required by this procedure simos et al 2012 and bispo et al 2016 used an approach similar to the one proposed by nielsen 2008 in their case however applications were made for moored floating systems therefore without advance speed and a third hyperparameter was included which avoids excessive energy estimation at frequency boundaries apart from these differences the main modification proposed concerned the estimation of the hyperparamters which in the case of simos et al 2012 and bispo et al 2016 are defined prior to the estimations following the procedure proposed by bispo et al 2012 the method adopted in the present article follows closely the one proposed in simos et al 2012 for moored floating units for this reason only a short introduction to the method will be presented next for the reader who is interested in a more detailed description of the statistical inference approach it is important to mention that a concise derivation of the formulae concerning the bayesian method can also be found in nielsen 2008 assuming that the relation between the waves and the ship response is linear the directional wave spectrum s ω θ and the raos response amplitude operators are related to the cross spectra derived from the ship motions records ϕ i j through the integral 1 ϕ i j ω π π rao i ω θ rao j ω θ s ω θ d θ where rao i ω θ corresponds to the response amplitude operator of the motion i at frequency ω and direction of incidence θ the relation presented by equation 1 can be rewritten in discrete form assuming the integrand to be constant in each slice δ θ 2 π k leading to 2 ϕ i j ω δ θ k 1 k rao i ω θ k rao j ω θ k s ω θ k where θ k π k 1 δ θ if a certain range of m wave frequencies is specified previously being δ ω ω m ω 1 m 1 equation 2 can be expressed in a matrix form as follows 3 b a x u here the vector b contains a total of n 2 m elements which are related to the spectrum and the cross spectrum and can be expressed as 4 b b 1 b 2 b m with b m ϕ i i ω m re ϕ i j ω m im ϕ i j ω m the rao matrix is represented by the matrix a which has n 2 m k m elements 5 a a 1 0 0 0 0 0 a 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a m 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a m where the 0 represents the n 2 k matrix with null elements the other matrices represented in a are given by 6 a m rao i ω m θ 1 2 rao i ω m θ k 2 rao i ω m θ k 2 re rao i ω m θ 1 rao j ω m θ 1 re rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k re rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k im rao i ω m θ 1 rao j ω m θ 1 im rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k im rao i ω m θ k rao j ω m θ k the vector x of equation 3 represents the unknown wave spectrum evaluated at the k m pairs of frequencies and directions 7 x s ω 1 θ 1 s ω 1 θ 2 s ω m θ k 1 s ω m θ k finally u is a vector with n 2 m elements representing the measurement noise which is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean value and variance σ 2 as suggested by akaike 1980 the bayes procedure can be applied in the singular system presented by equation 3 with such procedure the estimation of the vector x is obtained maximizing the product of the likelihood function l x b by the prior distribution where the likelihood function represents the probability of occurrence of the spectrum given a specific measurement b as pointed out above the measurement noise is assumed gaussian with zero mean and variance σ 2 therefore see akaike 1980 the likelihood function is given by 8 l x b 1 2 π σ 2 n 2 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 b a x 2 the prior distribution p x brings information about the unknown coefficients in this case the information known a priori relates to the assumption that the wave spectrum is smooth both in direction and frequency for implementing this the method makes use of the second order differences ε 1 m k and ε 2 m k which are associated to the direction k and frequency m and can be simply defined as 9 ε 1 m k s ω m θ k 1 2 s ω m θ k s ω m θ k 1 ε 2 m k s ω m 1 θ k 2 s ω m θ k s ω m 1 θ k the smoothness condition is equivalent to keeping the following relations as small as possible 10 k 1 k m 1 m ε 1 m k x t h 1 x k 1 k m 1 m ε 2 m k x t h 2 x where s ω m θ 0 s ω m θ k the matrices h 1 and h 2 can be easily computed considering the definition of the vector x for more information see nielsen 2008 finally one must take care of another practical problem in frequencies for which part or all the motions of the vessel are null any estimation is possible and therefore invalid thus in order to avoid an over prediction of the spectrum energy or inconsistent results due to the null or very small response of the platform the total energy of the spectrum is minimized in a pre defined range of low and high frequencies a third hyperparameter simos et al 2012 is then introduced in order to control the influence of this request in the final solution 11 k 1 k m 1 l s ω m θ k 2 k 1 k m h m s ω m θ k 2 x t h 3 x considering that each one is a gaussian variable with zero mean and variances σ 1 u 1 2 σ 2 u 2 2 and σ 3 u 3 2 for the distributions presented in equations 10 and 11 the product of the likelihood function see equation 8 by the prior distribution p x is given by 12 l x b p x c exp 1 2 σ 2 b a x 2 x t u 1 2 h 1 u 2 2 h 2 u 3 2 h 3 x where c represents a factor that is independent of the unknown in the model x the hyperparameters u 1 and u 2 control the compromise between a good fit to the data and the smoothness of the estimated spectrum in direction and frequency respectively these hyperparameters should be properly calibrated some works that have been presented in the literature deal with the estimation of the optimal hyperparameters for a specific type of ship vlcc see e g bispo et al 2012 in this case an extensive sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to obtain the optimal values of the hyperparameters which are equal to u 1 remains equal as the one presented by bispo et al 2012 for u 2 the optimal value is given by 1 10 5 and u 3 is equal to 0 0035 the almost negligible value of u 2 arises from the narrow differences between the beam and length of the platform which produce similar raos for roll and pitch motions this resemblance maintains the information level provided by these motions always equilibrated avoiding inconsistent results and therefore larger values of u 2 are no longer needed finally it should be noticed that the total size of the maximization problem is defined by the number of directions k and frequencies m considered being the number of variables equal to k m from equation 12 this problem can be interpreted as the minimization of the following functional 13 j x b a x 2 x t u 1 2 h 1 u 2 2 h 2 u 3 2 h 3 x which is feasible by means of a conventional quadratic programming algorithm 3 case study the model employed during the experimental campaign at the ch tpn was a precise scale 1 120 model of the åsgard b large semi submersible processing platform see fig 1 the main dimensions of the platform are given in table 1 also a 3d sketch and a photo of the model are presented in fig 2 the structure of the semi submersible platform model is mainly composed by a rectangular ring pontoon connected to the deck by six box shaped columns 4 corner columns and 2 center columns wave inference will be made based on the three most significant motions namely heave roll and pitch for this reason an analysis of the dynamic characteristics of these motions is important the hydrodynamic properties of the semi submersible unit are documented in wijaya 2009 with a heave natural period equal to 24 s the natural periods for the roll and pitch motions are both above the wave frequency range being defined as 74 s and 88 s respectively since it is known that the estimation of a linearized viscous damping is an important source of errors concerning the prediction of the resonant responses one may realize that this platform indeed has good response characteristics for being used as a wave sensor in fact the very large natural periods in roll and pitch are well above the periods of the sea waves thus increasing the reliability of the raos of angular motions within the wave frequency range nonetheless damping corrections in heave motion are still necessary for this motion presents its resonance inside the range of interest of the current study focused on large period waves these corrections were evaluated considering two different approaches a constant external damping equivalent to 5 of the critical damping determined experimentally and a linear damping estimated as a function of the heave amplitude further details about the damping corrections will be presented in sections 4 and 5 together with results obtained from decay tests 3 1 scaled model the manufacturing process for the model construction took into account the geometrical complexity of the hull and the need to keep the model mass low in order to guarantee a proper margin for ballast calibration considering these restraints the 3d printing with nylon sintered material was selected as the best method of construction except for the deck which was made of medium density fiberboard top sides were not modeled as the tests did not include wind effects the main features of the real scale semi submersible platform and the model are given in table 1 the mass properties of the model no ballast were confirmed experimentally through two bifilar pendulum test roll and pitch inclination tests in the water were made in order to verify the metacentric heights the model was moored to the tank by means of a soft spring horizontal system above the waterline the objective of the mooring was only to keep the model offsets within the range of optical motion tracking system the stiffness of the system was kept as low as possible in order to have little effect on the first order motions the overall stiffness in both horizontal directions was confirmed by means of pull out tests 4 numerical modelling motion raos and external damping the motion based wave estimation is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the raos which characterize the dynamic behavior of the semi submersible platform in the present study the hydrodynamical properties have been obtained with two different approaches frequency and time domain analyses the former was performed to obtain the set of motion raos that were used in the wave inference process on the other hand time domain simulations were also made in order to support the analysis of the non linear drag effects especially those associated with large amplitudes of heave motions near resonance this section provides a general description of the procedures followed during the numerical modelling including the analysis of the main results 4 1 frequency domain first order raos raos were computed in frequency domain using the software wamit the numerical model was made using the higher order method which allows the approximation of the geometry by b splines functions in our case the hull geometry was represented by 52 different patches in this approach the velocity potential and the fluid velocity on the body are described in a continuous manner inside each patch fig 3 shows the geometry considered in this numerical model fig 4 shows the raos computed in frequency domain for the heave roll and pitch motions results are presented for five different wave directions from 180 deg bow seas to 90 deg waves one should remind that the hull is symmetric in both x and y directions for the sake of illustration raos were computed with external damping equal to 0 and 5 dashed black line which is a typical value for the external damping and therefore provides a useful reference please notice that the raos with 5 of external damping are only provided for the most unfavorable direction regarding each motion i e 180 deg for heave and pitch and 90 deg for roll motion the raos reflect the dynamic characteristics of the platform that were emphasized before the heave motion is the only one with resonance inside the wave frequency range therefore the external damping effect is only significant for the heave rao roll and pitch have natural periods around 74 and 88 s respectively and therefore their motions within the frequency range are not supposed to be strongly affected by viscous effects 4 2 time domain analysis viscous effects as explained before the aim of the time domain analysis is to evaluate the viscous drag forces acting on the pontoons of the platform and its impact on the motions especially when large amplitudes are involved the impact of the viscous forces on motion raos is widely documented in the literature see for example clauss et al 1992 in the present case as mentioned above the major influence of the drag forces should be found in the heave motion a proper evaluation of these effects is necessary especially because heave is the most determinant motion for the estimation of wave amplitudes the software used during this stage was the ansys aqwa hydrodynamic time response package in order to perform the analysis in aqwa 11 830 panels were used in the model in addition some parts of the pontoons were modeled as morison elements in order to introduce the quadratic drag effects fig 5 provides an illustration of the heave rao only the heading equal to 180 is evaluated here because the heave responses for the other angles of incidence show only narrow differences if compared to this direction see fig 4 the wamit frequency domain analysis with 0 and 5 of fixed external damping provides a basis of comparison for the time domain study it can be seen that both codes provide similar results for the computations in frequency domain with 5 fixed external damping the figure also presents the results obtained for different regular wave amplitudes using the aqwa time domain package indicated by aqwa td a first set of results was obtained for a wave steepness of 2 without considering the morison elements on the pontoons blue circles it can be seen that the rao results obtained this way agree quite well with the results obtained from frequency domain a second set of results was generated including the morison elements of the pontoon for wave steepnesses of 0 64 and 2 magenta rhombus and orange squares respectively these results on the one hand make the effects of the non linear drag on the resonant amplification clear for periods above 24s on the other hand they also show that the cancelation point period of zero heave motion slightly above 22s expected from the potential flow analysis ceases to exist when the drag forces are considered the same figure presents a set of experimental results obtained in regular wave tests green triangles all the experimental tests for different wave periods were conducted considering a fixed wave steepness of 2 one may notice that the experimental results confirm the main trends obtained from the time domain simulations as expected these experimental results attest that a proper consideration of the non linear viscous effects is necessary for a good prediction of the resonant motions in general therefore the experimental results agree well with those obtained from the time domain analysis they attest that the viscous effects may indeed induce significant differences in the vertical motions of the platform for high wave periods these differences include not only an attenuation of the resonant amplification that can be emulated by means of external linearized damping but also the suppression of the cancellation point of the rao the latter effect results from the differences in the hydrodynamic exciting force and cannot be reproduced by merely adding an external damping since it is known beforehand that the heave motion is very important for the prediction of wave amplitude the problem of obtaining a proper representation of the heave raos becomes an important issue especially considering the goal of estimating severe sea states with good accuracy this is not straightforward task considering the limitations imposed by the supposition of a linear dynamic model for this reason irregular wave tests with many of the extreme sea conditions including 100yr conditions were tested in the basin aiming at quantifying the influence of the errors in the heave rao model on the wave estimation moreover two different approaches for defining the heave damping were tested the first considering a mean value independent of the heave amplitude as presented in the frequency domain results above the second with a simplified model that captures the variation of the linearized damping values as a function of the motion amplitude that is measured this approach will be discussed in more details next 4 3 variable damping estimation the reasons why a more refined damping model is needed for the heave motion were already pointed out from the experimental data obtained during the decay tests it can be observed that the damping factor is strongly correlated with the motion amplitude thus a method to account for this matter and obtain an estimation of the linearized equivalent external damping is needed a correction for the damping factor in the heave motion can be obtained as follows using the morison quadratic drag force formula morison et al 1950 14 f d 1 2 ρ s c d z z the linearization of the drag force is obtained using the well known method of equivalent energy dissipation presented for instance in faltinsen 1993 by means of an equivalent drag factor d equiv the drag factor d is linearized as function of frequency ω and amplitude a obtaining that 15 d equiv 8 3 π ω a d then the drag is rewritten as follows 16 f d l d equiv z d equiv ω a finally the damping ratio can be expressed as 17 ξ ξ equiv ξ crit f d l 2 ω n m t ω a 2 3 π ρ c d a l pont h pot b pot m a 33 where h pont and b pont represents the height and the beam of the pontoon respectively l pont is the length of the pontoons in between columns c d represents the cross sectional drag coefficient of the pontoon a 33 is the heave added mass for the heave natural frequency and m the total mass of the platform whose sum is equal to m t finally a stands for the representative amplitude of motion therefore with an appropriate value of c d an estimation of the heave external damping can be made based on a certain representative amplitude in an irregular sea state waves with different frequencies have different mean amplitudes nonetheless for the purpose of estimating the damping the most interesting frequency is the resonant frequency of motion keeping this in mind an approximation for the representative amplitude of resonance heave motion a h can be proposed as 18 a h 2 s h ω n δ ω n where s h ω n is the power spectrum of the heave motion at the natural frequency and δ ω n is the frequency interval of the spectral analysis close to the natural frequency ω n or ω n ω n 1 ω n 1 ω n in section 5 the results of this analysis are confronted with the damping estimated from the experimental decay tests in heave showing that a very good fit is obtained it should be noted that since the heave amplitude a h can be obtained directly from the platform motion records the procedure above can be used for pre calibrating the damping level prior to each wave estimation event in this way the implementation is quite simple all that is needed is a database of raos computed for different damping levels defined within a specified range at the moment of the wave estimation the inference algorithm computes the heave motion amplitude and selects the most appropriate heave rao for that particular estimation 5 experimental setup and tests performed 5 1 general the model tests were carried out in the numerical offshore tank tpn facilities in the university of são paulo usp the wave basin is a squared 14 0 m 14 0 m 4 1 m tank able to generate and absorb waves from 0 5 hz to 2 0 hz by means of a set of 148 flap type wavemakers fig 6 shows a sketch of the wave basin and one of the horizontal mooring arrangements adopted during the experimental campaign the model was placed in the middle of the basin and its horizontal excursions were restricted by a soft mooring system the campaign comprised only one draft operational and five wave headings from bow waves to beam waves in this case 180 150 135 120 and 90 during the tests the motions of the model were recorded with a qualisys optical tracking system 5 2 free floating decay tests decay tests were performed in still water for motions in the 6 dof in order to determine the natural periods and the damping characteristics of the semi submersible platform model for each motion tests with four different initial amplitudes were carried out with 3 repetitions each for avoiding spurious excitation of motions other than the ones being tested a specific set up was used for the decay tests this set up essentially comprised a set of bars and pulleys with a high resistance wire used for moving the model and keeping it in the required initial position for each test after releasing the model all the motions were tracked by the qualisys optical system the method adopted for characterizing the non linear damping in each test is essentially the one described in faltinsen 1993 which considers a linear and a quadratic damping term the former is supposed constant while the later is expressed as a function of the motion amplitude for illustration purposes fig 7 presents the results obtained in tests for four different motions namely heave roll pitch and yaw in this case however instead of presenting linear and quadratic damping coefficients the results are combined and expressed in terms of the critical damping ratio for each amplitude 5 2 1 variable damping model a comparison with the results from decay tests given the geometry of the semi submersible platform with the pontoons placed at relatively large depth a comparison between damping estimations obtained from tests in waves and in calm water decay tests is illustrative for doing this the method proposed in the previous section for computing the heave damping from drag estimations was applied the results were generated considering all the 32 different irregular waves tested in the wave basin for each one of them a representative resonant amplitude was obtained according to equation 18 and the damping ratio computed with equation 17 the damping ratios obtained from the irregular wave tests as a function of the resonant heave amplitudes may then be compared to the estimations derived from the decay tests see fig 7 the agreement between the different methods is shown in fig 8 next one may note that the damping ratio estimated from the irregular wave tests black dots indeed presents narrow differences with the linear fitting red line of the data obtained in the heave decay tests performed in calm water blue triangles the small differences between the experimental results and the output of the variable damping model are attested by the comparison of the linear and quadratic damping coefficients the values of these coefficients have been obtained following the procedure proposed by faltinsen 1993 which assumes that the motion can be written as 19 x p 1 x p 2 x x p 3 x 0 by fitting the results obtained in the decay tests and those of the damping model according to this procedure the coefficients obtained are given in table 2 where the linear damping coefficient is named p 1 and the quadratic damping coefficient is given by p 2 despite the differences in the linear coefficient it is clear that the damping is dominated by the quadratic term especially for the larger amplitudes velocities of motion the agreement regarding p 2 is indeed remarkable once again attesting the conclusions derived from the graphical representation of the results the good agreement obtained with the variable damping model also attests that the heave damping is dominated by the platform motions and that the effects of the wave induced flow on the damping force are indeed small even for the largest wave amplitudes that were tested in this sense the good fit with the decay data indicates that the method proposed represents a proper means of estimating the resonant heave damping in waves 5 3 wave tests 5 3 1 transient and regular wave tests transient wave tests were used to verify the accuracy of the motion raos obtained with the numerical model for this reason the wave steepness was kept below 4 during all the tests the range of periods for the generation of the transient waves was set from 8 to 24 s in real scale with a constant wave amplitude equal to 1 68 m these tests had a full scale equivalent duration of 240 s thus comprising at least ten waves cycles for each condition in addition a set of 33 tests in regular waves was carried out for a better evaluation of the non linear effects on the raos again the wave period ranged from 8 to 24 s but different wave amplitudes were tested considering wave steepness of 2 4 and 6 fig 9 illustrates the level of agreement obtained between the motion raos derived from the wave tests both for transient and regular waves and those derived numerically results correspond to a wave heading of 135 deg and comprise only the three motions that were used for the purpose of wave inference heave roll and pitch it can be seen that the agreement for the angular motions is good for the whole range of frequencies as mentioned before this was indeed expected because neither roll or pitch resonate in the wave frequency range for the heave motion on the other hand the agreement is good for wave periods up to 20 s as anticipated in section 4 2 discrepancies rise for larger periods and are associated to viscous effects within the resonant range regarding the use of the heave motion for wave inference part of these discrepancies will be mitigated with the use of a proper damping model which should provide a better adjustment of the resonant amplification for wave periods around the natural one another source of error however namely the one related to the motions observed closer to the numerical cancellation point are more difficult to mitigate when using the linear frequency domain results 5 3 2 irregular wave tests the selection process of irregular waves sea states was based on the wave statistics for the åsgard field in the norwegian sea from mathiesen and nygaard 2013 a set of 32 sea conditions with corresponding peak periods t p and significant wave heights h s was selected see table 3 ranging from mild waves with high probability of occurrence to extreme 100yr return events following the recommendation proposed in torsethaugen et al 2004 for a proper representation of each sea condition the limiting spectral peak period defined by the relation t p f 6 6 h s 1 3 was estimated using the theoretical significant wave height value then if the expected peak period of the sea t p was located within a band given by t p f 2 seconds the jonswap standard model was adopted to generate the spectrum otherwise the spectrum was generated using the torsethaugen spectrum fig 10 provides a comparison between the torsethaugen spectrum and an equivalent jonswap spectrum for the same significant wave height and peak period one should note that the torsethaugen spectrum is a bimodal sea spectrum composed by a swell energy around the peak in the low frequency range and a wind sea energy components given in the high frequency range 5 3 3 wave calibration wave calibration tests were performed in the absence of the semi submersible model and the evaluation of the wave spectrum within the test zone was performed by means of an array of three wave probes the quality of the waves generated in the basin was checked considering the main statistical parameters each condition was repeated at least twice in this calibration procedure the maximum frequency of the spectrum was 2 hz corresponding to 5 5 s in full scale the procedure has guaranteed that errors in the values of t p and h s were lower than 5 for all tests 5 3 3 1 experimental measurements of the directional wave spectrum in order to provide a reference for evaluating the accuracy of the sea conditions estimated using the motion based wave inference algorithm an array of eight wave probes has been used to measure the directional wave spectrum in the ch tpn basin in the absence of the semi submersible model the procedure adopted to measure directional waves follows the one proposed by nwogu 1989 applying the maximum entropy method mem a good explanation of the procedure adopted for estimating the spectrum from the wave records can be found in tannuri et al 2007 the disposition of the wave probes is similar to the one proposed in stansberg et al 1998 with six wave probes placed in the vertices of a regular hexagon with a circumradius equal to 0 4 m plus two central ones fig 11 provides a view of the wave probes arrangement installed in the basin for illustrative purposes fig 12 presents the results obtained with mem method for the irregular waves generated in four different tests which were selected among the 32 tests in order to provide a representative sample of the whole range of periods that was tested in these polar plots the wave energy in each wave frequency radial coordinate in rad s with values given in real scale is depicted for all wave directions as a convention the wave direction in the tank was considered as 180 deg in addition the main statistical parameters for each wave condition are presented at the top of each figure it should be stressed that instead of the peak period the mean central period t 1 will be used for evaluating the results the reasons for that are explained in the next section all waves generated in the basin were long crested meaning that no directional energy spread was considered in the wave generation for this reason one may realize that the wave spectra measured with the mem method have energy concentrated in a very narrow range around the mean direction the directional resolution considered in the spectral analysis corresponded to δ θ 5 deg the same that was employed for the motion based wave inference whose results will be presented next 6 results wave inference based on the motions of the model in the following the main results obtained with the wave inference method based on the motions of the semi submersible model are presented and confronted to the measurements performed in the wave basin with conventional wave probes it is worth remembering that the motion basis adopted for the analysis comprised only three motions namely heave roll and pitch the mathematical algorithm was implemented in matlab 2014a twenty different wave frequencies were considered with a spatial resolution of δ θ 5 degrees corresponding to m 20 and k 72 see section 2 moreover three different sets of raos were employed as alternatives for modelling the heave motions one with a constant external damping coefficient corresponding to 5 of the critical damping a second one obtained with the variable damping method computed according to the procedure presented in section 4 and also the raos obtained with the time domain analysis considering the pontoon drag forces see fig 5 regarding the values of the hyperparameters an extensive error analysis was carried out to determine the most favorable values as a result the calibration of u 1 was made based on the period of the motions according to the procedure defined by bispo et al 2012 whereas for u 2 the best value was given by 1 10 5 and for u 3 it was equal to 0 0035 with this set of input parameters the mean computational time required for the estimation of one wave condition using a conventional desktop pc was around 30 s for all the results showed ahead the motion based wave estimations have been made considering the first 30 min of data acquisition 1 1 time span that assures that a minimum number of 200 wave cycles are used to estimate the wave conditions as suggested in ittc 2014 period of time that is typically assumed as the length of the stationary period e g soares and fricke 2011 in fig 13 and fig 14 the reliability of the estimations was evaluated by means of relative errors accordingly the vertical axes of these figures provide the relative errors for the following statistics significant wave height h s that leads to the following relative error 20 η h s h m h s h m where h m stands for the significant wave height obtained from the measurements in the basin with wave probes and h s is the value of the significant wave height estimated by means of the motion based method mean wave period t 1 which relative error is given by 21 η t 1 t m t 1 t m where t m is the mean wave period measured in the basin and t 1 is the value estimated with the motion based method it must be emphasized once more that the platform is expected to filter certain part of the energy placed in high frequency range for this reason t 1 has been adopted as a reference for the errors instead of t p obtaining a better indicator of the distribution of the energy in the different frequencies the relative errors in the wave statistics are presented as a function of the measured mean period t 1 of the waves in each test given in the lower horizontal axis the upper axis indicates the corresponding measured significant wave heights in meters in this way the reader can assess the agreement obtained with the motion based method for different wave periods and heights moreover it should be noticed that these figures present three sets of results that correspond to the estimations obtained using the different raos described above finally it must be realized that the results are clustered into two different sets with different colors indicating whether the waves generated in the basin corresponded to a jonswap blue or torsethaugen empty red power spectrum the figures referred above only include information for waves coming from 90 and 135 because other headings conditions tested during the experimental campaign did not provide any meaningful new information see fig 19 fig 15 next presents a polar plot for the directional wave spectra estimated in a few selected cases among the beam sea tests once again the results include conditions that are representative of cases with low and high peak periods for an easier comparison the maps correspond to the same sea states presented before in fig 12 in this figure the accuracy regarding the estimation of the mean wave direction θ can be assessed reminding that the expected wave direction in the tank is 180 in addition one may also evaluate the results in terms of the energy spreading both in frequency and direction fig 16 provides the same results for the tests with quartering sea conditions heading of 135 figs 17 and 18 show the 2d wave spectra estimated dashed blue line for sea conditions 6 12 15 and 30 see table 3 also aiming at providing a reference for the posterior analysis the sea spectra obtained from the wave probes records are also included in these figures black lines in addition to the graphical results table 4 provides the mean values of the errors obtained not only for beam and quartering wave conditions but also for the other wave headings adopted in the tests it presents the mean relative errors for significant wave height mean wave period peak period and also the absolute error of the estimated direction it should be realized that the results displayed for each heading combines all the tests within a certain range of peak wave period this was made in order to allow an easier evaluation of how the errors behave as the wave period changes finally the results are presented separately for jonswap and torsethaugen spectra the presentation of the results is concluded with fig 19 that was conceived in order to provide a practical way for the analysis involving the five different headings and all the 32 different sea conditions tested during the experimental campaign in this case once again only the results with the variable damping method are presented moreover one may infer not only the mean errors and how they change with the wave period but also the variations induced by the different wave headings based on these figures and on the results in table 4 a detailed discussion of the performance of the motion based method will be presented next 6 1 discussion many aspects of the results presented above deserve attention first by inspecting the error statistics obtained with the wave inference method table 4 it can be concluded that the overall agreement with the expected values is indeed very good for all the different headings considering the whole range of wave periods tested the maximum errors involved in the prediction of wave height and mean wave period are around 10 for jonswap seas and 15 for the conditions corresponding to the bimodal torsethaugen spectra regarding only the significant wave height the inference method usually underestimates the experimental values the errors being below 16 for the most unfavorable headings 90 and 180 and below 7 for the most favorable one 135 it must be stressed that the underestimation observed is indeed consistent with the expected bias of the method since part of the energy in the high frequency wave components is filtered as these waves do not impose motions of the hull it is also important to observe that the level of underestimation and the differences between the headings tend to decrease as the wave period increases favoring the results for the most severe sea states this trend can be readily attested by observing the variation of the errors in fig 13 and also by comparing the errors for different period ranges in table 4 the results obtained for the predicted mean wave periods t 1 are also consistent with the bias of the method since energy is filtered from the wave components with higher frequencies the mean frequency of the estimated spectrum tends to be lower than the real one and consequently the mean period tends to be higher nonetheless the results show that differences are not large the errors being always below 15 once again the errors decrease for larger wave periods as should be expected on the other hand table 4 also provides the relative error concerning the estimated peak period t p the results show that the peak period is always estimated accurately with an error below 4 another important characteristic of these estimations is that there is no significant variation between the outputs obtained with different headings and for different wave periods attesting that the prediction of t p is less sensitive to these factors figs 13 and 14 also allow an assessment of the influence of the different heave rao models on the motion based predictions it is interesting to realize that the main influence arising from the consideration of pontoon drag effects occurs in the estimation of the significant wave height neither the mean wave direction nor the mean wave period are substantially changed by the use of alternative raos moreover one may realize that the discrepancies in the wave height predicted by the different models increase for larger periods this was already expected and happens due to the fact that these waves induce resonant heave motions that are more pronounced for the larger periods results indicate that the variable damping model provided the smallest errors in the wave height if compared to the other models that were tested constant damping or the raos corrected by means of time domain simulations regarding the shape of the wave spectrum the relative errors for significant wave height and mean period are amplified by torsethaugen model for all the wave headings again this is not surprising since compared to the jonswap model see fig 10 the torsethaugen spectrum places a larger amount of energy in the high frequency range in which the dynamic response of the model is less pronounced figs 17 and 18 reflect this filtering effect in the high frequency range for both heading conditions furthermore both figures show an example of a 100yr condition test case 30 which attests that for the most extreme conditions only a small amount of energy is filtered from the sea spectrum due to the large peak periods typically observed in these situations regarding the energy distribution in the frequency range one may realize that it changes according to the wave heading resulting in the variations of the estimations of t 1 showed in table 4 nevertheless as mentioned before the peak period is always captured correctly by the method furthermore the whole set of results shows that the most unfavorable headings are those of bow 180 and beam 90 waves once again this was expected because these are the situations when only 2 of the 3 motions used for the estimations are excited by the waves for the 180 heading there are no significant roll motions for the 90 heading there are no significant pitch motions on the other hand the most favorable conditions are those closer to 135 or 45 degrees when all the 3 motions are excited and thus the amount of information available for the estimations is larger when the mean wave direction is concerned see figs 15 and 16 although the estimated spectra present a somewhat larger spreading of energy if compared to those obtained from the wave probes see fig 12 for a proper comparison the prediction of the mean direction was very accurate for all the conditions tested this is because only long crested sea conditions were tested during the experimental campaign in short crested seas one may expect that the filtering effects of the platform dynamics on the high frequency energy components may in some cases lead to poorer estimations of the mean wave direction on the other hand the larger spreading of wave energy observed when using the bayesian inference method is related to the calibration of the hyperparameter u 1 which controls the level of smoothness of the spectrum with respect to the wave direction in this case the pre calibration of the hyperparameter was made seeking to improve the accuracy in the prediction of the main statistical wave parameters t 1 and h s a procedure that ultimately led to a somewhat larger wave spreading this trade off between accurate energy predictions and smoothness of the spectrum is a particular feature of the present version of the bayesian inference method at the present moment an investigation on alternative prior distributions is being made as an attempt of improving this trade off however in face of the good results obtained so far this is considered to be a secondary aspect finally to conclude the discussion of the main aspects some additional comments regarding the prediction of the most extreme conditions must be made in fact it is important to realize that the 100yr wave conditions could be captured by the motion based method with errors lower than 5 in both wave height and period for the jonswap model these conditions involved waves with h s over 16 m and peak periods close to 20 s obviously one must remind that these good results were obtained in model scale in very controlled conditions when considering the estimations made aboard a real unit other factors like the presence of risers and mooring lines and the effects of wind and current on the motions for example will certainly impose a more demanding scenario for the predictions nonetheless the favorable results obtained in the tests are certainly promising enough to motivate the continuity of the research during which these other factors must be properly addressed 7 conclusions an experimental study about the usefulness of employing a semi submersible platform for motion based estimations of local sea spectrum was presented and the results were evaluated by means of an extensive set of model scale tests performed in a wave basin for this purpose a 1 120 scale model of a semi submersible unit has been tested in five different headings comprising waves that ranged from typical to severe wave conditions representative of the åsgard field in norway waves were generated considering both unimodal jonswap and bimodal torsethaugen spectral models the directional wave spectra estimated from the model motions were directly confronted to the experimental measurements obtained by means of conventional wave probes a bayesian inference model with three hyperparameters as proposed by simos et al 2012 was adopted for the estimations this method includes the addition of a third hyperparameter which indeed improved the results compared to those obtained with only two hyperparameters the predictions considered a basis composed of three motions heave roll pitch which proved to be appropriate for all the sea conditions tested results have shown that all the wave conditions tested could be accurately inferred from the bayesian method keeping the errors below reasonable limits the errors were larger in the most unfavorable conditions which correspond to the ones with small motions small periods or mild seas and in the cases when the sea only excited two of the three motions bow and beam waves the errors are reduced in the cases were the platform presents larger motions or provide more information which were given when the heading was close to 135 and for the more severe wave conditions when the wave induce more pronounced motions all the results confirmed the expected biases of overestimating the wave period while underestimating the wave height deviations that are progressively smaller as the wave period increases the analysis of the results with raos obtained from different approaches also highlighted the importance of a proper modelling of transfer functions of motion in the experimental setup a soft mooring system was used and the major source of drag was the platform itself in this condition the results obtained when using the variable external damping method a damping ratio proportional to the recorded heave amplitude in each test proved to be a good option for dealing with effects of the non linear viscous damping so far as a general conclusion one may state that the results obtained with the small scale tests indicate that semi submersible platform indeed may be considered as a good choice for the motion based wave inference in addition the results for more severe sea states are promising even when the raos are modeled in a conventional linear analysis in frequency domain naturally a substantial amount of future work threads arise from the topics discussed in this paper on the one hand an experimental analysis of the effects the moorings and risers may have on the motions of the unit is envisaged and the same is true regarding the action of wind and current the impact that these effects may have on the wave frequency motions and as a consequence on the motion based inference must be properly quantified a field campaign supported by alternative wave sensors such as buoys or wave radars is also desirable for a proper validation of the method finally further attention should also be paid to the mathematical approach of the problem which in principle could be modified in order to include the uncertainty in the prediction of the raos a first step in this attempt was made by iseki 2012 who addressed this challenge with an error matrix c composed of products of the response functions and the estimation errors achieving a modified likelihood function by the summation of the rao matrix a and this error matrix i e b a c x u however different approaches may be proposed based on alternative prior distributions investigations on this topic are currently being made acknowledgments authors

23549,a numerical method is developed to study the ship hydroelasticity problem in time domain boundary element method bem with three dimensional transient free surface green function and neumann kelvin approximation is used for the solution of the hydrodynamic part the structural domain is modeled by finite element method fem using 1d beam element in time domain the coupling between bem and fem is made through body boundary condition in the hydrodynamic solution furthermore direct integration scheme i e newmark β method is used for obtaining the structural velocity and deformation the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are validated with available published results three different barge type structures and a large container ship are taken for the analysis a good correspondence is observed between the proposed and reported numerical and experimental results also it is observed that structural flexibility plays an important role while calculating structural deflection shear force bending moment etc the developed numerical method seems to be robust efficient and a very useful tool in predicting the hydrodynamic loads structural deflections shears force bending moment etc for flexible structure keywords hydroelasticity time domain panel method transient free surface green s function finite element method newmark β method 1 introduction prediction of wave induced loads and motions are two major aspects while designing a ship or offshore structures recently commercial ships have been becoming larger and faster due to the increase in global trade large floating structures and ships are relatively more flexible and their natural frequencies can fall into the range of the encounter frequencies of commonly occurring sea spectrum similarly with the increase in ship speed the encounter frequency increases and more often may come closer to the natural frequencies of the ship hull vibration in such situations the hydrodynamic loads on the structure and corresponding structural responses become large and leads to severe structural damage therefore it is important to develop a proper fluid structure interaction model to predict the wave induced loads and structural responses in such extreme situations a classical hydroelastic tool to analyze the interaction between the fluid and large floating structures was developed by bishop and price 1979 since then many researchers have contributed to the various aspects of this field different numerical techniques were also proposed by many researchers for the solution of such practical engineering problems generally a hydroelastic model can broadly divide into three major components i hydrodynamic model to estimate the hydrodynamic load on the structure ii structural model to predict the structural deflections and iii coupling of the hydrodynamic and structural model in case of simplified structures such as two dimensional rectangular and circular plates many rigorous and complete analytic solutions are available some of the recent works in these lines are as follows sahoo et al 2001 analyzed scattering of surface waves by a semi infinite floating elastic plate an extensive study on the hydroelasticity of a very large structure was given by andrianov 2005 squire 2008 developed a contemporary hydroelastic theory to describe how sea ice responds to an ocean wave field and those that relate to a very large floating structure vlfs experiencing comparable forcing karmakar et al 2009 studied wave interaction with multiple articulated floating elastic plates etc meylan and sturova 2009 proposed three methods to determine the motion of a two dimensional finite elastic plate floating on the water surface recently wang et al 2016 investigated the hydroelastic response of a horizontal elastic plate impacting with the water both theoretically and numerically in order to develop a robust and efficient method for hydroelastic analysis for the complicated structures like a ship it is essential to develop a coupled hydrodynamic structural solver either in frequency or time domain for the frequency domain solutions some examples are as follows a detailed investigations of ship hydroelasticity of a bulk carrier is elaborated in hirdaris et al 2003 timoshenko beam idealization with shear center influence and warping effects were included and finite difference formulations as well as 3d fem model were employed both models were combined with potential flow theory in the frequency domain iijima et al 2008 proposed a consistent structural analysis procedure to estimate the global and local load effects considering symmetric and anti symmetric hydroelastic vibrations to study the structural response of a ship in severe seas senjanovic et al 2008a 2008b 2009 extensively investigated the problem of hydroelasticity of ships with many details the hydrodynamic problem was solved in frequency domain either using strip theory or 3d boundary element method bem whereas the structural dynamic problem solved using 1d 3d finite element method fem meylan and tomic 2012 introduced a method that explained the behaviour of an elastic or rigid structure by its resonance frequencies this study provided some fundamental information that could be of use in giving a simplified description for the response of complicated structures the time domain solvers are capable of addressing certain nonlinear effects such as froude krylov nonlinearity nonlinear hydrostatics and structural nonlinearity etc in a relatively straightforward way and thus advantageous over frequency domain solvers also for a forward moving vessel time domain solutions are found to be less complicated in comparison to frequency domain solutions therefore a significant effort is made to solve the hydroelasticity problem in the time domain as well while dealing with the ship hydroelasticity problem in the time domain one of the most popular methods is to solve through impulse response function irf i e extending cummin s 1962 formulation for flexible body together with fem or modal superposition method wu and moan 1996 developed a nonlinear hydroelastic method where the linear part was calculated using linear strip theory and nonlinear modification was made from linear impulse response function taghipour et al 2009 developed a state space model using irf to deal with the time domain hydroelastic analysis of a marine structure rajendran and guedes soares 2016 investigated the response of a very large container ship in rough sea where the radiation forces were obtained using irf and the structural problem was solved using finite element method generally the idea behind such efforts is to use time domain method based on irf to include the several nonlinearities in a simplified way or to combine cfd solver with the hydroelasticity solution for example rajendran and guedes soares 2016 included the nonlinear radiation and diffraction force in a simplified manner seng et al 2014 included the local effect through volume of fluid vof based free surface flow solver in hydroelasticity solution where hydroelasticity solver is based on irf based time domain technique the numerical technique based on irf requires frequency domain solution however without such information the problem of hydroelasticity can be handled in the time domain using direct coupling between hydrodynamic and structural solution relatively less reported but few researchers have worked on such direct coupling as well in these cases the hydrodynamic solver is developed using time domain boundary element method and coupled with a finite element or modal superposition technique based on the structural dynamic solver a very systematic study has been done by kim et al 2009 2013 they coupled rankine panel method and fem to study the hydroelasticity of ships like structure in waves kara 2015 used transient free surface green s function based time domain panel method to calculate the hydrodynamic loads however the structural problem was solved using modal superposition technique assuming the ship to be a free free euler bernoulli beam direct coupling between bem and fem solver offer certain advantages for example i it implicitly takes all the wet modes of structural vibration ii extending this theory to include forward speed is relatively easier iii extension of the linear model into a nonlinear model for both hydrodynamic and structural part is possible in principle etc in view of that in the present study the problem of ship hydroelasticity has been solved by a direct coupling of a bem and a fem based solver for the hydrodynamic solution a 3d time domain panel method using transient free surface green s function is used by following the approach of kara 2015 for the structural part 1d finite element beam model is used for analysis of the structural deformation shear force bending moment etc the coupling between hydrodynamic and structural dynamic solvers is made through kinematic body boundary condition the dynamic responses of the structure are then found out at each time step by newmark β method the validation of the time domain panel method code used in this paper has been extensively done and reported in many literatures datta et al 2011 2013 sengupta et al 2016 in case of linear and nonlinear seakeeping problem in this paper an extension to that code for hydroelasticity analysis is elaborated a very brief discussion of the present method is reported in sengupta et al 2017 an elaborate discussion on the methodology and validation is given in this paper for validating the hydroelastic solution three different types of barges and a large container ship without forward speed are taken for the analysis the vertical bending moment vbm shear force sf are calculated and computed results are compared with existing published numerical and experimental results and found satisfactory agreement between them 2 mathematical formulation and numerical implementation 2 1 numerical formulation of the structural problem in this paper the ship hull has been modeled as an euler bernoulli beam floating in the water considering the basic assumptions of an euler bernoulli beam the response of the ship hull due to the external force f x t can be described by the following governing differential equation 1 m x 2 w t 2 2 x 2 e i x 2 w x 2 f x t in equation 1 m x is the mass per unit length of the structure e i x represents flexural rigidity along the length of the structure w is the elastic deflection of the floating body the calculation of mass distribution depends on the structural arrangements inside the hull and the cargo distributions however the distribution of flexural rigidity is usually calculated from the actual geometric shape of the different cross sections along the hull the weak form representation of equation 1 is obtained by multiplying it with weighted function v and integrating it over the domain ω s 0 l 2 0 l m x 2 w t 2 v d x 0 l 2 x 2 e i x 2 w x 2 v d x 0 l f v d x 0 assuming the uniform distribution of the weighted function v and dependent variable w equation 2 can be further modified as 3 0 l m x 2 w t 2 v d x 0 l e i x 2 v x 2 2 w x 2 d x 0 l f v d x 0 the hull girder is discretized into a set of n e elements whilst each element consists of two nodes since in the present formulation only vertical displacement and rotational displacement about transverse axis is considered two degrees of freedom is taken at each node and denoted by w i and w x i where w x i w x i t h n o d e see fig 1 thus at any point the displacement w and the weighted function v can be written as 4a w i 1 4 d i e n i e 4b v j 1 4 g j e n j e in above equations n e n 1 e n 2 e n 3 e n 4 e represents hermite shape functions of the individual degrees of freedom and d e w 1 e w x 1 e w 2 e w x 2 e represents degrees of freedom at element e in equation 4b v is arbitrary and satisfies only the homogeneous version of the essential boundary condition therefore g j has to be arbitrary and for each g j there will be an algebraic equation substituting the approximations for w and v into equation 3 yields 5 e 1 n e j 1 4 g j e i 1 4 0 l e m x n i e n j e d i e d x 0 l e e i x 2 n i e x 2 2 n j e x 2 d i e d x 0 l e f n j e d x 0 after simplification the elemental equation turns out as 6 m e 4 4 d i e 4 1 k e 4 4 d i e 4 1 f i e 4 1 in equation 6 the expressions for mass matrix stiffness matrix and force vector of an element e can be given as 7 m i j e 0 l e m x n i e n j e d x 8 k i j e 0 l e e i x 2 n i e x 2 2 n j e x 2 d x 9 f i e 0 l e f n j e d x equation 6 is a system of four linear simultaneous ordinary differential equations combining these elemental equations with consideration to the nodal connectivity of different elements the global finite element equation 10 can be obtained since an accurate simulation of the system damping is difficult in the current study an approximate method using rayleigh damping model liu and gorman 1995 is used and expressed as c α d k β d m where α d and β d are the proportional coefficients for the stiffness and mass respectively the values of α d and β d are calculated as 0 001 and 0 0001 using the procedure mentioned in liu et al 2016 adding this rayleigh damping term the final global finite element equation can be obtained as 10 m d c d k d f herein m and k are the global mass and stiffness matrices f is the global force vector 2 2 hydrodynamic analysis in equation 10 external force f is the wave induced loads and moments which is obtained by solving the hydrodynamic problem the boundary value problem for the hydrodynamic solution can be stated as follows assuming the fluid is homogeneous inviscid and incompressible and flow is ir rotational then based on the potential flow assumptions the total velocity potential ϕ t x t can be defined as 11 ϕ t x t ϕ i x t ϕ x t in equation 11 ϕ i x t is the incident wave potential ϕ x t represents the disturbed potential which is combination of radiation and diffraction potential the linearized initial boundary value problem for ϕ x t is specified by the following governing equations boundary conditions far field conditions and one initial condition as follows ϕ x t satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain ω f i e 12 2 ϕ x t 0 x ω f the linearized free surface boundary condition can be given by 13 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z 0 on z 0 where g denotes the acceleration due to gravity the kinematic body boundary condition for hydroelasticity solution is different from rigid body case in case of rigid body the kinematic body boundary condition can be written as 14a ϕ n v t n ϕ i n on s 0 in 14a v t is the velocity of the rigid body at its center of gravity at the time t and s 0 is the mean wetted surface n denotes the unit normal to the body however in case of deformable body the velocity is varying along the horizontal transverse and vertical axis and therefore the velocity of the body becomes the function of both x and t therefore the body boundary condition for the deformable body can be expressed as 14b ϕ n v x t n ϕ i n on s 0 finally the far field and initial condition can be written as 15 ϕ ϕ t 0 as r h on z 0 16 ϕ ϕ t 0 as t 0 in the above equations r h x 2 y 2 although the body boundary condition is different from the rigid one the integral equation does not change because of that using the time dependent transient green s function ϕ p t can be expressed in the form of an integral equation 17a ϕ p t 1 4 π s 0 σ q t g o p q d s 0 t d τ s 0 σ q t g t f p q t τ d s expression 17a represents the total disturbance potential ϕ at any point p at any instant of time t in terms of distribution of sources over the body surface in 17a σ q t is the associated source strength at time t differentiating 17a with respect to the normal vector and applying the boundary conditions at p in s 0 gives the following integral equation 17b ϕ p t n p 1 4 π s 0 σ q t g 0 p q n p d s 0 t d τ s 0 σ q t g t f p q t τ n p d s where 17c g 0 1 r 1 r 17d g f 2

the rankine part and the free surface memory part of the green s function respectively p x y z and q ξ η ζ are the field and the source points q ξ η ζ is the image of q above the mean free surface z 0 k is the wave number and g t f is the derivation of the g f with respect to τ the detail on the formation of the integral relation and the expression for g o and g f is available in many sources e g lin and yue 1990 equation 17b is used to solve for the unknown source strengths σ q t once source strengths σ q t are known equation 17a is then applied to determine the unknowns ϕ x t over the body surface once ϕ x t over body surface is determined pressure on the body can be found from the bernoulli equation and the hydrodynamic force and moment can be determined by integrating pressure over the body surface let p x t be the total dynamic pressure distribution including the hydrodynamic pressure due to disturbed potential ϕ x t and pressure due to incident wave potential ϕ i x t at any arbitrary point on the body then the total dynamic pressure on that point can be obtained from the equation 18 p x t ρ 0 ϕ x t t ϕ i x t t 1 2 ϕ ϕ i 2 in equation 18 ρ 0 is the density of the fluid equation 18 is the general form of the pressure equation for the zero speed problem the quadratic contribution can be ignored however for the linearized problem with forward speed in present earth fixed co ordinate system the quadratic contributions are included in the pressure equation for accounting the forward speed the detailed discussion on the same can be found in lin and yue 1990 therefore the dynamic force f s x t due to pressure p x t at any arbitrary section s x at any instant of time t can be obtained as 19 f s x t s x t p x t n d s x the dynamic force obtained from 19 along with hydrostatic force can be taken as an external force for the solution of the structural problem once the structural problem solved in the time domain the body boundary condition 14b will be updated accordingly to solve the boundary value problem the details of this coupling will be discussed in the following sections 2 3 numerical solution of the hydrodynamic problem a lower order panel method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problem in lower order panel method the velocity potential is assumed to be constant over a panel therefore it simplifies the nature of continuous variation of the velocity potential over the wetted surface in order to capture these phenomena more appropriately a higher order panel method proposed by kim et al 2009 2013 would be the better choice however one can always overcome this limitation by making panel size sufficiently small the discretized form of the body boundary condition 14b for the arbitrary panel i can be given as 20 ϕ n i v i n i ϕ n i in the above equation v i represents the velocity at the centroid of the i t h panel n i is the generalized normal vector to the i t h panel since the present formulation based on constant element boundary element implementation along with a trapezoidal rule for the convolution integral following steps have been followed i discretize s 0 by n planar quadrilateral and triangular panels ii assume σ to be constant over the panels and over the line segments with values same as at the centroid of the panels note that the source strength over the line segments becomes same as the source strength of the adjacent panel iii assume time step size δ t to be constant in carrying out the time integration and use a forward step euler method iv use trapezoidal rule for the convolution integration this reduces the integrals to a system of linear equations in terms of the discrete source strengths and potentials for example 17a reduces to 21a ϕ j 1 4 π j 1 n σ j δ s j g 0 p i t q j τ d s δ t m 0 m 1

can be obtained from the following equation as 21c ϕ j m 1 4 π j 1 n σ j m δ s j g 0 p i t q j τ d s δ t m 0 m 1 ε m σ j m δ s j g f p i t q j τ d s i 1 n here m and m are indices for the current time t and retarded time τ t m δ t τ m δ t i and j are the indices for the field point p and source point q respectively ε 0 5 for m 0 and 1 for m 1 for integration of the memory part of the green function over the panels four point gauss quadrature rules are used while the rankine part is integrated using a combination of analytical formula and quadrature rules of variable order in order to achieve consistent level of accuracy over the entire computational domain for the self influencing panel the analytical formulation proposed by newman 1986 is adopted the detailed discussion on the numerical integration scheme is available in many literatures for example sen 2002 datta and sen 2007 and not repeated here once the distribution of unknown ϕ x t over the mean wetted surface is known dynamic pressure at the centroid of the panel can be found out through equation 18 finally the dynamic force acted at any arbitrary panel i can be obtained as 22 f i m t p i m n i d s i in the above expression f i m t is the dynamic force at panel i at m t h time step p i m is the pressure at the centroid of the panel i at m t h time step d s i is the area of i t h panel at t 0 in reality the panel area and the unit normal should be the function of time however by taking sufficiently small panels one can assume that the variation in the panel area is ignorable such simplification would not affect the final solution as δ d s i o ε 2 on the other hand the change in normal velocity is taken care in appropriate manner therefore in the present paper the panel normal for the deformed shape is stored at each time step to calculate the variation of the normal with time however under the assumptions of the linearity panels co ordinates are not updated 2 4 modelling of restoring force modelling of restoring force is not straightforward in comparison to the rigid body case a detailed discussion on modelling of restoring force and its effect on the hydroelastic solution is deeply studied by senjanović et al 2008b in their derivations modeshapes are taken explicitly the present formulation is based on finite element method where modeshapes are implicitly defined therefore in this paper an alternative solution proposed by kim et al 2009 is adopted here the restoring force at the i t h panel is written as 23 f i r e s t o r i n g t ρ 0 g z i δ n i d s i ρ 0 g δ z i n i d s i where z i are water head and δ denotes the leading order variation 2 5 coupling between bem and fem in time domain the structural and hydrodynamic problems are solved through the global finite element equation 10 and the boundary element equations 17 19 respectively the global finite element equation 10 has been solved using newmark s time integration method newmark 1959 according to the newmark s method nodal displacement vector d at any time instant t can be related to d at the previous time instant by the following equation 24 m α δ t 2 δ α δ t c k d t f t m 1 α δ t 2 d t δ t 1 α δ t d t δ t 1 2 α 1 d t δ t c δ α δ t d t δ t δ α 1 d t δ t δ t 2 δ α 2 d t δ t after calculating d the velocities and acceleration vectors can be calculated using the following equations 25 d t 1 α δ t 2 d t d t δ t 1 α δ t d t δ t 1 2 α 1 d t δ t 26 d t d t δ t δ t 1 δ d t δ t δ d t the parameters α and δ decide stability and accuracy of the method and describe the variation of acceleration over a time step the values of α and δ are generally taken as 1 4 and 1 2 kim et al 2013 and same values are taken in this work as well using the velocities obtained from equation 26 force can be calculated from equations 17 19 using this force with the help of equations 24 26 the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors can be obtained for the next time step in this way the time marching is continued solution of equation 10 gives unknown structural responses at each node of the finite element model however to solve equation 10 force per unit length f is required the external force f at different nodes is obtained by solving the hydrodynamic problem i e boundary element equations 17 19 on the other hand to get the hydrodynamic force structural velocity and displacement at each node are required which can only be obtained by solving equation 10 therefore a suitable coupling scheme is required for exchanging the variables between the finite element and boundary element equations an efficient algorithm is proposed in this paper for such coupling normally the hydrodynamic panel and finite element grids are different moreover the hydrodynamic loads are computed at panel centroid but structural velocity is calculated at sections therefore it is important to shift the panel force to sectional force and sectional velocity and displacement to panel velocity and displacement fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the positions of the panels and stations in a simplistic way it can be seen from fig 2 that panels are arranged in such a way that none of the panels are intersected by the section lines this simplification reduces the complexity of incorporating the hydrodynamic load into the structural analysis furthermore it is considered that the pressure velocity etc are linearly varying between two consecutive panels along the horizontal axis in view of that the vertical force per unit run f is calculated at the stations as follows 27a f 1 j 1 m p m j a p j n j 2 w p

index notation for station and panel numbering the calculated hydrodynamic pressure at j t h panel centroid for the m t h time step is denoted here by p m j a p is denoted as panel area and panel width is given by w p x j p a n e l represents the longitudinal position of the j t h panel and s i denotes longitudinal location of i t h section respectively in fig 2 m represents the number of hydrodynamic panel within the respective range and n is the total number of structural grids after getting the sectional force using 27 a c newmark β method is applied in order to compute velocities at different nodes of the elements similarly the velocity at panel centroid v is calculated from the velocities at different nodes using equation 28a d 28a v i s t a t i o n d 2 k 1 f o r s i x 1 k e

1st and 2nd node of an element e once the velocity at each panel centroid is obtained the body boundary condition 14b is updated for the next time step and corresponding hydrodynamic pressure is estimated using bem thus the coupling between fem and bem is made 3 results and discussion three different types of barge and a containership are taken for the analysis to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method structural deflection shear force bending moment are calculated for the floating vessel without forward speed and compared with available experimental and numerical results the results obtained from the proposed method are referred as td the frequency is non dimensionalised by ω l g where ω is the incident wave frequency l is the length of the hull g is the acceleration due to gravity time is non dimensionalised by t t where t is the time period structural displacement at any section is non dimensionalised by x 3 a where x 3 is the magnitude of the displacement of that section and a denotes the wave amplitude the shear force and bending moment are non dimensionalised by v ρ g a l 2 and m ρ g a l 3 where v and m represents the amplitude of shear force and bending moment 3 1 analysis for barge type structure in the present paper three different barge models are taken for the analysis named as model i model ii and model iii the differences between these models lie in structural properties geometric dimensions etc the details of the same are discussed in the relevant sections 3 1 1 analysis of barge model i the panel model for the barge is shown in fig 3 and the principal particulars of the barge are also presented in table 1 in general the hydrodynamic grid is different from the structural grid and therefore convergence study is essential for both the grids for hydrodynamic analysis the barge is discretized by a different set of panels to obtain the optimum panel size the proper discretization of the hull is achieved through the convergence test fig 4 shows the deflection at mid ship of the barge for four different panel sizes at ω l g 2 5 which is essentially the case where wavelength to ship length ratio becomes approximately 1 0 from the figure it is seen that convergence is achieved around 448 panels for the solution of the hydrodynamic part also from fig 4 it may be observed that all four plots are very stable with time this indicates the efficiency and the robustness of the present time domain hydrodynamic code to obtain the optimum number of elements required for fea free vibration analysis is performed considering the ship as an equivalent euler bernoulli beam which is discretized with n n number of nodes the choice of the discretization is made through the convergence of the eigenfrequencies in table 2 the dry natural frequencies hz of the first four flexible vertical modes of the barge are presented and corresponding mode shapes are presented in fig 5 from table 2 it can be confirmed that the natural frequencies in case of the barge are converged at n n 100 also the variation in body normal i e δ n is plotted for a given time instance in fig 6 from the figure it can be seen that variation of the normal vector is not ignorable and thus proper modelling of hydrostatic force is extremely important to check the efficiency and the robustness of the present hydroelasticity code displacements of the barge at forward perpendicular fp mid ship and aft perpendicular ap is computed and presented in fig 7 for ω l g 2 5 the stability of the results indicates the efficiency and robustness of the present formulation from table 1 it may be noted that uniform mass distribution is taken for the model i which can be considered as the simplest situation the similar model and mass distribution are taken by farstad 1997 and kara 2015 however kara 2015 presented the results for different stiffness factors therefore to start with initial validation is done with the results reported in farstad 1997 then shear forces at a particular section are computed for different stiffness factors and compared with that of kara 2015 fig 8 shows the comparison of displacement raos response amplitude operators at mid ship farstad 1997 computed the displacement shear force bending moment considering the first eight flexible modes from the figure it can be observed that both results agreed very well although some small difference may be noticed at higher frequency range overall agreement is reasonably good the vertical bending moment transfer function at mid ship of the barge is plotted in fig 9 the result shows good assent with compared result similarly the shear force transfer function for the barge at x l 4 and x l 4 are computed and presented in fig 10 and fig 11 the comparison shows quite good agreement with farstad 1997 apart from some slight variation in some frequency range the overall agreement is excellent fig 12 a d shows the vertical shear force at x l 4 with varying stiffness factor and compared with the results of kara 2015 the stiffness factor s f in this paper is defined as e i ρ g l 5 from these figures also it can be noted that overall agreement is extremely good with kara 2015 results to check the influence of the flexibility in the hydrodynamic pressure dynamic pressure plot is given in case of rigid and flexible body in fig 13 at ω l g 2 5 the schematic representation of the corresponding wave profile is given in fig 14 from fig 13 it is clearly seen that due to flexibility the dynamic pressure changes significantly this difference comes due to the change of the body boundary condition 14 3 1 2 analysis of barge model ii the second set of results is computed for a rectangular barge where the distribution of the mass is non uniform the geometric details and mass distribution are taken from the work reported by senjanovic et al 2013 the principal characteristics of this barge are given in table 3 more detailed information about the structural arrangements is available in senjanovic et al 2013 in this case the vertical bending moment at mid ship and shear force at l 4 of mid ship is computed the transfer functions for vbm and sf is plotted in figs 15 and 16 for the heading angle β 150 and compared with reported numerical results in the figures senjanovic flex and senjanovic rigid refer the hydroelastic and rigid body results given by senjanović et al 2013 from the comparisons it can be noted that both the results agree excellently furthermore it is interesting to note that bending moment results for the rigid body case are showing the higher peak this trend indicates assuming the structure to be rigid could lead to overestimating the bending moment and shear force results however this may not be true when the ship is considerably large and vertical horizontal and torsional modes are considered altogether 3 1 3 comparison with experiment for a segmented barge model iii finally the structural deflection of the barge is validated with the experimental results reported by malenica et al 2003 the principal dimension of the barge is given in table 4 the details of the experimental model can be found out from malenica et al 2003 the hydrodynamic panel model for this barge is shown in fig 17 the experimental model consisting of 12 pontoons and were connected together with a steel rod however for predicting the hydroelastic response the gaps between the segmented pontoons are not considered in this case also the number of panels for hydrodynamic analysis and number of elements for finite element discretization has been considered by checking the convergence test for instance in table 5 dry natural frequencies for vertical vibration of the model are compared with that of senjanović et al 2008a and found satisfactory agreement between both the results in fig 18 the dry natural modes of vertical vibrations are presented for the first four natural frequencies fig 19 shows a comparison between the experimental and the computed results for displacement rao at the bow of the barge at a heading angle β 180 the comparison shows overall good agreement however there are some differences in mid frequency range it may be due to the difference in numerical modelling with the experimental one as the gaps between the segmented pontoons are not considered in the numerical model therefore because of that modification structural responses differ slightly from those of the experimental responses however from the overall pattern it can be confirmed that the present numerical scheme captures the response reasonably good with engineering accuracy therefore from the barge results figs 7 19 it can be concluded that the proposed methodology is capable of producing good results in case of simplistic hull shapes like a barge however it is required to validate the proposed method in case of realistic hulls also which has been done in the following sections 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental flexible responses of containership the efficiency and robustness of the proposed work are verified for a large container ship see fig 20 the vertical displacement bending moment at mid ship is computed and compared with published experimental and numerical results the geometric model of the hull distribution of mass along the hull and experimental results are taken from rajendran and guedes soares 2016 the experimental model was divided into 8 segments and each segment was connected together with an aluminum backbone of variable structural characteristics along the hull however like barge model iii in this case also such connectivity is ignored fig 21 shows the three dimensional panel model of the containership the main particulars of the ship are given in table 6 the dry natural frequencies are calculated numerically for the containership for convergence table 7 shows first four dry natural frequencies of the undamped free vibration of the hull and corresponding dry modes are shown in fig 21 the vertical bending moment and the displacement at mid ship are computed and compared with the experimental and numerical results given by rajendran and guedes soares 2016 in the plots 22 and 23 rajendran exp and rajendran num denote the experimental and numerical results given by rajendran and guedes soares 2016 in fig 22 displacements rao at mid ship is plotted the overall good agreement is observed among all the results fig 23 shows vertical bending moment rao at mid ship section the figure shows the bending moment results computed by the present method agree excellently with the experiment therefore from figs 22 and 23 it can be concluded that the present method is capable of getting accurate results for the realistic ship hull as well fig 24 represents the dynamic pressure plot in case of the rigid and flexible body at the non dimensional frequency ω l g 2 5 the corresponding wave profile is as same as fig 14 though the difference is not very prominent in this case still some difference can be seen between the rigid and flexible case which indicates the effect of structural flexibilities into the hydrodynamic solution 4 conclusion and future scope in this paper a direct bem fem coupled method in time domain is developed for hydroelasticity analysis of floating bodies a 3d time domain panel method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problem structural deflection is computed in time domain using fem both the methods then coupled through body boundary condition in hydrodynamic solution a simple but effective algorithm is developed to exchange the variables between structural and hydrodynamic code to check the accuracy and implementation of the proposed scheme three different barge type structures and a large container ship are taken for the analysis structural deflection shear force and bending moment are calculated and compared with available published and experimental results it is seen that the present methodology compared very well with the published results also it may be noted that the present scheme is able to produce very steady time domain results which confirm the efficiency and robustness of the present methodology therefore one can conclude that the proposed coupled bem fem scheme is efficient robust and produce reasonably good results with engineering accuracy and could be a useful tool to assess the hydroelasticity effect on the structure while designing a vessel also from the results it is observed that structural flexibility affect the hydrodynamic pressure on the hull therefore the effect due to flexible nature of the structure must be considered when dynamic pressure load is estimated at design stage as a future scope the present methodology can be further extended to include torsional and horizontal bending certain non linearities such as frude krylov nonlinear hydrostatic into the hydroelasticity

23549,a numerical method is developed to study the ship hydroelasticity problem in time domain boundary element method bem with three dimensional transient free surface green function and neumann kelvin approximation is used for the solution of the hydrodynamic part the structural domain is modeled by finite element method fem using 1d beam element in time domain the coupling between bem and fem is made through body boundary condition in the hydrodynamic solution furthermore direct integration scheme i e newmark β method is used for obtaining the structural velocity and deformation the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are validated with available published results three different barge type structures and a large container ship are taken for the analysis a good correspondence is observed between the proposed and reported numerical and experimental results also it is observed that structural flexibility plays an important role while calculating structural deflection shear force bending moment etc the developed numerical method seems to be robust efficient and a very useful tool in predicting the hydrodynamic loads structural deflections shears force bending moment etc for flexible structure keywords hydroelasticity time domain panel method transient free surface green s function finite element method newmark β method 1 introduction prediction of wave induced loads and motions are two major aspects while designing a ship or offshore structures recently commercial ships have been becoming larger and faster due to the increase in global trade large floating structures and ships are relatively more flexible and their natural frequencies can fall into the range of the encounter frequencies of commonly occurring sea spectrum similarly with the increase in ship speed the encounter frequency increases and more often may come closer to the natural frequencies of the ship hull vibration in such situations the hydrodynamic loads on the structure and corresponding structural responses become large and leads to severe structural damage therefore it is important to develop a proper fluid structure interaction model to predict the wave induced loads and structural responses in such extreme situations a classical hydroelastic tool to analyze the interaction between the fluid and large floating structures was developed by bishop and price 1979 since then many researchers have contributed to the various aspects of this field different numerical techniques were also proposed by many researchers for the solution of such practical engineering problems generally a hydroelastic model can broadly divide into three major components i hydrodynamic model to estimate the hydrodynamic load on the structure ii structural model to predict the structural deflections and iii coupling of the hydrodynamic and structural model in case of simplified structures such as two dimensional rectangular and circular plates many rigorous and complete analytic solutions are available some of the recent works in these lines are as follows sahoo et al 2001 analyzed scattering of surface waves by a semi infinite floating elastic plate an extensive study on the hydroelasticity of a very large structure was given by andrianov 2005 squire 2008 developed a contemporary hydroelastic theory to describe how sea ice responds to an ocean wave field and those that relate to a very large floating structure vlfs experiencing comparable forcing karmakar et al 2009 studied wave interaction with multiple articulated floating elastic plates etc meylan and sturova 2009 proposed three methods to determine the motion of a two dimensional finite elastic plate floating on the water surface recently wang et al 2016 investigated the hydroelastic response of a horizontal elastic plate impacting with the water both theoretically and numerically in order to develop a robust and efficient method for hydroelastic analysis for the complicated structures like a ship it is essential to develop a coupled hydrodynamic structural solver either in frequency or time domain for the frequency domain solutions some examples are as follows a detailed investigations of ship hydroelasticity of a bulk carrier is elaborated in hirdaris et al 2003 timoshenko beam idealization with shear center influence and warping effects were included and finite difference formulations as well as 3d fem model were employed both models were combined with potential flow theory in the frequency domain iijima et al 2008 proposed a consistent structural analysis procedure to estimate the global and local load effects considering symmetric and anti symmetric hydroelastic vibrations to study the structural response of a ship in severe seas senjanovic et al 2008a 2008b 2009 extensively investigated the problem of hydroelasticity of ships with many details the hydrodynamic problem was solved in frequency domain either using strip theory or 3d boundary element method bem whereas the structural dynamic problem solved using 1d 3d finite element method fem meylan and tomic 2012 introduced a method that explained the behaviour of an elastic or rigid structure by its resonance frequencies this study provided some fundamental information that could be of use in giving a simplified description for the response of complicated structures the time domain solvers are capable of addressing certain nonlinear effects such as froude krylov nonlinearity nonlinear hydrostatics and structural nonlinearity etc in a relatively straightforward way and thus advantageous over frequency domain solvers also for a forward moving vessel time domain solutions are found to be less complicated in comparison to frequency domain solutions therefore a significant effort is made to solve the hydroelasticity problem in the time domain as well while dealing with the ship hydroelasticity problem in the time domain one of the most popular methods is to solve through impulse response function irf i e extending cummin s 1962 formulation for flexible body together with fem or modal superposition method wu and moan 1996 developed a nonlinear hydroelastic method where the linear part was calculated using linear strip theory and nonlinear modification was made from linear impulse response function taghipour et al 2009 developed a state space model using irf to deal with the time domain hydroelastic analysis of a marine structure rajendran and guedes soares 2016 investigated the response of a very large container ship in rough sea where the radiation forces were obtained using irf and the structural problem was solved using finite element method generally the idea behind such efforts is to use time domain method based on irf to include the several nonlinearities in a simplified way or to combine cfd solver with the hydroelasticity solution for example rajendran and guedes soares 2016 included the nonlinear radiation and diffraction force in a simplified manner seng et al 2014 included the local effect through volume of fluid vof based free surface flow solver in hydroelasticity solution where hydroelasticity solver is based on irf based time domain technique the numerical technique based on irf requires frequency domain solution however without such information the problem of hydroelasticity can be handled in the time domain using direct coupling between hydrodynamic and structural solution relatively less reported but few researchers have worked on such direct coupling as well in these cases the hydrodynamic solver is developed using time domain boundary element method and coupled with a finite element or modal superposition technique based on the structural dynamic solver a very systematic study has been done by kim et al 2009 2013 they coupled rankine panel method and fem to study the hydroelasticity of ships like structure in waves kara 2015 used transient free surface green s function based time domain panel method to calculate the hydrodynamic loads however the structural problem was solved using modal superposition technique assuming the ship to be a free free euler bernoulli beam direct coupling between bem and fem solver offer certain advantages for example i it implicitly takes all the wet modes of structural vibration ii extending this theory to include forward speed is relatively easier iii extension of the linear model into a nonlinear model for both hydrodynamic and structural part is possible in principle etc in view of that in the present study the problem of ship hydroelasticity has been solved by a direct coupling of a bem and a fem based solver for the hydrodynamic solution a 3d time domain panel method using transient free surface green s function is used by following the approach of kara 2015 for the structural part 1d finite element beam model is used for analysis of the structural deformation shear force bending moment etc the coupling between hydrodynamic and structural dynamic solvers is made through kinematic body boundary condition the dynamic responses of the structure are then found out at each time step by newmark β method the validation of the time domain panel method code used in this paper has been extensively done and reported in many literatures datta et al 2011 2013 sengupta et al 2016 in case of linear and nonlinear seakeeping problem in this paper an extension to that code for hydroelasticity analysis is elaborated a very brief discussion of the present method is reported in sengupta et al 2017 an elaborate discussion on the methodology and validation is given in this paper for validating the hydroelastic solution three different types of barges and a large container ship without forward speed are taken for the analysis the vertical bending moment vbm shear force sf are calculated and computed results are compared with existing published numerical and experimental results and found satisfactory agreement between them 2 mathematical formulation and numerical implementation 2 1 numerical formulation of the structural problem in this paper the ship hull has been modeled as an euler bernoulli beam floating in the water considering the basic assumptions of an euler bernoulli beam the response of the ship hull due to the external force f x t can be described by the following governing differential equation 1 m x 2 w t 2 2 x 2 e i x 2 w x 2 f x t in equation 1 m x is the mass per unit length of the structure e i x represents flexural rigidity along the length of the structure w is the elastic deflection of the floating body the calculation of mass distribution depends on the structural arrangements inside the hull and the cargo distributions however the distribution of flexural rigidity is usually calculated from the actual geometric shape of the different cross sections along the hull the weak form representation of equation 1 is obtained by multiplying it with weighted function v and integrating it over the domain ω s 0 l 2 0 l m x 2 w t 2 v d x 0 l 2 x 2 e i x 2 w x 2 v d x 0 l f v d x 0 assuming the uniform distribution of the weighted function v and dependent variable w equation 2 can be further modified as 3 0 l m x 2 w t 2 v d x 0 l e i x 2 v x 2 2 w x 2 d x 0 l f v d x 0 the hull girder is discretized into a set of n e elements whilst each element consists of two nodes since in the present formulation only vertical displacement and rotational displacement about transverse axis is considered two degrees of freedom is taken at each node and denoted by w i and w x i where w x i w x i t h n o d e see fig 1 thus at any point the displacement w and the weighted function v can be written as 4a w i 1 4 d i e n i e 4b v j 1 4 g j e n j e in above equations n e n 1 e n 2 e n 3 e n 4 e represents hermite shape functions of the individual degrees of freedom and d e w 1 e w x 1 e w 2 e w x 2 e represents degrees of freedom at element e in equation 4b v is arbitrary and satisfies only the homogeneous version of the essential boundary condition therefore g j has to be arbitrary and for each g j there will be an algebraic equation substituting the approximations for w and v into equation 3 yields 5 e 1 n e j 1 4 g j e i 1 4 0 l e m x n i e n j e d i e d x 0 l e e i x 2 n i e x 2 2 n j e x 2 d i e d x 0 l e f n j e d x 0 after simplification the elemental equation turns out as 6 m e 4 4 d i e 4 1 k e 4 4 d i e 4 1 f i e 4 1 in equation 6 the expressions for mass matrix stiffness matrix and force vector of an element e can be given as 7 m i j e 0 l e m x n i e n j e d x 8 k i j e 0 l e e i x 2 n i e x 2 2 n j e x 2 d x 9 f i e 0 l e f n j e d x equation 6 is a system of four linear simultaneous ordinary differential equations combining these elemental equations with consideration to the nodal connectivity of different elements the global finite element equation 10 can be obtained since an accurate simulation of the system damping is difficult in the current study an approximate method using rayleigh damping model liu and gorman 1995 is used and expressed as c α d k β d m where α d and β d are the proportional coefficients for the stiffness and mass respectively the values of α d and β d are calculated as 0 001 and 0 0001 using the procedure mentioned in liu et al 2016 adding this rayleigh damping term the final global finite element equation can be obtained as 10 m d c d k d f herein m and k are the global mass and stiffness matrices f is the global force vector 2 2 hydrodynamic analysis in equation 10 external force f is the wave induced loads and moments which is obtained by solving the hydrodynamic problem the boundary value problem for the hydrodynamic solution can be stated as follows assuming the fluid is homogeneous inviscid and incompressible and flow is ir rotational then based on the potential flow assumptions the total velocity potential ϕ t x t can be defined as 11 ϕ t x t ϕ i x t ϕ x t in equation 11 ϕ i x t is the incident wave potential ϕ x t represents the disturbed potential which is combination of radiation and diffraction potential the linearized initial boundary value problem for ϕ x t is specified by the following governing equations boundary conditions far field conditions and one initial condition as follows ϕ x t satisfies the laplace equation in the fluid domain ω f i e 12 2 ϕ x t 0 x ω f the linearized free surface boundary condition can be given by 13 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z 0 on z 0 where g denotes the acceleration due to gravity the kinematic body boundary condition for hydroelasticity solution is different from rigid body case in case of rigid body the kinematic body boundary condition can be written as 14a ϕ n v t n ϕ i n on s 0 in 14a v t is the velocity of the rigid body at its center of gravity at the time t and s 0 is the mean wetted surface n denotes the unit normal to the body however in case of deformable body the velocity is varying along the horizontal transverse and vertical axis and therefore the velocity of the body becomes the function of both x and t therefore the body boundary condition for the deformable body can be expressed as 14b ϕ n v x t n ϕ i n on s 0 finally the far field and initial condition can be written as 15 ϕ ϕ t 0 as r h on z 0 16 ϕ ϕ t 0 as t 0 in the above equations r h x 2 y 2 although the body boundary condition is different from the rigid one the integral equation does not change because of that using the time dependent transient green s function ϕ p t can be expressed in the form of an integral equation 17a ϕ p t 1 4 π s 0 σ q t g o p q d s 0 t d τ s 0 σ q t g t f p q t τ d s expression 17a represents the total disturbance potential ϕ at any point p at any instant of time t in terms of distribution of sources over the body surface in 17a σ q t is the associated source strength at time t differentiating 17a with respect to the normal vector and applying the boundary conditions at p in s 0 gives the following integral equation 17b ϕ p t n p 1 4 π s 0 σ q t g 0 p q n p d s 0 t d τ s 0 σ q t g t f p q t τ n p d s where 17c g 0 1 r 1 r 17d g f 2

the rankine part and the free surface memory part of the green s function respectively p x y z and q ξ η ζ are the field and the source points q ξ η ζ is the image of q above the mean free surface z 0 k is the wave number and g t f is the derivation of the g f with respect to τ the detail on the formation of the integral relation and the expression for g o and g f is available in many sources e g lin and yue 1990 equation 17b is used to solve for the unknown source strengths σ q t once source strengths σ q t are known equation 17a is then applied to determine the unknowns ϕ x t over the body surface once ϕ x t over body surface is determined pressure on the body can be found from the bernoulli equation and the hydrodynamic force and moment can be determined by integrating pressure over the body surface let p x t be the total dynamic pressure distribution including the hydrodynamic pressure due to disturbed potential ϕ x t and pressure due to incident wave potential ϕ i x t at any arbitrary point on the body then the total dynamic pressure on that point can be obtained from the equation 18 p x t ρ 0 ϕ x t t ϕ i x t t 1 2 ϕ ϕ i 2 in equation 18 ρ 0 is the density of the fluid equation 18 is the general form of the pressure equation for the zero speed problem the quadratic contribution can be ignored however for the linearized problem with forward speed in present earth fixed co ordinate system the quadratic contributions are included in the pressure equation for accounting the forward speed the detailed discussion on the same can be found in lin and yue 1990 therefore the dynamic force f s x t due to pressure p x t at any arbitrary section s x at any instant of time t can be obtained as 19 f s x t s x t p x t n d s x the dynamic force obtained from 19 along with hydrostatic force can be taken as an external force for the solution of the structural problem once the structural problem solved in the time domain the body boundary condition 14b will be updated accordingly to solve the boundary value problem the details of this coupling will be discussed in the following sections 2 3 numerical solution of the hydrodynamic problem a lower order panel method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problem in lower order panel method the velocity potential is assumed to be constant over a panel therefore it simplifies the nature of continuous variation of the velocity potential over the wetted surface in order to capture these phenomena more appropriately a higher order panel method proposed by kim et al 2009 2013 would be the better choice however one can always overcome this limitation by making panel size sufficiently small the discretized form of the body boundary condition 14b for the arbitrary panel i can be given as 20 ϕ n i v i n i ϕ n i in the above equation v i represents the velocity at the centroid of the i t h panel n i is the generalized normal vector to the i t h panel since the present formulation based on constant element boundary element implementation along with a trapezoidal rule for the convolution integral following steps have been followed i discretize s 0 by n planar quadrilateral and triangular panels ii assume σ to be constant over the panels and over the line segments with values same as at the centroid of the panels note that the source strength over the line segments becomes same as the source strength of the adjacent panel iii assume time step size δ t to be constant in carrying out the time integration and use a forward step euler method iv use trapezoidal rule for the convolution integration this reduces the integrals to a system of linear equations in terms of the discrete source strengths and potentials for example 17a reduces to 21a ϕ j 1 4 π j 1 n σ j δ s j g 0 p i t q j τ d s δ t m 0 m 1 ε m σ j δ s j g f p i t q j τ d s i 1 n 21b j 1 n σ j m δ s j n i g 0 p i t q j τ d s 4 π v p i t ϕ i p i t n i δ t m 0 m 1 ε m j 1 n σ j δ s j n i g f p i t q j τ d s i 1 n in similar fashion ϕ j m can be obtained from the following equation as 21c ϕ j m 1 4 π j 1 n σ j m δ s j g 0 p i t q j τ d s δ t m 0 m 1 ε m σ j m δ s j g f p i t q j τ d s i 1 n here m and m are indices for the current time t and retarded time τ t m δ t τ m δ t i and j are the indices for the field point p and source point q respectively ε 0 5 for m 0 and 1 for m 1 for integration of the memory part of the green function over the panels four point gauss quadrature rules are used while the rankine part is integrated using a combination of analytical formula and quadrature rules of variable order in order to achieve consistent level of accuracy over the entire computational domain for the self influencing panel the analytical formulation proposed by newman 1986 is adopted the detailed discussion on the numerical integration scheme is available in many literatures for example sen 2002 datta and sen 2007 and not repeated here once the distribution of unknown ϕ x t over the mean wetted surface is known dynamic pressure at the centroid of the panel can be found out through equation 18 finally the dynamic force acted at any arbitrary panel i can be obtained as 22 f i m t p i m n i d s i in the above expression f i m t is the dynamic force at panel i at m t h time step p i m is the pressure at the centroid of the panel i at m t h time step d s i is the area of i t h panel at t 0 in reality the panel area and the unit normal should be the function of time however by taking sufficiently small panels one can assume that the variation in the panel area is ignorable such simplification would not affect the final solution as δ d s i o ε 2 on the other hand the change in normal velocity is taken care in appropriate manner therefore in the present paper the panel normal for the deformed shape is stored at each time step to calculate the variation of the normal with time however under the assumptions of the linearity panels co ordinates are not updated 2 4 modelling of restoring force modelling of restoring force is not straightforward in comparison to the rigid body case a detailed discussion on modelling of restoring force and its effect on the hydroelastic solution is deeply studied by senjanović et al 2008b in their derivations modeshapes are taken explicitly the present formulation is based on finite element method where modeshapes are implicitly defined therefore in this paper an alternative solution proposed by kim et al 2009 is adopted here the restoring force at the i t h panel is written as 23 f i r e s t o r i n g t ρ 0 g z i δ n i d s i ρ 0 g δ z i n i d s i where z i are water head and δ denotes the leading order variation 2 5 coupling between bem and fem in time domain the structural and hydrodynamic problems are solved through the global finite element equation 10 and the boundary element equations 17 19 respectively the global finite element equation 10 has been solved using newmark s time integration method newmark 1959 according to the newmark s method nodal displacement vector d at any time instant t can be related to d at the previous time instant by the following equation 24 m α δ t 2 δ α δ t c k d t f t m 1 α δ t 2 d t δ t 1 α δ t d t δ t 1 2 α 1 d t δ t c δ α δ t d t δ t δ α 1 d t δ t δ t 2 δ α 2 d t δ t after calculating d the velocities and acceleration vectors can be calculated using the following equations 25 d t 1 α δ t 2 d t d t δ t 1 α δ t d t δ t 1 2 α 1 d t δ t 26 d t d t δ t δ t 1 δ d t δ t δ d t the parameters α and δ decide stability and accuracy of the method and describe the variation of acceleration over a time step the values of α and δ are generally taken as 1 4 and 1 2 kim et al 2013 and same values are taken in this work as well using the velocities obtained from equation 26 force can be calculated from equations 17 19 using this force with the help of equations 24 26 the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors can be obtained for the next time step in this way the time marching is continued solution of equation 10 gives unknown structural responses at each node of the finite element model however to solve equation 10 force per unit length f is required the external force f at different nodes is obtained by solving the hydrodynamic problem i e boundary element equations 17 19 on the other hand to get the hydrodynamic force structural velocity and displacement at each node are required which can only be obtained by solving equation 10 therefore a suitable coupling scheme is required for exchanging the variables between the finite element and boundary element equations an efficient algorithm is proposed in this paper for such coupling normally the hydrodynamic panel and finite element grids are different moreover the hydrodynamic loads are computed at panel centroid but structural velocity is calculated at sections therefore it is important to shift the panel force to sectional force and sectional velocity and displacement to panel velocity and displacement fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the positions of the panels and stations in a simplistic way it can be seen from fig 2 that panels are arranged in such a way that none of the panels are intersected by the section lines this simplification reduces the complexity of incorporating the hydrodynamic load into the structural analysis furthermore it is considered that the pressure velocity etc are linearly varying between two consecutive panels along the horizontal axis in view of that the vertical force per unit run f is calculated at the stations as follows 27a f 1 j 1 m p m j a p j n j 2 w p

width is given by w p x j p a n e l represents the longitudinal position of the j t h panel and s i denotes longitudinal location of i t h section respectively in fig 2 m represents the number of hydrodynamic panel within the respective range and n is the total number of structural grids after getting the sectional force using 27 a c newmark β method is applied in order to compute velocities at different nodes of the elements similarly the velocity at panel centroid v is calculated from the velocities at different nodes using equation 28a d 28a v i s t a t i o n d 2 k 1 f o r s i x 1 k e

1st and 2nd node of an element e once the velocity at each panel centroid is obtained the body boundary condition 14b is updated for the next time step and corresponding hydrodynamic pressure is estimated using bem thus the coupling between fem and bem is made 3 results and discussion three different types of barge and a containership are taken for the analysis to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method structural deflection shear force bending moment are calculated for the floating vessel without forward speed and compared with available experimental and numerical results the results obtained from the proposed method are referred as td the frequency is non dimensionalised by ω l g where ω is the incident wave frequency l is the length of the hull g is the acceleration due to gravity time is non dimensionalised by t t where t is the time period structural displacement at any section is non dimensionalised by x 3 a where x 3 is the magnitude of the displacement of that section and a denotes the wave amplitude the shear force and bending moment are non dimensionalised by v ρ g a l 2 and m ρ g a l 3 where v and m represents the amplitude of shear force and bending moment 3 1 analysis for barge type structure in the present paper three different barge models are taken for the analysis named as model i model ii and model iii the differences between these models lie in structural properties geometric dimensions etc the details of the same are discussed in the relevant sections 3 1 1 analysis of barge model i the panel model for the barge is shown in fig 3 and the principal particulars of the barge are also presented in table 1 in general the hydrodynamic grid is different from the structural grid and therefore convergence study is essential for both the grids for hydrodynamic analysis the barge is discretized by a different set of panels to obtain the optimum panel size the proper discretization of the hull is achieved through the convergence test fig 4 shows the deflection at mid ship of the barge for four different panel sizes at ω l g 2 5 which is essentially the case where wavelength to ship length ratio becomes approximately 1 0 from the figure it is seen that convergence is achieved around 448 panels for the solution of the hydrodynamic part also from fig 4 it may be observed that all four plots are very stable with time this indicates the efficiency and the robustness of the present time domain hydrodynamic code to obtain the optimum number of elements required for fea free vibration analysis is performed considering the ship as an equivalent euler bernoulli beam which is discretized with n n number of nodes the choice of the discretization is made through the convergence of the eigenfrequencies in table 2 the dry natural frequencies hz of the first four flexible vertical modes of the barge are presented and corresponding mode shapes are presented in fig 5 from table 2 it can be confirmed that the natural frequencies in case of the barge are converged at n n 100 also the variation in body normal i e δ n is plotted for a given time instance in fig 6 from the figure it can be seen that variation of the normal vector is not ignorable and thus proper modelling of hydrostatic force is extremely important to check the efficiency and the robustness of the present hydroelasticity code displacements of the barge at forward perpendicular fp mid ship and aft perpendicular ap is computed and presented in fig 7 for ω l g 2 5 the stability of the results indicates the efficiency and robustness of the present formulation from table 1 it may be noted that uniform mass distribution is taken for the model i which can be considered as the simplest situation the similar model and mass distribution are taken by farstad 1997 and kara 2015 however kara 2015 presented the results for different stiffness factors therefore to start with initial validation is done with the results reported in farstad 1997 then shear forces at a particular section are computed for different stiffness factors and compared with that of kara 2015 fig 8 shows the comparison of displacement raos response amplitude operators at mid ship farstad 1997 computed the displacement shear force bending moment considering the first eight flexible modes from the figure it can be observed that both results agreed very well although some small difference may be noticed at higher frequency range overall agreement is reasonably good the vertical bending moment transfer function at mid ship of the barge is plotted in fig 9 the result shows good assent with compared result similarly the shear force transfer function for the barge at x l 4 and x l 4 are computed and presented in fig 10 and fig 11 the comparison shows quite good agreement with farstad 1997 apart from some slight variation in some frequency range the overall agreement is excellent fig 12 a d shows the vertical shear force at x l 4 with varying stiffness factor and compared with the results of kara 2015 the stiffness factor s f in this paper is defined as e i ρ g l 5 from these figures also it can be noted that overall agreement is extremely good with kara 2015 results to check the influence of the flexibility in the hydrodynamic pressure dynamic pressure plot is given in case of rigid and flexible body in fig 13 at ω l g 2 5 the schematic representation of the corresponding wave profile is given in fig 14 from fig 13 it is clearly seen that due to flexibility the dynamic pressure changes significantly this difference comes due to the change of the body boundary condition 14 3 1 2 analysis of barge model ii the second set of results is computed for a rectangular barge where the distribution of the mass is non uniform the geometric details and mass distribution are taken from the work reported by senjanovic et al 2013 the principal characteristics of this barge are given in table 3 more detailed information about the structural arrangements is available in senjanovic et al 2013 in this case the vertical bending moment at mid ship and shear force at l 4 of mid ship is computed the transfer functions for vbm and sf is plotted in figs 15 and 16 for the heading angle β 150 and compared with reported numerical results in the figures senjanovic flex and senjanovic rigid refer the hydroelastic and rigid body results given by senjanović et al 2013 from the comparisons it can be noted that both the results agree excellently furthermore it is interesting to note that bending moment results for the rigid body case are showing the higher peak this trend indicates assuming the structure to be rigid could lead to overestimating the bending moment and shear force results however this may not be true when the ship is considerably large and vertical horizontal and torsional modes are considered altogether 3 1 3 comparison with experiment for a segmented barge model iii finally the structural deflection of the barge is validated with the experimental results reported by malenica et al 2003 the principal dimension of the barge is given in table 4 the details of the experimental model can be found out from malenica et al 2003 the hydrodynamic panel model for this barge is shown in fig 17 the experimental model consisting of 12 pontoons and were connected together with a steel rod however for predicting the hydroelastic response the gaps between the segmented pontoons are not considered in this case also the number of panels for hydrodynamic analysis and number of elements for finite element discretization has been considered by checking the convergence test for instance in table 5 dry natural frequencies for vertical vibration of the model are compared with that of senjanović et al 2008a and found satisfactory agreement between both the results in fig 18 the dry natural modes of vertical vibrations are presented for the first four natural frequencies fig 19 shows a comparison between the experimental and the computed results for displacement rao at the bow of the barge at a heading angle β 180 the comparison shows overall good agreement however there are some differences in mid frequency range it may be due to the difference in numerical modelling with the experimental one as the gaps between the segmented pontoons are not considered in the numerical model therefore because of that modification structural responses differ slightly from those of the experimental responses however from the overall pattern it can be confirmed that the present numerical scheme captures the response reasonably good with engineering accuracy therefore from the barge results figs 7 19 it can be concluded that the proposed methodology is capable of producing good results in case of simplistic hull shapes like a barge however it is required to validate the proposed method in case of realistic hulls also which has been done in the following sections 3 2 comparison between numerical and experimental flexible responses of containership the efficiency and robustness of the proposed work are verified for a large container ship see fig 20 the vertical displacement bending moment at mid ship is computed and compared with published experimental and numerical results the geometric model of the hull distribution of mass along the hull and experimental results are taken from rajendran and guedes soares 2016 the experimental model was divided into 8 segments and each segment was connected together with an aluminum backbone of variable structural characteristics along the hull however like barge model iii in this case also such connectivity is ignored fig 21 shows the three dimensional panel model of the containership the main particulars of the ship are given in table 6 the dry natural frequencies are calculated numerically for the containership for convergence table 7 shows first four dry natural frequencies of the undamped free vibration of the hull and corresponding dry modes are shown in fig 21 the vertical bending moment and the displacement at mid ship are computed and compared with the experimental and numerical results given by rajendran and guedes soares 2016 in the plots 22 and 23 rajendran exp and rajendran num denote the experimental and numerical results given by rajendran and guedes soares 2016 in fig 22 displacements rao at mid ship is plotted the overall good agreement is observed among all the results fig 23 shows vertical bending moment rao at mid ship section the figure shows the bending moment results computed by the present method agree excellently with the experiment therefore from figs 22 and 23 it can be concluded that the present method is capable of getting accurate results for the realistic ship hull as well fig 24 represents the dynamic pressure plot in case of the rigid and flexible body at the non dimensional frequency ω l g 2 5 the corresponding wave profile is as same as fig 14 though the difference is not very prominent in this case still some difference can be seen between the rigid and flexible case which indicates the effect of structural flexibilities into the hydrodynamic solution 4 conclusion and future scope in this paper a direct bem fem coupled method in time domain is developed for hydroelasticity analysis of floating bodies a 3d time domain panel method is used to solve the hydrodynamic problem structural deflection is computed in time domain using fem both the methods then coupled through body boundary condition in hydrodynamic solution a simple but effective algorithm is developed to exchange the variables between structural and hydrodynamic code to check the accuracy and implementation of the proposed scheme three different barge type structures and a large container ship are taken for the analysis structural deflection shear force and bending moment are calculated and compared with available published and experimental results it is seen that the present methodology compared very well with the published results also it may be noted that the present scheme is able to produce very steady time domain results which confirm the efficiency and robustness of the present methodology therefore one can conclude that the proposed coupled bem fem scheme is efficient robust and produce reasonably good results with engineering accuracy and could be a useful tool to assess the hydroelasticity effect on the structure while designing a vessel also from the results it is observed that structural flexibility affect the hydrodynamic pressure on the hull therefore the effect due to flexible nature of the structure must be considered when dynamic pressure load is estimated at design stage as a future scope the present methodology can be further extended to include torsional and horizontal bending certain non linearities such as frude krylov nonlinear hydrostatic into the hydroelasticity
