22100,maximizing the ship operational energy efficiency requires robust tools to monitor estimate and predict the ship s performance under dynamic sea environments knowledge of ships fuel consumption using an appropriate prediction algorithm prior to or during a voyage can be a very important tool in reducing ghg emissions from international shipping classical methods for power estimation are approximate procedures that lack the required sensitivity to track sea environmental effects on ship performance meanwhile artificial neural network ann as a computing system has proven its applicability in estimating its systems outputs it also has the ability to capture learn and adapt to the changes that may occur within the system s variables the proposed model has employed combined ann and multi regression mr techniques to estimate the ship s power and fuel consumption the proposed model has the ability to function in a real time environment and adapt to changes that may occur to the ship environment additionally the proposed model has been developed by processing intensive datasets rather than traditional noon reports that have been relied on in many previous studies finally the developed model was utilized to predict potential fuel saving in a just in time jit scenario for one of the ship s voyages keywords ship energy efficiency artificial neural network multiple regression analysis ship performance model ship power prediction just in time 1 introduction we are now in a new era where reduction and removal of green house gas ghg from international shipping is indispensable especially after paris agreement unfccc 2015 in addition imo s initial ghg strategy marine environmental protection committee 2018 accelerated the momentum of decarbonization efforts in the shipping industry since ghg removal from the operations of commercially sized merchant ships is extremely arduous with the today s technologies increasing ship performance through reduction of ships fuel consumption is accepted as the way forward in the short to foreseeable medium term ölçer 2018 therefore knowing ships fuel consumption through an appropriate prediction algorithm prior to or during a voyage can be a very important tool to serve for the main purpose of ghg reduction the estimation of ship performance in calm water has been the focus of many studies traditionally the still water resistance is estimated according to the classical method of holtrop mennen which is an approximate procedure that is widely used at the initial design stage of the ship holtrop and mennen 1982 nevertheless when a ship advances in a seaway she faces additional resistance caused by actual sea state condition the extra power is usually accounted for by a sea margin of the total engine power with a value of 15 that is frequently assumed insel et al 2018 the added resistance and ship motion in waves have been broadly studied through several approaches from experiments statistical numerical simulations using potential flow theory to the computational fluid dynamics cfd kim et al 2017 main challenge is that the classical mathematical models lack the required sensitivity and accuracy to capture and track real time environmental conditions surrounding ships in seaways additionally and for the purpose of maximizing the ship energy efficiency there is a need for models flexible and mature enough to capture the change of a ship s behaviour as a result of sea environment and to analyse its effect on the ship s performance which can then predict ship power consumption at varying voyage conditions artificial neural networks ann is a relatively new approach that has been originally derived from neurobiological science mechanism by mcculloch and pitts 1943 humans and other animals are able to process the information through their neural networks these networks are containing trillions of neurons nerve cells that exchanges brief electrical pulses called action potentials computer algorithms that mimic these biological structures are formally called ann ann could be defined as a group of interconnected neurons that progressively has learned from their environment data to obtain linear and nonlinear trends in complex data platforms it is reliable enough to predict for new situations containing noisy or even partial information neurons are the core computing units that perform local data processing inside a network these neurons form massively parallel networks whose function defined by the network structure i e how neurons organized and linked to each other the connection strengths between neurons and the processing performed at neurons currently ann perform a variety of tasks including prediction or function approximation pattern classification clustering and forecasting samarasinghe 2007 therefore employing ann to estimate the ship performance during its voyage may pave the road to more accurate real time fuel consumption models these models by the ann nature will have the ability of deep learning and hence improving its accuracy by data accumulation it will also have the ability to realize the relation between operational factors that affect the ship performance by adapting to any change that may occur to the ship operational profile then these prediction models if integrated with suitable optimization tools can support the ship s operator in maximizing their ship energy efficiency by making optimal operational decisions the research in this paper aims at developing a combined artificial neural network ann multi regression m r model that can predict ship fuel consumption in varying sea environment the paper structure is given as section 2 reviews the literature studies that employed ann and other methods in developing ship performance models while section 3 illustrates the proposed methodology section 4 explains the proposed model and presents training and validation results finally section 5 evaluates the developed model as a tool to predict a full voyage fuel consumption and to compare the obtained results with a s single ann model results and a tool to evaluate potential savings if just in time jit measure would be applied on a certain ship voyage finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 with further research recommendations 2 literature review for fuel consumption prediction the literature showed that only a few studies have employed non classical methodologies to estimate ship performance in a sea voyage recently and driven by the current vast interest in improving the ship s energy efficiency multiple studies have been introduced with remarkable interest in employing data driven models to predict ships performance in the complex sea environment some of these studies are reviewed below aiming to pin down the aforementioned research aim data driven models have recently contributed very well to the development of the models used to predict fuel consumption in numerous applications on top of these models many of them have employed ann to solve many complex problems that physical based models may fail to accommodate their complex environment kara togun and baysec 2010 developed an ann model to predict the torque and brake specific fuel consumption of a gasoline engine furthermore many studies have employed the same methodology to model similar complex problems for predicting engine s output wu and liu 2012 thakur et al 2018 domínguez sáez et al 2018 noor et al 2016 for ship power prediction leifsson et al 2008 used a grey box approach for the simulation of ocean vessels the studied combined conventional analysis models based on physical principles a white box model with a feedforward neural network a black box model the results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey box modelling approach both serial and parallel approaches can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white box model pedersen and larsen 2009 employed the ann methodology to predict a full scale propulsion power in their study they used onboard measurement noon report data and hindcast weather data the study also compared between different linear and non linear methods with the ann method and found that ann has a significantly better performance over other tested methods petersen et al 2012a deployed in their research a set high quality sensory data gathered from a ferry over two months by employing anns in both instant and predictive settings to predict main propulsion efficiency by using the same data they investigated and compared two black box modelling approaches of gaussian process gp and ann methods petersen et al 2012b the study showed that the performance of gp is a little less accurate than anns but gp is capable of quantifying the uncertainty of the model bal beşikçi arslan turan and ölçer 2016 employed ann to predict the ship fuel consumption as a method of developing a decision support tool the study counts on the ship s noon report data with seven input variables to their ann model the study concluded that ann can learn the relationship between input variables and ship fuel consumption accurately furthermore the study highlighted the ann s superior performance when compared to results derived by a m r model later the same year rudzki and tarelko 2016 developed a decision making system to support controllable pitch propeller ships operators in selecting the optimum commanded outputs commanded engine speed and pitch ratio they incorporated two ann functional models for estimating fuel consumption and speed in a multi objective optimization model based on the lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wang et al 2018 proposed a ship fuel consumption prediction model in their model they developed a regression algorithm to implement the variable selection for voyage parameters the proposed lasso based method proved to have more solid performance when compared to ann and gps models this may be because of the type of data utilized in the case study with low frequency data obtained from a fleet of containerships was utilized yuan and nian 2018 developed a gp metamodel to simply predict the ship fuel consumption for evaluating the effect of both operational and weather variables on the ship s energy efficiency the model takes into account 7 influencing factors including speed mean draft trim wind speed wind direction wave height and wave direction the data for these input factors and the fuel consumption were obtained from ais data ship onboard measurements and noon reports of an oil tanker the developed model was further validated by calculating the root mean square error rmse for training and for validation data coraddu et al 2017 investigated the problems of predicting the fuel consumption and of providing the best value for the trim of a vessel in real operations based on data measured by the onboard automation systems three alternative modelling strategies are compared white black and grey box models the study also concluded the superiority of the black box models which is built based on a series of historical observation over state of the art numerical or white box models which exploit the physical knowledge of the system in the task of predicting the fuel consumption of a naval propulsion plant gkerekos et al 2019 presented a comparative study of data driven m r algorithms for predicting ship main engine foc considering two different shipboard data acquisition strategies noon reports and automated data logging monitoring adlm systems these algorithms including support vector machines svms random forest regressors rfrs extra trees regressors etrs and artificial neural networks anns the study concludes that adlm systems can enhance modelling r 2 by 5 7 compared to noon reports etr and rfr models were found to perform best in both cases however these models should only be preferred in cases where no extrapolation is required from the above it can be concluded that modelling of ships fuel consumption has been studied with a multiple of different approaches selecting the proper algorithm mainly depends on the nature of the investigated problem whether it is related to the ship s systems sub systems the ship overall performance or fleet performance also data quality frequency and intensity all play a vital role in selecting the optimum methodology anns by nature is susceptible to the training dataset quality to identify the correlation between its input and output variables some of the ann training dataset used in the above mentioned studies were based on noon reports that were logged in by the ship s crew twice per 24 h intervals such a log data only reflects a time capture or mean values of the ship s parameters and doesn t describe the ship s real operational behaviour although an excellent attempt an automatic data acquisition system which indicates the ship s operational changes during its voyage may prove to be a better alternative 3 methodology 3 1 artificial neural network the ann applications had grown gradually from the modelling of simple processing elements or neurons to massively parallel neural networks which led to more sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning applications ann has proven its applicability in many fields to forecast its systems outputs especially systems with many nonlinear relationships involved between its elements ann s research has been employed in various fields such as quantum chemistry medical diagnosis data mining e mail spam filtration face identification gaming financial business and other machine learning applications these models have facilitated to solve many problems that couldn t be solved with traditional methods the ann ability to model the nonlinear processes allowed its implementation to wide range of diverse applications kim et al 2017 ann is a computing system that consists of highly connected neurons these neurons process the information operate in parallel and are connected in a network shape through their weights w ann can learn by acquiring the knowledge of the data in the process which is then reflected on the weight values to capture the essential features of the problem and minimize the error fig 1 shows an ann structure with n input variables x n each neuron receives inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 x n attached with a weight w ij which indicates the connection strength for a particular input for each connection then it multiplies every input by its corresponding weight of the neuron connection a bias b i can be defined as a type of connection weight with a constant nonzero value added to the summation of inputs and corresponding weights bal beşikçi et al 2016 samarasinghe 2007 bhaya 2016 the neuron s network inside activity u i can be expressed as follows eqn 1 u i j 1 n w ij x j b i where w i j is the weight value of the i layer x j is the input value of the j layer and n is the number of the neurons then the neuron output will be processed through a nonlinear activation function φ to obtain the output y i i e the output y i can be mathematically expressed as follows eqn 2 y i φ u i φ j 1 n w ij x j b i the neurons activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs and it could take different shapes as shown in fig 2 samarasinghe 2007 bhaya 2016 3 1 1 feedforward neural networks the ann structure differs according to the nature of the problem to be solved a simple problem may require a simple single layer feed forward network with only one layer of neurons as shown in fig 1 for more complicated problems that require a significant number of neurons to solve and a complex nonlinear relation between its multiple inputs a multilayer feedforward neural network seems more suitable to obtain more accurate results schmidhuber 2015 each layer can apply a different activation function to the previous layer to produce a linear transformation output followed by a squashing nonlinearity such complex calculations smoothed by nonlinearity in hidden neurons whose features are controlled by the network weights fig 3 shows the most commonly used ann structure the network has three layers called the input layer hidden layer and output layer each layer consists of one or more neuron the lines between the nodes indicate the information flow from one neuron to the next in this type of network the information flows from the input to the output other types of neural networks may have more complicated connections with feedback paths the variables x 1 are representing the input nodes and they are passive which means that they do not modify their values while hidden layer nodes are active the values entering a hidden node are then multiplied by weights a set of predetermined numbers stored in the program the weighted inputs are then added to produce a single number the first layer weights w 1 could be expressed as follows eqn 3 w 1 w 1 11 w 1 21 w 1 n 1 w 1 12 w 1 22 w 1 n 2 w 1 1 m w 1 2 m w 1 nm before leaving the node this single number has to pass through the first layer bias b 1 and the nonlinear function the variables x 2 represent the outputs from the hidden layer just as before each of these values x 2 1 to x 2 m are multiplied by weights and bias then are applied to the next layer the active nodes of the output layer combine and modify the data to produce the two output values of this network x 3 1 and x 3 k similarly to eqn 3 the second layer weights w2 could be expressed as follows eqn 4 w 2 w 2 11 w 2 21 w 2 m 1 w 2 12 w 2 22 w 2 1 k w 2 2 k w 2 mk neural networks can have any number of layers and any number of nodes per layer most applications use the three layer structure with a maximum of a few hundred input nodes 3 1 2 ann training and back propagation algorithm the weights values needed for a neural network to perform a particular task can be obtained by a learning algorithm the term learning is widely used in the neural network field to explain the process however a more precise description might be determining an optimized set of weights based on the statistics of the dataset smith 1997 the most commonly used training algorithm for the multilayer perceptron is a back propagation bp algorithm multilayer ann trained with bp usually is chosen because of its proven ability to model any function bhaya 2016 the algorithm proceeds by iterations through multiple epochs epoch can be referred to as a completed iteration of the training procedure with each epoch the training results are submitted to the network and predicted targets are compared with actual values and the error is then calculated both the error and error surface gradient are used to optimize the weights values and hence the training repeated and error minimized the initial ann weight values are random and the training stops when epochs lapse or when the error stops improving the back propagation algorithm has become the most popular one for training the multilayer perceptron it is compositionally very efficient samarasinghe 2007 basheer and hajmeer 2000 3 2 multiple regression analysis m r methods the regression analyses as pearson first used it as a term in 1908 aims to analyse the correlation between several independent or predictor variables multiple regression disciplines are widely used in scientific research in this study only polynomial regression methods are described as it has been employed to develop the m r model polynomial regression analysis method the polynomial method is a regression analysis method that suits a nonlinear relation between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y the model formed by multiple degree polynomials in x the resulted function could be expressed by the following equation eqn 6 y f x β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n additionally polynomial regression as a statistical evaluation problem is linear as the regression function is linear in the unknown parameters e g x 1 x 2 x 3 x n in eqn 6 that calculated from the data which explains why polynomial regression is considered a special case of m r analysis hill t lewicki 2007 4 case study 4 1 dataset the design of the ann model in this study has started in farag 2017 as a requirement for master degree thesis the model was highly related to the attained data set from napa gathered during a visit to their headquarter in helsinki finland the case study dataset belongs to a double hulled vlcc built at the end of 2011 the dataset contains information about two sea voyages at a certain loading condition more details of the ship particulars shown in table 1 the raw dataset was thoroughly studied and analysed to understand the relations between data variables the obtained data were extracted from the ship s automatic continuous monitoring system acms the automatic identification system ais and weather hindcast information the given voyage dataset consists of ship s speed brake power and instant fuel consumption at each sampling point at certain time intervals it additionally contains route and weather hindcast related information such as water depth wind wave swell and current absolute values table 2 and fig 4 reviews both voyages general information it is worth mentioning that both voyages had the same loading condition i e the same dwt mean draft and trim such limitation constraint the use of ship s draught and trim despite their importance in the proposed model framework the second voyage dataset utilized in training the ann and m r models mainly because it has a larger data which should allow deeper learning of the ann model dataset analysis a correlation analysis has been carried out on the acquired dataset to understand the interrelation between dataset elements furthermore more analysis was conducted to comprehend the effect of the voyage variables especially the effect of the sea state on the ship s performance many relations have been concluded and can be checked in details in the mentioned study farag 2017 the authors decision to use ann for the purpose of this research may be attributed to the following the complexity involved in evaluating ship performance at varying sea conditions the nature and quality of obtained data and the ability of ann to establish algebraic and differential equations for complex phenomena additionally it was the authors intent to put to test the mentioned methodology in solving similar problems beside and based on correlation analysis as shown in fig 5 it has been chosen to derive the engine s functional dependency of b p on b s f c by a multiple regression model mr due to high correlation factor of 0 9966 between them 4 2 performance model structure ann models are by nature susceptible to the training dataset quality to accurately identify correlation between input variables and the output therefore the obtained intensive dataset employed in this study may satisfy the former argument also it will provide an opportunity to validate the ann model with an entirely independent voyage dataset that was not used for training the model such a validation should increase the confidence level of the employed methodology the ann model in this study mainly aims to be able to predict the required brake power bp at different seaway conditions as discussed before ann can take several structures based on dataset complexity and the level of accuracy aimed from the model fig 6 illustrates the general framework for performance prediction model utilized in this study many trails have been examined with various ann structures to reduce the number of inputs however the best results were obtained with the proposed ann structure the ann doesn t only link each input with the output but it also connects each input neuron with the network other inputs thus for a certain input it may have a small correlation value with the output b p though any change in that value it may hugely influence other input neuron which is highly correlated with the ann output for example swell direction has only 0 01 correlation value with the b p still its highly correlated with wave direction 0 65 which is relatively in high correlation with b p 0 39 such complexity in the ann s neurons interconnection signifies its ability to analyse non linear relationships that physical methods may not be able to solve and emphasis its ability to approximate a more accurate solution generally the neural network does not need to be complex to provide better performance more nodes and layers decreased performance in many cases a single hidden layer model is good enough for the regression problems in this study with regards to estimating how many neurons should be added to the hidden layer the best results achieved by model validation through one hidden layer with 16 neurons as illustrated in fig 7 the ann model input variables include 11 variables as ship s speed seawater depth apparent wind speed on ship s direction which is highly correlated to the ship heading angle wave parameters three inputs swell parameters three inputs sea current two parameters the designed ann is a feed forward backpropagation type network and the training functions can update weight and bias values according to levenberg marquardt optimization fig 7 shows the ann equipped with transfer functions for the first and second layers of logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions respectively the ann input variables were normalized to be within the range of 0 1 mathworks 2015 4 3 ann model validation the cross validation method was used to build the proposed model with a division of the dataset to 70 for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing the validation set is used to measure network generalization and to halt training when generalization stops improving while the testing set does not affect training and so provide an independent measure of network performance during and after training the model has been trained by the second voyage dataset 2562 sample points the ann model performance was assessed by the regression analysis and the mean squared error mse of the results the ann model trained for 556 iterations with the best achieved validation performance at epoch 456 with an mse value of 8 97e 6 and overall r square value of 0 99 as shown in fig 8 the blue line represents the training data mse the green line for the validation data mse while the red line represents the test data mse against the epochs count number 4 4 multiple regression m r model for brake specific fuel consumption b s f c function the best fitting function of the b s f c was achieved with the polynomial function to the power seven as following eqn 8 s f c f x β 0 β 1 x β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 5 β 6 x 6 β 7 x 7 where β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 β 7 186 3 1 929 0 2785 0 1988 0 04687 0 03975 0 0026 0 0021 the selected function was then validated with the first voyage dataset to predict the b s f c values corresponding to b p values the validation results are summarized in table 3 from the previous results the b s f c estimation showed high accuracy with an average error of 0 06 g kw hr when tested against the first voyage s 1142 sampling points such results prove that the developed b s f c s m r model can be count on to be integrated with the b p s ann model to jointly form the proposed performance model 5 model evaluation in this section the developed performance model has been evaluated in two case studies first as a voyage performance prediction tool to estimate the ship fuel consumption for the first voyage then the proposed model was utilized to predict potential fuel saving in a just in time jit scenario for the ship s second voyage 5 1 as a voyage prediction tool the first voyage input values have been fed to the model to evaluate its precision in predicting the b p and b s f c at varying sea conditions the power prediction results showed high accuracy with an r square value of 0 9842 and as illustrated in fig 9 in fig 10 b p predictions were plotted against its error values the results showed an overall accurate performance however error variation red colour along the sampling points fluctuated and showed high values at some sampling points ranges this can be justified that the ann model has been trained by the variables of the second voyage dataset only and as discussed before it is essential for the ann to train itself with sufficient wide spectrum of dataset variables if the test dataset contains a different pattern that the ann has not been trained by then the error values increases the error values can be considerably minimized if more data were available for model training then the predicted b p values as extracted by the ann model are simultaneously fed to the m r model to obtain the estimated b s f c values for each corresponding power the results showed consistently high accuracy with r square values of 0 981 as shown in fig 11 the performance prediction results of the proposed ann mr model shows a high total fuel consumption precision with 99 6 accuracy for the overall voyage estimation detailed results are summarized in table 4 to demonstrate the performance of the proposed combined ann mr based fuel consumption prediction model we compared it with a single ann based model according to the evaluation criteria presented in this section the proposed ann m r model outperformed the single ann based model for predicting both b p b s f c and general voyage estimation as illustrated in table 4 additionally fig 12 shows that the prediction results of the ann based model are not able to fit accurately the real values with the same test set if compared with the proposed model 5 2 to assess just in time jit measure if applied 5 2 1 just in time jit voyage optimization could be defined as the optimization of the ship operation that the shipmaster can achieve within the constraints imposed by logistics scheduling contractual arrangements and other limitations it includes measures such as just in time arrival jit weather routing trim and ballast optimization the potential co2 emissions savings if these measures are applied is up to 10 american bureau of shipping 2014 buhaug et al 2009 the anchorage and drifting time of the average operation mode of a capesize bulk carrier represents about 15 of the average operation mode according to et al 2014 the potential savings are directly related to the ship s type its operational profile and the ship contractual nature which could cause split incentives between different contract jia et al 2017 had estimated in their study the impact of a virtual arrival policy for vlcc tankers in global trade the study claims that if only 50 of the estimated waiting time could be avoided the consequential slow down in average sailing speeds leads to an average reduction of 422 tonnes of co2 and 6 7 tonnes of sox emissions per single voyage 5 2 2 jit scenario the validated performance model has been used to assess the potential savings of jit arrival measure if applied in the second voyage on that voyage the ship had drifted for one day waiting for berthing instructions from rotterdam port authorities the scenario has been built based on the assumption that the ship s operators have been given the latest actual eta berthing time instructions before commencing the voyage from sidi kerir the new voyage plan was designed with a new average speed to arrive in time to rotterdam the scenario also considered the same route positions lat long through the same weather conditions just to be able to employ original dataset the new ship speed is estimated with the navigational considerations of slowing down at restricted seaways as shown in fig 13 the model has predicted that with the new voyage mean speed of 10 57 knots to arrive at the correct eta where the ship would proceed immediately to berth without drifting 24 24 of heavy fuel oil and 328 5 ton of c o 2 emissions could be saved as detailed in table 5 the results have shown high consistency level with the potential energy saving of slow steaming as found in the literature buhaug et al 2009 6 conclusion the proposed model has employed an appropriate combination of ann and m r methodologies to estimate the ship s power and b s f c under varying sea conditions to the best of the authors knowledge highly frequent data was used one of the first times to model and predict the ship s performance such a dataset has been used to train the ann model and to accumulate its knowledge about the ship s behaviour in different operational scenarios total performance model results confirm the merit of using the proposed model in evaluating the ship performance during varying sea environments the results also showed the importance of ann training data quality in obtaining accurate results in this study only two datasets were readily available at the time of this study however the authors are strongly confident that better results could have been achieved with the exploitation of more variant data although it was demonstrated in one ship the developed framework along with the associated model may be applied to any other ship type upon appropriate modification and tailoring the proposed model can also play a vital role in developing decision support systems dss for ships operators to maximize the ship energy efficiency such systems can achieve cost free savings if correctly used in voyage planning it can also advise the ship s operator during a sea voyage with the optimum operational parameters such as ship s speed heading and optimum trim to achieve an optimum energy efficient voyage future research may additionally include integrating the developed model into a real time decision support system dss that aims to maximize the ship s energy efficiency during sea voyages by weather routing furthermore in addition to ann other non classical mathematical methods of relevance may be considered in

environment kara togun and baysec 2010 developed an ann model to predict the torque and brake specific fuel consumption of a gasoline engine furthermore many studies have employed the same methodology to model similar complex problems for predicting engine s output wu and liu 2012 thakur et al 2018 domínguez sáez et al 2018 noor et al 2016 for ship power prediction leifsson et al 2008 used a grey box approach for the simulation of ocean vessels the studied combined conventional analysis models based on physical principles a white box model with a feedforward neural network a black box model the results of simulating several trips of a medium sized container vessel show that the grey box modelling approach both serial and parallel approaches can improve the prediction of the vessel fuel consumption significantly compared to a white box model pedersen and larsen 2009 employed the ann methodology to predict a full scale propulsion power in their study they used onboard measurement noon report data and hindcast weather data the study also compared between different linear and non linear methods with the ann method and found that ann has a significantly better performance over other tested methods petersen et al 2012a deployed in their research a set high quality sensory data gathered from a ferry over two months by employing anns in both instant and predictive settings to predict main propulsion efficiency by using the same data they investigated and compared two black box modelling approaches of gaussian process gp and ann methods petersen et al 2012b the study showed that the performance of gp is a little less accurate than anns but gp is capable of quantifying the uncertainty of the model bal beşikçi arslan turan and ölçer 2016 employed ann to predict the ship fuel consumption as a method of developing a decision support tool the study counts on the ship s noon report data with seven input variables to their ann model the study concluded that ann can learn the relationship between input variables and ship fuel consumption accurately furthermore the study highlighted the ann s superior performance when compared to results derived by a m r model later the same year rudzki and tarelko 2016 developed a decision making system to support controllable pitch propeller ships operators in selecting the optimum commanded outputs commanded engine speed and pitch ratio they incorporated two ann functional models for estimating fuel consumption and speed in a multi objective optimization model based on the lasso least absolute shrinkage and selection operator wang et al 2018 proposed a ship fuel consumption prediction model in their model they developed a regression algorithm to implement the variable selection for voyage parameters the proposed lasso based method proved to have more solid performance when compared to ann and gps models this may be because of the type of data utilized in the case study with low frequency data obtained from a fleet of containerships was utilized yuan and nian 2018 developed a gp metamodel to simply predict the ship fuel consumption for evaluating the effect of both operational and weather variables on the ship s energy efficiency the model takes into account 7 influencing factors including speed mean draft trim wind speed wind direction wave height and wave direction the data for these input factors and the fuel consumption were obtained from ais data ship onboard measurements and noon reports of an oil tanker the developed model was further validated by calculating the root mean square error rmse for training and for validation data coraddu et al 2017 investigated the problems of predicting the fuel consumption and of providing the best value for the trim of a vessel in real operations based on data measured by the onboard automation systems three alternative modelling strategies are compared white black and grey box models the study also concluded the superiority of the black box models which is built based on a series of historical observation over state of the art numerical or white box models which exploit the physical knowledge of the system in the task of predicting the fuel consumption of a naval propulsion plant gkerekos et al 2019 presented a comparative study of data driven m r algorithms for predicting ship main engine foc considering two different shipboard data acquisition strategies noon reports and automated data logging monitoring adlm systems these algorithms including support vector machines svms random forest regressors rfrs extra trees regressors etrs and artificial neural networks anns the study concludes that adlm systems can enhance modelling r 2 by 5 7 compared to noon reports etr and rfr models were found to perform best in both cases however these models should only be preferred in cases where no extrapolation is required from the above it can be concluded that modelling of ships fuel consumption has been studied with a multiple of different approaches selecting the proper algorithm mainly depends on the nature of the investigated problem whether it is related to the ship s systems sub systems the ship overall performance or fleet performance also data quality frequency and intensity all play a vital role in selecting the optimum methodology anns by nature is susceptible to the training dataset quality to identify the correlation between its input and output variables some of the ann training dataset used in the above mentioned studies were based on noon reports that were logged in by the ship s crew twice per 24 h intervals such a log data only reflects a time capture or mean values of the ship s parameters and doesn t describe the ship s real operational behaviour although an excellent attempt an automatic data acquisition system which indicates the ship s operational changes during its voyage may prove to be a better alternative 3 methodology 3 1 artificial neural network the ann applications had grown gradually from the modelling of simple processing elements or neurons to massively parallel neural networks which led to more sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning applications ann has proven its applicability in many fields to forecast its systems outputs especially systems with many nonlinear relationships involved between its elements ann s research has been employed in various fields such as quantum chemistry medical diagnosis data mining e mail spam filtration face identification gaming financial business and other machine learning applications these models have facilitated to solve many problems that couldn t be solved with traditional methods the ann ability to model the nonlinear processes allowed its implementation to wide range of diverse applications kim et al 2017 ann is a computing system that consists of highly connected neurons these neurons process the information operate in parallel and are connected in a network shape through their weights w ann can learn by acquiring the knowledge of the data in the process which is then reflected on the weight values to capture the essential features of the problem and minimize the error fig 1 shows an ann structure with n input variables x n each neuron receives inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 x n attached with a weight w ij which indicates the connection strength for a particular input for each connection then it multiplies every input by its corresponding weight of the neuron connection a bias b i can be defined as a type of connection weight with a constant nonzero value added to the summation of inputs and corresponding weights bal beşikçi et al 2016 samarasinghe 2007 bhaya 2016 the neuron s network inside activity u i can be expressed as follows eqn 1 u i j 1 n w ij x j b i where w i j is the weight value of the i layer x j is the input value of the j layer and n is the number of the neurons then the neuron output will be processed through a nonlinear activation function φ to obtain the output y i i e the output y i can be mathematically expressed as follows eqn 2 y i φ u i φ j 1 n w ij x j b i the neurons activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs and it could take different shapes as shown in fig 2 samarasinghe 2007 bhaya 2016 3 1 1 feedforward neural networks the ann structure differs according to the nature of the problem to be solved a simple problem may require a simple single layer feed forward network with only one layer of neurons as shown in fig 1 for more complicated problems that require a significant number of neurons to solve and a complex nonlinear relation between its multiple inputs a multilayer feedforward neural network seems more suitable to obtain more accurate results schmidhuber 2015 each layer can apply a different activation function to the previous layer to produce a linear transformation output followed by a squashing nonlinearity such complex calculations smoothed by nonlinearity in hidden neurons whose features are controlled by the network weights fig 3 shows the most commonly used ann structure the network has three layers called the input layer hidden layer and output layer each layer consists of one or more neuron the lines between the nodes indicate the information flow from one neuron to the next in this type of network the information flows from the input to the output other types of neural networks may have more complicated connections with feedback paths the variables x 1 are representing the input nodes and they are passive which means that they do not modify their values while hidden layer nodes are active the values entering a hidden node are then multiplied by weights a set of predetermined numbers stored in the program the weighted inputs are then added to produce a single number the first layer weights w 1 could be expressed as follows eqn 3 w 1 w 1 11 w 1 21 w 1 n 1 w 1 12 w 1 22 w 1 n 2 w 1 1 m w 1 2 m w 1 nm before leaving the node this single number has to pass through the first layer bias b 1 and the nonlinear function the variables x 2 represent the outputs from the hidden layer just as before each of these values x 2 1 to x 2 m are multiplied by weights and bias then are applied to the next layer the active nodes of the output layer combine and modify the data to produce the two output values of this network x 3 1 and x 3 k similarly to eqn 3 the second layer weights w2 could be expressed as follows eqn 4 w 2 w 2 11 w 2 21 w 2 m 1 w 2 12 w 2 22 w 2 1 k w 2 2 k w 2 mk neural networks can have any number of layers and any number of nodes per layer most applications use the three layer structure with a maximum of a few hundred input nodes 3 1 2 ann training and back propagation algorithm the weights values needed for a neural network to perform a particular task can be obtained by a learning algorithm the term learning is widely used in the neural network field to explain the process however a more precise description might be determining an optimized set of weights based on the statistics of the dataset smith 1997 the most commonly used training algorithm for the multilayer perceptron is a back propagation bp algorithm multilayer ann trained with bp usually is chosen because of its proven ability to model any function bhaya 2016 the algorithm proceeds by iterations through multiple epochs epoch can be referred to as a completed iteration of the training procedure with each epoch the training results are submitted to the network and predicted targets are compared with actual values and the error is then calculated both the error and error surface gradient are used to optimize the weights values and hence the training repeated and error minimized the initial ann weight values are random and the training stops when epochs lapse or when the error stops improving the back propagation algorithm has become the most popular one for training the multilayer perceptron it is compositionally very efficient samarasinghe 2007 basheer and hajmeer 2000 3 2 multiple regression analysis m r methods the regression analyses as pearson first used it as a term in 1908 aims to analyse the correlation between several independent or predictor variables multiple regression disciplines are widely used in scientific research in this study only polynomial regression methods are described as it has been employed to develop the m r model polynomial regression analysis method the polynomial method is a regression analysis method that suits a nonlinear relation between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y the model formed by multiple degree polynomials in x the resulted function could be expressed by the following equation eqn 6 y f x β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n additionally polynomial regression as a statistical evaluation problem is linear as the regression function is linear in the unknown parameters e g x 1 x 2 x 3 x n in eqn 6 that calculated from the data which explains why polynomial regression is considered a special case of m r analysis hill t lewicki 2007 4 case study 4 1 dataset the design of the ann model in this study has started in farag 2017 as a requirement for master degree thesis the model was highly related to the attained data set from napa gathered during a visit to their headquarter in helsinki finland the case study dataset belongs to a double hulled vlcc built at the end of 2011 the dataset contains information about two sea voyages at a certain loading condition more details of the ship particulars shown in table 1 the raw dataset was thoroughly studied and analysed to understand the relations between data variables the obtained data were extracted from the ship s automatic continuous monitoring system acms the automatic identification system ais and weather hindcast information the given voyage dataset consists of ship s speed brake power and instant fuel consumption at each sampling point at certain time intervals it additionally contains route and weather hindcast related information such as water depth wind wave swell and current absolute values table 2 and fig 4 reviews both voyages general information it is worth mentioning that both voyages had the same loading condition i e the same dwt mean draft and trim such limitation constraint the use of ship s draught and trim despite their importance in the proposed model framework the second voyage dataset utilized in training the ann and m r models mainly because it has a larger data which should allow deeper learning of the ann model dataset analysis a correlation analysis has been carried out on the acquired dataset to understand the interrelation between dataset elements furthermore more analysis was conducted to comprehend the effect of the voyage variables especially the effect of the sea state on the ship s performance many relations have been concluded and can be checked in details in the mentioned study farag 2017 the authors decision to use ann for the purpose of this research may be attributed to the following the complexity involved in evaluating ship performance at varying sea conditions the nature and quality of obtained data and the ability of ann to establish algebraic and differential equations for complex phenomena additionally it was the authors intent to put to test the mentioned methodology in solving similar problems beside and based on correlation analysis as shown in fig 5 it has been chosen to derive the engine s functional dependency of b p on b s f c by a multiple regression model mr due to high correlation factor of 0 9966 between them 4 2 performance model structure ann models are by nature susceptible to the training dataset quality to accurately identify correlation between input variables and the output therefore the obtained intensive dataset employed in this study may satisfy the former argument also it will provide an opportunity to validate the ann model with an entirely independent voyage dataset that was not used for training the model such a validation should increase the confidence level of the employed methodology the ann model in this study mainly aims to be able to predict the required brake power bp at different seaway conditions as discussed before ann can take several structures based on dataset complexity and the level of accuracy aimed from the model fig 6 illustrates the general framework for performance prediction model utilized in this study many trails have been examined with various ann structures to reduce the number of inputs however the best results were obtained with the proposed ann structure the ann doesn t only link each input with the output but it also connects each input neuron with the network other inputs thus for a certain input it may have a small correlation value with the output b p though any change in that value it may hugely influence other input neuron which is highly correlated with the ann output for example swell direction has only 0 01 correlation value with the b p still its highly correlated with wave direction 0 65 which is relatively in high correlation with b p 0 39 such complexity in the ann s neurons interconnection signifies its ability to analyse non linear relationships that physical methods may not be able to solve and emphasis its ability to approximate a more accurate solution generally the neural network does not need to be complex to provide better performance more nodes and layers decreased performance in many cases a single hidden layer model is good enough for the regression problems in this study with regards to estimating how many neurons should be added to the hidden layer the best results achieved by model validation through one hidden layer with 16 neurons as illustrated in fig 7 the ann model input variables include 11 variables as ship s speed seawater depth apparent wind speed on ship s direction which is highly correlated to the ship heading angle wave parameters three inputs swell parameters three inputs sea current two parameters the designed ann is a feed forward backpropagation type network and the training functions can update weight and bias values according to levenberg marquardt optimization fig 7 shows the ann equipped with transfer functions for the first and second layers of logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions respectively the ann input variables were normalized to be within the range of 0 1 mathworks 2015 4 3 ann model validation the cross validation method was used to build the proposed model with a division of the dataset to 70 for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing the validation set is used to measure network generalization and to halt training when generalization stops improving while the testing set does not affect training and so provide an independent measure of network performance during and after training the model has been trained by the second voyage dataset 2562 sample points the ann model performance was assessed by the regression analysis and the mean squared error mse of the results the ann model trained for 556 iterations with the best achieved validation performance at epoch 456 with an mse value of 8 97e 6 and overall r square value of 0 99 as shown in fig 8 the blue line represents the training data mse the green line for the validation data mse while the red line represents the test data mse against the epochs count number 4 4 multiple regression m r model for brake specific fuel consumption b s f c function the best fitting function of the b s f c was achieved with the polynomial function to the power seven as following eqn 8 s f c f x β 0 β 1 x β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 β 5 x 5 β 6 x 6 β 7 x 7 where β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 β 4 β 5 β 6 β 7 186 3 1 929 0 2785 0 1988 0 04687 0 03975 0 0026 0 0021 the selected function was then validated with the first voyage dataset to predict the b s f c values corresponding to b p values the validation results are summarized in table 3 from the previous results the b s f c estimation showed high accuracy with an average error of 0 06 g kw hr when tested against the first voyage s 1142 sampling points such results prove that the developed b s f c s m r model can be count on to be integrated with the b p s ann model to jointly form the proposed performance model 5 model evaluation in this section the developed performance model has been evaluated in two case studies first as a voyage performance prediction tool to estimate the ship fuel consumption for the first voyage then the proposed model was utilized to predict potential fuel saving in a just in time jit scenario for the ship s second voyage 5 1 as a voyage prediction tool the first voyage input values have been fed to the model to evaluate its precision in predicting the b p and b s f c at varying sea conditions the power prediction results showed high accuracy with an r square value of 0 9842 and as illustrated in fig 9 in fig 10 b p predictions were plotted against its error values the results showed an overall accurate performance however error variation red colour along the sampling points fluctuated and showed high values at some sampling points ranges this can be justified that the ann model has been trained by the variables of the second voyage dataset only and as discussed before it is essential for the ann to train itself with sufficient wide spectrum of dataset variables if the test dataset contains a different pattern that the ann has not been trained by then the error values increases the error values can be considerably minimized if more data were available for model training then the predicted b p values as extracted by the ann model are simultaneously fed to the m r model to obtain the estimated b s f c values for each corresponding power the results showed consistently high accuracy with r square values of 0 981 as shown in fig 11 the performance prediction results of the proposed ann mr model shows a high total fuel consumption precision with 99 6 accuracy for the overall voyage estimation detailed results are summarized in table 4 to demonstrate the performance of the proposed combined ann mr based fuel consumption prediction model we compared it with a single ann based model according to the evaluation criteria presented in this section the proposed ann m r model outperformed the single ann based model for predicting both b p b s f c and general voyage estimation as illustrated in table 4 additionally fig 12 shows that the prediction results of the ann based model are not able to fit accurately the real values with the same test set if compared with the proposed model 5 2 to assess just in time jit measure if applied 5 2 1 just in time jit voyage optimization could be defined as the optimization of the ship operation that the shipmaster can achieve within the constraints imposed by logistics scheduling contractual arrangements and other limitations it includes measures such as just in time arrival jit weather routing trim and ballast optimization the potential co2 emissions savings if these measures are applied is up to 10 american bureau of shipping 2014 buhaug et al 2009 the anchorage and drifting time of the average operation mode of a capesize bulk carrier represents about 15 of the average operation mode according to et al 2014 the potential savings are directly related to the ship s type its operational profile and the ship contractual nature which could cause split incentives between different contract jia et al 2017 had estimated in their study the impact of a virtual arrival policy for vlcc tankers in global trade the study claims that if only 50 of the estimated waiting time could be avoided the consequential slow down in average sailing speeds leads to an average reduction of 422 tonnes of co2 and 6 7 tonnes of sox emissions per single voyage 5 2 2 jit scenario the validated performance model has been used to assess the potential savings of jit arrival measure if applied in the second voyage on that voyage the ship had drifted for one day waiting for berthing instructions from rotterdam port authorities the scenario has been built based on the assumption that the ship s operators have been given the latest actual eta berthing time instructions before commencing the voyage from sidi kerir the new voyage plan was designed with a new average speed to arrive in time to rotterdam the scenario also considered the same route positions lat long through the same weather conditions just to be able to employ original dataset the new ship speed is estimated with the navigational considerations of slowing down at restricted seaways as shown in fig 13 the model has predicted that with the new voyage mean speed of 10 57 knots to arrive at the correct eta where the ship would proceed immediately to berth without drifting 24 24 of heavy fuel oil and 328 5 ton of c o 2 emissions could be saved as detailed in table 5 the results have shown high consistency level with the potential energy saving of slow steaming as found in the literature buhaug et al 2009 6 conclusion the proposed model has employed an appropriate combination of ann and m r methodologies to estimate the ship s power and b s f c under varying sea conditions to the best of the authors knowledge highly frequent data was used one of the first times to model and predict the ship s performance such a dataset has been used to train the ann model and to accumulate its knowledge about the ship s behaviour in different operational scenarios total performance model results confirm the merit of using the proposed model in evaluating the ship performance during varying sea environments the results also showed the importance of ann training data quality in obtaining accurate results in this study only two datasets were readily available at the time of this study however the authors are strongly confident that better results could have been achieved with the exploitation of more variant data although it was demonstrated in one ship the developed framework along with the associated model may be applied to any other ship type upon appropriate modification and tailoring the proposed model can also play a vital role in developing decision support systems dss for ships operators to maximize the ship energy efficiency such systems can achieve cost free savings if correctly used in voyage planning it can also advise the ship s operator during a sea voyage with the optimum operational parameters such as ship s speed heading and optimum trim to achieve an optimum energy efficient voyage future research may additionally include integrating the developed model into a real time decision support system dss that aims to maximize the ship s energy efficiency during sea voyages by weather routing furthermore in addition to ann other non classical mathematical methods of relevance may be considered in

22101,tidal current turbines have undergone tremendous development on their scales and capacities in recent decades but their further commercial application has encountered great challenges including their high energy cost and short lifetime the optimization design for cost reduction requires accurate and reliable turbine load information and the load reduction control for life extension requires recognizable real time fatigue load feedback to avoid the difficulty and complication of direct load measurements an indirect load measurement method for a large floating horizontal axis tidal current turbine was proposed in this study based on the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and platform responses the operation principle of the proposed method was defined in detail and a turbine load measurement system was designed to validate the feasibility of this measurement system a measurement experiment for a 300 kw tidal current turbine on a floating platform was conducted the turbine loads consisting of the turbine thrust and fatigue loads were estimated based on the measured information in a comparison with the load information predicted by software simulation good agreement especially on the turbine thrust was obtained the estimated fatigue load signal indicated a high signal to noise ratio which can provide reliable support for load control keywords tidal current energy load measurement floating platform tidal current turbine 1 introduction tidal current energy is an attractive renewable energy resource because of its high predictability and stability both the size and the generation power of tidal current turbines tcts have been continuously increasing in recent years the capacity of the world s largest tct has reached 2 mw zhou et al 2017 however the further development of tcts is facing some problems associated with their high energy cost and severe fatigue load in the current process of tct design the operational load performance of tcts is investigated mainly based on theoretical analysis using blade element momentum bem theory and cfd numerical simulation ed dı n fertahi et al 2018 li et al 2016 however the cfd method strongly relies on the computing ability and costs a substantial amount of time thus it is difficult to calculate the load performance of turbines during the control process in the bem method many parameters of blade hydrofoils are transferred from wind turbines but the two systems have quite different reynolds numbers stall characteristics and potential for cavitation bahaj et al 2007 winter 2011 in general the load results predicted by the current theoretical analysis methods are not accurate or reliable enough for the precise designs of tcts and their support structures hence due to the complex marine conditions and the lack of accurate load estimation of operating tcts high reliability indices are often adopted in the design process with additional safety margins that increase the energy cost this cost disadvantage has seriously impeded the industrialization process of the tcts additionally another problem of software simulations and theoretical calculations is that they cannot provide real time load data of an operating tct for the load reduction control with the increase in tct size the fatigue load arising from current shear becomes more severe li et al 2019 the absence of effective load reduction control such as individual pitch control ipc reduces the lifetime of tcts and has led to some unexpected failures bahaj 2011 zhou et al 2017 in addition to the pitch control actuators a reliable real time fatigue load monitor method is required for ipc it is therefore important to establish an effective method to measure or monitor the operating load of tcts thus developing a load measurement system for tcts is an efficient approach to meet the requirements of the cost reduction design and lifetime extension to measure or monitor the dynamic load of wind turbines strain gauge sensors liu et al 2015 2016 and fiber bragg grating sensors schroeder et al 2006 have been proposed and demonstrated for wind turbine blade load measurement however because the tcts operate in deep water probably in a high pressure environment the seal problems and signal transmission problems of these direct load measurement methods affect their longtime and efficient operation and restrict their applications for tcts moreover some indirect methods have also been studied platform pitching motion wakui et al 2017 and tower vibrations lio et al 2018 were used as feedback for power control and load reduction the effects of platform motion on turbine performance were also studied wen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 however these studies cannot provide direct reference or feedback for turbine design the 6 degree of freedom dof motions of the hywind demo floating wind turbine were measured in a related study that focused on the wave loads and the comparative analysis of measurement and simulation lin et al 2018 skaare et al 2015 however the numerical relationship between the response of platform motions and the turbine loads remains to be studied and experimentally validated although the load measurements were studied for wind turbines little work has been devoted to the load measurements for tcts until recently load measuring for tcts had been a largely under explored domain and existing methods in wind energy research areas could not provide available direct reference for the load measurement method for tcts thus this paper presents a novel load measurement method for the large floating tcts regarding the whole mooring system as a part of a load measurement sensor floating platforms provide convenient maintenance for tcts and thus are widely used to support tcts and other equipment gu et al 2018 sheng et al 2016 xu et al 2016 compared with the towers of wind turbines the mooring systems have smaller stiffness so that the motions of the platforms can be easily observed and measured hence avoiding the complicated and difficult direct load measurement the proposed method in this study is to investigate the loads of tcts by measuring both the static and the dynamic responses of floating platform motion it is the focus of this research to obtain the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and the mooring system motion responses as shown in fig 1 the main contributions of this method is presenting a new solution for the load measurements for tcts to support the cost reduction design for both the tcts and the floating platforms and to provide real time load feedback for load reduction control in this study a mooring system model was firstly established by analyzing all the loads acting on the platform to obtain the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and the mooring system motion responses then a floating platform motion measurement method based on euler s angles was proposed and introduced to validate the feasibility of proposed method a measurement experiment for a 300 kw floating tct was subsequently carried out in real sea state good agreement was obtained between the measured results and the theoretically calculated results based on bem theory 2 mooring system model the mooring system model is crucial for the indirect load measurement the floating mooring system is subjected to turbine loads waves tidal current and wind each of them needs to be analyzed to determine the accurate relationship between turbine loads and platform responses compared with other factors the wind force is negligible fig 2 shows the tidal current energy test field in zhoushan consisting of three floating platforms for various sizes of tcts although the sea surface is still without even small waves at the sea trial site the wave effects on the platform need to be considered for a universal load measurement method filters are designed to separate the wave effects in the frequency domain based on the different frequencies of waves and the fatigue load in this study the largest platform of this test field is studied as an example 2 1 the load of tcts first the turbine loads are analyzed in this section the tct has a similar operating principle as a wind turbine dai et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the 6 dof turbine loads in hub fixed frame coordinates are shown in fig 3 m x h is the power production torque which can be derived from the generator torque and generator speed information m y h is the tilt moment and m z h is the yaw moment both of them are produced by the current shear civelek et al 2017 and they can be regarded as the horizontal and vertical components of a rotation moment vector riboldi and cacciola 2017 the turbine thrust f x h is an important parameter for turbine design f y h and f z h are relatively small values and can be ignored thus the measurement of thrust f x h and tilt moment m y h are of specific interest and are studied in this paper based on previous related studies riboldi and cacciola 2017 van solingen and van wingerden 2015 the thrust and tilt moment can be written in harmonic forms or fourier series as 1 f x h f s f 0 sin ω t f 1 sin 2 ω t f 2 sin 3 ω t m y h m 0 sin ω t φ m 1 sin 2 ω t φ m 2 sin 3 ω t φ where 2 ω 2 π n 60 b here n is the rotor speed in rpm b is the blade number and φ is the phase difference f s is the steady state part of the thrust f i and m i are the oscillation amplitudes of the thrust and tilt moment respectively the determination methods of f i and m i in the frequency domain are similar and related studies have indicated that the main components of fatigue loads are the 2p loads for two bladed turbines or 3p loads for three bladed turbines thus in this study the determinations of f 1 and m 1 are representatively investigated as examples in other words the load measurement for tcts is governed by the four main variables f s f 1 m 1 and φ 2 2 the floating platform introduction and its dynamical analysis to study the dynamic response of the platform an inertial coordinate system x a y a z a is built as shown in fig 4 z a is the vertical direction heave y a is the platform surge direction and x a is the platform sway direction the forces acting on the platform are shown in fig 5 the dynamic equations can be given as follows y direction 3 f x h cos θ x f c i 1 6 t y i cos λ i m m a y d y y where θ x is the rotation angle around the x axis f c is the current load t y i is the horizontal component of mooring line tension λ i is the angle between t y i and the y axis m is the mass of the platform m a is the added mass and d y is the total damping in the y direction the damping d y consists of three main parts pressure viscous and radiation z direction 4 f f l o a t m g f x h sin θ x i 1 6 t z i m m a z d z z f f l o a t is the buoyancy of the platform d z is the total damping in the z direction and t z i is the vertical component of mooring line tension rx direction 5 m f l o a t m

c is the moment acting on the platform by the tidal current j is the moment of inertia around the x axis j a is the added mass d is the rotational damping and m i is the moment produced by mooring line tension to obtain the turbine loads through the dynamic responses of the platform the relative parameters in the above dynamic equations need to be determined 2 3 the mass and the moment of inertia of the platform due to the complex structure of the platform the platform s mass and moment of inertia cannot be obtained directly thus a 3 d model of the platform was built in ansys workbench as shown in fig 6 according to the mass distribution of the platform and turbine system components a static structure analysis was conducted in workbench and the mass of the platform was obtained 6 m 48681 kg the coordinates of the barycenter are obtained as follows 0 035 0 046 1 2471 the moment of inertia matrix around the barycenter is 5 2 e 7 69 8 3 e 5 69 6 7 e 7 28557 8 3 e 5 28857 8 7 e 7 2 4 mooring line tension to determine the flexible constraints of this floating multiline system the tension of a single mooring line is analyzed based on the assumption that the line is perfectly flexible and linearly elastic three potential cases of the mooring line can be considered as shown in fig 7 1 a fully suspended catenary line 0 α π 2 2 a slack catenary line partially resting on the seabed α 0 and 3 a totally slack line without horizontal tension α π 2 typically the tension of the fully suspended catenary mooring line in case 1 of fig 7 is studied according to hooke s law the tension of an element on the mooring line can be expressed as 7 t d p d l d l e a where dp and dl are the deformed and initial length of the element respectively e is young s modulus approximately 2e11 pa and a is the average cross sectional area of a mooring line approximately 77 cm2 thus dp can be expressed as 8 d p t e a 1 d l the static equilibrium conditions of the catenary mooring line with initial length l can be given as 9 t y t cos θ t 0 cos α 10 t z t sin θ ρ ρ 0 g l t 0 sin α where t 0 is the tension of the bottom end α and θ are the bottom slope and top slope respectively and ρ and ρ 0 are the linear density of the mooring line and water respectively the total length l 0 of a mooring line used is 100 m about 98 m is actually used and the total mass of a mooring line is 6000 kg thus the tension t can be expressed as 11 t t 0 cos α 2 ρ ρ 0 g l t 0 sin α 2 the horizontal and vertical excursions of suspension point s can be integrated as yang and tsay 2008 12 y f t y t z l 0 l cos θ d p 0 l t z t t e a 1 d l l t y e a t y ρ ρ 0 g sinh 1 t z t y sinh 1 t z ρ ρ 0 g l t y 13 z g t y t z l 0 l sin θ d p 0 l t z t t e a 1 d l t z e a l ρ g 2 e a l 2 t y ρ ρ 0 g 1 t z t y 2 1 t z ρ ρ 0 g l t y 2 the excursions x y can be calculated by the equation set for given tension values t x t y and the catenary initial length l to determine the mooring line tension for given excursions x 0 y 0 and length l an iteration algorithm based on the newton raphson method is designed to solve the following nonlinear transcendental equation set 14 f t y 0 t z 0 l y 0 0 g t y 0 t z 0 l z 0 0 applying taylor s series expansion for the equations set at t y 0 t z 0 eq 14 can be written as 15 y y 0 z z 0 j t y t y 0 t z t z 0 where j is the jacobian matrix al solihat and nahon 2015 16 j f t y f t z g t y g t z thus the calculated tension for the next iteration can be written as abeysekera et al 2016 17 t y k 1 t z k 1 t y k t z k j 1 y k 1 y k z k 1 z k however due to the rigid and frictionless support of the seabed the bottom slope α is always nonnegative as stated in fig 7 a negative result of α after iteration indicates that part of the mooring line is resting on the seabed thus the catenary length l is a variable to be determined to obtain the numerical solution for given excursions x 0 y 0 the bisection method is applied to find the value of l a flowchart of the calculation steps used in the newton raphson iteration and bisection iteration is shown in fig 8 the numerical results of the tension excursion relationship are obtained by this calculation and are plotted in fig 9 these results can be imported into a 2 d lookup table in matlab simulink to establish a numerical mooring line model for the dynamic response simulation 2 5 buoyancy the buoyancy of the platform provides a hydrostatic restoring force and torque the buoyancy can be calculated as 18 f f l o a t ρ w g a z where z is the excursion of the platform barycenter a is the hull area and ρ w is the water density the hydrostatic restoring moment namely the righting moment generated by buoyancy can be calculated based on the metacentric concept fig 10 displays the metacentric and metacentric radius of the platform g is the gravity center m is the metacentric b is the original buoyant center and b is the buoyant center of tilted platform the hydrostatic restoring moment can be calculated as 19 m f l o a t f f l o a t g p f f l o a t m g tan θ x f f l o a t m b g b tan θ x according to the metacentric concept metacentric radius m b can be expressed as neves et al 1999 m b i t v 2 3 w 2 w 2 l 3 x d x m ρ w where i t is inertia of area with respect to axis x v is the displaced volume of the platform and ρ w is the water density 2 6 current load the floating platform endures the scour of tidal currents with different velocities the scour applies a thrust and moment to the platform to determine the thrust and moment of the platform at various velocities a 3 d simulation in fluent was conducted using a volume of fluid vof model the rans reynolds average navier stockes method was applied combined with the rng k ε turbulent model multizone method was adopted to generate the mesh for a pontoon of the platform based on the symmetrical condition the influence of the operating turbine wasn t taken into consideration in this study because the turbine located in relatively deeper water as shown in fig 4 a velocity contour for a 1 m s incident current velocity is shown in fig 11 for a steady current velocity the force acting on the platform due to the pressure and viscous can be described as mctaggart 20 f c 1 2 ρ w c d s y v 2 where c d is the transverse drag coefficient s y is the transverse underwater area and v is the current velocity the moment acting on the platform can also be described in a similar form as koop et al 2013 21 m c 1 2 ρ w c m s y v 2 where c m is the transverse moment coefficient the cfd simulation result predicts c d to be approximately 0 3538 and c m to be 4 6 these results may not be accurate or even constant but are acceptable because the current force is much smaller than the turbine thrust according to the load estimation in gh bladed the thrust is approximately 250 kn at the current condition of 2 m s while the current load is only approximately 6 kn in this study the differential coefficient of the current load is regarded as the damping due to the pressure and viscous 2 7 added mass and radiation damping because the platform suffers from fatigue loads radiated waves generated by the motions of the platform has to be taken into account added mass and radiation damping were widely used to express the dissipated energy and were calculated in ansys aqwa diffraction component using boundary element method in frequency domain the platform model in fig 6 was import to the ansys aqwa and the results were obtained as plotted in fig 12 3 simulations and measurements 3 1 simulations to obtain the numerical relationship between the tct loads and platform responses a theoretical model based on the analysis in section 2 for this mooring system was established in matlab simulink additionally to provide further evidence of the theoretical model results a simulation for this mooring system was also conducted in ansys workbench as shown in fig 13 the mechanical structure of the platform was imported to the ansys workbench hydrodynamic response components the mass characteristic as stated in section 2 1 and the current force as investigated in section 2 6 were defined for the structure six mooring lines were defined according to their actual positions at platform constant thrusts were applied to the hub to obtained the steady responses of the platform the calculation results from matlab simulink and the simulation results from ansys workbench are plotted in fig 14 and are found to demonstrate a similar numerical relationship between the thrust and the steady state responses of the floating platform because the ansys aqwa didn t include the slack mooring line model as shown in case 2 and 3 in fig 7 the stiffness obtained in aqwa is relatively larger than the result from simulink the linearity of r x and z is better than that of y note that the displacements of the offshore floating platform are difficult to measure due to the lack of a calibration method thus the steady state part of the turbine thrust f s can be estimated by the measured steady state tilt angle r x based on their linear numerical relationship f 1 and m 1 the amplitudes of the fatigue loads need to be calculated based on the system magnitude frequency characteristics through local linearization of the mooring system the following equations can be derived from eqs 3 and 5 22 f x h cos θ x f c v 0 m m a y d y y k y y 23 m y h f x h h m c v 0 j j a θ x d θ x k θ x where d y d f c v d v v v 0 d r y the d is the radiation damping about the x axis and v 0 is the current velocity k y is the stiffness in the y direction i e the average inverse of the slope of the curves in fig 14 c while k is the rotation stiffness the frequency characteristic relationship of loads and responses can be written as 24 a y 1 f 1 cos θ x ω 2 k y m m a ω 2 2 d y ω 2 25 θ x 1 m 1 k j j a ω 2 2 d ω 2 where a y 1 and θ x 1 are the amplitudes of platform responses with the same frequency as f 1 and m 1 respectively ω is the 2p frequency of the rotor speed m the resultant moment generated by the turbine loads on the platform can be described as 26 m sin ω t φ m 1 sin ω t φ f 1 h sin ω t and 27 m m 1 2 2 m 1 f 1 h cos φ f 1 h 2 28 φ arctan f 1 h m 1 cos φ m 1 sin φ 3 2 measurement method to measure the steady state and dynamical responses of the floating platform a measurement system is designed as shown in fig 15 this system consists of acceleration sensors a magnetic field sensor tilt sensors an encoder for the rotor speed and an acoustic doppler current meter adcm the pose and motion of the platform are monitored by the sensors to estimate the turbine loads based on the numerical system model the adcm provides the tidal current velocity and the tidal current load is subtracted the encoder offers real time rotor speed for the filter design the sensors are fixed on the moving and rotating platform thus to obtain the platform responses in inertial frame a a noninertial frame b is established and fixed with the platform barycenter the origins of coordinates b can be described in inertial frame a as follows 29 x o b c θ where c x y z t and θ θ x θ y θ z t x y and z are the coordinates of o b in frame a θ x θ y and θ z are the pitch roll and yaw euler angles respectively the position on the platform where the sensors are fixed is defined as point p its coordinates in frame b can be written as 30 p b p x p y p z t the position of the measurement sensors is approximately 0 9 2 76 t in this study the coordinates of point p in frame a can be obtained by euler rotation transformation as 31 p a t p b c where t is the transform euler rotation matrix from b to a 32 t t z t y t x where 33 t z cos θ z sin θ z 0 sin θ z cos θ z 0 0 0 1 t y cos θ y 0 sin θ y 0 1 0 sin θ y 0 cos θ y t x 1 0 0 0 cos θ x sin θ x 0 sin θ x cos θ x thus the speed of p in inertial frame a is 34 v p t p b t p b c where 35 t θ z q k t z t y t z θ y t z q j t y t z θ x t z t y q i t z 36 q i 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 q j 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 q k 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 the acceleration of point p in inertial frame a is 37 v p t p b 2 t p b t p b c as the sensors are fixed on the platform its acceleration can be written as 38 v p t p b c the measured acceleration in the b frame can be transformed to the a frame 39 v p t v m where v m is the acceleration measured by the sensors thus the acceleration of the platform can be calculated as 40 c t v m t p b the signal processing for load identification is shown in fig 16 the platform accelerations in inertial frame a are obtained through euler rotation transformation from the measured accelerations a bandpass filter is designed according to the rotor speed so that the signal components with frequency ω are separated finally the fatigue loads can be identified by the system magnitude frequency characteristics besides the steady state thrust can be calculated by the steady state tilt angle filtered by a low pass filter based on their relationship 4 experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed measurement method and the designed measurement system a measurement experiment for a 300 kw twin blade horizontal axis tct was carried out in a real sea state this tct with a 16 m rotor diameter was installed on a floating platform as shown in fig 17 with the turbine loads acting on the floating platform the platform responses including the tilt angles and accelerations were monitored by the designed measurement system during the power generation process the experimental results are plotted in fig 18 the tilt angle of the platform in fig 18 c and the amplitude of acceleration in fig 18 b show a strong correlation with the current velocity in fig 18 a fig 18 d indicates the detailed information of the acceleration and fig 18 f demonstrates the spectral analysis results of the platform acceleration the frequency domain results show that the spectral peak is completely consistent with the double rotor rotation frequency 12 rpm this result indicates that the acceleration of the platform measured by the designed measurement system can provide a recognizable signal of the fatigue load feedback with a high signal to noise ratio snr for the load reduction control fig 18 e displays the calculated steady state turbine thrust f s during the tct operation based on the linear relationship between the tilt angle of the platform and the turbine thrust a power production simulation for this tct was conducted in gh bladed with a constant velocity gradient similar to fast gh bladed is a professional commercial performance and loading calculation software based on bem blade element momentum theory gu et al 2018 the parameters of the 600 kw tidal current turbine was directly defined in the gh bladed and the current shear coefficient was determined according to the experimental power fluctuation li et al 2019 the simulation results are plotted in fig 19 good agreement on the turbine thrust can be found between the theoretical simulation analyses in fig 19 and experimentally measured results in fig 18 e fig 18 b and d also show that the amplitude of acceleration fluctuates significantly with the amplitude having a positive correlation with the current velocity this result indicates that the velocity gradient is not always constant and reveals the complexity of the flow conditions to reframe the response and loads in terms of frequency bandpass filters were applied for the tilt angles and accelerations detailed data are plotted in fig 20 to present an example the amplitude of the tilt angle fluctuated from 0 033 to 0 079 while the amplitude of acceleration fluctuated from 0 023 m s2 to 0 055 m s2 based on the phase relationship and the system magnitude frequency characteristic described in section 3 1 the fatigue loads were calculated the amplitude of the tilt moment m 1 was between 157 3 knm and 376 83 knm while f 1 was between 10 72 kn and 25 64 kn the phase difference φ was approximately 13 because the complex flow condition could not be perfectly defined in the gh bladed simulation the simulation results in fig 19 only displays the amplitudes of fatigue loads roughly the amplitudes of calculated fatigue loads are consistent with the simulation results but fluctuate actively moreover the measurement accuracy of the proposed measurement system may not be sufficient for the high accuracy fatigue load measurement but the high snr of the fatigue loads measurement data may be more important for load reduction control than other aspects 5 conclusion reliable load measurements are crucial for the optimization design and load control of tcts in this study a novel indirect load measurement method is proposed for large tcts on floating platforms a measurement system is designed and its operating principle is introduced in detail based on the mooring system model to validate the feasibility and measurement accuracy of the designed measurement system an experimental measurement test for a 300 kw tct was carried out in a real sea state good agreement was obtained especially for the turbine thrust between the simulation results in gh bladed and the experimental measurement results compared with traditional measurement methods based on the deformation of blade roots this designed load measurement system is simple to implement for large tcts on floating platforms load feedback support for the load reduction can be effectively provided to increase the turbine lifetime meanwhile through the precise design based on this load measurement the construction cost of both the turbines and platforms may be further reduced this load measurement method also has potential broad prospects of application for floating offshore wind turbines due to their similar energy cost problems to improve the accuracy of the designed measurement system the effects and the source of the measurement error can be discussed in a subsequent study author

22101,tidal current turbines have undergone tremendous development on their scales and capacities in recent decades but their further commercial application has encountered great challenges including their high energy cost and short lifetime the optimization design for cost reduction requires accurate and reliable turbine load information and the load reduction control for life extension requires recognizable real time fatigue load feedback to avoid the difficulty and complication of direct load measurements an indirect load measurement method for a large floating horizontal axis tidal current turbine was proposed in this study based on the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and platform responses the operation principle of the proposed method was defined in detail and a turbine load measurement system was designed to validate the feasibility of this measurement system a measurement experiment for a 300 kw tidal current turbine on a floating platform was conducted the turbine loads consisting of the turbine thrust and fatigue loads were estimated based on the measured information in a comparison with the load information predicted by software simulation good agreement especially on the turbine thrust was obtained the estimated fatigue load signal indicated a high signal to noise ratio which can provide reliable support for load control keywords tidal current energy load measurement floating platform tidal current turbine 1 introduction tidal current energy is an attractive renewable energy resource because of its high predictability and stability both the size and the generation power of tidal current turbines tcts have been continuously increasing in recent years the capacity of the world s largest tct has reached 2 mw zhou et al 2017 however the further development of tcts is facing some problems associated with their high energy cost and severe fatigue load in the current process of tct design the operational load performance of tcts is investigated mainly based on theoretical analysis using blade element momentum bem theory and cfd numerical simulation ed dı n fertahi et al 2018 li et al 2016 however the cfd method strongly relies on the computing ability and costs a substantial amount of time thus it is difficult to calculate the load performance of turbines during the control process in the bem method many parameters of blade hydrofoils are transferred from wind turbines but the two systems have quite different reynolds numbers stall characteristics and potential for cavitation bahaj et al 2007 winter 2011 in general the load results predicted by the current theoretical analysis methods are not accurate or reliable enough for the precise designs of tcts and their support structures hence due to the complex marine conditions and the lack of accurate load estimation of operating tcts high reliability indices are often adopted in the design process with additional safety margins that increase the energy cost this cost disadvantage has seriously impeded the industrialization process of the tcts additionally another problem of software simulations and theoretical calculations is that they cannot provide real time load data of an operating tct for the load reduction control with the increase in tct size the fatigue load arising from current shear becomes more severe li et al 2019 the absence of effective load reduction control such as individual pitch control ipc reduces the lifetime of tcts and has led to some unexpected failures bahaj 2011 zhou et al 2017 in addition to the pitch control actuators a reliable real time fatigue load monitor method is required for ipc it is therefore important to establish an effective method to measure or monitor the operating load of tcts thus developing a load measurement system for tcts is an efficient approach to meet the requirements of the cost reduction design and lifetime extension to measure or monitor the dynamic load of wind turbines strain gauge sensors liu et al 2015 2016 and fiber bragg grating sensors schroeder et al 2006 have been proposed and demonstrated for wind turbine blade load measurement however because the tcts operate in deep water probably in a high pressure environment the seal problems and signal transmission problems of these direct load measurement methods affect their longtime and efficient operation and restrict their applications for tcts moreover some indirect methods have also been studied platform pitching motion wakui et al 2017 and tower vibrations lio et al 2018 were used as feedback for power control and load reduction the effects of platform motion on turbine performance were also studied wen et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 however these studies cannot provide direct reference or feedback for turbine design the 6 degree of freedom dof motions of the hywind demo floating wind turbine were measured in a related study that focused on the wave loads and the comparative analysis of measurement and simulation lin et al 2018 skaare et al 2015 however the numerical relationship between the response of platform motions and the turbine loads remains to be studied and experimentally validated although the load measurements were studied for wind turbines little work has been devoted to the load measurements for tcts until recently load measuring for tcts had been a largely under explored domain and existing methods in wind energy research areas could not provide available direct reference for the load measurement method for tcts thus this paper presents a novel load measurement method for the large floating tcts regarding the whole mooring system as a part of a load measurement sensor floating platforms provide convenient maintenance for tcts and thus are widely used to support tcts and other equipment gu et al 2018 sheng et al 2016 xu et al 2016 compared with the towers of wind turbines the mooring systems have smaller stiffness so that the motions of the platforms can be easily observed and measured hence avoiding the complicated and difficult direct load measurement the proposed method in this study is to investigate the loads of tcts by measuring both the static and the dynamic responses of floating platform motion it is the focus of this research to obtain the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and the mooring system motion responses as shown in fig 1 the main contributions of this method is presenting a new solution for the load measurements for tcts to support the cost reduction design for both the tcts and the floating platforms and to provide real time load feedback for load reduction control in this study a mooring system model was firstly established by analyzing all the loads acting on the platform to obtain the numerical relationship between the turbine loads and the mooring system motion responses then a floating platform motion measurement method based on euler s angles was proposed and introduced to validate the feasibility of proposed method a measurement experiment for a 300 kw floating tct was subsequently carried out in real sea state good agreement was obtained between the measured results and the theoretically calculated results based on bem theory 2 mooring system model the mooring system model is crucial for the indirect load measurement the floating mooring system is subjected to turbine loads waves tidal current and wind each of them needs to be analyzed to determine the accurate relationship between turbine loads and platform responses compared with other factors the wind force is negligible fig 2 shows the tidal current energy test field in zhoushan consisting of three floating platforms for various sizes of tcts although the sea surface is still without even small waves at the sea trial site the wave effects on the platform need to be considered for a universal load measurement method filters are designed to separate the wave effects in the frequency domain based on the different frequencies of waves and the fatigue load in this study the largest platform of this test field is studied as an example 2 1 the load of tcts first the turbine loads are analyzed in this section the tct has a similar operating principle as a wind turbine dai et al 2011 xu et al 2015 the 6 dof turbine loads in hub fixed frame coordinates are shown in fig 3 m x h is the power production torque which can be derived from the generator torque and generator speed information m y h is the tilt moment and m z h is the yaw moment both of them are produced by the current shear civelek et al 2017 and they can be regarded as the horizontal and vertical components of a rotation moment vector riboldi and cacciola 2017 the turbine thrust f x h is an important parameter for turbine design f y h and f z h are relatively small values and can be ignored thus the measurement of thrust f x h and tilt moment m y h are of specific interest and are studied in this paper based on previous related studies riboldi and cacciola 2017 van solingen and van wingerden 2015 the thrust and tilt moment can be written in harmonic forms or fourier series as 1 f x h f s f 0 sin ω t f 1 sin 2 ω t f 2 sin 3 ω t m y h m 0 sin ω t φ m 1 sin 2 ω t φ m 2 sin 3 ω t φ where 2 ω 2 π n 60 b here n is the rotor speed in rpm b is the blade number and φ is the phase difference f s is the steady state part of the thrust f i and m i are the oscillation amplitudes of the thrust and tilt moment respectively the determination methods of f i and m i in the frequency domain are similar and related studies have indicated that the main components of fatigue loads are the 2p loads for two bladed turbines or 3p loads for three bladed turbines thus in this study the determinations of f 1 and m 1 are representatively investigated as examples in other words the load measurement for tcts is governed by the four main variables f s f 1 m 1 and φ 2 2 the floating platform introduction and its dynamical analysis to study the dynamic response of the platform an inertial coordinate system x a y a z a is built as shown in fig 4 z a is the vertical direction heave y a is the platform surge direction and x a is the platform sway direction the forces acting on the platform are shown in fig 5 the dynamic equations can be given as follows y direction 3 f x h cos θ x f c i 1 6 t y i cos λ i m m a y d y y where θ x is the rotation angle around the x axis f c is the current load t y i is the horizontal component of mooring line tension λ i is the angle between t y i and the y axis m is the mass of the platform m a is the added mass and d y is the total damping in the y direction the damping d y consists of three main parts pressure viscous and radiation z direction 4 f f l o a t m g f x h sin θ x i 1 6 t z i m m a z d z z f f l o a t is the buoyancy of the platform d z is the total damping in the z direction and t z i is the vertical component of mooring line tension rx direction 5 m f l o a t m

c is the moment acting on the platform by the tidal current j is the moment of inertia around the x axis j a is the added mass d is the rotational damping and m i is the moment produced by mooring line tension to obtain the turbine loads through the dynamic responses of the platform the relative parameters in the above dynamic equations need to be determined 2 3 the mass and the moment of inertia of the platform due to the complex structure of the platform the platform s mass and moment of inertia cannot be obtained directly thus a 3 d model of the platform was built in ansys workbench as shown in fig 6 according to the mass distribution of the platform and turbine system components a static structure analysis was conducted in workbench and the mass of the platform was obtained 6 m 48681 kg the coordinates of the barycenter are obtained as follows 0 035 0 046 1 2471 the moment of inertia matrix around the barycenter is 5 2 e 7 69 8 3 e 5 69 6 7 e 7 28557 8 3 e 5 28857 8 7 e 7 2 4 mooring line tension to determine the flexible constraints of this floating multiline system the tension of a single mooring line is analyzed based on the assumption that the line is perfectly flexible and linearly elastic three potential cases of the mooring line can be considered as shown in fig 7 1 a fully suspended catenary line 0 α π 2 2 a slack catenary line partially resting on the seabed α 0 and 3 a totally slack line without horizontal tension α π 2 typically the tension of the fully suspended catenary mooring line in case 1 of fig 7 is studied according to hooke s law the tension of an element on the mooring line can be expressed as 7 t d p d l d l e a where dp and dl are the deformed and initial length of the element respectively e is young s modulus approximately 2e11 pa and a is the average cross sectional area of a mooring line approximately 77 cm2 thus dp can be expressed as 8 d p t e a 1 d l the static equilibrium conditions of the catenary mooring line with initial length l can be given as 9 t y t cos θ t 0 cos α 10 t z t sin θ ρ ρ 0 g l t 0 sin α where t 0 is the tension of the bottom end α and θ are the bottom slope and top slope respectively and ρ and ρ 0 are the linear density of the mooring line and water respectively the total length l 0 of a mooring line used is 100 m about 98 m is actually used and the total mass of a mooring line is 6000 kg thus the tension t can be expressed as 11 t t 0 cos α 2 ρ ρ 0 g l t 0 sin α 2 the horizontal and vertical excursions of suspension point s can be integrated as yang and tsay 2008 12 y f t y t z l 0 l cos θ d p 0 l t z t t e a 1 d l l t y e a t y ρ ρ 0 g sinh 1 t z t y sinh 1 t z ρ ρ 0 g l t y 13 z g t y t z l 0 l sin θ d p 0 l t z t t e a 1 d l t z e a l ρ g 2 e a l 2 t y ρ ρ 0 g 1 t z t y 2 1 t z ρ ρ 0 g l t y 2 the excursions x y can be calculated by the equation set for given tension values t x t y and the catenary initial length l to determine the mooring line tension for given excursions x 0 y 0 and length l an iteration algorithm based on the newton raphson method is designed to solve the following nonlinear transcendental equation set 14 f t y 0 t z 0 l y 0 0 g t y 0 t z 0 l z 0 0 applying taylor s series expansion for the equations set at t y 0 t z 0 eq 14 can be written as 15 y y 0 z z 0 j t y t y 0 t z t z 0 where j is the jacobian matrix al solihat and nahon 2015 16 j f t y f t z g t y g t z thus the calculated tension for the next iteration can be written as abeysekera et al 2016 17 t y k 1 t z k 1 t y k t z k j 1 y k 1 y k z k 1 z k however due to the rigid and frictionless support of the seabed the bottom slope α is always nonnegative as stated in fig 7 a negative result of α after iteration indicates that part of the mooring line is resting on the seabed thus the catenary length l is a variable to be determined to obtain the numerical solution for given excursions x 0 y 0 the bisection method is applied to find the value of l a flowchart of the calculation steps used in the newton raphson iteration and bisection iteration is shown in fig 8 the numerical results of the tension excursion relationship are obtained by this calculation and are plotted in fig 9 these results can be imported into a 2 d lookup table in matlab simulink to establish a numerical mooring line model for the dynamic response simulation 2 5 buoyancy the buoyancy of the platform provides a hydrostatic restoring force and torque the buoyancy can be calculated as 18 f f l o a t ρ w g a z where z is the excursion of the platform barycenter a is the hull area and ρ w is the water density the hydrostatic restoring moment namely the righting moment generated by buoyancy can be calculated based on the metacentric concept fig 10 displays the metacentric and metacentric radius of the platform g is the gravity center m is the metacentric b is the original buoyant center and b is the buoyant center of tilted platform the hydrostatic restoring moment can be calculated as 19 m f l o a t f f l o a t g p f f l o a t m g tan θ x f f l o a t m b g b tan θ x according to the metacentric concept metacentric radius m b can be expressed as neves et al 1999 m b i t v 2 3 w 2 w 2 l 3 x d x m ρ w where i t is inertia of area with respect to axis x v is the displaced volume of the platform and ρ w is the water density 2 6 current load the floating platform endures the scour of tidal currents with different velocities the scour applies a thrust and moment to the platform to determine the thrust and moment of the platform at various velocities a 3 d simulation in fluent was conducted using a volume of fluid vof model the rans reynolds average navier stockes method was applied combined with the rng k ε turbulent model multizone method was adopted to generate the mesh for a pontoon of the platform based on the symmetrical condition the influence of the operating turbine wasn t taken into consideration in this study because the turbine located in relatively deeper water as shown in fig 4 a velocity contour for a 1 m s incident current velocity is shown in fig 11 for a steady current velocity the force acting on the platform due to the pressure and viscous can be described as mctaggart 20 f c 1 2 ρ w c d s y v 2 where c d is the transverse drag coefficient s y is the transverse underwater area and v is the current velocity the moment acting on the platform can also be described in a similar form as koop et al 2013 21 m c 1 2 ρ w c m s y v 2 where c m is the transverse moment coefficient the cfd simulation result predicts c d to be approximately 0 3538 and c m to be 4 6 these results may not be accurate or even constant but are acceptable because the current force is much smaller than the turbine thrust according to the load estimation in gh bladed the thrust is approximately 250 kn at the current condition of 2 m s while the current load is only approximately 6 kn in this study the differential coefficient of the current load is regarded as the damping due to the pressure and viscous 2 7 added mass and radiation damping because the platform suffers from fatigue loads radiated waves generated by the motions of the platform has to be taken into account added mass and radiation damping were widely used to express the dissipated energy and were calculated in ansys aqwa diffraction component using boundary element method in frequency domain the platform model in fig 6 was import to the ansys aqwa and the results were obtained as plotted in fig 12 3 simulations and measurements 3 1 simulations to obtain the numerical relationship between the tct loads and platform responses a theoretical model based on the analysis in section 2 for this mooring system was established in matlab simulink additionally to provide further evidence of the theoretical model results a simulation for this mooring system was also conducted in ansys workbench as shown in fig 13 the mechanical structure of the platform was imported to the ansys workbench hydrodynamic response components the mass characteristic as stated in section 2 1 and the current force as investigated in section 2 6 were defined for the structure six mooring lines were defined according to their actual positions at platform constant thrusts were applied to the hub to obtained the steady responses of the platform the calculation results from matlab simulink and the simulation results from ansys workbench are plotted in fig 14 and are found to demonstrate a similar numerical relationship between the thrust and the steady state responses of the floating platform because the ansys aqwa didn t include the slack mooring line model as shown in case 2 and 3 in fig 7 the stiffness obtained in aqwa is relatively larger than the result from simulink the linearity of r x and z is better than that of y note that the displacements of the offshore floating platform are difficult to measure due to the lack of a calibration method thus the steady state part of the turbine thrust f s can be estimated by the measured steady state tilt angle r x based on their linear numerical relationship f 1 and m 1 the amplitudes of the fatigue loads need to be calculated based on the system magnitude frequency characteristics through local linearization of the mooring system the following equations can be derived from eqs 3 and 5 22 f x h cos θ x f c v 0 m m a y d y y k y y 23 m y h f x h h m c v 0 j j a θ x d θ x k θ x where d y d f c v d v v v 0 d r y the d is the radiation damping about the x axis and v 0 is the current velocity k y is the stiffness in the y direction i e the average inverse of the slope of the curves in fig 14 c while k is the rotation stiffness the frequency characteristic relationship of loads and responses can be written as 24 a y 1 f 1 cos θ x ω 2 k y m m a ω 2 2 d y ω 2 25 θ x 1 m 1 k j j a ω 2 2 d ω 2 where a y 1 and θ x 1 are the amplitudes of platform responses with the same frequency as f 1 and m 1 respectively ω is the 2p frequency of the rotor speed m the resultant moment generated by the turbine loads on the platform can be described as 26 m sin ω t φ m 1 sin ω t φ f 1 h sin ω t and 27 m m 1 2 2 m 1 f 1 h cos φ f 1 h 2 28 φ arctan f 1 h m 1 cos φ m 1 sin φ 3 2 measurement method to measure the steady state and dynamical responses of the floating platform a measurement system is designed as shown in fig 15 this system consists of acceleration sensors a magnetic field sensor tilt sensors an encoder for the rotor speed and an acoustic doppler current meter adcm the pose and motion of the platform are monitored by the sensors to estimate the turbine loads based on the numerical system model the adcm provides the tidal current velocity and the tidal current load is subtracted the encoder offers real time rotor speed for the filter design the sensors are fixed on the moving and rotating platform thus to obtain the platform responses in inertial frame a a noninertial frame b is established and fixed with the platform barycenter the origins of coordinates b can be described in inertial frame a as follows 29 x o b c θ where c x y z t and θ θ x θ y θ z t x y and z are the coordinates of o b in frame a θ x θ y and θ z are the pitch roll and yaw euler angles respectively the position on the platform where the sensors are fixed is defined as point p its coordinates in frame b can be written as 30 p b p x p y p z t the position of the measurement sensors is approximately 0 9 2 76 t in this study the coordinates of point p in frame a can be obtained by euler rotation transformation as 31 p a t p b c where t is the transform euler rotation matrix from b to a 32 t t z t y t x where 33 t z cos θ z sin θ z 0 sin θ z cos θ z 0 0 0 1 t y cos θ y 0 sin θ y 0 1 0 sin θ y 0 cos θ y t x 1 0 0 0 cos θ x sin θ x 0 sin θ x cos θ x thus the speed of p in inertial frame a is 34 v p t p b t p b c where 35 t θ z q k t z t y t z θ y t z q j t y t z θ x t z t y q i t z 36 q i 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 q j 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 q k 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 the acceleration of point p in inertial frame a is 37 v p t p b 2 t p b t p b c as the sensors are fixed on the platform its acceleration can be written as 38 v p t p b c the measured acceleration in the b frame can be transformed to the a frame 39 v p t v m where v m is the acceleration measured by the sensors thus the acceleration of the platform can be calculated as 40 c t v m t p b the signal processing for load identification is shown in fig 16 the platform accelerations in inertial frame a are obtained through euler rotation transformation from the measured accelerations a bandpass filter is designed according to the rotor speed so that the signal components with frequency ω are separated finally the fatigue loads can be identified by the system magnitude frequency characteristics besides the steady state thrust can be calculated by the steady state tilt angle filtered by a low pass filter based on their relationship 4 experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed measurement method and the designed measurement system a measurement experiment for a 300 kw twin blade horizontal axis tct was carried out in a real sea state this tct with a 16 m rotor diameter was installed on a floating platform as shown in fig 17 with the turbine loads acting on the floating platform the platform responses including the tilt angles and accelerations were monitored by the designed measurement system during the power generation process the experimental results are plotted in fig 18 the tilt angle of the platform in fig 18 c and the amplitude of acceleration in fig 18 b show a strong correlation with the current velocity in fig 18 a fig 18 d indicates the detailed information of the acceleration and fig 18 f demonstrates the spectral analysis results of the platform acceleration the frequency domain results show that the spectral peak is completely consistent with the double rotor rotation frequency 12 rpm this result indicates that the acceleration of the platform measured by the designed measurement system can provide a recognizable signal of the fatigue load feedback with a high signal to noise ratio snr for the load reduction control fig 18 e displays the calculated steady state turbine thrust f s during the tct operation based on the linear relationship between the tilt angle of the platform and the turbine thrust a power production simulation for this tct was conducted in gh bladed with a constant velocity gradient similar to fast gh bladed is a professional commercial performance and loading calculation software based on bem blade element momentum theory gu et al 2018 the parameters of the 600 kw tidal current turbine was directly defined in the gh bladed and the current shear coefficient was determined according to the experimental power fluctuation li et al 2019 the simulation results are plotted in fig 19 good agreement on the turbine thrust can be found between the theoretical simulation analyses in fig 19 and experimentally measured results in fig 18 e fig 18 b and d also show that the amplitude of acceleration fluctuates significantly with the amplitude having a positive correlation with the current velocity this result indicates that the velocity gradient is not always constant and reveals the complexity of the flow conditions to reframe the response and loads in terms of frequency bandpass filters were applied for the tilt angles and accelerations detailed data are plotted in fig 20 to present an example the amplitude of the tilt angle fluctuated from 0 033 to 0 079 while the amplitude of acceleration fluctuated from 0 023 m s2 to 0 055 m s2 based on the phase relationship and the system magnitude frequency characteristic described in section 3 1 the fatigue loads were calculated the amplitude of the tilt moment m 1 was between 157 3 knm and 376 83 knm while f 1 was between 10 72 kn and 25 64 kn the phase difference φ was approximately 13 because the complex flow condition could not be perfectly defined in the gh bladed simulation the simulation results in fig 19 only displays the amplitudes of fatigue loads roughly the amplitudes of calculated fatigue loads are consistent with the simulation results but fluctuate actively moreover the measurement accuracy of the proposed measurement system may not be sufficient for the high accuracy fatigue load measurement but the high snr of the fatigue loads measurement data may be more important for load reduction control than other aspects 5 conclusion reliable load measurements are crucial for the optimization design and load control of tcts in this study a novel indirect load measurement method is proposed for large tcts on floating platforms a measurement system is designed and its operating principle is introduced in detail based on the mooring system model to validate the feasibility and measurement accuracy of the designed measurement system an experimental measurement test for a 300 kw tct was carried out in a real sea state good agreement was obtained especially for the turbine thrust between the simulation results in gh bladed and the experimental measurement results compared with traditional measurement methods based on the deformation of blade roots this designed load measurement system is simple to implement for large tcts on floating platforms load feedback support for the load reduction can be effectively provided to increase the turbine lifetime meanwhile through the precise design based on this load measurement the construction cost of both the turbines and platforms may be further reduced this load measurement method also has potential broad prospects of application for floating offshore wind turbines due to their similar energy cost problems to improve the accuracy of the designed measurement system the effects and the source of the measurement error can be discussed in a subsequent study author

22102,this paper mainly focus on presenting a newly developed meshless numerical scheme named the generalized finite difference method gfdm to efficiently and accurately solve the improved boussinesq type equations btes based on the improved btes the wave propagated over a flat or irregular bottom topography is described as a two dimensional horizontal problem with nonlinear water waves the gfdm and the 2nd order runge kutta method rkm were employed for spatial and temporal discretizations for this problem respectively the ramping function and the sponge layer combing in this proposed scheme were adopted for incident and outgoing waves respectively as one of domain type meshless methods gfdm can improve the numerical efficiency due to avoiding time consuming meshing generation and numerical quadrature furthermore the partial derivatives of boussinesq equations can be transformed as linear combinations of nearby function values by the moving least squares method of the gfdm simplifying the numerical procedures specifically gfdm is suitable for complex fluid field with some irregular boundaries because of the flexible distribution of nodes four numerical examples were selected to verify the accuracy and applicability in the improved btes of the proposed meshless scheme the results were compared with other numerical predictions and experimental observations and good agreements were depicted keywords improved boussinesq type equations generalized finite difference method meshless method second order runge kutta method nonlinear waves 1 introduction when offshore wave propagates into a nearshore zone the wave profile will be deformed due to the topography and barriers such as islands or submerged obstacles which may cause coastal erosion and endanger the safety of coastal and offshore structures hence it is essential for personal safety and economic effects of coastal structures that propose an accurate and efficient estimation to predict the wave propagation the boussinesq type equations btes are widely applied in numerical coastal models in the variable depth environment because they can relative accurately and easily predict the wave transformations and behaviors the btes are depth integrated equations by simplification from three dimensional euler equations to equivalent two dimensional equations to effectively eradicate time consuming procedures in the computation boussinesq 1872 established the original boussinesq equation which describes the propagation of weakly non linear fairly long waves in shallow waters and have a widely application in simulating water waves in shallow seas on these bases peregrine 1967 proposed the two dimensional boussinesq equation which can describe the changes of water depth referred as the standard one by researchers unfortunately the standard boussinesq equation was only applied in very shallow water due to the inaccuracy of the linear dispersion relation with increasing water depth later a great number of researchers made their efforts to improve the standard boussinesq equations or derive alternative forms e g madsen et al 1991 madsen and sørenson 1992 nwogu 1993 beji and nadaoka 1996 madsen et al 1991 1992 presented the new boussinesq equations with the depth integrated velocities for slowly varying bathymetry nwogu 1993 derived alternative equations based on the velocity at an arbitrary depth beji and nadaoka 1996 improved the dispersive relationship by adding and subtracting a dispersive term based on the standard boussinesq equation in this paper we attempted to solve the improved btes proposed by beji and nadaoka 1996 for developing a numerical model including the wave propagation and transformation since the improved btes proposed by beji and nadaoka 1996 are the 3rd order nonlinear partial differential equations presenting a direct solution is arduous in addition some improved btes will show instabilities when numerically solved over irregular topography beds simarro et al 2015 studied the instabilities of the improved btes and introduced a sets of coefficients that optimize the linear performance while improving the linear stability consequently in order to solve the improved btes various traditional numerical schemes e g wei g and kirby t 1995 beji and nadaoka 1996 li et al 1999 walkley and berzins 2002 sørensen et al 2004 kazolea et al 2012 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 ghadimi and lamouki 2017 zhang and teng 2017 have been successfully adopted by many researchers some of the researchers wei g and kirby t 1995 beji and nadaoka 1996 kim et al 2009 ghadimi and lamouki 2017 adopted the finite difference method fdm to deal with the improved btes but it wasn t applied to more complex and irregular boundaries in realistic physical conditions due to the structured mesh therefore the major group of studies gradually started to focus more on the finite element method fem e g li et al 1999 walkley and berzins 2002 sørensen et al 2004 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 zhang and teng 2017 li et al 1999 adopted the quadrilateral elements with linear interpolating functions to obtain the two horizontal velocity components and the free surface elevation sørensen et al 2004 proposed the galerkin method with mixed interpolation to solve the enhanced boussinesq equations combined with the explicit three step taylor galerkin method reisinezhad et al 2016 solved nwogu s extended boussinesq equations system to simulate wave propagation by using a novel fem scheme apart from fdm and fem kazolea et al 2012 presented a high order well balanced unstructured finite volume method fvm on triangular meshes for extended boussinesq equation of nwogu delis and kazolea 2016 adopted a higher order fvm scheme on unstructured meshes for approximating enhance btes in the last decades in order to alleviate time consuming mesh generation and numerical quadrature the meshless methods have been proposed successively in engineering such as the trefftz method kita et al 2004 mierzwiczak et al 2016 ku et al 2018 the modified collocation trefftz method mctm chen et al 2010 the boundary knot method bkm chen 2002 hon and chen 2003 ma and wang 2016 fu et al 2018 the local radial basis function collocation method rbfcm chan and fan 2013 tsai et al 2015 the generalized finite difference method gfdm benito et al 2001 2007 chan et al 2013 fan et al 2014 2015 2018 li et al 2014 2018 ureña et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2018 and etc as one of the local meshless methods the gfdm captures the attention of different researchers based on the moving least squares method benito et al 2001 deduced the explicit formulas of gfdm which can be used to express spatial derivatives a series of numerical experiment were carried out to measure the influence of some factors in gfdm the significant advantage of gfdm is that spatial derivatives can be simplified as linear combination of nearby function values combining respective weightings with enforcing satisfactions of the governing equations and the boundary conditions at all interior and boundary nodes respectively the extremely stable and accurate numerical solutions can be acquired moreover the gfdm has been efficiently used to solve different partial differential equations such as parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations benito et al 2007 and third and fourth order partial differential equations ureña et al 2012 chan et al 2013 combined the gfdm and a newly developed solver for studying nonlinear algebraic equations and solving the issues of nonlinear obstacle in addition by using the gfdm the 2d inverse problems have been stably solved by fan et al 2014 2015 in the past few years we have successfully applied the gfdm to simulate some engineering problems including the 2d sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular container zhang et al 2016a and wave submerged breakwater interactions in a numerical wave flume zhang et al 2016b furthermore we have efficiently and accurately solve mild slope equation mse based on gfdm zhang et al 2018 being one of the local domain type meshless methods the gfdm can overcome the ill condition of coefficient matrix compared with the boundary type meshless method the gfdm is particularly advantageous in tackling the time consuming process since the localized approaches can divide the domain into subdomains leading to a sparse global system matrix in general fdm may cause practically truncation errors which seriously affect directly the accuracy of the speed of wave energy propagation and thus the accuracy of the wave solutions not only that based on the mesh size the original mathematical models will be contaminated to produce non physical numerical dispersions actually these numerical dispersion relations produced different from the boussinesq type equations and this discrepancy is a critical problem for wave propagation many researchers have also done a lot of research about this issue tam and webb 1993 chiu et al 2009 vitousek and fringer 2011 jang 2017 2018 in gfdm reducing truncation error by least squares method to avoid non physical numerical dispersion in summary it can be noted that the gfdm which contains the advantages of the mesh based and the meshless methods had huge potential for applying diverse interesting engineering cases in this paper the gfdm and the 2nd order runge kutta method rkm were adopted for spatial and temporal discretization of the improved btes respectively based on the euler approach the spatial coordinate of every node in the computational domain is fixed after the discretization by the 2nd order rkm for every node the two horizontal depth average velocity components and the free surface elevation will be updated at each time steps then the gfdm is employed to deal with the improved btes at the present time step in addition the improved btes seem a complicated partial differential equation containing the 3rd order derivatives a special treatment of the 3rd order spatial derivatives in the dispersion modification terms which is given by li et al 1999 is adopted in this paper to avoid the troublesome procedures of direct solutions for 3rd order derivatives up to now this is the first time that the gfdm is applied for accurately solving the improved btes in each example a ramping function is introduced to ensure that the wave height increases gradually which effectively improve the numerical instability problem simultaneously a sponge layer for outgoing waves is assumed to replace radiation boundary the numerical results obtained which compared with experimental data and numerical predictions show that the present numerical scheme is successfully applied in the improved btes model this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the improving btes and the boundary condition are described including side wall incident and absorbing boundary condition the gfdm combining with 2nd order rkm is presented in section 3 then a verification for the merits of the present model is made by four test cases and the numerical results are examined by experimental data and other solutions in section 4 finally the conclusion and discussions are given in section 5 2 governing equations and boundary conditions 2 1 governing equations in this paper a two dimensional boussinesq model is considered in the horizontal free surface of a numerical wave flume the cartesian coordinate system x y is located at the still water plane and the incident wave propagate from x 0 exhibited in fig 1 a in which h x y is the depth of initial still water a and b represent the width and the length of flume respectively it is assumed that the fluid in the flume is inviscid incompressible and irrotational and then the governing equations of the fluid motion can be expressed by the improved btes beji and nadaoka 1996 as follows 1 η t h η u 0 2 u t g η u u 1 β h 2 h u t β g h 2 h η 1 β h 2 6 u t β g h 2 6 2 η where η η x t represents the free surface elevation or vertically measured above still water level g is the acceleration due to gravity u u v is the two dimensional depth averaged velocity vector and u v are the velocity along x and y axes in addition β is considered 0 2 as a constant value madsen and sørenson 1992 neglecting the small 2nd order derivatives of h for slowly varying water depth eqs 1 and 2 can be re written in scalar as follows 3 η t x h u y h v 0 4 r t u u x v u y g η x β g 3 h 2 2 c x 2 β g 3 h 2 2 d x y β g h h x c x β g 2 h h y d x β g 2 h h x d y 5 s t u v x v v y g η y β g 3 h 2 2 c x y β g 3 h 2 2 d y 2 β g h h y d y β g 2 h h x c y β g 2 h h y c x r and s are defined as follows 6 r u β 1 3 h 2 2 u x 2 β 1 3 h 2 2 v x y β 1 h h x u x β 1 2 h h y v x β 1 2 h h x v y 7 s v β 1 3 h 2 2 u x y β 1 3 h 2 2 v y 2 β 1 h h y v y β 1 2 h h x u y β 1 2 h h y u x in which β 1 β 1 h h η c η x and d η y the initial physical value u v η in the interior domain are equal to 0 respectively although the improved btes seems a complicated partial differential equation containing the 3rd order derivatives through the above process given by li et al 1999 3rd order derivatives of η are simplified as the 2nd order derivatives of c and d it means that the 1st order derivatives of η can be obtained at the first then the 3rd order derivatives of η are calculated by the 2nd order derivatives of c and d indirectly which can avoid the troublesome procedures of direct solutions for third order derivatives 2 2 zero flux boundary condition since no flow can penetrate the solid boundary zero flux impermeable boundary conditions are imposed as 8 n x η x n y η y 0 9 u n x v n y 0 10 u x τ x n x v x τ y n x u y τ x n y v y τ y n y 0 where n n x n y and τ τ x τ y correspond to the normal vector and the tangent vector along each solid boundary respectively 2 3 incident boundary condition the given velocity with time based on the linear theory is recommended as the wave making condition on the incident boundary 11 u x 0 ω k h η r m cos θ 12 v x 0 ω k h η r m sin θ 13 η ι x 0 h 2 r m cos ω t where θ donates the angle between wave propagation direction and the forward direction of x axis k 2π l and ω are the presenting wave number and the circular frequency respectively moreover in order to satisfy a rest condition initially to approach the unity smoothly in the simulation and prevent the impulse like behavior of wave maker the ramping function r m is used which can boost the incident wave gradually and handle numerical instability and surge problems in this paper the ramping function is given as follows zhang et al 2006 senturk 2011 wang et al 2017 14 r m 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m taken as two times of wave period t in this paper is the modulation time concurrently the waves are ramped in it 2 4 absorbing boundary conditions for the sake of assimilating the wave energy to ensure the little reflection of outgoing wave back into the wave flume a numerical beach named the sponge layer larsen and dancy 1983 is used to make outgoing waves vanish gradually at the end of the numerical flume geng and zhao 2014 yang et al 2015 reisinezhad et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b zhao et al 2017 on the sponge layer the free surface elevation η and two horizontal velocity components u v are divided by μ x y after each time step and μ x y is given as follows larsen and dancy 1983 15 μ x y exp 2 d δ d 2 d s δ d ln α 0 d d s 1 d s d where d is the distance between the point on the sponge layer and the absorbing boundary and ds is the width of the sponge layer usually equal to one or two wave lengths in order to absorb the wave more effectively δ d and α are constant values taken as 0 2 0 3 and 4 respectively in actual computation on the absorbing boundary conditions behind the sponge layer u v or η are equal to zero 16 u x b 0 v x b 0 η x b 0 3 numerical methods the gfdm and the 2nd order rkm are employed for spatial and temporal discretization respectively the 2nd order rkm based on the euler approach is used to discrete the governing equations simultaneously each boundary and interior node on the computational domain are not enabled to move since the spatial positions of every node are fixed all the time the weighting coefficients for every node are determined at the beginning then the gfdm is applied to solve the improved btes in irregular domain at the present time according to values of the updated horizontal velocity and free surface elevation the detailed descriptions are expressed in the next subsections 3 1 generalized finite difference method the original idea of the gfdm is from the moving least squares method to derive the expressions of spatial derivatives to begin with a set of arbitrarily or uniformly distributed boundary nodes and interior nodes are determined then the coordinates of ith node is supposed as x i y i for a given ith node n s nearest nodes around the ith node will be selected which form a cluster seen in fig 1 b and v is defined as the generic value for every node denoted u v or η in this paper the 2nd order taylor series expansion is adopted to a new function within the cluster b v expressed as follows e g benito et al 2001 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b ureña et al 2017 chen et al 2018 17 b v j 1 n s v i v j i v i h i j t 1 2 h i 2 v i h i j t w h i j 2 where j is the local index in the cluster h i j x j i x i y j i y i represents the step vector from the central ith node to its nearby jth nodes and x j i y j i j 1 2 n s is the coordinates of the n s nodes in the cluster the quartic spline w h i j benito et al 2001 is used as the weighting function in this study 18 w h i j 1 6 d i j d m i 2 8 d i j d m i 3 3 d i j d m i 4 d i j d m i 0 d i j d m i in which d ij h i j stands for the distance between the ith node and the jth node and the radius of the cluster d m is specified as the distance between the ith node and the farthest node in a cluster then by making b v 0 the above function eq 17 is minimized with respect to d u v x i v y i 2 v x 2 i 2 v x 2 i 2 v x y i t and a linear system is yielded 19 a i d u b i where 20 a i j 1 n s diag e 1 j diag e 2 j where is a 5 5 matrix with all element equal to one diag e k j is diagonal matrix with diagonal element e k

depend on n s and w h i j and it contained the first order and second order spatial partial derivatives which can be accurate approximated by a linear combination of the physical values of other n s 1 nodes with different weighting coefficients inside a cluster in general the theoretical minimum value for n s is taken as 5 to ensure the existence of inverse of a in eq 23 benito et al 2001 based on previous experiences e g chan et al 2013 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b zhang et al 2018 the adopted value for n s is set as 15 during the entire simulation in order to simplify the numerical procedures of the gfdm the number of nodes n s is fixed and presumed as 15 in a cluster therefore it might possibly happen that the distances between the central node and its 15th neighbors is equal to the distance from the 16th neighbors or even more nodes seen in fig 1 b if this does happen only arbitrary one of these nodes can be selected inside this cluster since this farthest node the 15th node in the cluster is inconsequential by adopting the weighting function eq 18 in the gfdm no special rule is used to determine which node is adopted as the 15th node and leave it to the computer code in addition to avoid the confusing recognition of normal vector it is essential that the nodes at the four corner are not set depicted in fig 1 c for sake of clear expressions of spatial derivatives eq 23 can be re written as the follows 26 v x i k 0 x i v i j 1 n s k j x i v j i 27 v y i k 0 y i v i j 1 n s k j y i v j i 28 2 v x 2 i k 0 x x i v i j 1 n s k j x x i v j i 29 2 v y 2 i

time dependent terms in the governing equations in this paper the 2nd order rkm is used to discretize eqs 3 5 as one of the important explicit iterative methods the unknown generic value v at n 1 th time step can be explicitly calculated as follows 31 v v n δ t f v n 32 v n 1 v n 2 1 2 v δ t f v where δ t represents the time increment the physical values at the temporary the nth and the n 1 th step times are denoted by the superscripts n and n 1 respectively the generic variable v represents the component of velocity u and v of eqs 4 and 5 and the free surface elevation η of eq 3 respectively the f function is equal to the right hand side in each equation in eqs 3 5 for more detail information the reader can refer to zhang et al 2016b 3 3 applied gfdm to improved boussinesq model the collocation procedures to analyze the improved boussinesq problem by using the gfdm is described as follow in this paper the number of total nodes n n i n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 n b 4 are arranged in the computational domain among them n i n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 and n b 4 denote the number of nodes which are distributed inside computational domain along incident boundary absorbing boundary and two side wall boundaries respectively after the spatial coordinates of all nodes are determined performing the procedures for every node can acquire the expressions of spatial derivatives of every node in eqs 17 23 since the spatial positions of all nodes are fixed based on the euler approach within each time step the weighting coefficients for every node are determined at the beginning there are three different physical values u v and η in the improved boussinesq equations so these parameters will be solved by gfdm respectively firstly for free surface elevation η all interior node ought to satisfy the governing equation and the system of n i linear algebraic equations will be yielded 33 η i n 1 f η i i 1 2 3 n i where f η i i 1 n i are the dirichlet boundary datum by eq 3 inside the interior domain in addition every boundary node need to respectively satisfy the boundary condition i e the incident boundary condition absorbing boundary condition and two side wall boundary conditions then the system of linear algebraic equations will be yield as follow 34 η i n 1 h 2 r m cos ω t n 1 i n i 1 n i 2 n i 3 n i n b 1 35 η i n 1 0 i n i n b 1 1 n i n b 1 2 n i n b 1 3 n i n b 1 n b 2 36 η n

will be eventuated as 37 e η n n η n 1 n 1 g η n 1 where e η is a sparse coefficient matrix about η and can be efficiently solved g η is formed by combining the inhomogeneous term of the governing equation and the boundary data about η secondly two free surface velocity components u and v should be solved simultaneously since every interior node should satisfy the governing equation the system of 2n i linear algebraic equations will be yielded due to two different physical values 38 u i n 1 β 1 3 h i 2 2 u n 1 x 2 i β 1 3 h i 2 2 v n 1 x y i β 1 h i h x i u n 1 x i β 1 2 h i h y i v n 1 x i

where e u v is a sparse coefficient matrix about u and v g u v is formed by combining the homogeneous term of the governing equation and the boundary data about u and v once the above numerical system is established the numerical solutions of η u and v at all nodes whether they are inside computational domain or along boundary segment are acquired after being divided step by μ x y at the n 1 th time then the simulation can be proceeded to the next time step the flowchart of the proposed meshless numerical scheme for solving improved bets is indicated in fig 2 from the above descriptions it could be noticed that the complicated boussinesq equations can be solved by the simple and straightforward numerical procedure of the gfdm the four numerical examples about boussinesq model are selected for calibration and validation of the proposed numerical scheme in the following section 4 numerical results and comparisons the proposed numerical scheme is adopted to three selected numerical tests about the improved btes these popular and classical examples have been investigated by other numerical methods or experiments e g whalin 1971 isaacson 1978 berkhoff et al 1982 li et al 1999 sørensen et al 2004 in the past therefore the calibrated predictions were compared with previous numerical results and corresponding experimental data in addition a series of numerical experiments have been performed to study some factors of the proposed numerical scheme including the total nodes number n and the time increment δt 4 1 wave runup around a circular cylinder in the first numerical example the proposed meshless method is applied to the irregular domain demonstrated by wave propagation over the circular cylinder the case was one of the laboratory experiments firstly implemented by isaacson 1978 which was widely adopted to investigate the wave runup around a circular cylinder problem in the shallow water range due to the blockage of the cylinder which will lead to the diffraction reflection and wave runup around the cylinder it has some difficult for numerical method to prove the stability and accuracy of the numerical method this case has been presented to simulate waves propagating based on different governing equations such as boussinesq type equations li et al 1999 li and zhan 2001 zhan et al 2004 and shallow water equation swe liang and hsu 2009 liang and chen 2011 as well as n s equation choi et al 2011 the numerical flume is illustrated in fig 3 the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 3 4 m and 6 4 m respectively there is a circular cylinder in the center with radius r 0 25 m the boundary of cylinder is considered as impermeable no flux boundary so the nodes along cylinder boundary satisfy impermeable boundary conditions eqs 8 10 fig 4 shows the distribution of computation nodes and the number of total nodes in computational domain n 39268 and time increment δt 0 01 s three experimental cases of isaacson 1978 are used to test the validity of the numerical models in first two cases wave with wave period t 1 41 and 1 3 s were generated corresponding to the wave number k 4 m 1 wave height h 0 0463 m and the depth of still fluid h 0 12 m respectively which resulting in kr 1 in the third case wave with t 1 4 s were generated corresponding to k 5 2 m 1 h 0 03 m and h 0 08 m which resulting in kr 1 3 besides the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are set as 1 5 m and 0 2 in these cases the parameter of wave runup is defined as r α h i where α is the direction relative to the forward direction of x axis and r α is the maximum wave runup along this direction during computational time the wave runup around the cylinder is depicted in fig 5 compared the simulated results with li and zhan 2001 zhang et al 2006 and li et al 1999 fig 5 a compares the computed results with experimental data and li and zhan s 2001 numerical results for t 1 41s k 4 m 1 h 0 0463 m waves in fig 5 b the case for k 4 m 1 t 1 3s h 0 0463m is shown for the parameter of wave run up which compared with experimental data and zhang et al s 2006 predictions fig 5 c gives the same comparisons for t 1 4 s and k 5 2 m 1 compared with li et al s 1999 results it s obvious that the wave runup around the circular cylinder along different directions are different and hits the bottom at around α 15 20 but peaks at α 180 besides the value of the maximum wave runup increases with the reduce of wave period three numerical results of gfdm are in a good agreement with the experiments isaacson 1978 especially in third case which better than the results of fem li et al 1999 it is demonstrated that the proposed meshless scheme is more suitable for some irregular boundaries than fem fig 6 provides a 3 d presentation of free surface along the length of flume in the third case at t 8 5 s t 9 0 s t 9 5 s fig 6 a shows a wave impact the cylinder and runs up in the windward of the cylinder thereafter the wave passes and divides into the two sides because of the blockage of the cylinder the back scatted wave has been formed and can be founded in fig 6 b at t 9 5 s the wave passes the cylinder and next incoming wave hits the cylinder identically the process of wave diffraction by the circular cylinder is accurately exhibited 4 2 wave focusing over a semi circular shoal from the successful validation in the first cases the stable numerical wave field with non variable depth can be solved by proposed meshless scheme then wave field over the more complicate submarine topography will be focused on in the next two numerical examples so the variable depth should be considered the second case aim at a problem about waves propagating over a semi circular shoal leading the still water depth to gradually decrease from 0 4572 m to 0 1524 m of which the experimental setup was carried out by whalin 1971 as illustrate in fig 7 it is one of the classical cases for simulating the wave propagation combining refraction and diffraction which has been investigated many times by using different numerical method madsen and sørensen 1991 sørensen et al 2004 liu et al 2012 geng and zhao 2014 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 bigoni et al 2016 in addition that the shoaling process in this example will occur energy transformation as well as refraction of wave add complexity and challenge to the simulation the still water depth h x y on the bottom topography is described as follows 47 h x y 0 4572 0 4572 10 67 g x 25 0 1524 0 x 10 67 g 10 67 g x 18 29 g 18 29 x 21 34 where g x y 6 096 y 1 2 0 y 6 096 the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 6 096 m and 36 576 m and the bottom topography is depicted in fig 7 the incident parameters of wave length λ wave period t wave height h and angle θ are set as 3 9 m 2 s 0 015 m and 0 respectively the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are 6 576 m and 0 2 the total simulation time is 50 s in addition number of total nodes and time increment are selected as 85561 and 0 01 respectively the schematic diagram of the free surface at t 49 5 s is illustrated in fig 8 fig 8 a shows the free surface elevation along centreline by the comparisons between the numerical results from the gfdm the fem sørensen et al 2004 and the fdm madsen and sørenson 1992 the results from three different schemes are almost identified to each other furthermore based on the linear theory the incident wave is linear when it enters the flume from the incident boundary nevertheless as the wave propagates on this topography it becomes steeper and more nonlinear due to the semi circular shoal fig 8 b correspond to the contour plot of free surface at t 49 5 s they clearly reveal the wave focusing and wave diffraction due to bottom topography then under the influence of wave diffraction the wave energy dissipates gradually after focusing the wave amplitudes of the first three harmonics along the centerline based on fft analysis are demonstrated in fig 9 in which the result of the gfdm is compared with the experimental data whalin 1971 the fem results sørensen et al 2004 and the gpc results daniele et al 2016 quite obviously a satisfactory estimation of the first and third harmonic is achieved while the second harmonic is somewhat underestimated comparing with the results of fem and gpc about from x 24 m 28 m the wave amplitude of the three harmonics are increasing with distance at the semi circular shoal from x 15 m 25 m it indicates that a significant amount of energy is transferred to the higher frequency components due to the wave refraction diffraction 4 3 wave refraction and diffraction over an elliptic shoal a rather difficult example in which the wave propagates over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely elliptic oriented shoal with 20 angle between incoming wave and shoal as depicted in fig 10 is simulated by gfdm to solve the improved btes previously we have succeeded in simulating this example by means of using gfdm to solve mild slope equations zhang et al 2018 now it is reapplied as the last case in this paper as illustrated in fig 10 a the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 20 m and 27 m in the computational domain in this numerical example the origin is re located i e the wave maker is arranged at x 10 m and the solid walls is set correspondingly at y 10 m and y 10 m the absorbing boundary at x 12 m has a sponge layer as depicted in fig 10 b the still water depth out of range of the shoal is described as follows 48 h 0 x y 0 45 0 45 0 02 5 82 y r y r 5 82 y r 5 82 where x r y cos 20 x sin 20 y r y sin 20 x cos 20 because the improved btes in this paper isn t very suitable for the breaking wave model the position of the very steep slope near the free surface is flattened to keep the numerical stability which is showed in fig 10 b the total still water depth h x y on bottom topography is expressed as follows 49 h x y h 0 x y 0 125 h 0 x y 0 3 0 5 1 x r 5 2 y r 3 75 2 x r 4 2 y r 3 2 1 and h 0 0 125 h 0 0 125 x r 4 2 y r 3 2 1 the incident wave length λ wave period t wave height h and incident angle θ are 1 485 m 1 s 0 0464 m and 0 respectively the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are 2 m and 0 3 the total simulation time is 40 s in addition the number of total nodes and time increment are adopted as 74659 and 0 01 respectively in this paper the normalized wave height is defined as h d h in which h d denoted the wave height in the computational domain and given as η max η min for one stable wave period the numerical results for distributions of normalized wave height at eight different sections x 1 m 3 m 5 m 7 m 9 m and y 2 m 0 m 2 m depicted as in fig 11 are almost identified to the experimental data berkhoff et al 1982 the fem predictions walkley and berzins 2002 the fvm predictions delis et al 2016 and the funwave model kirby et al 1998 the main peaks are basically captured accurately by proposed meshless method except few secondary peaks compared to fem fvm and funwave model from fig 11 a 11 e it can be obviously found that the symmetry and periodicity of the wave lost behind the elliptic shoal due to the wave diffraction refraction the wave diffraction phenomenon will cause reduction of the wave height on the boundary of the elliptic shoal fig 11 f and 11 h whereas the increases on the top of the obstacle fig 11 g fig 12 exhibits the three dimensional free surface profiles at t 37 00 s the wave deformation is clearly indicated due to the focusing effect of the elliptic shoal from the above numerical models it s demonstrated that the proposed meshless scheme is fully applied in the wave field on more complex topography and the wave profiles are almost accurately captured 5 conclusions and discussions the paper represents a truly meshless numerical scheme which combined the gfdm the rkm based on the euler approach the ramping function and the sponge layer is proposed to precisely investigate the waves propagation problems governed by the improved btes firstly the improved btes are transformed by a treatment of the spatial derivatives in order to simplify calculation of 3rd order partial derivatives then the 2nd order rkm and the gfdm are adopted for temporal and spatial discretization respectively through the above application the numerical model of the improved btes can be successfully established by addressing a sparse system of linear algebraic equations the validation of the present numerical model is conducted through four classical numerical examples to investigate the merit and applicability in the simulation of water wave propagation and deformation derived from the improved btes the advantage of gfdm to dealing with the irregular domain is examined by the wave runup problem in the first example fortunately compared with experiment data and fem predictions satisfactory results are achieved by the proposed scheme in last two examples wave propagating in complex bottom topography is studied by gfdm and the wave profiles under diffraction refraction condition are almost precisely acquired moreover the energy transformation of wave in this process is accurately captured based on fft analysis in general it s concluded that the proposed numerical model is fully adopted in the engineering including some wave field on the complex topography and accurately capture the wave profiles from satisfactory results the improved btes are based on the ideal fluid so the proposed numerical model is only applied in the nonlinear water waves when the viscosity is not dominant to develop numerical models considering viscous effect are focuses of

22102,this paper mainly focus on presenting a newly developed meshless numerical scheme named the generalized finite difference method gfdm to efficiently and accurately solve the improved boussinesq type equations btes based on the improved btes the wave propagated over a flat or irregular bottom topography is described as a two dimensional horizontal problem with nonlinear water waves the gfdm and the 2nd order runge kutta method rkm were employed for spatial and temporal discretizations for this problem respectively the ramping function and the sponge layer combing in this proposed scheme were adopted for incident and outgoing waves respectively as one of domain type meshless methods gfdm can improve the numerical efficiency due to avoiding time consuming meshing generation and numerical quadrature furthermore the partial derivatives of boussinesq equations can be transformed as linear combinations of nearby function values by the moving least squares method of the gfdm simplifying the numerical procedures specifically gfdm is suitable for complex fluid field with some irregular boundaries because of the flexible distribution of nodes four numerical examples were selected to verify the accuracy and applicability in the improved btes of the proposed meshless scheme the results were compared with other numerical predictions and experimental observations and good agreements were depicted keywords improved boussinesq type equations generalized finite difference method meshless method second order runge kutta method nonlinear waves 1 introduction when offshore wave propagates into a nearshore zone the wave profile will be deformed due to the topography and barriers such as islands or submerged obstacles which may cause coastal erosion and endanger the safety of coastal and offshore structures hence it is essential for personal safety and economic effects of coastal structures that propose an accurate and efficient estimation to predict the wave propagation the boussinesq type equations btes are widely applied in numerical coastal models in the variable depth environment because they can relative accurately and easily predict the wave transformations and behaviors the btes are depth integrated equations by simplification from three dimensional euler equations to equivalent two dimensional equations to effectively eradicate time consuming procedures in the computation boussinesq 1872 established the original boussinesq equation which describes the propagation of weakly non linear fairly long waves in shallow waters and have a widely application in simulating water waves in shallow seas on these bases peregrine 1967 proposed the two dimensional boussinesq equation which can describe the changes of water depth referred as the standard one by researchers unfortunately the standard boussinesq equation was only applied in very shallow water due to the inaccuracy of the linear dispersion relation with increasing water depth later a great number of researchers made their efforts to improve the standard boussinesq equations or derive alternative forms e g madsen et al 1991 madsen and sørenson 1992 nwogu 1993 beji and nadaoka 1996 madsen et al 1991 1992 presented the new boussinesq equations with the depth integrated velocities for slowly varying bathymetry nwogu 1993 derived alternative equations based on the velocity at an arbitrary depth beji and nadaoka 1996 improved the dispersive relationship by adding and subtracting a dispersive term based on the standard boussinesq equation in this paper we attempted to solve the improved btes proposed by beji and nadaoka 1996 for developing a numerical model including the wave propagation and transformation since the improved btes proposed by beji and nadaoka 1996 are the 3rd order nonlinear partial differential equations presenting a direct solution is arduous in addition some improved btes will show instabilities when numerically solved over irregular topography beds simarro et al 2015 studied the instabilities of the improved btes and introduced a sets of coefficients that optimize the linear performance while improving the linear stability consequently in order to solve the improved btes various traditional numerical schemes e g wei g and kirby t 1995 beji and nadaoka 1996 li et al 1999 walkley and berzins 2002 sørensen et al 2004 kazolea et al 2012 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 ghadimi and lamouki 2017 zhang and teng 2017 have been successfully adopted by many researchers some of the researchers wei g and kirby t 1995 beji and nadaoka 1996 kim et al 2009 ghadimi and lamouki 2017 adopted the finite difference method fdm to deal with the improved btes but it wasn t applied to more complex and irregular boundaries in realistic physical conditions due to the structured mesh therefore the major group of studies gradually started to focus more on the finite element method fem e g li et al 1999 walkley and berzins 2002 sørensen et al 2004 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 zhang and teng 2017 li et al 1999 adopted the quadrilateral elements with linear interpolating functions to obtain the two horizontal velocity components and the free surface elevation sørensen et al 2004 proposed the galerkin method with mixed interpolation to solve the enhanced boussinesq equations combined with the explicit three step taylor galerkin method reisinezhad et al 2016 solved nwogu s extended boussinesq equations system to simulate wave propagation by using a novel fem scheme apart from fdm and fem kazolea et al 2012 presented a high order well balanced unstructured finite volume method fvm on triangular meshes for extended boussinesq equation of nwogu delis and kazolea 2016 adopted a higher order fvm scheme on unstructured meshes for approximating enhance btes in the last decades in order to alleviate time consuming mesh generation and numerical quadrature the meshless methods have been proposed successively in engineering such as the trefftz method kita et al 2004 mierzwiczak et al 2016 ku et al 2018 the modified collocation trefftz method mctm chen et al 2010 the boundary knot method bkm chen 2002 hon and chen 2003 ma and wang 2016 fu et al 2018 the local radial basis function collocation method rbfcm chan and fan 2013 tsai et al 2015 the generalized finite difference method gfdm benito et al 2001 2007 chan et al 2013 fan et al 2014 2015 2018 li et al 2014 2018 ureña et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2018 and etc as one of the local meshless methods the gfdm captures the attention of different researchers based on the moving least squares method benito et al 2001 deduced the explicit formulas of gfdm which can be used to express spatial derivatives a series of numerical experiment were carried out to measure the influence of some factors in gfdm the significant advantage of gfdm is that spatial derivatives can be simplified as linear combination of nearby function values combining respective weightings with enforcing satisfactions of the governing equations and the boundary conditions at all interior and boundary nodes respectively the extremely stable and accurate numerical solutions can be acquired moreover the gfdm has been efficiently used to solve different partial differential equations such as parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations benito et al 2007 and third and fourth order partial differential equations ureña et al 2012 chan et al 2013 combined the gfdm and a newly developed solver for studying nonlinear algebraic equations and solving the issues of nonlinear obstacle in addition by using the gfdm the 2d inverse problems have been stably solved by fan et al 2014 2015 in the past few years we have successfully applied the gfdm to simulate some engineering problems including the 2d sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular container zhang et al 2016a and wave submerged breakwater interactions in a numerical wave flume zhang et al 2016b furthermore we have efficiently and accurately solve mild slope equation mse based on gfdm zhang et al 2018 being one of the local domain type meshless methods the gfdm can overcome the ill condition of coefficient matrix compared with the boundary type meshless method the gfdm is particularly advantageous in tackling the time consuming process since the localized approaches can divide the domain into subdomains leading to a sparse global system matrix in general fdm may cause practically truncation errors which seriously affect directly the accuracy of the speed of wave energy propagation and thus the accuracy of the wave solutions not only that based on the mesh size the original mathematical models will be contaminated to produce non physical numerical dispersions actually these numerical dispersion relations produced different from the boussinesq type equations and this discrepancy is a critical problem for wave propagation many researchers have also done a lot of research about this issue tam and webb 1993 chiu et al 2009 vitousek and fringer 2011 jang 2017 2018 in gfdm reducing truncation error by least squares method to avoid non physical numerical dispersion in summary it can be noted that the gfdm which contains the advantages of the mesh based and the meshless methods had huge potential for applying diverse interesting engineering cases in this paper the gfdm and the 2nd order runge kutta method rkm were adopted for spatial and temporal discretization of the improved btes respectively based on the euler approach the spatial coordinate of every node in the computational domain is fixed after the discretization by the 2nd order rkm for every node the two horizontal depth average velocity components and the free surface elevation will be updated at each time steps then the gfdm is employed to deal with the improved btes at the present time step in addition the improved btes seem a complicated partial differential equation containing the 3rd order derivatives a special treatment of the 3rd order spatial derivatives in the dispersion modification terms which is given by li et al 1999 is adopted in this paper to avoid the troublesome procedures of direct solutions for 3rd order derivatives up to now this is the first time that the gfdm is applied for accurately solving the improved btes in each example a ramping function is introduced to ensure that the wave height increases gradually which effectively improve the numerical instability problem simultaneously a sponge layer for outgoing waves is assumed to replace radiation boundary the numerical results obtained which compared with experimental data and numerical predictions show that the present numerical scheme is successfully applied in the improved btes model this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the improving btes and the boundary condition are described including side wall incident and absorbing boundary condition the gfdm combining with 2nd order rkm is presented in section 3 then a verification for the merits of the present model is made by four test cases and the numerical results are examined by experimental data and other solutions in section 4 finally the conclusion and discussions are given in section 5 2 governing equations and boundary conditions 2 1 governing equations in this paper a two dimensional boussinesq model is considered in the horizontal free surface of a numerical wave flume the cartesian coordinate system x y is located at the still water plane and the incident wave propagate from x 0 exhibited in fig 1 a in which h x y is the depth of initial still water a and b represent the width and the length of flume respectively it is assumed that the fluid in the flume is inviscid incompressible and irrotational and then the governing equations of the fluid motion can be expressed by the improved btes beji and nadaoka 1996 as follows 1 η t h η u 0 2 u t g η u u 1 β h 2 h u t β g h 2 h η 1 β h 2 6 u t β g h 2 6 2 η where η η x t represents the free surface elevation or vertically measured above still water level g is the acceleration due to gravity u u v is the two dimensional depth averaged velocity vector and u v are the velocity along x and y axes in addition β is considered 0 2 as a constant value madsen and sørenson 1992 neglecting the small 2nd order derivatives of h for slowly varying water depth eqs 1 and 2 can be re written in scalar as follows 3 η t x h u y h v 0 4 r t u u x v u y g η x β g 3 h 2 2 c x 2 β g 3 h 2 2 d x y β g h h x c x β g 2 h h y d x β g 2 h h x d y 5 s t u v x v v y g η y β g 3 h 2 2 c x y β g 3 h 2 2 d y 2 β g h h y d y β g 2 h h x c y β g 2 h h y c x r and s are defined as follows 6 r u β 1 3 h 2 2 u x 2 β 1 3 h 2 2 v x y β 1 h h x u x β 1 2 h h y v x β 1 2 h h x v y 7 s v β 1 3 h 2 2 u x y β 1 3 h 2 2 v y 2 β 1 h h y v y β 1 2 h h x u y β 1 2 h h y u x in which β 1 β 1 h h η c η x and d η y the initial physical value u v η in the interior domain are equal to 0 respectively although the improved btes seems a complicated partial differential equation containing the 3rd order derivatives through the above process given by li et al 1999 3rd order derivatives of η are simplified as the 2nd order derivatives of c and d it means that the 1st order derivatives of η can be obtained at the first then the 3rd order derivatives of η are calculated by the 2nd order derivatives of c and d indirectly which can avoid the troublesome procedures of direct solutions for third order derivatives 2 2 zero flux boundary condition since no flow can penetrate the solid boundary zero flux impermeable boundary conditions are imposed as 8 n x η x n y η y 0 9 u n x v n y 0 10 u x τ x n x v x τ y n x u y τ x n y v y τ y n y 0 where n n x n y and τ τ x τ y correspond to the normal vector and the tangent vector along each solid boundary respectively 2 3 incident boundary condition the given velocity with time based on the linear theory is recommended as the wave making condition on the incident boundary 11 u x 0 ω k h η r m cos θ 12 v x 0 ω k h η r m sin θ 13 η ι x 0 h 2 r m cos ω t where θ donates the angle between wave propagation direction and the forward direction of x axis k 2π l and ω are the presenting wave number and the circular frequency respectively moreover in order to satisfy a rest condition initially to approach the unity smoothly in the simulation and prevent the impulse like behavior of wave maker the ramping function r m is used which can boost the incident wave gradually and handle numerical instability and surge problems in this paper the ramping function is given as follows zhang et al 2006 senturk 2011 wang et al 2017 14 r m 1 2 1 cos π t t m t t m 1 t t m where t m taken as two times of wave period t in this paper is the modulation time concurrently the waves are ramped in it 2 4 absorbing boundary conditions for the sake of assimilating the wave energy to ensure the little reflection of outgoing wave back into the wave flume a numerical beach named the sponge layer larsen and dancy 1983 is used to make outgoing waves vanish gradually at the end of the numerical flume geng and zhao 2014 yang et al 2015 reisinezhad et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b zhao et al 2017 on the sponge layer the free surface elevation η and two horizontal velocity components u v are divided by μ x y after each time step and μ x y is given as follows larsen and dancy 1983 15 μ x y exp 2 d δ d 2 d s δ d ln α 0 d d s 1 d s d where d is the distance between the point on the sponge layer and the absorbing boundary and ds is the width of the sponge layer usually equal to one or two wave lengths in order to absorb the wave more effectively δ d and α are constant values taken as 0 2 0 3 and 4 respectively in actual computation on the absorbing boundary conditions behind the sponge layer u v or η are equal to zero 16 u x b 0 v x b 0 η x b 0 3 numerical methods the gfdm and the 2nd order rkm are employed for spatial and temporal discretization respectively the 2nd order rkm based on the euler approach is used to discrete the governing equations simultaneously each boundary and interior node on the computational domain are not enabled to move since the spatial positions of every node are fixed all the time the weighting coefficients for every node are determined at the beginning then the gfdm is applied to solve the improved btes in irregular domain at the present time according to values of the updated horizontal velocity and free surface elevation the detailed descriptions are expressed in the next subsections 3 1 generalized finite difference method the original idea of the gfdm is from the moving least squares method to derive the expressions of spatial derivatives to begin with a set of arbitrarily or uniformly distributed boundary nodes and interior nodes are determined then the coordinates of ith node is supposed as x i y i for a given ith node n s nearest nodes around the ith node will be selected which form a cluster seen in fig 1 b and v is defined as the generic value for every node denoted u v or η in this paper the 2nd order taylor series expansion is adopted to a new function within the cluster b v expressed as follows e g benito et al 2001 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b ureña et al 2017 chen et al 2018 17 b v j 1 n s v i v j i v i h i j t 1 2 h i 2 v i h i j t w h i j 2 where j is the local index in the cluster h i j x j i x i y j i y i represents the step vector from the central ith node to its nearby jth nodes and x j i y j i j 1 2 n s is the coordinates of the n s nodes in the cluster the quartic spline w h i j benito et al 2001 is used as the weighting function in this study 18 w h i j 1 6 d i j d m i 2 8 d i j d m i 3 3 d i j d m i 4 d i j d m i 0 d i j d m i in which d ij h i j stands for the distance between the ith node and the jth node and the radius of the cluster d m is specified as the distance between the ith node and the farthest node in a cluster then by making b v 0 the above function eq 17 is minimized with respect to d u v x i v y i 2 v x 2 i 2 v x 2 i 2 v x y i t and a linear system is yielded 19 a i d u b i where 20 a i j 1 n s diag e 1 j diag e 2 j where is a 5 5 matrix with all element equal to one diag e k j is diagonal matrix with diagonal element e k j k 1 2 in which 21 e 1 j x j i x i y j i y i x j i x i 2 y j i y i 2 x j i x i y j i y i e 2 j w h i 2 x j i x i y j i y i x j i x i 2 2 y j i y i 2 2 x j i x i y j i y i and b i is a 5 1 vector which can be decomposed and expressed as follows 22 b i m i v i j 1 n s e 2 j e 21 e 2 n s v i v 1 i v 2 i v n s i where v i v i v 1 i v 2 i v n s i t are the physical values at the central ith node and the other n s nodes within the cluster finally the vector of derivatives d u can be expressed as follows 23 d u v x i v y i 2 v x 2 i 2 v y 2 i 2 v x y i a i 1 m i v i a i 1 j 1 n s e 2 j v j i a i 1 v i j 1 n s e 2 j k 0 i v i j 1 n s k j i v j i in which 24 k 0 i a i 1 j 1 n s e 2 j 25 k j i a i 1 e 2 j according to the above equations the corresponding coefficient matrix at the ith node d u depend on n s and w h i j and it contained the first order and second order spatial partial derivatives which can be accurate approximated by a linear combination of the physical values of other n s 1 nodes with different weighting coefficients inside a cluster in general the theoretical minimum value for n s is taken as 5 to ensure the existence of inverse of a in eq 23 benito et al 2001 based on previous experiences e g chan et al 2013 fan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b zhang et al 2018 the adopted value for n s is set as 15 during the entire simulation in order to simplify the numerical procedures of the gfdm the number of nodes n s is fixed and presumed as 15 in a cluster therefore it might possibly happen that the distances between the central node and its 15th neighbors is equal to the distance from the 16th neighbors or even more nodes seen in fig 1 b if this does happen only arbitrary one of these nodes can be selected inside this cluster since this farthest node the 15th node in the cluster is inconsequential by adopting the weighting function eq 18 in the gfdm no special rule is used to determine which node is adopted as the 15th node and leave it to the computer code in addition to avoid the confusing recognition of normal vector it is essential that the nodes at the four corner are not set depicted in fig 1 c for sake of clear expressions of spatial derivatives eq 23 can be re written as the follows 26 v x i k 0 x i v i j 1 n s k j x i v j i 27 v y i k 0 y i v i j 1 n s k j y i v j i 28 2 v x 2 i k 0 x x i v i j 1 n s k j x x i v j i 29 2 v y 2 i k 0 y y i v i j 1 n s k j y y i v j i 30 2 v x y i k 0 x y i v i j 1 n s k j x y i v j i 3 2 2nd order runge kutta method since the boussinesq problem is actually a time dependent problem due to the time dependent terms in the governing equations in this paper the 2nd order rkm is used to discretize eqs 3 5 as one of the important explicit iterative methods the unknown generic value v at n 1 th time step can be explicitly calculated as follows 31 v v n δ t f v n 32 v n 1 v n 2 1 2 v δ t f v where δ t represents the time increment the physical values at the temporary the nth and the n 1 th step times are denoted by the superscripts n and n 1 respectively the generic variable v represents the component of velocity u and v of eqs 4 and 5 and the free surface elevation η of eq 3 respectively the f function is equal to the right hand side in each equation in eqs 3 5 for more detail information the reader can refer to zhang et al 2016b 3 3 applied gfdm to improved boussinesq model the collocation procedures to analyze the improved boussinesq problem by using the gfdm is described as follow in this paper the number of total nodes n n i n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 n b 4 are arranged in the computational domain among them n i n b 1 n b 2 n b 3 and n b 4 denote the number of nodes which are distributed inside computational domain along incident boundary absorbing boundary and two side wall boundaries respectively after the spatial coordinates of all nodes are determined performing the procedures for every node can acquire the expressions of spatial derivatives of every node in eqs 17 23 since the spatial positions of all nodes are fixed based on the euler approach within each time step the weighting coefficients for every node are determined at the beginning there are three different physical values u v and η in the improved boussinesq equations so these parameters will be solved by gfdm respectively firstly for free surface elevation η all interior node ought to satisfy the governing equation and the system of n i linear algebraic equations will be yielded 33 η i n 1 f η i i 1 2 3 n i where f η i i 1 n i are the dirichlet boundary datum by eq 3 inside the interior domain in addition every boundary node need to respectively satisfy the boundary condition i e the incident boundary condition absorbing boundary condition and two side wall boundary conditions then the system of linear algebraic equations will be yield as follow 34 η i n 1 h 2 r m cos ω t n 1 i n i 1 n i 2 n i 3 n i n b 1 35 η i n 1 0 i n i n b 1 1 n i n b 1 2 n i n b 1 3 n i n b 1 n b 2 36 η n

will be eventuated as 37 e η n n η n 1 n 1 g η n 1 where e η is a sparse coefficient matrix about η and can be efficiently solved g η is formed by combining the inhomogeneous term of the governing equation and the boundary data about η secondly two free surface velocity components u and v should be solved simultaneously since every interior node should satisfy the governing equation the system of 2n i linear algebraic equations will be yielded due to two different physical values 38 u i n 1 β 1 3 h i 2 2 u n 1 x 2 i β 1 3 h i 2 2 v n 1 x y i β 1 h i h x i u n 1 x i β 1 2 h i h y i v n 1 x i

where e u v is a sparse coefficient matrix about u and v g u v is formed by combining the homogeneous term of the governing equation and the boundary data about u and v once the above numerical system is established the numerical solutions of η u and v at all nodes whether they are inside computational domain or along boundary segment are acquired after being divided step by μ x y at the n 1 th time then the simulation can be proceeded to the next time step the flowchart of the proposed meshless numerical scheme for solving improved bets is indicated in fig 2 from the above descriptions it could be noticed that the complicated boussinesq equations can be solved by the simple and straightforward numerical procedure of the gfdm the four numerical examples about boussinesq model are selected for calibration and validation of the proposed numerical scheme in the following section 4 numerical results and comparisons the proposed numerical scheme is adopted to three selected numerical tests about the improved btes these popular and classical examples have been investigated by other numerical methods or experiments e g whalin 1971 isaacson 1978 berkhoff et al 1982 li et al 1999 sørensen et al 2004 in the past therefore the calibrated predictions were compared with previous numerical results and corresponding experimental data in addition a series of numerical experiments have been performed to study some factors of the proposed numerical scheme including the total nodes number n and the time increment δt 4 1 wave runup around a circular cylinder in the first numerical example the proposed meshless method is applied to the irregular domain demonstrated by wave propagation over the circular cylinder the case was one of the laboratory experiments firstly implemented by isaacson 1978 which was widely adopted to investigate the wave runup around a circular cylinder problem in the shallow water range due to the blockage of the cylinder which will lead to the diffraction reflection and wave runup around the cylinder it has some difficult for numerical method to prove the stability and accuracy of the numerical method this case has been presented to simulate waves propagating based on different governing equations such as boussinesq type equations li et al 1999 li and zhan 2001 zhan et al 2004 and shallow water equation swe liang and hsu 2009 liang and chen 2011 as well as n s equation choi et al 2011 the numerical flume is illustrated in fig 3 the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 3 4 m and 6 4 m respectively there is a circular cylinder in the center with radius r 0 25 m the boundary of cylinder is considered as impermeable no flux boundary so the nodes along cylinder boundary satisfy impermeable boundary conditions eqs 8 10 fig 4 shows the distribution of computation nodes and the number of total nodes in computational domain n 39268 and time increment δt 0 01 s three experimental cases of isaacson 1978 are used to test the validity of the numerical models in first two cases wave with wave period t 1 41 and 1 3 s were generated corresponding to the wave number k 4 m 1 wave height h 0 0463 m and the depth of still fluid h 0 12 m respectively which resulting in kr 1 in the third case wave with t 1 4 s were generated corresponding to k 5 2 m 1 h 0 03 m and h 0 08 m which resulting in kr 1 3 besides the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are set as 1 5 m and 0 2 in these cases the parameter of wave runup is defined as r α h i where α is the direction relative to the forward direction of x axis and r α is the maximum wave runup along this direction during computational time the wave runup around the cylinder is depicted in fig 5 compared the simulated results with li and zhan 2001 zhang et al 2006 and li et al 1999 fig 5 a compares the computed results with experimental data and li and zhan s 2001 numerical results for t 1 41s k 4 m 1 h 0 0463 m waves in fig 5 b the case for k 4 m 1 t 1 3s h 0 0463m is shown for the parameter of wave run up which compared with experimental data and zhang et al s 2006 predictions fig 5 c gives the same comparisons for t 1 4 s and k 5 2 m 1 compared with li et al s 1999 results it s obvious that the wave runup around the circular cylinder along different directions are different and hits the bottom at around α 15 20 but peaks at α 180 besides the value of the maximum wave runup increases with the reduce of wave period three numerical results of gfdm are in a good agreement with the experiments isaacson 1978 especially in third case which better than the results of fem li et al 1999 it is demonstrated that the proposed meshless scheme is more suitable for some irregular boundaries than fem fig 6 provides a 3 d presentation of free surface along the length of flume in the third case at t 8 5 s t 9 0 s t 9 5 s fig 6 a shows a wave impact the cylinder and runs up in the windward of the cylinder thereafter the wave passes and divides into the two sides because of the blockage of the cylinder the back scatted wave has been formed and can be founded in fig 6 b at t 9 5 s the wave passes the cylinder and next incoming wave hits the cylinder identically the process of wave diffraction by the circular cylinder is accurately exhibited 4 2 wave focusing over a semi circular shoal from the successful validation in the first cases the stable numerical wave field with non variable depth can be solved by proposed meshless scheme then wave field over the more complicate submarine topography will be focused on in the next two numerical examples so the variable depth should be considered the second case aim at a problem about waves propagating over a semi circular shoal leading the still water depth to gradually decrease from 0 4572 m to 0 1524 m of which the experimental setup was carried out by whalin 1971 as illustrate in fig 7 it is one of the classical cases for simulating the wave propagation combining refraction and diffraction which has been investigated many times by using different numerical method madsen and sørensen 1991 sørensen et al 2004 liu et al 2012 geng and zhao 2014 ricchiuto and filippinib 2014 bigoni et al 2016 in addition that the shoaling process in this example will occur energy transformation as well as refraction of wave add complexity and challenge to the simulation the still water depth h x y on the bottom topography is described as follows 47 h x y 0 4572 0 4572 10 67 g x 25 0 1524 0 x 10 67 g 10 67 g x 18 29 g 18 29 x 21 34 where g x y 6 096 y 1 2 0 y 6 096 the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 6 096 m and 36 576 m and the bottom topography is depicted in fig 7 the incident parameters of wave length λ wave period t wave height h and angle θ are set as 3 9 m 2 s 0 015 m and 0 respectively the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are 6 576 m and 0 2 the total simulation time is 50 s in addition number of total nodes and time increment are selected as 85561 and 0 01 respectively the schematic diagram of the free surface at t 49 5 s is illustrated in fig 8 fig 8 a shows the free surface elevation along centreline by the comparisons between the numerical results from the gfdm the fem sørensen et al 2004 and the fdm madsen and sørenson 1992 the results from three different schemes are almost identified to each other furthermore based on the linear theory the incident wave is linear when it enters the flume from the incident boundary nevertheless as the wave propagates on this topography it becomes steeper and more nonlinear due to the semi circular shoal fig 8 b correspond to the contour plot of free surface at t 49 5 s they clearly reveal the wave focusing and wave diffraction due to bottom topography then under the influence of wave diffraction the wave energy dissipates gradually after focusing the wave amplitudes of the first three harmonics along the centerline based on fft analysis are demonstrated in fig 9 in which the result of the gfdm is compared with the experimental data whalin 1971 the fem results sørensen et al 2004 and the gpc results daniele et al 2016 quite obviously a satisfactory estimation of the first and third harmonic is achieved while the second harmonic is somewhat underestimated comparing with the results of fem and gpc about from x 24 m 28 m the wave amplitude of the three harmonics are increasing with distance at the semi circular shoal from x 15 m 25 m it indicates that a significant amount of energy is transferred to the higher frequency components due to the wave refraction diffraction 4 3 wave refraction and diffraction over an elliptic shoal a rather difficult example in which the wave propagates over obliquely shoaling bottom topography and obliquely elliptic oriented shoal with 20 angle between incoming wave and shoal as depicted in fig 10 is simulated by gfdm to solve the improved btes previously we have succeeded in simulating this example by means of using gfdm to solve mild slope equations zhang et al 2018 now it is reapplied as the last case in this paper as illustrated in fig 10 a the width of flume a and the length of flume b are 20 m and 27 m in the computational domain in this numerical example the origin is re located i e the wave maker is arranged at x 10 m and the solid walls is set correspondingly at y 10 m and y 10 m the absorbing boundary at x 12 m has a sponge layer as depicted in fig 10 b the still water depth out of range of the shoal is described as follows 48 h 0 x y 0 45 0 45 0 02 5 82 y r y r 5 82 y r 5 82 where x r y cos 20 x sin 20 y r y sin 20 x cos 20 because the improved btes in this paper isn t very suitable for the breaking wave model the position of the very steep slope near the free surface is flattened to keep the numerical stability which is showed in fig 10 b the total still water depth h x y on bottom topography is expressed as follows 49 h x y h 0 x y 0 125 h 0 x y 0 3 0 5 1 x r 5 2 y r 3 75 2 x r 4 2 y r 3 2 1 and h 0 0 125 h 0 0 125 x r 4 2 y r 3 2 1 the incident wave length λ wave period t wave height h and incident angle θ are 1 485 m 1 s 0 0464 m and 0 respectively the length of sponge layer ds and the special parameter δd in the sponge layer are 2 m and 0 3 the total simulation time is 40 s in addition the number of total nodes and time increment are adopted as 74659 and 0 01 respectively in this paper the normalized wave height is defined as h d h in which h d denoted the wave height in the computational domain and given as η max η min for one stable wave period the numerical results for distributions of normalized wave height at eight different sections x 1 m 3 m 5 m 7 m 9 m and y 2 m 0 m 2 m depicted as in fig 11 are almost identified to the experimental data berkhoff et al 1982 the fem predictions walkley and berzins 2002 the fvm predictions delis et al 2016 and the funwave model kirby et al 1998 the main peaks are basically captured accurately by proposed meshless method except few secondary peaks compared to fem fvm and funwave model from fig 11 a 11 e it can be obviously found that the symmetry and periodicity of the wave lost behind the elliptic shoal due to the wave diffraction refraction the wave diffraction phenomenon will cause reduction of the wave height on the boundary of the elliptic shoal fig 11 f and 11 h whereas the increases on the top of the obstacle fig 11 g fig 12 exhibits the three dimensional free surface profiles at t 37 00 s the wave deformation is clearly indicated due to the focusing effect of the elliptic shoal from the above numerical models it s demonstrated that the proposed meshless scheme is fully applied in the wave field on more complex topography and the wave profiles are almost accurately captured 5 conclusions and discussions the paper represents a truly meshless numerical scheme which combined the gfdm the rkm based on the euler approach the ramping function and the sponge layer is proposed to precisely investigate the waves propagation problems governed by the improved btes firstly the improved btes are transformed by a treatment of the spatial derivatives in order to simplify calculation of 3rd order partial derivatives then the 2nd order rkm and the gfdm are adopted for temporal and spatial discretization respectively through the above application the numerical model of the improved btes can be successfully established by addressing a sparse system of linear algebraic equations the validation of the present numerical model is conducted through four classical numerical examples to investigate the merit and applicability in the simulation of water wave propagation and deformation derived from the improved btes the advantage of gfdm to dealing with the irregular domain is examined by the wave runup problem in the first example fortunately compared with experiment data and fem predictions satisfactory results are achieved by the proposed scheme in last two examples wave propagating in complex bottom topography is studied by gfdm and the wave profiles under diffraction refraction condition are almost precisely acquired moreover the energy transformation of wave in this process is accurately captured based on fft analysis in general it s concluded that the proposed numerical model is fully adopted in the engineering including some wave field on the complex topography and accurately capture the wave profiles from satisfactory results the improved btes are based on the ideal fluid so the proposed numerical model is only applied in the nonlinear water waves when the viscosity is not dominant to develop numerical models considering viscous effect are focuses of

22103,in this study we propose a new design of prefabricated hollow blocks which are made of pervious concrete the effects of thickness of block walls are studied to optimize an adequate size the comparison of performance of porous and solid blocks is studied through fluid solid interaction models a polyhedral finite element formulation pfem is employed to analyse responses of the structure under equivalent static and dynamic wave load conditions the effectiveness of pfem is verified by comparing the obtained results with those of standard finite element method fem using the commercial software ansys their accuracy is also proved via the validation model of a step beam in which the natural frequencies are used for comparison in static analysis the maximum displacement of block increases rapidly when porosity of concrete changes from 5 to 35 the optimum porosity is found to be around 20 the variable thickness of the block walls reasonably affects the displacement resistance however compared to porosity the influence of thickness is not significant the change of poisson s ratio slightly affects the responses of the block for dynamic analysis the vibration of pervious concrete block types under the impact of wave load with small duration 20 ms lasts longer than the case attacked by long duration shock around 50 ms however the amplitudes of displacement responses by long duration impact wave are greater than that of short impact study also showed that the porous concrete block could significantly reduce the run down pressure acting on the structure compared to solid block keywords pervious concrete variable porosity polyhedral finite element method static and dynamic wave load run down pressure 1 introduction pervious concrete an environmentally friendly material has been increasingly attracted interest in construction industry in recent years it is a very effective structure to control storm water runoff on pavement because of the characteristic of allowing water running through its connected voids however according to the best authors knowledge even though there are a number of studies on porous sea wall revetment or breakwater jensen et al 2014 alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016a 2016b losada et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2015 the research of coastal defence structures using porous concrete is still very limited porous concrete is made from water cement and coarse aggregates herein most or all sand and fine aggregates are omitted from normal concrete high water infiltration rate is the result of interconnected pores running through concrete structure pervious concrete is used as a sustainable material in wide range of constructions which could be sidewalks retaining walls car parks green house floors tennis courts drains plants purification and other low traffic roads great advantages of pervious concrete have been recorded over many years in comparison to conventional concrete such as less drying shrinkage considerably reducing cement coating better thermal insulation storm water runoff capturing suspended solids hydrocarbon pollution control and groundwater recharge kia et al 2017 adewumi et al 2016 in pavement constructions permeable concrete can reduce over 90 of peak flows and 43 of surface water runoff it can significantly decrease costs by limiting storm water management systems jennifer drake and asce 2014 the waste from traffic vehicles which are suspended solids and motor oil can be filtered to improve groundwater quality welker et al 2013 in hydraulic environment porous concrete has been increasingly used in recent years the porous concrete pipes are used for underdrains the astm c654 standard indicates the required specifications of porous pipes for pervious concrete the porosity inversely affects material strength unlike conventional concrete which requires minimized porosity for better structural and functional performance pervious concrete needs to increase porosity as much as possible for its permeable characteristic total porosity is typically from 15 to 30 and pore sizes are from 2 mm to 8 mm based on aggregate type and compaction method adewumi et al 2016 aci 522r 10 2010 strength of pervious concrete is not usually the same for similar mixture a consistent trend has been reported that strength of pervious concrete both compression and tension decreased when porosity increased alam and haselbach 2014a deo and neithalath 2010a 2011 zhong and wille 2016 however greater porosity allows more infiltration rate this requires attention on the relation between porosity and strength of pervious concrete to balance its structural performance with functional performance while compressive strengths of conventional concretes range from 24 1 mpa to 34 5 mpa and tensile strengths range from 2 4 mpa to 4 1 mpa dhatt and touzot 1985 compressive strengths of pervious concretes typically range from 3 4 to 27 6 mpa and tensile strengths range from 1 0 to 3 8 mpa tennis et al 2004 however greater pervious concrete strength is possible by using additional admixtures or and high strength cement zhong and wille reported that compressive strength of pervious concrete using ultra high strength matrix can reach 65 8 mpa corresponding to 19 8 of total porosity zhong and wille 2016 various functional relations between porosity and strength of porous media based on empirical models have been reported herein strength was linearly derived from porosity by hasselmann hasselman and fulrath 1964 power relation by balshin 1949 exponential relation by ryshkevitch ryshkewitch 1953 chindaprasirt chindaprasirt et al 2009 and lian lian et al 2011 logarithmic relation by schiller 1971 and deo et al deo and neithalath 2010b studies for stated equations evaluation have been performed in which the linear equation was simple and high accurate to determine strength of normal pervious concrete based on total porosity a reason for limited use of pervious concrete is its weakness in surface abrasion resistant however this can be improved by adding reinforced fibres or and admixture into paste matrix kevern et al 2015 reported that pervious concretes using macro synthetic fibres could inversely reduce abrasion and increase freeze thaw durability even though compressive and tensile strengths were not significantly affected yang and jiang 2003 used silica fume and reported that superplasticizer added to common materials could also greatly increase abrasion resistant water penetration and strength of pervious concrete seawalls or revetments are coastal structures protecting coastline dike slope from erosion they are made from sand bags blockwork gabion concrete etc under the attack of wave armour structures are at risk of damage caused by external and internal pressures on the structure as known a popular mechanism causing the failure of dikes is that the negative pressure acts on the protected slope and strips out the armour layer the total loading on the protected slope seawall is induced by wave actions on cover layer earth and pore pressures corresponding to phreatic surface during the wave running down the hydraulic pressure on concrete block decreases significantly but the pore pressure is nearly constant which leads to uplift or slide parts of the protection armour subsequently the slope is vulnerable to erosion and collapse pilarczyk et al 1995 burger et al 1989 however with the application of pervious concrete block the stated pore pressure can also be reduced due to ability to allow water passing through its structure in addition the porous seawall can significantly reduce wave run up and reflection which leads to the reduction in local scour of the structure compared to impermeable type koraim et al 2014 consequently the seawall could be more stable in this study porous concrete is applied for sea defence structure in order to take advantage of its permeability the studied elements are prefabricated concrete blocks which form step wall protecting slope of sea dike see fig 1 recently the polyhedral finite element method pfem has been increasingly applied to analyse structural responses because of its flexible ability in meshing complex structure as well as inversely reducing number of dofs brezzi et al 2005 chin et al 2015 however most cases used complicated shape functions and applied to simple structures such as cantilever beam and cube rashid and selimotic 2006 bishop 2014 the piecewise linear shape function used in pfem is simple and proved to be more accurate than wachspress laplace and mean value shape functions nguyen xuan 2017 in this study pfem is used to analyse 3d porous concrete block under static and dynamic wave loads shortly this article numerically investigates the application of the prefabricated concrete block in step type seawall structure the structural performances of the block under static and dynamic wave loads are studied for static analysis the following factors are considered the porosity is ranging from 5 to 35 and the thickness of block is changing from 10 cm to 15 cm in the direction perpendicular to seawall line additionally the lower and upper bounds of poisson s ratios are also investigated for their effects on responses of the studied structure for dynamic analysis we determine the natural frequencies of the first six modes of the pervious concrete block and the transient responses of the block under the effect of experimental data of impact breaking wave the 2d wave block interaction is studied to compare the performance of pervious concrete block with conventional concrete block the latest pfem using piecewise linear shape function is applied to analyse the structure its effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using experimental data and verified using standard fem and commercial software ansys the four point bending test results of pervious concrete beam reported in ref chandrappa and biligiri 2018 are compared with static responses obtained from ansys model for validation which will be used as reference data the other numerical dynamic models for complex geometry structure are validated by comparing their calculation with experimental natural frequencies of an aluminium step beam reported in ref jaworski and dowell 2008 eventually the dam break model in ref lara et al 2012 is used to verify the fluid solid interaction model derived from ansys fluent 2 background on pervious concrete with porosity 2 1 concrete material with porosity pervious concrete properties which are modulus of elasticity density infiltration rate compressive and tensile strength are proved to be functions of porosity deo and neithalath 2010a agar ozbek et al 2013 xu et al 2018 shi and chen 2018 alam and haselbach 2014b fig 2 the porosity depends on many factors such as compaction method ratio of water to cement ratio of aggregate to cement aggregate sizes etc while increasing pore content tends to reduce density modulus of elasticity and strength resistant of pervious concrete the permeability characteristic is positively increased therefore porosity can be set as the governing parameter from which other properties of porous concrete are determined based on their functional relation various equations have been generally developed for porous media that indicated the effect of porosity on compressive strength ryshkevitch ryshkewitch 1953 introduced the empirical equation of the decrease of compressive strength as f c f c o exp n p where p is the porosity f c o is the compressive strength of matrix at zero void ratio p 0 and n is the empirical constant chindaprasirt chindaprasirt et al 2009 and lian lian et al 2011 also developed similar equations based on analytical and experimental data as f c f c o exp m n ξ p and f c f c o 1 p m e n p respectively where m is empirical coefficient balshin 1949 presented an alternative relation power function as f c f c o 1 p n hasselmann s formula hasselman and fulrath 1964 was originally developed for projecting young s modulus of porous glass which can be linearly derived from porosity as 1 f c f c o 1 n p zhong and wille 2016 validated all the stated equations in predicting compressive strength of pervious concrete using experimental data of concrete with matrix strengths between 29 mpa and 174 mpa and they also proposed their own formula as 2 f c f c o 1 n p d d o m where d and d o are the aggregate size and the smallest aggregate size respectively they proved that for normal strength pervious concrete the linear equation gave the most accurate prediction of compressive strength in this case eq 1 and eq 2 give the same results as in ref zhong and wille 2016 3 f c f c o 1 2 1 p whereas for high strength pervious concrete the coefficient n of 2 6 was found to give the reasonable linear prediction of f c eq 2 can produce better results but the application is limited by aggregate size therefore the linear equation is preferred in this study for general cases the value of elastic modulus must be predefined for numerical static analysis goede 2009 proposed equation for predicting modulus of elasticity in the terms of density and compressive strength as e 39 1 w p c 1 5 f c where w pc is the density of pervious concrete however alam et al 2012 reported that the young s modulus predicted by goede was greater than that of cores drilled from the porous pavement aci 318 aci 318 11 2011 and aashto aashto 2012 standards give more reasonable results even though the equations are for predicting elastic modulus of normal concrete which are e 33 w p c 1 5 f c psi and e 0 043 w p c 1 5 f c mpa respectively ghafoori and dutta 2002 presented a similar elastic modulus equation for pervious concrete as 4 e 32 88 w p c 1 5 f c psi converting eq 4 into metric unit system gives 5 e 0 0426 w p c 1 5 f c mpa where w p c is in kg m3 and f c is the compressive strength of pervious concrete in mpa this equation is close to those proposed in aci 318 and aashto standards hence we will use eq 5 for predicting elastic modulus of pervious concrete in this study substituting eq 3 into eq 5 gives 6 e 0 0426 w p c 1 5 f c o 1 2 1 p to determine young s modulus e the unit weight w pc of pervious concrete is needed the density and porosity of pervious concrete are reported to be ranged from 1570 kg m3 to 1938 kg m3 and from 10 to 29 respectively ghafoori and dutta 2002 however higher values of density with the same porosity have been later reported in refs ibrahim et al 2014 liu et al 2018 due to differences in material properties and additional admixture liu et al 2018 experimentally developed an equation to predict density in terms of total porosity as follows 7 w p c 2491 2550 p substituting eq 7 into eq 6 young s modulus can be determined by function of porosity as 8 e 0 0426 2491 2550 p 1 5 f c o 1 2 1 p based on previous experimental and theoretical researches of pervious concrete the following assumptions are used in this study the modulus of elasticity of pervious concrete is predicted in terms of porosity by using eq 8 for normal strength pervious concrete material in pavement construction the porosity of concrete distributes un equality in vertical direction due to compaction nevertheless the considered concrete block is prefabricated in order to improve the quality as well as the homogeneity of material hence an assumption is made that the distribution of porosity is uniform in all directions of the concrete structure consequently young s modulus is constant for each value of porosity poisson s ratio variability of pervious concrete is higher than that of conventional concrete it ranges from 0 13 to 0 34 average of 0 22 which was reported in ref goede 2009 typically the average value is used in this study except for the investigation of the effect of poisson s ratio since the macrosynthetic fibre does not significantly affect the compressive and tensile strength of pervious concrete kevern et al 2015 its effect can be neglected in this study however it should be taken into account for further study of water infiltration and free thaw performance 2 2 pervious hollow concrete block the studied structure is a 3d prefabricated innovative hollow block made of pervious concrete the block is an interlocking element of step type seawall see fig 3 the detail dimensions of the block are shown in fig 4 whereas the patterns on the inclined surfaces of the upper part are simplified because they have no effect on strength resistant of the block the main reason of those patterns are to dissipate wave energy as the result reducing wave overtopping due to problems of casting and erosion steel bars should not be used in reinforcing the block but macro synthetic fibres which can increase the surface abrasion of pervious concrete are good option the block is hollow inside and is filled by sand on site based on the construction process there are two main states of loading on the block 1 the block is erected but not filled by sand inside and on the back 2 the block is in fully working condition that sand is filled inside on front up to half of block depth and on the back of the block fig 3 the former loading condition is more dangerous for strength limit state and is considered in this study the performance of interlocking pervious concrete block model at the later state service state is not considered within the scope of this study however following this article the interaction of waves and the complete interlocking seawall will be further investigated in addition for porous concrete the fatigue life is an important factor affecting the life of structure which can be improved significantly by adding chemical admixtures polymers chen et al 2013 for instances for statics analysis the porosity of pervious concrete ranges from 5 to 35 to investigate displacement and tensile stress responses of the block we also consider the thickness of the front and back walls of the block changing from 10 cm to 15 cm as well as the effect of poisson s ratio variation for dynamic analysis we study the first 6 mode natural frequencies of the block with 20 porosity and the transient responses under the impact wave loads reported in hofland et al 2012 and salih kirkgöz 1991 3 computational modelling by polyhedral finite element the pervious hollow concrete block has complex geometry and it is modelled as a solid structure the pfem is proved to be effective in meshing and analysing 3d complicated shape structures rashid and selimotic 2006 bishop 2014 nguyen xuan 2017 therefore besides determining static and dynamic responses of the block this study also validates the pfem using linear piecewise linear shape functions over arbitrary polyhedral elements which is the simple method but can provide high accuracy the obtained results by pfem are compared to those of standards fem using linear tetrahedral elements and commercial software ansys using high order basic functions the pfem divides structural domain into polyhedral elements which can be convex polyhedrons with triangular faces warren 1996 or regular arbitrary faces idelsohn et al 2003 the most general polyhedral element is an arbitrary 3d domain surrounded by non planar faces bishop 2014 the finite element matrices force matrix and stiffness matrix are constructed based on sub tetrahedrons divided from polyhedral element let us consider a mechanical problem in equilibrium state of

shape function over a 3d polyhedral element with n vertices v 1 v i 1 v i v n is constructed by dividing the element into sub tetrahedral domains where each sub domain is built by connecting two adjacent vertices v i 1 v i face centroid x c and element centroid x pc fig 5 nguyen ngoc et al 2019 the piece wise linear shape functions are as follows 14 φ i pl x j 1 4 φ j t 4 x φ i pl x j for x ω

fem codes are compiled in matlab program more details can be seen in ref nguyen ngoc et al 2019 for static analysis the main pfem coding procedure is illustrated in the flowchart in fig 6 the natural

with γ β 0 5 0 25 the approximated displacements are unconditionally stable the dynamic analysis process in matlab is generally similar to the static case in fig 6 however additional matrices of m and c need to be assembled and the applied force is built for every time step then the displacements of the systems are approximated explicitly by using eq 20 to eq 22 4 experimental validation 4 1 elastostatic pervious beam the effectiveness of predicting equations in section 2 1 for fem analysis is validated by comparing the results obtained from ansys models with flexural pervious concrete beam experimental test reported in ref chandrappa and biligiri 2018 the beams have the dimensions of 100 100 500 mm see fig 7 the material mixtures are various with different aggregate sizes combinations water cement ratios and cement aggregate ratios since the compressive strength of the tested pervious concrete was not presented it is analysed based on eq 1 f c f c 0 1 n p with n 2 6 and the matrix strength f c0 61 mpa which is obtained from the similar cement matrix ingredients reported in ref zhong and wille 2016 for high strength pervious concrete the elastic young s modulus e is predicted using eq 5 to analyse the elastic behaviour of the beams a force p 0 3p max is applied the results are listed in table 1 in which the middle beam deflection and tensile stress at the bottom are used for comparison the beam ids in the table are originally used in the 4 points test which indicates different mixtures of pervious concrete as it can be seen that the gaps of deflection between ansys models and experimental data are reasonable however the numerical tensile stresses agree well with experimental results it can be observed from the validation results that the proposed analysis procedure can be used for predicting preliminary elastostatic responses of pervious concrete structure with wide range of concrete mixtures besides ansys results can be used as reference solution in this study in table 1 the difference is calculated by using the following formulae 23 difference result fem result test result test x 100 4 2 model verification for dynamic analysis of complex geometry to validate the accuracy of commercial software ansys numerical methods pfem and fem used in this study the experimental natural frequencies of a cantilever step beam reported in ref jaworski and dowell 2008 are used for comparison the beam is 463 55 mm in length 3 175 mm in width the details of other dimensions are shown in fig 8 the beam is made of aluminium with young s modulus e of 60 6 gpa and density ρ of 2664 kg m3 since poisson s ratio was not reported it is assumed to be 0 3 in this validation model the beam is mesh using 40000 hexahedral elements in ansys model around 33000 tetrahedral elements and polyhedral elements in fem and pfem analyses respectively fig 9 the results are shown in table 2 in which m 1l and m 2l are the first and second lateral bending modes while m 1b is the first in plain bending mode fig 10 in addition the table also shows the differences in percentage between values of corresponding methods and experimental data as it can be seen 1 8 is the maximum deviation of ansys s results where the difference of pfem is 3 3 and of fem is 27 5 those values are acceptable except for fem s results which are not yet converge with respect to 33000 tetrahedral elements fig 11 compares the convergence of the first natural frequency analysed by using pfem and fem the figure shows that convergence rate of fem is much slower than that of pfem the reference and exp jaworski and dowell 2008 lines are the results of ansys and experimental test respectively corresponding to mode m 1l presenting in table 2 4 3 fluid solid interaction model validation in this section the comparison of interaction between fluid porous concrete block and fluid conventional concrete block is carried out the dam breaking model reported by lara et al 2012 is used to validate the interaction model in ansys fluent the original experimental data was presented by wu 2004 the dimensions of dam breaking tank are showed in fig 12 in which the prism is considered for two cases of solid media and porous media with porosity of 0 5 the medium mesh of 1 1 0 5 cm and the other parameters of the model are used as suggested by lara et al 2012 the results of velocity is shown in fig 13 of force acting on the prism in fig 14 and of water surface at 0 5 s in fig 15 as it can be seen the predicted values of ansys model are generally smaller than the experimental results however the maximum values and distribution trends are acceptable 5 numerical analysis 5 1 static analysis as stated in section 2 2 the studied 3d block made of pervious concrete is an innovative design forming the interlocking step seawall in this study we consider the case of block being erected the inside and the back have not filled by sand yet consequently the block is attacked by sea wave which is equalized to uniform distribution pressure varying linearly from 28 kpa to 26 kpa from the top of the block the lateral displacements of block sides y direction are set to be 0 because they are constrained by connecting with the adjacent blocks forming interlocking structure the three factors affecting strength resistant of the block are porosity thickness and poisson s ratio the porosity of pervious concrete ranges from 5 to 35 which includes the regular porosity range from 15 to 30 adewumi et al 2016 aci 522r 10 2010 we also consider the variable thickness of the front and back walls of the block varying from 10 cm to 15 cm and the effects of upper and lower bounds of poisson s ratio of 0 34 and 0 13 respectively the outputs from the analysis are the displacement and tensile stress responses of the block the former is investigated on edge 1 2 and the latter on edge 3 4 see fig 16 5 1 1 variable porosity the effect of porosity on the linearly elastic responses of pervious concrete block under static load is presented in this section the concrete block is modelled as a solid structure to compared the performance between two numerical methods about 20000 elements are used the material properties are functions in porosity which include the compressive strength the density and young s modulus predicted by eqs 3 7 and 8 respectively moreover the tensile strength f t mpa of pervious concrete is preliminary determined based on its compressive strength aashto 2012 i e 24 f t 0 45 f c in all results figures pfem represents the results analysed by polyhedral finite element method using piecewise linear shape function whereas fem is the results of standard finite element method using conventional linear shape functions the results from ansys software is denoted as reference fig 17 and fig 18 show the displacements of edge 1 2 in which the maximum displacement at end 2 with respect to different concrete porosities along x and z axes are presented as it can be seen from those figures when porosity is less than 24 the maximum displacement rises gradually however the rising curves are steeper when porosity of pervious concrete is over 24 fig 19 shows the maximum tensile stress along edge 3 4 it can be observed that the tensile stress only depends on applied load and geometry of the block the increase of porosity does not affect the stress responses even though it adversely influences the displacement and tensile stress of the studied block therefore to make sure that adequate relationship between structural and functional performances of the block take place the porosity of 20 is chosen as the optimum value for further investigation fig 20 and fig 21 show the distribution of x displacement along edge 1 2 and tensile stress along edge 3 4 for porosity of 20 in fig 21 the stress distribution is not smooth this can be explained that for linear shape function stress in each element is constant as a consequence stress is fluctuated corresponding to non uniform elements 5 1 2 variable thickness and poisson s ratio pervious concrete is widely used in design of environmentally friendly pavement however its applications in other constructions such as seawall structures are very limited and lacking of design standard therefore it is necessary to investigate the sizes of studied block the original design of the block is for conventional concrete with thickness of front and back walls of 9 cm ba ria vung tau urban s nevertheless pervious concrete panel should be thicker and should not be smaller than 10 cm thick goede 2009 the range from 10 cm to 15 cm of the thickness of front and back walls is studied in order to find the optimized block fig 22 poisson s ratio of pervious concrete varies within a wider range 0 13 0 34 compared to conventional concrete 0 15 0 20 goede 2009 consequently this study investigates the effect of poisson s ratio on static responses of the block by comparing its behaviour under three different ratios of 0 13 0 22 and 0 34 which are the lower bound average and upper bound respectively fig 23 and fig 24 show the maximum displacements along x axis of edge 1 2 with various thickness and porosity fig 23 is the results determined by pfem with around 40000 polyhedral elements as demonstrated in the figure when the thickness increases the displacement decreases which is the obvious trend however compared to the rise of displacement based on increase porosity the effect of block thickness is less significant the figure also re verifies that when porosity is higher than about 25 the displacement rises dramatically fig 24 compares the displacements calculated by pfem and fem with the number of elements around 40000 the maximum tensile stresses along edge 3 4 in conjunction with changing thickness of the block are illustrated in fig 25 since the analysed tensile stress is independent of porosity of concrete the figure only shows its reducing trend with increase thickness the ratios of tensile strength p 20 versus analysed tensile stress of block with 10 cm and 15 cm thickness are 1 24 and 1 48 respectively the results obtained for different values of poisson s ratios from ansys models are shown in figs 25 and 26 black lines in which the presentative porosity of 20 is used for analysis in those figures the dot lines are the results of lower bound ratio μ 0 13 whereas black continuous lines are obtained from average ratio μ 0 22 and the dash lines represent upper bound results μ 0 34 as it can be seen that the effect of poisson s ratio on tensile strength is greater than the effect on displacement of the studied block in additional compare to the average ratio the upper bounds give smaller responses than the lower bounds however the results obtained from lower bounds and average ratio agree very well difference is 1 62 in average for stress and 0 17 for displacement the results of upper bounds are smaller than those of average ratio by 3 67 for stress and 1 54 for displacement from the results of static analysis the porosity of concrete shows its significant effect on deformation of the pervious concrete block with the preliminary designed of box shape block the effect of thickness of front and back walls changing from 10 cm to 15 cm on responses of block is not as significant as the effect of variable porosity moreover the effect of poisson s ratio variability is not significant in this study and the average ratio give conservative responses therefore the block with 10 cm thickness 20 porosity and poisson s ratio of 0 22 are chosen for dynamic analysis 5 2 dynamic analysis the studied blocks protect a sea dike which is regularly under attacks of wave therefore dynamic responses of the block are necessary to investigate the obtained results of pfem are compared with those of standard fem and ansys firstly the first six modes of natural frequencies are analysed secondly transient responses of the block under the impact wave loads are studied using the experimental data reported in hofland et al 2012 and salih kirkgöz 1991 5 2 1 natural frequencies as mentioned in the static analysis the block has 10 cm thickness and porosity of pervious concrete is 20 the other material properties are predicted using eqs 7 and 8 which yield young s modulus e of 16923 mpa and density ρ of 1981 kg m3 fig 27 shows the values of the first six natural frequencies of the studied model the results are analysed by pfem and fem using around 20000 elements for the first mode the difference of natural frequency between pfem and reference is 2 4 while that difference between fem and reference is 4 3 those differences for second mode are 1 4 and 2 4 for pfem and fem respectively furthermore table 3 lists the values of natural frequencies of the first six modes in the table concrete porosity 2 represents conventional concrete where porosity 20 is the pervious concrete block the first natural frequency of the block made of pervious concrete reduces by 16 compared to conventional concrete which leads to the lower resonant frequency of applied loads for pervious concrete structure figs 28 to 30 illustrate the shape of block deformation corresponding to its first six modes 5 2 2 transient analysis if the motion of load is too slow the responses of inertia forces are sufficiently small and can be neglected as a result the analysis model can be considered as static model otherwise a dynamic analysis should be performed in this section we investigate the dynamic responses of pervious concrete block under the attack of load as a function of time the loads applied on the studied block are the impact wave loads with high acceleration which were experimentally measured by hofland et al 2012 and kirkgöz salih kirkgöz 1991 hofland et al carried out the impact wave test in the delta flume for measuring large impact pressure on vertical wall in their test the water depth varies from h 2 5 m to h 4 25 m and wave height is kept constant as 0 6h the impact loads of flip through and air pocket breaking waves using in this study are showed in fig 31 and fig 32 respectively flip through impact pressure has duration of around 20 ms and air pocket impact pressure duration is about 50 ms the impact load data of generally breaking wave from kirkgöz test shown in fig 33 was conducted with smaller wave height 0 258 m and water depth 0 61 m in comparison to the test of hofland et al 2012 the newmark method is used to analyse the transient problems by solving eq 13 for conservative results the damping of block is neglected in this analysis the time dependent results obtained by pfem will be compared with those obtained by standard fem and ansys reference the pervious concrete block also possesses 20 porosity and 10 cm thickness the transient displacements at end 2 of edge 1 2 are displayed in figs 34 to 36 corresponding to the impact pressures presented in figs 31 to 33 as it can be seen in those figures the amplitude of vibration generated by shorter duration impact wave lasts longer we consider two representative impact loads which have long duration impact as in fig 32 and short duration impact as in fig 33 because the peak pressure in all cases are quite high compared to static wave load and building conditions we further considered time dependent reduced pressures as shown in fig 37 and fig 38 the corresponding results of transient displacements and stresses are presented in figs 39 to 42 it can be observed that the oscillation responses are similar to the cases using original experimental data in comparison to static analysis the maximum displacement of long duration impact load is 13 higher while that difference is 7 lower for the case of short duration impact nevertheless the tensile stresses are higher for both cases of impact loads than the static stress i e 9 and 5 respectively as it can be observed from those figures on the one hand the effect of long duration shock waves on maximum displacements and stresses is more critical than that of short duration on the other hand the vibration of the block caused by fast impact lasts longer which may lead to the problem of fatigue fortunately the maximum stress responses in both cases of impact loads are smaller compared to tensile strength of pervious concrete material 2 0 mpa 5 3 interaction of wave and studied block the outperformance of porous concrete block compared to conventional block in wave solid interaction is studied by using the model in fig 43 the figure also indicates locations for measuring pressure acting on the block by wave the 2d model is used instead of 3d model for reducing computer resources as well as processing time but it still ensures the required comparison between the analyses the model is 24 5 m long and 6 5 m high based on the validation model the mesh in wave region is 3 1 5 cm with quadrilateral elements and at block region a fine local mesh with triangle elements is introduced fig 44 the built in open wave channel is used to generate intermediate wave fig 45 shows the generated wave for both cases of a section at 19 m from wave generation source 1 m in front of porous block which is not affected by reflection wave and used for comparison for the porous block the whole model of block with filled in sand is presented with their respective porosity of 20 and 57 and d 50 of 6 cm and 0 3 cm whereas the solid block is modelled as a wall fig 46 shows the pressure history generated by wave on the point gauge as it can be seen from the figure the pressure caused by run up wave are similar for both cases however the huge gap occurs when the wave is run down the minimum negative pressure acting on gauge of solid block is about quadruped porous pressure the details of pressure distributions for two critical cases of pressure on the studied edge red line in fig 43 are presented in fig 47 it is observed that the maximum porous pressure is around 7 less than solid pressure fig 48 compares the velocity distribution of wave acting on the blocks for critical cases of run up and run down wave the similar trend of smaller velocity for porous block is obtained 6 discussion the pervious concrete has been analysed based on the developed empirical equations the rationality of the concrete properties predictions has already evaluated and verified for a wide range of material mixtures from average strength to high performance strength eq 8 was derived for normal strength pervious concrete however it can also be extendedly used for high strength pc by just using suitable empirical coefficient as described in section 2 1 the verification models were performed to prove the feasibility of the present method although the pervious concrete was verified with the porosities from 21 1 to 32 6 which is smaller range compared to 5 35 of the studied cases the empirical formulations are obtained from experiments of concrete with porosities around 10 30 so that the confidence of studied results can be inductively covered besides various aggregate mixtures can perform in the different ways it is the nature of concrete material which cannot be exactly evaluated by any particular equation for more accurate results the test samples are required with respect to each concrete structures therefore this study can be considered as a novel numerical model for preliminary prediction of elasticity responses of porous concrete structure the proposed seawall block made of micro synthetic fibre porous concrete was studied for the strength limit state the boundary conditions were predicted from short period of blocks construction which can be positively chosen to avoid extreme case of sea waves this study does not propose ingredients for porous concrete material however there are a number of previous studies that can make porous concrete with acceptable porosity strength and durability zhong and wille 2016 chen et al 2013 the proposed concrete blocks inherit the previous empirical and theoretical researches of pervious concrete material therefore this study contributes not only by the new structural application but also by the preliminary numerical investigation of pervious concrete structure this study investigates the pervious concrete block working as an individual element under the equivalent static and dynamic wave load further study should be carried out to improve the proposed model such as developing the full model of wave seawall interaction to investigate working responses of the whole interlocking structure under more realistic wave actions even though the various concrete mixtures are mediating studied via the empirical equations the properties of specific mixture may be differed due to ingredients casting or compaction method therefore experimental test of the proposed block should be studied in addition pfem is an effective and accurate method in analysing elastic structure its application in fluid calculation is a wide field of interest 7 conclusion in this study we investigated the performances of the innovative prefabricated hollow blocks which were made of pervious concrete with porosity varying from 5 to 35 the variation in thickness of block walls and poisson s ratio were also studied in order to find adequate dimensions the pervious concrete block was subjected to static and dynamic loads for static analysis the wave load is equalized as a distribution pressure the experimental impact wave loads were used for dynamic analysis in addition the outperformance of pervious concrete block compared to conventional block in interaction with wave was demostrated through fluid solid model in ansys fluent the developed polyhedral finite element method using piecewise linear shape function pfem was used as an up to date numerical method for solid structures the effectiveness of pfem in analysis of 3d complex structure are verified by comparing the results with standard fem and commercial ansys software some conclusions are derived as follows in static analysis the maximum displacement of block increases gradually when porosity of concrete changes from 5 to about 24 when porosity keeps rising more than 24 the maximum displacement increases dramatically thickness of front and back walls of the studied block changing from 10 cm to 15 cm reasonably affects the displacement resistance however the effect of variable thickness is not significant in comparison to porosity of concrete material in dynamic analysis the transient oscillation responses of the block under fast impact wave load 20 ms last much longer than vibration caused by slow impact about 50 ms with the same peak amplitude the long duration impact waves have greater effect on maximum displacement and stress responses of the pervious concrete than short duration impact waves in addition both types of dynamic loads cause higher responses than static load the optimum porosity is found to be around 20 for the adequate relationship between structural and functional performances the application of pervious concrete in seawall structure can significantly reduce the wave load acting on the structure and velocity in front of seawall especially for run down wave the derived equations can be used effectively for numerically analysing pervious concrete structure as a preliminary design pfem is more accurate and converges faster than standard fem pfem can be effectively used in analysing elastic responses of 3d complex geometry solid structures under static and dynamic applied loads declaration of interest statement the authors declare that there

22103,in this study we propose a new design of prefabricated hollow blocks which are made of pervious concrete the effects of thickness of block walls are studied to optimize an adequate size the comparison of performance of porous and solid blocks is studied through fluid solid interaction models a polyhedral finite element formulation pfem is employed to analyse responses of the structure under equivalent static and dynamic wave load conditions the effectiveness of pfem is verified by comparing the obtained results with those of standard finite element method fem using the commercial software ansys their accuracy is also proved via the validation model of a step beam in which the natural frequencies are used for comparison in static analysis the maximum displacement of block increases rapidly when porosity of concrete changes from 5 to 35 the optimum porosity is found to be around 20 the variable thickness of the block walls reasonably affects the displacement resistance however compared to porosity the influence of thickness is not significant the change of poisson s ratio slightly affects the responses of the block for dynamic analysis the vibration of pervious concrete block types under the impact of wave load with small duration 20 ms lasts longer than the case attacked by long duration shock around 50 ms however the amplitudes of displacement responses by long duration impact wave are greater than that of short impact study also showed that the porous concrete block could significantly reduce the run down pressure acting on the structure compared to solid block keywords pervious concrete variable porosity polyhedral finite element method static and dynamic wave load run down pressure 1 introduction pervious concrete an environmentally friendly material has been increasingly attracted interest in construction industry in recent years it is a very effective structure to control storm water runoff on pavement because of the characteristic of allowing water running through its connected voids however according to the best authors knowledge even though there are a number of studies on porous sea wall revetment or breakwater jensen et al 2014 alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016a 2016b losada et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2015 the research of coastal defence structures using porous concrete is still very limited porous concrete is made from water cement and coarse aggregates herein most or all sand and fine aggregates are omitted from normal concrete high water infiltration rate is the result of interconnected pores running through concrete structure pervious concrete is used as a sustainable material in wide range of constructions which could be sidewalks retaining walls car parks green house floors tennis courts drains plants purification and other low traffic roads great advantages of pervious concrete have been recorded over many years in comparison to conventional concrete such as less drying shrinkage considerably reducing cement coating better thermal insulation storm water runoff capturing suspended solids hydrocarbon pollution control and groundwater recharge kia et al 2017 adewumi et al 2016 in pavement constructions permeable concrete can reduce over 90 of peak flows and 43 of surface water runoff it can significantly decrease costs by limiting storm water management systems jennifer drake and asce 2014 the waste from traffic vehicles which are suspended solids and motor oil can be filtered to improve groundwater quality welker et al 2013 in hydraulic environment porous concrete has been increasingly used in recent years the porous concrete pipes are used for underdrains the astm c654 standard indicates the required specifications of porous pipes for pervious concrete the porosity inversely affects material strength unlike conventional concrete which requires minimized porosity for better structural and functional performance pervious concrete needs to increase porosity as much as possible for its permeable characteristic total porosity is typically from 15 to 30 and pore sizes are from 2 mm to 8 mm based on aggregate type and compaction method adewumi et al 2016 aci 522r 10 2010 strength of pervious concrete is not usually the same for similar mixture a consistent trend has been reported that strength of pervious concrete both compression and tension decreased when porosity increased alam and haselbach 2014a deo and neithalath 2010a 2011 zhong and wille 2016 however greater porosity allows more infiltration rate this requires attention on the relation between porosity and strength of pervious concrete to balance its structural performance with functional performance while compressive strengths of conventional concretes range from 24 1 mpa to 34 5 mpa and tensile strengths range from 2 4 mpa to 4 1 mpa dhatt and touzot 1985 compressive strengths of pervious concretes typically range from 3 4 to 27 6 mpa and tensile strengths range from 1 0 to 3 8 mpa tennis et al 2004 however greater pervious concrete strength is possible by using additional admixtures or and high strength cement zhong and wille reported that compressive strength of pervious concrete using ultra high strength matrix can reach 65 8 mpa corresponding to 19 8 of total porosity zhong and wille 2016 various functional relations between porosity and strength of porous media based on empirical models have been reported herein strength was linearly derived from porosity by hasselmann hasselman and fulrath 1964 power relation by balshin 1949 exponential relation by ryshkevitch ryshkewitch 1953 chindaprasirt chindaprasirt et al 2009 and lian lian et al 2011 logarithmic relation by schiller 1971 and deo et al deo and neithalath 2010b studies for stated equations evaluation have been performed in which the linear equation was simple and high accurate to determine strength of normal pervious concrete based on total porosity a reason for limited use of pervious concrete is its weakness in surface abrasion resistant however this can be improved by adding reinforced fibres or and admixture into paste matrix kevern et al 2015 reported that pervious concretes using macro synthetic fibres could inversely reduce abrasion and increase freeze thaw durability even though compressive and tensile strengths were not significantly affected yang and jiang 2003 used silica fume and reported that superplasticizer added to common materials could also greatly increase abrasion resistant water penetration and strength of pervious concrete seawalls or revetments are coastal structures protecting coastline dike slope from erosion they are made from sand bags blockwork gabion concrete etc under the attack of wave armour structures are at risk of damage caused by external and internal pressures on the structure as known a popular mechanism causing the failure of dikes is that the negative pressure acts on the protected slope and strips out the armour layer the total loading on the protected slope seawall is induced by wave actions on cover layer earth and pore pressures corresponding to phreatic surface during the wave running down the hydraulic pressure on concrete block decreases significantly but the pore pressure is nearly constant which leads to uplift or slide parts of the protection armour subsequently the slope is vulnerable to erosion and collapse pilarczyk et al 1995 burger et al 1989 however with the application of pervious concrete block the stated pore pressure can also be reduced due to ability to allow water passing through its structure in addition the porous seawall can significantly reduce wave run up and reflection which leads to the reduction in local scour of the structure compared to impermeable type koraim et al 2014 consequently the seawall could be more stable in this study porous concrete is applied for sea defence structure in order to take advantage of its permeability the studied elements are prefabricated concrete blocks which form step wall protecting slope of sea dike see fig 1 recently the polyhedral finite element method pfem has been increasingly applied to analyse structural responses because of its flexible ability in meshing complex structure as well as inversely reducing number of dofs brezzi et al 2005 chin et al 2015 however most cases used complicated shape functions and applied to simple structures such as cantilever beam and cube rashid and selimotic 2006 bishop 2014 the piecewise linear shape function used in pfem is simple and proved to be more accurate than wachspress laplace and mean value shape functions nguyen xuan 2017 in this study pfem is used to analyse 3d porous concrete block under static and dynamic wave loads shortly this article numerically investigates the application of the prefabricated concrete block in step type seawall structure the structural performances of the block under static and dynamic wave loads are studied for static analysis the following factors are considered the porosity is ranging from 5 to 35 and the thickness of block is changing from 10 cm to 15 cm in the direction perpendicular to seawall line additionally the lower and upper bounds of poisson s ratios are also investigated for their effects on responses of the studied structure for dynamic analysis we determine the natural frequencies of the first six modes of the pervious concrete block and the transient responses of the block under the effect of experimental data of impact breaking wave the 2d wave block interaction is studied to compare the performance of pervious concrete block with conventional concrete block the latest pfem using piecewise linear shape function is applied to analyse the structure its effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using experimental data and verified using standard fem and commercial software ansys the four point bending test results of pervious concrete beam reported in ref chandrappa and biligiri 2018 are compared with static responses obtained from ansys model for validation which will be used as reference data the other numerical dynamic models for complex geometry structure are validated by comparing their calculation with experimental natural frequencies of an aluminium step beam reported in ref jaworski and dowell 2008 eventually the dam break model in ref lara et al 2012 is used to verify the fluid solid interaction model derived from ansys fluent 2 background on pervious concrete with porosity 2 1 concrete material with porosity pervious concrete properties which are modulus of elasticity density infiltration rate compressive and tensile strength are proved to be functions of porosity deo and neithalath 2010a agar ozbek et al 2013 xu et al 2018 shi and chen 2018 alam and haselbach 2014b fig 2 the porosity depends on many factors such as compaction method ratio of water to cement ratio of aggregate to cement aggregate sizes etc while increasing pore content tends to reduce density modulus of elasticity and strength resistant of pervious concrete the permeability characteristic is positively increased therefore porosity can be set as the governing parameter from which other properties of porous concrete are determined based on their functional relation various equations have been generally developed for porous media that indicated the effect of porosity on compressive strength ryshkevitch ryshkewitch 1953 introduced the empirical equation of the decrease of compressive strength as f c f c o exp n p where p is the porosity f c o is the compressive strength of matrix at zero void ratio p 0 and n is the empirical constant chindaprasirt chindaprasirt et al 2009 and lian lian et al 2011 also developed similar equations based on analytical and experimental data as f c f c o exp m n ξ p and f c f c o 1 p m e n p respectively where m is empirical coefficient balshin 1949 presented an alternative relation power function as f c f c o 1 p n hasselmann s formula hasselman and fulrath 1964 was originally developed for projecting young s modulus of porous glass which can be linearly derived from porosity as 1 f c f c o 1 n p zhong and wille 2016 validated all the stated equations in predicting compressive strength of pervious concrete using experimental data of concrete with matrix strengths between 29 mpa and 174 mpa and they also proposed their own formula as 2 f c f c o 1 n p d d o m where d and d o are the aggregate size and the smallest aggregate size respectively they proved that for normal strength pervious concrete the linear equation gave the most accurate prediction of compressive strength in this case eq 1 and eq 2 give the same results as in ref zhong and wille 2016 3 f c f c o 1 2 1 p whereas for high strength pervious concrete the coefficient n of 2 6 was found to give the reasonable linear prediction of f c eq 2 can produce better results but the application is limited by aggregate size therefore the linear equation is preferred in this study for general cases the value of elastic modulus must be predefined for numerical static analysis goede 2009 proposed equation for predicting modulus of elasticity in the terms of density and compressive strength as e 39 1 w p c 1 5 f c where w pc is the density of pervious concrete however alam et al 2012 reported that the young s modulus predicted by goede was greater than that of cores drilled from the porous pavement aci 318 aci 318 11 2011 and aashto aashto 2012 standards give more reasonable results even though the equations are for predicting elastic modulus of normal concrete which are e 33 w p c 1 5 f c psi and e 0 043 w p c 1 5 f c mpa respectively ghafoori and dutta 2002 presented a similar elastic modulus equation for pervious concrete as 4 e 32 88 w p c 1 5 f c psi converting eq 4 into metric unit system gives 5 e 0 0426 w p c 1 5 f c mpa where w p c is in kg m3 and f c is the compressive strength of pervious concrete in mpa this equation is close to those proposed in aci 318 and aashto standards hence we will use eq 5 for predicting elastic modulus of pervious concrete in this study substituting eq 3 into eq 5 gives 6 e 0 0426 w p c 1 5 f c o 1 2 1 p to determine young s modulus e the unit weight w pc of pervious concrete is needed the density and porosity of pervious concrete are reported to be ranged from 1570 kg m3 to 1938 kg m3 and from 10 to 29 respectively ghafoori and dutta 2002 however higher values of density with the same porosity have been later reported in refs ibrahim et al 2014 liu et al 2018 due to differences in material properties and additional admixture liu et al 2018 experimentally developed an equation to predict density in terms of total porosity as follows 7 w p c 2491 2550 p substituting eq 7 into eq 6 young s modulus can be determined by function of porosity as 8 e 0 0426 2491 2550 p 1 5 f c o 1 2 1 p based on previous experimental and theoretical researches of pervious concrete the following assumptions are used in this study the modulus of elasticity of pervious concrete is predicted in terms of porosity by using eq 8 for normal strength pervious concrete material in pavement construction the porosity of concrete distributes un equality in vertical direction due to compaction nevertheless the considered concrete block is prefabricated in order to improve the quality as well as the homogeneity of material hence an assumption is made that the distribution of porosity is uniform in all directions of the concrete structure consequently young s modulus is constant for each value of porosity poisson s ratio variability of pervious concrete is higher than that of conventional concrete it ranges from 0 13 to 0 34 average of 0 22 which was reported in ref goede 2009 typically the average value is used in this study except for the investigation of the effect of poisson s ratio since the macrosynthetic fibre does not significantly affect the compressive and tensile strength of pervious concrete kevern et al 2015 its effect can be neglected in this study however it should be taken into account for further study of water infiltration and free thaw performance 2 2 pervious hollow concrete block the studied structure is a 3d prefabricated innovative hollow block made of pervious concrete the block is an interlocking element of step type seawall see fig 3 the detail dimensions of the block are shown in fig 4 whereas the patterns on the inclined surfaces of the upper part are simplified because they have no effect on strength resistant of the block the main reason of those patterns are to dissipate wave energy as the result reducing wave overtopping due to problems of casting and erosion steel bars should not be used in reinforcing the block but macro synthetic fibres which can increase the surface abrasion of pervious concrete are good option the block is hollow inside and is filled by sand on site based on the construction process there are two main states of loading on the block 1 the block is erected but not filled by sand inside and on the back 2 the block is in fully working condition that sand is filled inside on front up to half of block depth and on the back of the block fig 3 the former loading condition is more dangerous for strength limit state and is considered in this study the performance of interlocking pervious concrete block model at the later state service state is not considered within the scope of this study however following this article the interaction of waves and the complete interlocking seawall will be further investigated in addition for porous concrete the fatigue life is an important factor affecting the life of structure which can be improved significantly by adding chemical admixtures polymers chen et al 2013 for instances for statics analysis the porosity of pervious concrete ranges from 5 to 35 to investigate displacement and tensile stress responses of the block we also consider the thickness of the front and back walls of the block changing from 10 cm to 15 cm as well as the effect of poisson s ratio variation for dynamic analysis we study the first 6 mode natural frequencies of the block with 20 porosity and the transient responses under the impact wave loads reported in hofland et al 2012 and salih kirkgöz 1991 3 computational modelling by polyhedral finite element the pervious hollow concrete block has complex geometry and it is modelled as a solid structure the pfem is proved to be effective in meshing and analysing 3d complicated shape structures rashid and selimotic 2006 bishop 2014 nguyen xuan 2017 therefore besides determining static and dynamic responses of the block this study also validates the pfem using linear piecewise linear shape functions over arbitrary polyhedral elements which is the simple method but can provide high accuracy the obtained results by pfem are compared to those of standards fem using linear tetrahedral elements and commercial software ansys using high order basic functions the pfem divides structural domain into polyhedral elements which can be convex polyhedrons with triangular faces warren 1996 or regular arbitrary faces idelsohn et al 2003 the most general polyhedral element is an arbitrary 3d domain surrounded by non planar faces bishop 2014 the finite element matrices force matrix and stiffness matrix are constructed based on sub tetrahedrons divided from polyhedral element let us consider a mechanical problem in equilibrium state of

with γ β 0 5 0 25 the approximated displacements are unconditionally stable the dynamic analysis process in matlab is generally similar to the static case in fig 6 however additional matrices of m and c need to be assembled and the applied force is built for every time step then the displacements of the systems are approximated explicitly by using eq 20 to eq 22 4 experimental validation 4 1 elastostatic pervious beam the effectiveness of predicting equations in section 2 1 for fem analysis is validated by comparing the results obtained from ansys models with flexural pervious concrete beam experimental test reported in ref chandrappa and biligiri 2018 the beams have the dimensions of 100 100 500 mm see fig 7 the material mixtures are various with different aggregate sizes combinations water cement ratios and cement aggregate ratios since the compressive strength of the tested pervious concrete was not presented it is analysed based on eq 1 f c f c 0 1 n p with n 2 6 and the matrix strength f c0 61 mpa which is obtained from the similar cement matrix ingredients reported in ref zhong and wille 2016 for high strength pervious concrete the elastic young s modulus e is predicted using eq 5 to analyse the elastic behaviour of the beams a force p 0 3p max is applied the results are listed in table 1 in which the middle beam deflection and tensile stress at the bottom are used for comparison the beam ids in the table are originally used in the 4 points test which indicates different mixtures of pervious concrete as it can be seen that the gaps of deflection between ansys models and experimental data are reasonable however the numerical tensile stresses agree well with experimental results it can be observed from the validation results that the proposed analysis procedure can be used for predicting preliminary elastostatic responses of pervious concrete structure with wide range of concrete mixtures besides ansys results can be used as reference solution in this study in table 1 the difference is calculated by using the following formulae 23 difference result fem result test result test x 100 4 2 model verification for dynamic analysis of complex geometry to validate the accuracy of commercial software ansys numerical methods pfem and fem used in this study the experimental natural frequencies of a cantilever step beam reported in ref jaworski and dowell 2008 are used for comparison the beam is 463 55 mm in length 3 175 mm in width the details of other dimensions are shown in fig 8 the beam is made of aluminium with young s modulus e of 60 6 gpa and density ρ of 2664 kg m3 since poisson s ratio was not reported it is assumed to be 0 3 in this validation model the beam is mesh using 40000 hexahedral elements in ansys model around 33000 tetrahedral elements and polyhedral elements in fem and pfem analyses respectively fig 9 the results are shown in table 2 in which m 1l and m 2l are the first and second lateral bending modes while m 1b is the first in plain bending mode fig 10 in addition the table also shows the differences in percentage between values of corresponding methods and experimental data as it can be seen 1 8 is the maximum deviation of ansys s results where the difference of pfem is 3 3 and of fem is 27 5 those values are acceptable except for fem s results which are not yet converge with respect to 33000 tetrahedral elements fig 11 compares the convergence of the first natural frequency analysed by using pfem and fem the figure shows that convergence rate of fem is much slower than that of pfem the reference and exp jaworski and dowell 2008 lines are the results of ansys and experimental test respectively corresponding to mode m 1l presenting in table 2 4 3 fluid solid interaction model validation in this section the comparison of interaction between fluid porous concrete block and fluid conventional concrete block is carried out the dam breaking model reported by lara et al 2012 is used to validate the interaction model in ansys fluent the original experimental data was presented by wu 2004 the dimensions of dam breaking tank are showed in fig 12 in which the prism is considered for two cases of solid media and porous media with porosity of 0 5 the medium mesh of 1 1 0 5 cm and the other parameters of the model are used as suggested by lara et al 2012 the results of velocity is shown in fig 13 of force acting on the prism in fig 14 and of water surface at 0 5 s in fig 15 as it can be seen the predicted values of ansys model are generally smaller than the experimental results however the maximum values and distribution trends are acceptable 5 numerical analysis 5 1 static analysis as stated in section 2 2 the studied 3d block made of pervious concrete is an innovative design forming the interlocking step seawall in this study we consider the case of block being erected the inside and the back have not filled by sand yet consequently the block is attacked by sea wave which is equalized to uniform distribution pressure varying linearly from 28 kpa to 26 kpa from the top of the block the lateral displacements of block sides y direction are set to be 0 because they are constrained by connecting with the adjacent blocks forming interlocking structure the three factors affecting strength resistant of the block are porosity thickness and poisson s ratio the porosity of pervious concrete ranges from 5 to 35 which includes the regular porosity range from 15 to 30 adewumi et al 2016 aci 522r 10 2010 we also consider the variable thickness of the front and back walls of the block varying from 10 cm to 15 cm and the effects of upper and lower bounds of poisson s ratio of 0 34 and 0 13 respectively the outputs from the analysis are the displacement and tensile stress responses of the block the former is investigated on edge 1 2 and the latter on edge 3 4 see fig 16 5 1 1 variable porosity the effect of porosity on the linearly elastic responses of pervious concrete block under static load is presented in this section the concrete block is modelled as a solid structure to compared the performance between two numerical methods about 20000 elements are used the material properties are functions in porosity which include the compressive strength the density and young s modulus predicted by eqs 3 7 and 8 respectively moreover the tensile strength f t mpa of pervious concrete is preliminary determined based on its compressive strength aashto 2012 i e 24 f t 0 45 f c in all results figures pfem represents the results analysed by polyhedral finite element method using piecewise linear shape function whereas fem is the results of standard finite element method using conventional linear shape functions the results from ansys software is denoted as reference fig 17 and fig 18 show the displacements of edge 1 2 in which the maximum displacement at end 2 with respect to different concrete porosities along x and z axes are presented as it can be seen from those figures when porosity is less than 24 the maximum displacement rises gradually however the rising curves are steeper when porosity of pervious concrete is over 24 fig 19 shows the maximum tensile stress along edge 3 4 it can be observed that the tensile stress only depends on applied load and geometry of the block the increase of porosity does not affect the stress responses even though it adversely influences the displacement and tensile stress of the studied block therefore to make sure that adequate relationship between structural and functional performances of the block take place the porosity of 20 is chosen as the optimum value for further investigation fig 20 and fig 21 show the distribution of x displacement along edge 1 2 and tensile stress along edge 3 4 for porosity of 20 in fig 21 the stress distribution is not smooth this can be explained that for linear shape function stress in each element is constant as a consequence stress is fluctuated corresponding to non uniform elements 5 1 2 variable thickness and poisson s ratio pervious concrete is widely used in design of environmentally friendly pavement however its applications in other constructions such as seawall structures are very limited and lacking of design standard therefore it is necessary to investigate the sizes of studied block the original design of the block is for conventional concrete with thickness of front and back walls of 9 cm ba ria vung tau urban s nevertheless pervious concrete panel should be thicker and should not be smaller than 10 cm thick goede 2009 the range from 10 cm to 15 cm of the thickness of front and back walls is studied in order to find the optimized block fig 22 poisson s ratio of pervious concrete varies within a wider range 0 13 0 34 compared to conventional concrete 0 15 0 20 goede 2009 consequently this study investigates the effect of poisson s ratio on static responses of the block by comparing its behaviour under three different ratios of 0 13 0 22 and 0 34 which are the lower bound average and upper bound respectively fig 23 and fig 24 show the maximum displacements along x axis of edge 1 2 with various thickness and porosity fig 23 is the results determined by pfem with around 40000 polyhedral elements as demonstrated in the figure when the thickness increases the displacement decreases which is the obvious trend however compared to the rise of displacement based on increase porosity the effect of block thickness is less significant the figure also re verifies that when porosity is higher than about 25 the displacement rises dramatically fig 24 compares the displacements calculated by pfem and fem with the number of elements around 40000 the maximum tensile stresses along edge 3 4 in conjunction with changing thickness of the block are illustrated in fig 25 since the analysed tensile stress is independent of porosity of concrete the figure only shows its reducing trend with increase thickness the ratios of tensile strength p 20 versus analysed tensile stress of block with 10 cm and 15 cm thickness are 1 24 and 1 48 respectively the results obtained for different values of poisson s ratios from ansys models are shown in figs 25 and 26 black lines in which the presentative porosity of 20 is used for analysis in those figures the dot lines are the results of lower bound ratio μ 0 13 whereas black continuous lines are obtained from average ratio μ 0 22 and the dash lines represent upper bound results μ 0 34 as it can be seen that the effect of poisson s ratio on tensile strength is greater than the effect on displacement of the studied block in additional compare to the average ratio the upper bounds give smaller responses than the lower bounds however the results obtained from lower bounds and average ratio agree very well difference is 1 62 in average for stress and 0 17 for displacement the results of upper bounds are smaller than those of average ratio by 3 67 for stress and 1 54 for displacement from the results of static analysis the porosity of concrete shows its significant effect on deformation of the pervious concrete block with the preliminary designed of box shape block the effect of thickness of front and back walls changing from 10 cm to 15 cm on responses of block is not as significant as the effect of variable porosity moreover the effect of poisson s ratio variability is not significant in this study and the average ratio give conservative responses therefore the block with 10 cm thickness 20 porosity and poisson s ratio of 0 22 are chosen for dynamic analysis 5 2 dynamic analysis the studied blocks protect a sea dike which is regularly under attacks of wave therefore dynamic responses of the block are necessary to investigate the obtained results of pfem are compared with those of standard fem and ansys firstly the first six modes of natural frequencies are analysed secondly transient responses of the block under the impact wave loads are studied using the experimental data reported in hofland et al 2012 and salih kirkgöz 1991 5 2 1 natural frequencies as mentioned in the static analysis the block has 10 cm thickness and porosity of pervious concrete is 20 the other material properties are predicted using eqs 7 and 8 which yield young s modulus e of 16923 mpa and density ρ of 1981 kg m3 fig 27 shows the values of the first six natural frequencies of the studied model the results are analysed by pfem and fem using around 20000 elements for the first mode the difference of natural frequency between pfem and reference is 2 4 while that difference between fem and reference is 4 3 those differences for second mode are 1 4 and 2 4 for pfem and fem respectively furthermore table 3 lists the values of natural frequencies of the first six modes in the table concrete porosity 2 represents conventional concrete where porosity 20 is the pervious concrete block the first natural frequency of the block made of pervious concrete reduces by 16 compared to conventional concrete which leads to the lower resonant frequency of applied loads for pervious concrete structure figs 28 to 30 illustrate the shape of block deformation corresponding to its first six modes 5 2 2 transient analysis if the motion of load is too slow the responses of inertia forces are sufficiently small and can be neglected as a result the analysis model can be considered as static model otherwise a dynamic analysis should be performed in this section we investigate the dynamic responses of pervious concrete block under the attack of load as a function of time the loads applied on the studied block are the impact wave loads with high acceleration which were experimentally measured by hofland et al 2012 and kirkgöz salih kirkgöz 1991 hofland et al carried out the impact wave test in the delta flume for measuring large impact pressure on vertical wall in their test the water depth varies from h 2 5 m to h 4 25 m and wave height is kept constant as 0 6h the impact loads of flip through and air pocket breaking waves using in this study are showed in fig 31 and fig 32 respectively flip through impact pressure has duration of around 20 ms and air pocket impact pressure duration is about 50 ms the impact load data of generally breaking wave from kirkgöz test shown in fig 33 was conducted with smaller wave height 0 258 m and water depth 0 61 m in comparison to the test of hofland et al 2012 the newmark method is used to analyse the transient problems by solving eq 13 for conservative results the damping of block is neglected in this analysis the time dependent results obtained by pfem will be compared with those obtained by standard fem and ansys reference the pervious concrete block also possesses 20 porosity and 10 cm thickness the transient displacements at end 2 of edge 1 2 are displayed in figs 34 to 36 corresponding to the impact pressures presented in figs 31 to 33 as it can be seen in those figures the amplitude of vibration generated by shorter duration impact wave lasts longer we consider two representative impact loads which have long duration impact as in fig 32 and short duration impact as in fig 33 because the peak pressure in all cases are quite high compared to static wave load and building conditions we further considered time dependent reduced pressures as shown in fig 37 and fig 38 the corresponding results of transient displacements and stresses are presented in figs 39 to 42 it can be observed that the oscillation responses are similar to the cases using original experimental data in comparison to static analysis the maximum displacement of long duration impact load is 13 higher while that difference is 7 lower for the case of short duration impact nevertheless the tensile stresses are higher for both cases of impact loads than the static stress i e 9 and 5 respectively as it can be observed from those figures on the one hand the effect of long duration shock waves on maximum displacements and stresses is more critical than that of short duration on the other hand the vibration of the block caused by fast impact lasts longer which may lead to the problem of fatigue fortunately the maximum stress responses in both cases of impact loads are smaller compared to tensile strength of pervious concrete material 2 0 mpa 5 3 interaction of wave and studied block the outperformance of porous concrete block compared to conventional block in wave solid interaction is studied by using the model in fig 43 the figure also indicates locations for measuring pressure acting on the block by wave the 2d model is used instead of 3d model for reducing computer resources as well as processing time but it still ensures the required comparison between the analyses the model is 24 5 m long and 6 5 m high based on the validation model the mesh in wave region is 3 1 5 cm with quadrilateral elements and at block region a fine local mesh with triangle elements is introduced fig 44 the built in open wave channel is used to generate intermediate wave fig 45 shows the generated wave for both cases of a section at 19 m from wave generation source 1 m in front of porous block which is not affected by reflection wave and used for comparison for the porous block the whole model of block with filled in sand is presented with their respective porosity of 20 and 57 and d 50 of 6 cm and 0 3 cm whereas the solid block is modelled as a wall fig 46 shows the pressure history generated by wave on the point gauge as it can be seen from the figure the pressure caused by run up wave are similar for both cases however the huge gap occurs when the wave is run down the minimum negative pressure acting on gauge of solid block is about quadruped porous pressure the details of pressure distributions for two critical cases of pressure on the studied edge red line in fig 43 are presented in fig 47 it is observed that the maximum porous pressure is around 7 less than solid pressure fig 48 compares the velocity distribution of wave acting on the blocks for critical cases of run up and run down wave the similar trend of smaller velocity for porous block is obtained 6 discussion the pervious concrete has been analysed based on the developed empirical equations the rationality of the concrete properties predictions has already evaluated and verified for a wide range of material mixtures from average strength to high performance strength eq 8 was derived for normal strength pervious concrete however it can also be extendedly used for high strength pc by just using suitable empirical coefficient as described in section 2 1 the verification models were performed to prove the feasibility of the present method although the pervious concrete was verified with the porosities from 21 1 to 32 6 which is smaller range compared to 5 35 of the studied cases the empirical formulations are obtained from experiments of concrete with porosities around 10 30 so that the confidence of studied results can be inductively covered besides various aggregate mixtures can perform in the different ways it is the nature of concrete material which cannot be exactly evaluated by any particular equation for more accurate results the test samples are required with respect to each concrete structures therefore this study can be considered as a novel numerical model for preliminary prediction of elasticity responses of porous concrete structure the proposed seawall block made of micro synthetic fibre porous concrete was studied for the strength limit state the boundary conditions were predicted from short period of blocks construction which can be positively chosen to avoid extreme case of sea waves this study does not propose ingredients for porous concrete material however there are a number of previous studies that can make porous concrete with acceptable porosity strength and durability zhong and wille 2016 chen et al 2013 the proposed concrete blocks inherit the previous empirical and theoretical researches of pervious concrete material therefore this study contributes not only by the new structural application but also by the preliminary numerical investigation of pervious concrete structure this study investigates the pervious concrete block working as an individual element under the equivalent static and dynamic wave load further study should be carried out to improve the proposed model such as developing the full model of wave seawall interaction to investigate working responses of the whole interlocking structure under more realistic wave actions even though the various concrete mixtures are mediating studied via the empirical equations the properties of specific mixture may be differed due to ingredients casting or compaction method therefore experimental test of the proposed block should be studied in addition pfem is an effective and accurate method in analysing elastic structure its application in fluid calculation is a wide field of interest 7 conclusion in this study we investigated the performances of the innovative prefabricated hollow blocks which were made of pervious concrete with porosity varying from 5 to 35 the variation in thickness of block walls and poisson s ratio were also studied in order to find adequate dimensions the pervious concrete block was subjected to static and dynamic loads for static analysis the wave load is equalized as a distribution pressure the experimental impact wave loads were used for dynamic analysis in addition the outperformance of pervious concrete block compared to conventional block in interaction with wave was demostrated through fluid solid model in ansys fluent the developed polyhedral finite element method using piecewise linear shape function pfem was used as an up to date numerical method for solid structures the effectiveness of pfem in analysis of 3d complex structure are verified by comparing the results with standard fem and commercial ansys software some conclusions are derived as follows in static analysis the maximum displacement of block increases gradually when porosity of concrete changes from 5 to about 24 when porosity keeps rising more than 24 the maximum displacement increases dramatically thickness of front and back walls of the studied block changing from 10 cm to 15 cm reasonably affects the displacement resistance however the effect of variable thickness is not significant in comparison to porosity of concrete material in dynamic analysis the transient oscillation responses of the block under fast impact wave load 20 ms last much longer than vibration caused by slow impact about 50 ms with the same peak amplitude the long duration impact waves have greater effect on maximum displacement and stress responses of the pervious concrete than short duration impact waves in addition both types of dynamic loads cause higher responses than static load the optimum porosity is found to be around 20 for the adequate relationship between structural and functional performances the application of pervious concrete in seawall structure can significantly reduce the wave load acting on the structure and velocity in front of seawall especially for run down wave the derived equations can be used effectively for numerically analysing pervious concrete structure as a preliminary design pfem is more accurate and converges faster than standard fem pfem can be effectively used in analysing elastic responses of 3d complex geometry solid structures under static and dynamic applied loads declaration of interest statement the authors declare that there

22104,taking a 10 000teu container ship as the study object a series of simplified global hull girder models with large deck openings are modeled and analyzed to investigate their torsional failure behaviors including collapse modes and ultimate torsional strength the objective of this research is to answer which mechanism the hull girder with large deck openings under torsion will collapse in and to figure out the decisive factor that is dominating the transformation between the warping failure and the shear failure mechanism in addition the ultimate torsional strength reduction curves of the hull girder with large deck openings are obtained to reveal the relationship of the ultimate torsional strength between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder also it is experimentally validated that the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis can well predict the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the test model keywords global hull girder single segment torsional failure mechanisms warping failure shear failure strength reduction curves 1 introduction according to the thin walled girder theory warping and shear stresses are both developed when a thin walled beam with open cross sections is subjected to torsion pedersen 1985 1991 paik et al 2001 correspondingly there may exist two torsional failure mechanisms warping failure or shear failure for the hull girder with large deck openings when ships sail at an oblique heading in rough sea the torsional moments induced by waves and non symmetrical cargo loading may approach or even exceed the vertical bending moments causing a necessity to comprehensively understand the torsional failure characteristics of the hull girder with large deck openings due to their low torsional rigidity the ultimate torsional strength experiment conducted by sun and soares 2003 showed that the hull girder with a large deck opening under torsion collapsed in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and plastic buckling only occurred at the abrupt sections near two ends with most parts of the side structures remaining at a low damage level paik et al 2001 illustrated a procedure for calculating the distribution and magnitude of warping and shear stresses for the hull cross section of a container ship under unit torsion mainly focusing on the elastic response even though the collapse process of hull girders exhibits a high nonlinearity including both material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity based on the torsional theory of thin walled girders and orthotropic plate theory an analytical expression that could regard the contribution of transverse bulkheads to the torsional stiffness of the hull girder with a large deck opening was derived by senjanović and tomašević 2008 quantitatively presenting the influence of the geometric characteristics of transverse bulkheads on the torsional stiffness of the hull girder in an approximate way which could be referred as a quick reference in early stages of ship structure design tanaka et al 2015 had studied the ultimate strength performance of a typical container ship under combined loads aiming at developing an analysis method of the ultimate hull girder strength under combined loads an ultimate strength experiment of a swath ship subjected to transverse loads was conducted by liu et al 2018 having illustrated the design and manufacture process of the scale model an ultimate bending strength test of an inland catamaran was performed by xu et al 2019 establishing a procedure for evaluating the ultimate strength of the catamaran for some researchers the hull cross section of container ships could be simplified to be composed of some closed or open rectangular sections one of which can be adopted as the study object to investigate the collapse behaviors and ultimate strength of box girders residual ultimate strength of cracked box girders with and without opening under pure torsion was numerically studied by shi and wang 2012a b proposing a simple model for predicting the residual ultimate strength of cracked box girders under pure torsion another numerical investigation of the ultimate torsional strength of cracked box girders with a large deck opening was performed by ao and wang 2016 having detailedly illustrated the influence of some potential parameters such as mesh refinement initial imperfections and material strain hardening on the ultimate torsional strength of cracked box girders for ultra large container ships mohammed and benson 2016 conducted a numerical study of the ultimate hull girder strength of a 10 000teu container ship under two combined loads introducing an ultimate strength interaction of the hull girder between vertical bending and torsion later a three dimensional hull girder ultimate strength envelope for an ultra large container ship was numerically investigated by wang et al 2018 deriving a formula that could regard the ultimate strength interaction of the hull girder among three combined loads however in their research only the mid ship compartment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads was adopted as the study object to represent the global hull girder neglecting the effect of transverse bulkheads and hull girder s longitudinal dimension and they mainly devoted their efforts to studying the ultimate strength of the hull girder without conducting a discussion about the failure mechanisms the study on the failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings is the main focus of this paper although the ultimate strength performance of the hull girder can also be affected by dynamic effect such as strain rate yang et al 2018 liu and soares 2019 dynamic effect involved in the collapse process of the hull girder is not considered in this paper in current studies on evaluating the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with large deck openings a single segment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads are employed to represent the global hull girder neglecting the effect of transverse bulkheads and hull girder s longitudinal dimension on the torsional failure behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder shi and wang 2012a b ao and wang 2016 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 however according to the thin walled girder theory for the global hull girder with large deck openings under torsion the sectional torque is composed of pure torsional moment and warping torsional moment senjanović and tomašević 2008 namely 1 t t t t w in which the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment can be expressed by senjanović and tomašević 2008 2 t t t 1 cos h β x cos h β l 3 t w t cos h β x cos h β l 4 β g i t e i w where x and l is the distance from the mid ship section and the overall length of the hull girder respectively i t i w e and g is the torsional modulus warping modulus young s modulus and shear modulus respectively it can be seen that both the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment at a certain section are considerably affected by the longitudinal dimension of the hull girder due to the existence of warping effect for the hull girder with large deck openings the torsional collapse behaviors and the ultimate torsional strength between the global hull girder and a single segment hull girder should be different transverse bulkheads are important components of ship hull structures contributing a lot to the torsional rigidity of the hull girders with large deck openings senjanović and tomašević 2008 the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with large deck openings also needs to be investigated making a more comprehensive understanding of the torsional collapse characteristics of the hull girder with large deck openings corresponding to what is mentioned above taking a 10 000teu container ship as the study object a series of simplified global hull girder models are modeled and analyzed to figure out the torsional collapse mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings taking the number of the hull girder segments adopted in the computation model and the rigidity of transverse bulkheads as two variables a series of nonlinear finite element analyses are conducted to figure out the effect of hull girder s longitudinal dimension and transverse bulkheads on the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder it should be noted that only transverse bulkheads are taken into account when the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder were discussed in this paper 2 nonlinear finite element analysis as is mentioned before due to the existence of warping effect the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment are not identically distributed at different cross sections along the longitudinal direction when the hull girder is bearing a torsional moment therefore in order to explicitly figure out the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder with large deck openings the global hull girder should be simulated taking the influence of transverse bulkheads into account 2 1 fe modeling 2 1 1 description of the object ship and the simplified hull girder model the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 the main dimensions and details of the ship are shown in table 1 and table 2 most components of the hull girder structure are manufactured with non uniform thickness plates especially for the side structures which are made of stepped plates of which the thickness of the upper part plates is considerably larger than that of the middle and lower part the side structures are the main support components of the hull girder in its torsional collapse process which means that the configuration of side structures may have a significant effect on the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder some researchers have simplified their test models to the ones with the side structures that are manufactured with uniform thickness plates which may bring some uncertainties to the experimental results sun and soares 2003 the objective of this nonlinear finite element analyses is to figure out the main factors that could influence the collapse mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings under torsion to capture the main parameters and conduct a parametric study the hull girder model is simplified as follows 1 the segments which are close to the bow and stern of the ship are simplified to the compartments with closed sections 2 transverse bulkheads either support ones or water tight ones are simplified to the plates with an equivalent thickness which is determined as follows 5 t e q t i 1 n t i a i i 1 n a i where t i and a i is the plate thickness and area of a local plate respectively 3 anti torsion boxes play a similar role with transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks in the torsional collapse process of the hull girder for simplicity and to control the main parameters anti torsion boxes are neglected in the modeling process local complex joints that have little effect on the overall collapse behaviors of the hull girder are also simplified 4 the hull girder is simplified to a prismatic pontoon with cross sections of the mid ship section of a 10 000teu container ship shown in fig 1 neglecting the variations of cross sections in longitudinal direction 5 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic material with the yielding stress of 300 mpa young s modulus of 206 gpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and the density of 7 85 t m 3 6 welding residual stresses are not taken into account although the ultimate strength of hull girders could be affected by it paik et al 2008 2 1 2 finite element model and mesh sensitivity analysis 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 are adopted in the finite element model which is presented in fig 2 the nonlinear finite element analysis illustrated in this paper was conducted with the commercial fe software abaqus 6 14 it is known that the mesh size could have a significant effect on the uncertainty of the results obtained with finite element analysis to make the numerically obtained results as accurate as possible the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the yielding and local buckling process of the hull girder however finer meshes are accompanied by much greater consuming of computation efforts which means that a balance between the mesh size and computing capability has to be made taking the number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners as the measurement of the mesh refinement mesh sensitivity analysis of the finite element model is conducted to determine a proper element size which can guarantee a stable result while less computation efforts are consumed it can be observed in fig 3 that the ultimate strength and progressive collapse process of the hull girder model exhibits a stable state when there are more than 5 elements in the space between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners indicating that the numerically obtained results are not affected by mesh sizes when the number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners exceeds 5 as a result the mesh refinement of 5 elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners is adopted in the fe model of this research 2 1 3 initial geometric imperfections for stiffened panel structures initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses are inevitably produced during the welding fabrication process which could affect the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder structure paik et al 2004 as is mentioned before residual stresses are not taken into account which can be released by loading and unloading cycles with a small amplitude in experiment for the numerical model the initial deflections have been imposed into the hull girder members by modeling the shape and magnitude of the initial geometric imperfections corresponding to true ship structures three types of initial deflections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners the column type initial deflections for the plate related stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the independent stiffeners respectively for the thin horse mode of initial deflections of the local plates w o p 6 w o p w 0 sin m π x a sin π z b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflections a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frames and b is the distance between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners m is the number of buckling half waves which is taken as an integer corresponding to a b which has to satisfy 7 a b m m 1 the amplitude of the initial deflections of the local plates w 0 can be defined as follows 8 w 0 0 025 β 2 t for slight level 0 1 β 2 t for average level 0 3 β

should be noted that the average level is adopted for the initial deflections in the numerical model for the column type initial deflections of the plate related stiffeners w o s 10 w o s a 1000 sin π

stiffeners 2 1 4 boundary conditions and load application boundary conditions are the key factors to determine the practical value of the results obtained in numerical simulations to study the effect of boundary conditions on the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder and to choose a proper boundary condition to simulate the loading conditions of true ship structures three cases are discussed in this research 1 for fully restrained case the nodes at the section of the unloaded end are completely fixed with the longitudinal displacements of all the nodes of the whole fe model constrained shown in fig 4 a 2 for partially restrained case the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free shown in fig 4 b 3 for fully free case the nodes at the unloaded end are constrained in y and z direction while the longitudinal displacements of all the nodes of the whole fe model is set to be free except the one at the unloaded end section on the outer bottom centerline shown in fig 4 c according to the basic assumption in the torsional theory of thin walled girders the outline of the cross sections of thin walled girders will not be deformed in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis during the torsional collapse process which is also called the assumption of rigid edges a rigid body constraint is created for the nodes on the edge of the unloaded end section and tied to a reference point locating at the centroid of the end section by which the load application can be transmitted to the loaded end section what should be noted is that the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and will not affect the result solution with the rigid body constraint which has been verified by applying torsional moment on the reference point and the shear center of the loaded end section wang et al 2018 2 2 discussions based on the numerically obtained results 2 2 1 torsional collapse mechanisms under different boundary conditions von mises yielding criterion is widely used to determine the failure regions of the structures made of elastoplastic materials which can be expressed as 12 σ e q 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 6 τ x y 2 τ y z 2 τ z x 2 σ where σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the first the second and the third principal stress respectively τ x y τ y z and τ z x are the shear stresses in the three coordinate planes respectively the main support members for the hull girder under torsion are the side structures which determine the occurrence of the overall collapse of the hull girder as a result side structures are adopted as the main study object for characterizing the failure mechanisms of the hull girder for planar stress issues the von mises stress criterion can be degenerated to 13 σ e q σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x σ y 3 τ x y 2 σ where σ x and σ y is the normal stress induced by warping torsional moment in x and y direction respectively and τ x y is the shear stress induced by pure torsional moment the failure mechanisms of the hull girder in this paper are defined in two aspects which are the location of the yielding zones and the dominant stress component in the yielding zones it should be noted here that the stresses extracted from the numerical results have been converted into the absolute values i e only the magnitude of the stresses is concerned the difference of the three boundary conditions illustrated in 2 1 4 is inherently different restraints of the warping displacements causing different warping effects on the hull girder with the fully restrained boundary condition the hull girder collapses in pure shear failure mechanism since warping stresses are not developed at all due to the constraint of all axial strains as is shown in fig 5 a every cross section is equal to each other with the yielding zones identically and uniformly distributed along the longitudinal direction of side structures the whole side shells are in severe damage causing the overall collapse of the hull girder however transverse bulkheads are not deformed or damaged at all in pure shear mechanism to figure out which stress is dominating the failure process an average stress state of the side shells is evaluated by the average stresses of all the nodes in yielding zones the average stress state of the yielding zones of side shells in the torsional collapse process is presented in fig 5 b in which σ e q is the average von mises stress σ x and σ y is the average normal stress induced by warping torsional moment in x and y direction respectively τ x y is the average shear stress induced by pure torsional moment it can be observed from fig 5 b that the shear stress τ x y is dominating the whole collapse process while the normal stresses induced by warping effect stay close to zero during the whole collapse process it can also be found that the shear stress τ x y is approximately equal to 0 58 σ y which is the ultimate shear strength of elastoplastic materials in pure shear stress state of course fully restrained boundary condition is an idealized state for the true ship hull girder with this boundary condition an arbitrary cross section can represent the global hull girder in both collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength due to the absence of warping effect with the partially restrained boundary condition the hull girder collapses in warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones occur only in the regions close to the two ends of the hull girder while most parts of the side shells stay at a low damage level shown in fig 6 a this warping failure mechanism was also experimentally observed by sun and soares 2003 in an ultimate torsional strength experiment of a hull girder with a large deck opening as is shown in fig 6 a in this failure mode the transverse bulkheads are deformed and stressed due to the out of plane distortions of the cross sections by warping effect implying that the transverse bulkheads may play an important role in resisting the warping effect in the torsional failure process of the global hull girder the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional failure characteristics of the global hull girder will be discussed in section 2 2 3 it can be observed from fig 6 b that the normal stress σ x induced by warping effect has dominated the whole collapse process while the shear stress τ x y stays at a relatively low level implying that the hull girder mainly collapses in warping failure mechanism not shear as is shown in fig 7 a with the fully free boundary condition the distribution of the yielding zones is quite similar to that of the hull girder under the partially restrained boundary condition it is worth mentioning that the stress state of the global hull girder under the fully free boundary condition is different from the descriptions made by paik et al 2001 in an ultimate torsional strength analysis of a single segment hull girder model between two transverse bulkheads it was believed by paik et al 2001 that axial warping stresses will not be developed by torsion in a single segment hull girder model since warping displacements at the unloaded end occur freely however results in this paper show that the warping stresses are still predominantly existing for the global hull girder under the fully free boundary condition an explanation for this discrepancy can be given here as is known in the torsional theory of thin walled girders no matter of free torsion or constrained torsion for the thin walled girders with non circular cross sections out of plane distortions of cross sections must be developed in torsional process the non circular cross sections at different locations of the girders under torsion will be distorted in different degrees which is the essence of the existence of warping stresses for the single segment hull girder models employed by paik et al 2001 and other researchers the dimension in longitudinal direction is usually smaller than that of the cross sections it can be assumed that the distortions of the different cross sections are consistent neglecting the axial warping stresses as a result and the warping effect will be further weakened by the release of the warping displacements at the unloaded end section however for the global hull girder whose dimension in longitudinal direction is much larger than that of the cross sections the inconsistency of the distortions of the cross sections at different locations of the hull girder cannot be neglected warping stresses are actually developed and playing an important role in the torsional failure process of the global hull girder under fully free boundary condition 2 2 2 effect of warping restraints on the ultimate torsional strength the discrepancy in the effects of the warping restraints on the torsional failure characteristics between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder can also be observed in the view of the ultimate torsional strength which is shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b m t u 0 is the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder under fully restrained case it can be observed that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is significantly decreased with the release of warping displacements from fully restrained case to partially restrained case both for the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder however as the warping restraints are further released from partially restrained case to fully free case the global hull girder exhibits a different feature with the single segment hull girder model for the global hull girder the progressive collapse processes are quite similar under these two boundary conditions shown in fig 8 a however for the single segment hull girder a large discrepancy exists in the load displacement response curves shown in fig 8 b under these two boundary conditions implying that the ultimate torsional strength of the single segment hull girder can be significantly affected by the warping displacements at the unloaded end section compared with the single segment hull girder the global hull girder has a very large longitudinal dimension which could considerably affect the warping torsional moments also a group of transverse bulkheads and many transverse frameworks are densely arranged along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder to have contributed a lot to the torsional rigidity of the hull girder as a result above discrepancies in the torsional failure characteristics of the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder may occur as the main components of ship hull structures the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder should be investigated which will be illustrated in the following sections it needs to be noted that the numerical simulations in the following sections are conducted with the partially restrained boundary condition which is more representative of the true ship hull girders under torsion paik et al 2001 2 2 3 effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms the average normal stress σ x warping stress and average shear stress τ x y of the yielding zones in the progressive collapse process under different thickness ratios of transverse bulkheads to side shells are depicted in fig 9 in which t b and t s is the equivalent thickness of bulkheads and side shells according to eq 5 respectively it can be observed that the normal stresses are continuously weakened with the strengthening of bulkheads see fig 9 a and the shear stresses are correspondingly enhanced at the same time see fig 9 b indicating that the bulkheads can effectively weaken the warping effect and strengthen the shear effect in the torsional collapse process of the hull girder when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s is approximately smaller than 6 the normal stresses σ x will keep a considerably higher level than the shear stresses τ x y in the yielding zones which means that the warping effect is dominating the collapse process at this time under this condition the hull girder would always collapse in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and local buckling only occur at the abrupt sections near two ends shown in fig 10 a when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s is approximately larger than 9 the shear stresses τ x y will occupy a larger proportion than the normal stresses σ x in the yielding zones which means that the shear effect is governing the collapse process under this condition and the hull girder would always collapse in the shear failure mechanism of which the yielding zones are widely distributed over almost the whole side shells shown in fig 10 b in addition when bulkheads are rigid enough to make the hull girder exhibit the shear failure mechanism shown in fig 10 b it can be observed that every single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads is almost equivalent to each other in collapse behaviors which means that any single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in the torsional failure characteristics under this condition and this will be illustrated again in the view of the ultimate torsional strength in section 2 2 4 when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s lies between 6 and 9 6 t b t s 9 both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y will predominantly co exist in the yielding zones and the hull girder tends to collapse in a transition mode between warping failure mechanism and shear failure mechanism shown in fig 10 c it is worth mentioning that the stress states of the yielding zones will exhibit a stable feature after the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells exceeds 9 which means that both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y will no longer be significantly affected by the further strengthening of bulkheads when the bulkheads are already rigid enough for example both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y in progressive collapse process keep at a stable level while t b t s is increased from 9 to 30 see fig 9 of course there are no such thick plates in the usual manufacturing of ship structures however for study purpose it can help to understand the trend of the effect of bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms of the global hull girder in particular when the transverse bulkheads are rigid enough to be regarded as rigid bodies it can be seen that every single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads exhibits an identical failure mechanism in the whole torsional failure process see fig 11 the global hull girder collapses with the yielding and shear buckling of the side shells also as is mentioned above an arbitrary single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in the torsional failure characteristics when the transverse bulkheads are rigid enough what should be noted is that it is hard to accurately define and find a bifurcation point to distinguish these two failure mechanisms however the results numerically obtained with the idealized and simplified hull girder models in this section are aiming at displaying the two distinguished torsional failure mechanisms of the global hull girder with large deck openings exhibiting the significant effect of bulkheads on the torsional failure mechanisms of the global hull girder with the strengthening of the bulkheads the torsional collapse mechanism of the global hull girder can be transformed from warping failure to shear failure which will also cause a considerable effect on the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder and the effect of bulkheads on the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder will be illustrated in section 2 2 4 2 2 4 ultimate torsional strength reduction curves as is mentioned above when ultimate torsional strength analysis of the hull girder with large deck openings is conducted a single segment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads or even between two adjacent transverse frameworks is usually adopted as the study object to represent the global hull girder mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 for the hull girder under pure shear stress state shown in fig 5 an arbitrary cross section could represent the global hull girder in torsional failure characteristics and ultimate torsional strength due to the absence of warping effect however for the hull girder under partially restrained boundary condition the warping effect cannot be neglected especially for the global hull girder which has a large longitudinal dimension that could significantly affect the warping torsional moments distributed at different cross sections along the hull girder also the effect of the bulkheads should also be taken into account the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with different longitudinal dimensions and bulkheads of different rigidities is shown in fig 12 in which m t u and m t u 1 denotes the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder with a certain longitudinal dimension i e a certain number of segments and the ultimate torsional strength of the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads respectively it can be observed from fig 12 that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is decreased with the increase of the hull girder s longitudinal dimension i e the increase of the number of segments adopted in computation model indicating that the ultimate torsional strength analysis conducted with the single segment hull girder model may overestimate the ultimate torsional capacity of the global hull girder enough attention should be paid to this phenomenon because overestimation of the ultimate strength of hull girders in design procedure may cause accidents or even disasters to people the ultimate torsional strength reduction curves shown in fig 12 are divided into two distinguished clusters of which one represents the hull girders under warping failure mechanism t b t s 4 and the other represents the hull girders under shear failure mechanism t b t s 9 for the hull girders under warping failure mechanism t b t s 4 the ultimate torsional strength is decreased sharply with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension indicating that the ultimate torsional capacity of the global hull girder can be significantly weakened by warping effect for the hull girders under shear failure mechanism t b t s 9 the ultimate torsional strength is decreased much more gently with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension especially when the bulkheads are rigid enough e g t b 30 t s there is almost no reduction of the ultimate torsional strength with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of an arbitrary single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent that of the global hull girder when the bulkheads are rigid enough however as what has been mentioned in section 2 2 3 the ratio of equivalent thickness between transverse bulkheads and side shells for normal ships can hardly be so large as what is discussed in this paper which means that the transverse bulkheads for normal ships may not be rigid enough to make the global hull girder collapse in the shear failure mechanism that s to say for normal ships due to the existence of warping effect it may have overestimated the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder by taking only a single segment hull girder as the study object mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 3 validation of the numerical model it has been demonstrated that the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in both torsional failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength when the bulkheads are rigid enough in this section the numerical models which are performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis are validated by scale model experiment both in load displacement responses and collapse mode the design method of the scale model and detailed experiment procedures have been illustrated in previously published papers wang et al 2019 2020 which are not elaborated again in this paper 3 1 experiment setup as is shown in fig 13 a strong reaction frame was employed to clamp the test model at one end and a pure torsional moment was produced by two fixed hydro cylinders which could offer a pair of forces that are opposite in up and down direction but of the same magnitude as is shown in fig 14 strain gauges are arranged at several typical locations to check the anti symmetry feature of the structure responses 3 2 experiment results 3 2 1 symmetry examination of the experiment to more clearly show the anti symmetry characteristics of the structure responses in the loading process the obtained strains of ε x in the linear stage of the hull girder s collapse process are presented in fig 15 the strain loading curves of every two locations in symmetry have been plotted in the same color it could be observed from fig 15 that the structure responses at two sides of the test model are in good anti symmetry which gives a validation of the anti symmetry of the applied load and the symmetry of the model 3 2 2 load displacement response curves of the single segment hull girder load displacement response curves which are obtained in both experiment and numerical analysis are plotted in fig 16 to validate the accuracy and reliability of the numerical model it can be seen that the elastic limit strength of the test model can be well predicted by numerical analysis even though some discrepancies in the overall failure process can be observed between model test and numerical analysis the error of the ultimate strength obtained in model test and numerical analysis is only 3 8 indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of the test model can be well predicted by the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis 3 2 3 collapse mode of the single segment hull girder in experiment collapse mode of the test model is displayed in fig 17 from which it can be observed that heavy shear buckling waves occur on the panels of the side shells see fig 17 c as is known diagonal buckling will be caused in a plate subjected to pure shear glassman and moreyra garlock 2016 which means that shear failure mechanism has dominated the torsional collapse process of the test model 3 2 4 collapse mode of the single segment hull girder in numerical simulations compared with experiments numerical results could visualize the collapse mode of the structure in a more convenient and detailed way von mises stress and deformation contours of the numerical model at ultimate limit state have been displayed in fig 18 in which different components are individually displayed to more intuitively exhibit the damage condition at ultimate limit state it can be clearly seen that both inner bottom and outer bottom are in low damage with few yielding regions except for the bilge at outer bottom the main support members of the hull girder subjected to a pure torque are double side shells of which most regions have already yielded with diagonal shear buckling waves emerging on the panels inside components like transverse frameworks longitudinal girders and stiffeners are important parts of the hull girder which should not be ignored when collapse mode analysis is conducted as shown in fig 18 b most regions of inside components are in low stress level except for the parts close to bulkheads which means that inside components are not the main support members of the hull girder subjected to a pure torque either with the comparison of the collapse modes obtained in model test and numerical analysis it can be seen that the numerical model can well predict the collapse behaviors of the test model 4 conclusions in this paper the torsional failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings have been detailedly investigated with both numerical simulations and scale model collapse experiment based on the results obtained in this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 due to warping effect there exist some distinguished discrepancies in the torsional failure characteristics between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder including both failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength 2 under partially restrained boundary condition which is thought to be more representative of true ship hull girders under torsion the global hull girder with large deck openings under torsion tends to collapse in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and plastic buckling occur only at the abrupt sections close to the two ends however the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads collapses in the shear failure mechanism of which the yielding zones are distributed over the whole side structures with diagonal shear buckling waves on the panels 3 although the transverse bulkheads for normal ships may not be rigid enough the bulkheads do significantly affect the torsional failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings by weakening the warping effect under torsion the global hull girder could collapse in warping failure mechanism or shear failure mechanism depending on the rigidity of transverse bulkheads when bulkheads are not rigid enough the global hull girder collapses in warping failure mechanism and the warping failure mechanism can be transformed into the shear failure mechanism with the increase of the rigidity of transverse bulkheads which can also cause a considerable effect on the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder 4 due to warping effect the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder can be significantly decreased with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension under warping failure mechanism indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder may be overestimated by the numerically or experimentally obtained results based on the single segment hull girder however with the transformation of hull girder s failure mechanisms from warping failure to shear failure the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is decreased more and more slowly with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension when the bulkheads are rigid enough the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder would not be affected by its longitudinal dimension under this condition the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in both torsional failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength 5 with the comparison of the experimentally and numerically obtained load displacement response curves and failure modes of the hull girder it can be observed that the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis can well predict the ultimate torsional strength and the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull

22104,taking a 10 000teu container ship as the study object a series of simplified global hull girder models with large deck openings are modeled and analyzed to investigate their torsional failure behaviors including collapse modes and ultimate torsional strength the objective of this research is to answer which mechanism the hull girder with large deck openings under torsion will collapse in and to figure out the decisive factor that is dominating the transformation between the warping failure and the shear failure mechanism in addition the ultimate torsional strength reduction curves of the hull girder with large deck openings are obtained to reveal the relationship of the ultimate torsional strength between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder also it is experimentally validated that the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis can well predict the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the test model keywords global hull girder single segment torsional failure mechanisms warping failure shear failure strength reduction curves 1 introduction according to the thin walled girder theory warping and shear stresses are both developed when a thin walled beam with open cross sections is subjected to torsion pedersen 1985 1991 paik et al 2001 correspondingly there may exist two torsional failure mechanisms warping failure or shear failure for the hull girder with large deck openings when ships sail at an oblique heading in rough sea the torsional moments induced by waves and non symmetrical cargo loading may approach or even exceed the vertical bending moments causing a necessity to comprehensively understand the torsional failure characteristics of the hull girder with large deck openings due to their low torsional rigidity the ultimate torsional strength experiment conducted by sun and soares 2003 showed that the hull girder with a large deck opening under torsion collapsed in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and plastic buckling only occurred at the abrupt sections near two ends with most parts of the side structures remaining at a low damage level paik et al 2001 illustrated a procedure for calculating the distribution and magnitude of warping and shear stresses for the hull cross section of a container ship under unit torsion mainly focusing on the elastic response even though the collapse process of hull girders exhibits a high nonlinearity including both material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity based on the torsional theory of thin walled girders and orthotropic plate theory an analytical expression that could regard the contribution of transverse bulkheads to the torsional stiffness of the hull girder with a large deck opening was derived by senjanović and tomašević 2008 quantitatively presenting the influence of the geometric characteristics of transverse bulkheads on the torsional stiffness of the hull girder in an approximate way which could be referred as a quick reference in early stages of ship structure design tanaka et al 2015 had studied the ultimate strength performance of a typical container ship under combined loads aiming at developing an analysis method of the ultimate hull girder strength under combined loads an ultimate strength experiment of a swath ship subjected to transverse loads was conducted by liu et al 2018 having illustrated the design and manufacture process of the scale model an ultimate bending strength test of an inland catamaran was performed by xu et al 2019 establishing a procedure for evaluating the ultimate strength of the catamaran for some researchers the hull cross section of container ships could be simplified to be composed of some closed or open rectangular sections one of which can be adopted as the study object to investigate the collapse behaviors and ultimate strength of box girders residual ultimate strength of cracked box girders with and without opening under pure torsion was numerically studied by shi and wang 2012a b proposing a simple model for predicting the residual ultimate strength of cracked box girders under pure torsion another numerical investigation of the ultimate torsional strength of cracked box girders with a large deck opening was performed by ao and wang 2016 having detailedly illustrated the influence of some potential parameters such as mesh refinement initial imperfections and material strain hardening on the ultimate torsional strength of cracked box girders for ultra large container ships mohammed and benson 2016 conducted a numerical study of the ultimate hull girder strength of a 10 000teu container ship under two combined loads introducing an ultimate strength interaction of the hull girder between vertical bending and torsion later a three dimensional hull girder ultimate strength envelope for an ultra large container ship was numerically investigated by wang et al 2018 deriving a formula that could regard the ultimate strength interaction of the hull girder among three combined loads however in their research only the mid ship compartment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads was adopted as the study object to represent the global hull girder neglecting the effect of transverse bulkheads and hull girder s longitudinal dimension and they mainly devoted their efforts to studying the ultimate strength of the hull girder without conducting a discussion about the failure mechanisms the study on the failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings is the main focus of this paper although the ultimate strength performance of the hull girder can also be affected by dynamic effect such as strain rate yang et al 2018 liu and soares 2019 dynamic effect involved in the collapse process of the hull girder is not considered in this paper in current studies on evaluating the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with large deck openings a single segment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads are employed to represent the global hull girder neglecting the effect of transverse bulkheads and hull girder s longitudinal dimension on the torsional failure behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder shi and wang 2012a b ao and wang 2016 mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 however according to the thin walled girder theory for the global hull girder with large deck openings under torsion the sectional torque is composed of pure torsional moment and warping torsional moment senjanović and tomašević 2008 namely 1 t t t t w in which the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment can be expressed by senjanović and tomašević 2008 2 t t t 1 cos h β x cos h β l 3 t w t cos h β x cos h β l 4 β g i t e i w where x and l is the distance from the mid ship section and the overall length of the hull girder respectively i t i w e and g is the torsional modulus warping modulus young s modulus and shear modulus respectively it can be seen that both the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment at a certain section are considerably affected by the longitudinal dimension of the hull girder due to the existence of warping effect for the hull girder with large deck openings the torsional collapse behaviors and the ultimate torsional strength between the global hull girder and a single segment hull girder should be different transverse bulkheads are important components of ship hull structures contributing a lot to the torsional rigidity of the hull girders with large deck openings senjanović and tomašević 2008 the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with large deck openings also needs to be investigated making a more comprehensive understanding of the torsional collapse characteristics of the hull girder with large deck openings corresponding to what is mentioned above taking a 10 000teu container ship as the study object a series of simplified global hull girder models are modeled and analyzed to figure out the torsional collapse mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings taking the number of the hull girder segments adopted in the computation model and the rigidity of transverse bulkheads as two variables a series of nonlinear finite element analyses are conducted to figure out the effect of hull girder s longitudinal dimension and transverse bulkheads on the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder it should be noted that only transverse bulkheads are taken into account when the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder were discussed in this paper 2 nonlinear finite element analysis as is mentioned before due to the existence of warping effect the pure torsional moment and the warping torsional moment are not identically distributed at different cross sections along the longitudinal direction when the hull girder is bearing a torsional moment therefore in order to explicitly figure out the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder with large deck openings the global hull girder should be simulated taking the influence of transverse bulkheads into account 2 1 fe modeling 2 1 1 description of the object ship and the simplified hull girder model the principal characteristics of the transverse mid ship section of the 10 000teu ultra large container ship are presented in fig 1 the main dimensions and details of the ship are shown in table 1 and table 2 most components of the hull girder structure are manufactured with non uniform thickness plates especially for the side structures which are made of stepped plates of which the thickness of the upper part plates is considerably larger than that of the middle and lower part the side structures are the main support components of the hull girder in its torsional collapse process which means that the configuration of side structures may have a significant effect on the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull girder some researchers have simplified their test models to the ones with the side structures that are manufactured with uniform thickness plates which may bring some uncertainties to the experimental results sun and soares 2003 the objective of this nonlinear finite element analyses is to figure out the main factors that could influence the collapse mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings under torsion to capture the main parameters and conduct a parametric study the hull girder model is simplified as follows 1 the segments which are close to the bow and stern of the ship are simplified to the compartments with closed sections 2 transverse bulkheads either support ones or water tight ones are simplified to the plates with an equivalent thickness which is determined as follows 5 t e q t i 1 n t i a i i 1 n a i where t i and a i is the plate thickness and area of a local plate respectively 3 anti torsion boxes play a similar role with transverse bulkheads and transverse frameworks in the torsional collapse process of the hull girder for simplicity and to control the main parameters anti torsion boxes are neglected in the modeling process local complex joints that have little effect on the overall collapse behaviors of the hull girder are also simplified 4 the hull girder is simplified to a prismatic pontoon with cross sections of the mid ship section of a 10 000teu container ship shown in fig 1 neglecting the variations of cross sections in longitudinal direction 5 the hull girder structure is assumed to be made of elastic perfectly plastic material with the yielding stress of 300 mpa young s modulus of 206 gpa poisson s ratio of 0 3 and the density of 7 85 t m 3 6 welding residual stresses are not taken into account although the ultimate strength of hull girders could be affected by it paik et al 2008 2 1 2 finite element model and mesh sensitivity analysis 4 node doubly curved general purpose shell element s4r and 3 node triangular general purpose shell element s3 are adopted in the finite element model which is presented in fig 2 the nonlinear finite element analysis illustrated in this paper was conducted with the commercial fe software abaqus 6 14 it is known that the mesh size could have a significant effect on the uncertainty of the results obtained with finite element analysis to make the numerically obtained results as accurate as possible the meshes should be fine enough to well capture the yielding and local buckling process of the hull girder however finer meshes are accompanied by much greater consuming of computation efforts which means that a balance between the mesh size and computing capability has to be made taking the number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners as the measurement of the mesh refinement mesh sensitivity analysis of the finite element model is conducted to determine a proper element size which can guarantee a stable result while less computation efforts are consumed it can be observed in fig 3 that the ultimate strength and progressive collapse process of the hull girder model exhibits a stable state when there are more than 5 elements in the space between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners indicating that the numerically obtained results are not affected by mesh sizes when the number of the elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners exceeds 5 as a result the mesh refinement of 5 elements between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners is adopted in the fe model of this research 2 1 3 initial geometric imperfections for stiffened panel structures initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses are inevitably produced during the welding fabrication process which could affect the ultimate strength and collapse behaviors of the hull girder structure paik et al 2004 as is mentioned before residual stresses are not taken into account which can be released by loading and unloading cycles with a small amplitude in experiment for the numerical model the initial deflections have been imposed into the hull girder members by modeling the shape and magnitude of the initial geometric imperfections corresponding to true ship structures three types of initial deflections are taken into account which are the thin horse mode for the local plates between stiffeners the column type initial deflections for the plate related stiffeners and the sideways initial deflections for the independent stiffeners respectively for the thin horse mode of initial deflections of the local plates w o p 6 w o p w 0 sin m π x a sin π z b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflections a is the distance between two adjacent transverse frames and b is the distance between two adjacent longitudinal stiffeners m is the number of buckling half waves which is taken as an integer corresponding to a b which has to satisfy 7 a b m m 1 the amplitude of the initial deflections of the local plates w 0 can be defined as follows 8 w 0 0 025 β 2 t for slight level 0 1 β 2 t for average level 0 3 β 2 t for severe level in which t is the plate thickness e is young s modulus σ y is the yielding stress of the material and β is the plate slenderness parameter which is defined by 9 β b t σ y e it should be noted that the average level is adopted for the initial deflections in the numerical model for the column type initial deflections of the plate related stiffeners w o s 10 w o s a 1000 sin π

stiffeners 2 1 4 boundary conditions and load application boundary conditions are the key factors to determine the practical value of the results obtained in numerical simulations to study the effect of boundary conditions on the torsional collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder and to choose a proper boundary condition to simulate the loading conditions of true ship structures three cases are discussed in this research 1 for fully restrained case the nodes at the section of the unloaded end are completely fixed with the longitudinal displacements of all the nodes of the whole fe model constrained shown in fig 4 a 2 for partially restrained case the nodes at the unloaded end are completely fixed with all the other nodes of the fe model free shown in fig 4 b 3 for fully free case the nodes at the unloaded end are constrained in y and z direction while the longitudinal displacements of all the nodes of the whole fe model is set to be free except the one at the unloaded end section on the outer bottom centerline shown in fig 4 c according to the basic assumption in the torsional theory of thin walled girders the outline of the cross sections of thin walled girders will not be deformed in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis during the torsional collapse process which is also called the assumption of rigid edges a rigid body constraint is created for the nodes on the edge of the unloaded end section and tied to a reference point locating at the centroid of the end section by which the load application can be transmitted to the loaded end section what should be noted is that the position of the reference point can be arbitrary and will not affect the result solution with the rigid body constraint which has been verified by applying torsional moment on the reference point and the shear center of the loaded end section wang et al 2018 2 2 discussions based on the numerically obtained results 2 2 1 torsional collapse mechanisms under different boundary conditions von mises yielding criterion is widely used to determine the failure regions of the structures made of elastoplastic materials which can be expressed as 12 σ e q 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 6 τ x y 2 τ y z 2 τ z x 2 σ where σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the first the second and the third principal stress respectively τ x y τ y z and τ z x are the shear stresses in the three coordinate planes respectively the main support members for the hull girder under torsion are the side structures which determine the occurrence of the overall collapse of the hull girder as a result side structures are adopted as the main study object for characterizing the failure mechanisms of the hull girder for planar stress issues the von mises stress criterion can be degenerated to 13 σ e q σ x 2 σ y 2 σ x σ y 3 τ x y 2 σ where σ x and σ y is the normal stress induced by warping torsional moment in x and y direction respectively and τ x y is the shear stress induced by pure torsional moment the failure mechanisms of the hull girder in this paper are defined in two aspects which are the location of the yielding zones and the dominant stress component in the yielding zones it should be noted here that the stresses extracted from the numerical results have been converted into the absolute values i e only the magnitude of the stresses is concerned the difference of the three boundary conditions illustrated in 2 1 4 is inherently different restraints of the warping displacements causing different warping effects on the hull girder with the fully restrained boundary condition the hull girder collapses in pure shear failure mechanism since warping stresses are not developed at all due to the constraint of all axial strains as is shown in fig 5 a every cross section is equal to each other with the yielding zones identically and uniformly distributed along the longitudinal direction of side structures the whole side shells are in severe damage causing the overall collapse of the hull girder however transverse bulkheads are not deformed or damaged at all in pure shear mechanism to figure out which stress is dominating the failure process an average stress state of the side shells is evaluated by the average stresses of all the nodes in yielding zones the average stress state of the yielding zones of side shells in the torsional collapse process is presented in fig 5 b in which σ e q is the average von mises stress σ x and σ y is the average normal stress induced by warping torsional moment in x and y direction respectively τ x y is the average shear stress induced by pure torsional moment it can be observed from fig 5 b that the shear stress τ x y is dominating the whole collapse process while the normal stresses induced by warping effect stay close to zero during the whole collapse process it can also be found that the shear stress τ x y is approximately equal to 0 58 σ y which is the ultimate shear strength of elastoplastic materials in pure shear stress state of course fully restrained boundary condition is an idealized state for the true ship hull girder with this boundary condition an arbitrary cross section can represent the global hull girder in both collapse behaviors and ultimate torsional strength due to the absence of warping effect with the partially restrained boundary condition the hull girder collapses in warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones occur only in the regions close to the two ends of the hull girder while most parts of the side shells stay at a low damage level shown in fig 6 a this warping failure mechanism was also experimentally observed by sun and soares 2003 in an ultimate torsional strength experiment of a hull girder with a large deck opening as is shown in fig 6 a in this failure mode the transverse bulkheads are deformed and stressed due to the out of plane distortions of the cross sections by warping effect implying that the transverse bulkheads may play an important role in resisting the warping effect in the torsional failure process of the global hull girder the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional failure characteristics of the global hull girder will be discussed in section 2 2 3 it can be observed from fig 6 b that the normal stress σ x induced by warping effect has dominated the whole collapse process while the shear stress τ x y stays at a relatively low level implying that the hull girder mainly collapses in warping failure mechanism not shear as is shown in fig 7 a with the fully free boundary condition the distribution of the yielding zones is quite similar to that of the hull girder under the partially restrained boundary condition it is worth mentioning that the stress state of the global hull girder under the fully free boundary condition is different from the descriptions made by paik et al 2001 in an ultimate torsional strength analysis of a single segment hull girder model between two transverse bulkheads it was believed by paik et al 2001 that axial warping stresses will not be developed by torsion in a single segment hull girder model since warping displacements at the unloaded end occur freely however results in this paper show that the warping stresses are still predominantly existing for the global hull girder under the fully free boundary condition an explanation for this discrepancy can be given here as is known in the torsional theory of thin walled girders no matter of free torsion or constrained torsion for the thin walled girders with non circular cross sections out of plane distortions of cross sections must be developed in torsional process the non circular cross sections at different locations of the girders under torsion will be distorted in different degrees which is the essence of the existence of warping stresses for the single segment hull girder models employed by paik et al 2001 and other researchers the dimension in longitudinal direction is usually smaller than that of the cross sections it can be assumed that the distortions of the different cross sections are consistent neglecting the axial warping stresses as a result and the warping effect will be further weakened by the release of the warping displacements at the unloaded end section however for the global hull girder whose dimension in longitudinal direction is much larger than that of the cross sections the inconsistency of the distortions of the cross sections at different locations of the hull girder cannot be neglected warping stresses are actually developed and playing an important role in the torsional failure process of the global hull girder under fully free boundary condition 2 2 2 effect of warping restraints on the ultimate torsional strength the discrepancy in the effects of the warping restraints on the torsional failure characteristics between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder can also be observed in the view of the ultimate torsional strength which is shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b m t u 0 is the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder under fully restrained case it can be observed that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is significantly decreased with the release of warping displacements from fully restrained case to partially restrained case both for the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder however as the warping restraints are further released from partially restrained case to fully free case the global hull girder exhibits a different feature with the single segment hull girder model for the global hull girder the progressive collapse processes are quite similar under these two boundary conditions shown in fig 8 a however for the single segment hull girder a large discrepancy exists in the load displacement response curves shown in fig 8 b under these two boundary conditions implying that the ultimate torsional strength of the single segment hull girder can be significantly affected by the warping displacements at the unloaded end section compared with the single segment hull girder the global hull girder has a very large longitudinal dimension which could considerably affect the warping torsional moments also a group of transverse bulkheads and many transverse frameworks are densely arranged along the longitudinal direction of the hull girder to have contributed a lot to the torsional rigidity of the hull girder as a result above discrepancies in the torsional failure characteristics of the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder may occur as the main components of ship hull structures the effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder should be investigated which will be illustrated in the following sections it needs to be noted that the numerical simulations in the following sections are conducted with the partially restrained boundary condition which is more representative of the true ship hull girders under torsion paik et al 2001 2 2 3 effect of transverse bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms the average normal stress σ x warping stress and average shear stress τ x y of the yielding zones in the progressive collapse process under different thickness ratios of transverse bulkheads to side shells are depicted in fig 9 in which t b and t s is the equivalent thickness of bulkheads and side shells according to eq 5 respectively it can be observed that the normal stresses are continuously weakened with the strengthening of bulkheads see fig 9 a and the shear stresses are correspondingly enhanced at the same time see fig 9 b indicating that the bulkheads can effectively weaken the warping effect and strengthen the shear effect in the torsional collapse process of the hull girder when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s is approximately smaller than 6 the normal stresses σ x will keep a considerably higher level than the shear stresses τ x y in the yielding zones which means that the warping effect is dominating the collapse process at this time under this condition the hull girder would always collapse in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and local buckling only occur at the abrupt sections near two ends shown in fig 10 a when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s is approximately larger than 9 the shear stresses τ x y will occupy a larger proportion than the normal stresses σ x in the yielding zones which means that the shear effect is governing the collapse process under this condition and the hull girder would always collapse in the shear failure mechanism of which the yielding zones are widely distributed over almost the whole side shells shown in fig 10 b in addition when bulkheads are rigid enough to make the hull girder exhibit the shear failure mechanism shown in fig 10 b it can be observed that every single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads is almost equivalent to each other in collapse behaviors which means that any single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in the torsional failure characteristics under this condition and this will be illustrated again in the view of the ultimate torsional strength in section 2 2 4 when the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells t b t s lies between 6 and 9 6 t b t s 9 both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y will predominantly co exist in the yielding zones and the hull girder tends to collapse in a transition mode between warping failure mechanism and shear failure mechanism shown in fig 10 c it is worth mentioning that the stress states of the yielding zones will exhibit a stable feature after the thickness ratio of bulkheads to side shells exceeds 9 which means that both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y will no longer be significantly affected by the further strengthening of bulkheads when the bulkheads are already rigid enough for example both the normal stresses σ x and the shear stresses τ x y in progressive collapse process keep at a stable level while t b t s is increased from 9 to 30 see fig 9 of course there are no such thick plates in the usual manufacturing of ship structures however for study purpose it can help to understand the trend of the effect of bulkheads on the torsional collapse mechanisms of the global hull girder in particular when the transverse bulkheads are rigid enough to be regarded as rigid bodies it can be seen that every single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads exhibits an identical failure mechanism in the whole torsional failure process see fig 11 the global hull girder collapses with the yielding and shear buckling of the side shells also as is mentioned above an arbitrary single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in the torsional failure characteristics when the transverse bulkheads are rigid enough what should be noted is that it is hard to accurately define and find a bifurcation point to distinguish these two failure mechanisms however the results numerically obtained with the idealized and simplified hull girder models in this section are aiming at displaying the two distinguished torsional failure mechanisms of the global hull girder with large deck openings exhibiting the significant effect of bulkheads on the torsional failure mechanisms of the global hull girder with the strengthening of the bulkheads the torsional collapse mechanism of the global hull girder can be transformed from warping failure to shear failure which will also cause a considerable effect on the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder and the effect of bulkheads on the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder will be illustrated in section 2 2 4 2 2 4 ultimate torsional strength reduction curves as is mentioned above when ultimate torsional strength analysis of the hull girder with large deck openings is conducted a single segment between two adjacent transverse bulkheads or even between two adjacent transverse frameworks is usually adopted as the study object to represent the global hull girder mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 for the hull girder under pure shear stress state shown in fig 5 an arbitrary cross section could represent the global hull girder in torsional failure characteristics and ultimate torsional strength due to the absence of warping effect however for the hull girder under partially restrained boundary condition the warping effect cannot be neglected especially for the global hull girder which has a large longitudinal dimension that could significantly affect the warping torsional moments distributed at different cross sections along the hull girder also the effect of the bulkheads should also be taken into account the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girders with different longitudinal dimensions and bulkheads of different rigidities is shown in fig 12 in which m t u and m t u 1 denotes the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder with a certain longitudinal dimension i e a certain number of segments and the ultimate torsional strength of the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads respectively it can be observed from fig 12 that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is decreased with the increase of the hull girder s longitudinal dimension i e the increase of the number of segments adopted in computation model indicating that the ultimate torsional strength analysis conducted with the single segment hull girder model may overestimate the ultimate torsional capacity of the global hull girder enough attention should be paid to this phenomenon because overestimation of the ultimate strength of hull girders in design procedure may cause accidents or even disasters to people the ultimate torsional strength reduction curves shown in fig 12 are divided into two distinguished clusters of which one represents the hull girders under warping failure mechanism t b t s 4 and the other represents the hull girders under shear failure mechanism t b t s 9 for the hull girders under warping failure mechanism t b t s 4 the ultimate torsional strength is decreased sharply with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension indicating that the ultimate torsional capacity of the global hull girder can be significantly weakened by warping effect for the hull girders under shear failure mechanism t b t s 9 the ultimate torsional strength is decreased much more gently with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension especially when the bulkheads are rigid enough e g t b 30 t s there is almost no reduction of the ultimate torsional strength with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of an arbitrary single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent that of the global hull girder when the bulkheads are rigid enough however as what has been mentioned in section 2 2 3 the ratio of equivalent thickness between transverse bulkheads and side shells for normal ships can hardly be so large as what is discussed in this paper which means that the transverse bulkheads for normal ships may not be rigid enough to make the global hull girder collapse in the shear failure mechanism that s to say for normal ships due to the existence of warping effect it may have overestimated the ultimate torsional strength of the global hull girder by taking only a single segment hull girder as the study object mohammed and benson 2016 wang et al 2018 3 validation of the numerical model it has been demonstrated that the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in both torsional failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength when the bulkheads are rigid enough in this section the numerical models which are performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis are validated by scale model experiment both in load displacement responses and collapse mode the design method of the scale model and detailed experiment procedures have been illustrated in previously published papers wang et al 2019 2020 which are not elaborated again in this paper 3 1 experiment setup as is shown in fig 13 a strong reaction frame was employed to clamp the test model at one end and a pure torsional moment was produced by two fixed hydro cylinders which could offer a pair of forces that are opposite in up and down direction but of the same magnitude as is shown in fig 14 strain gauges are arranged at several typical locations to check the anti symmetry feature of the structure responses 3 2 experiment results 3 2 1 symmetry examination of the experiment to more clearly show the anti symmetry characteristics of the structure responses in the loading process the obtained strains of ε x in the linear stage of the hull girder s collapse process are presented in fig 15 the strain loading curves of every two locations in symmetry have been plotted in the same color it could be observed from fig 15 that the structure responses at two sides of the test model are in good anti symmetry which gives a validation of the anti symmetry of the applied load and the symmetry of the model 3 2 2 load displacement response curves of the single segment hull girder load displacement response curves which are obtained in both experiment and numerical analysis are plotted in fig 16 to validate the accuracy and reliability of the numerical model it can be seen that the elastic limit strength of the test model can be well predicted by numerical analysis even though some discrepancies in the overall failure process can be observed between model test and numerical analysis the error of the ultimate strength obtained in model test and numerical analysis is only 3 8 indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of the test model can be well predicted by the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis 3 2 3 collapse mode of the single segment hull girder in experiment collapse mode of the test model is displayed in fig 17 from which it can be observed that heavy shear buckling waves occur on the panels of the side shells see fig 17 c as is known diagonal buckling will be caused in a plate subjected to pure shear glassman and moreyra garlock 2016 which means that shear failure mechanism has dominated the torsional collapse process of the test model 3 2 4 collapse mode of the single segment hull girder in numerical simulations compared with experiments numerical results could visualize the collapse mode of the structure in a more convenient and detailed way von mises stress and deformation contours of the numerical model at ultimate limit state have been displayed in fig 18 in which different components are individually displayed to more intuitively exhibit the damage condition at ultimate limit state it can be clearly seen that both inner bottom and outer bottom are in low damage with few yielding regions except for the bilge at outer bottom the main support members of the hull girder subjected to a pure torque are double side shells of which most regions have already yielded with diagonal shear buckling waves emerging on the panels inside components like transverse frameworks longitudinal girders and stiffeners are important parts of the hull girder which should not be ignored when collapse mode analysis is conducted as shown in fig 18 b most regions of inside components are in low stress level except for the parts close to bulkheads which means that inside components are not the main support members of the hull girder subjected to a pure torque either with the comparison of the collapse modes obtained in model test and numerical analysis it can be seen that the numerical model can well predict the collapse behaviors of the test model 4 conclusions in this paper the torsional failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings have been detailedly investigated with both numerical simulations and scale model collapse experiment based on the results obtained in this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 due to warping effect there exist some distinguished discrepancies in the torsional failure characteristics between the global hull girder and the single segment hull girder including both failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength 2 under partially restrained boundary condition which is thought to be more representative of true ship hull girders under torsion the global hull girder with large deck openings under torsion tends to collapse in the warping failure mechanism of which the yielding zones and plastic buckling occur only at the abrupt sections close to the two ends however the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads collapses in the shear failure mechanism of which the yielding zones are distributed over the whole side structures with diagonal shear buckling waves on the panels 3 although the transverse bulkheads for normal ships may not be rigid enough the bulkheads do significantly affect the torsional failure mechanisms of the hull girder with large deck openings by weakening the warping effect under torsion the global hull girder could collapse in warping failure mechanism or shear failure mechanism depending on the rigidity of transverse bulkheads when bulkheads are not rigid enough the global hull girder collapses in warping failure mechanism and the warping failure mechanism can be transformed into the shear failure mechanism with the increase of the rigidity of transverse bulkheads which can also cause a considerable effect on the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder 4 due to warping effect the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder can be significantly decreased with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension under warping failure mechanism indicating that the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder may be overestimated by the numerically or experimentally obtained results based on the single segment hull girder however with the transformation of hull girder s failure mechanisms from warping failure to shear failure the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder is decreased more and more slowly with the increase of hull girder s longitudinal dimension when the bulkheads are rigid enough the ultimate torsional strength of the hull girder would not be affected by its longitudinal dimension under this condition the single segment hull girder between two adjacent transverse bulkheads could represent the global hull girder in both torsional failure mechanisms and ultimate torsional strength 5 with the comparison of the experimentally and numerically obtained load displacement response curves and failure modes of the hull girder it can be observed that the numerical models performed with nonlinear large deflection elastoplastic finite element analysis can well predict the ultimate torsional strength and the torsional collapse behaviors of the hull
