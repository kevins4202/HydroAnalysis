4555,the hydrology of the himalayan region known as the water tower of asia is undergoing rapid transformations due to climate change and growing human influences and it is known that this region is one of those most vulnerable to climate change numerous studies have examined the changes in the hydrology of nepal which includes a significant upstream portion of the himalayas however there is a lack of holistic studies on the spatial temporal evolution of hydrologic dynamics over the entire nation and over long periods in this study we present a comprehensive assessment of the changes in river discharge flood occurrence and terrestrial water storage tws across all river basins in nepal using hydrological hydrodynamic simulations spanning for 40 years 1979 2018 at 5 km spatial resolution and downscaled flood attributes at 90 m resolution the spatio temporal variations in river discharge and inundation extent are examined through mapping of decadal trends using a quantile analysis method the results indicate that the dynamics of river discharge has evolved varyingly across different river basins the evolution pattern within a basin generally agrees with that at the basin outlet but notable exceptions are found indicating high hydro climatic heterogeneity within the basins the decadal evaluation of flood dynamics over major flooded areas suggests that inundation dynamics is strongly influenced by various flow characteristics including the timing duration and magnitude and that the evolution of flood dynamics is more complex than that of river discharge results indicate that the tws dynamics over entire nepal is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage and groundwater storage has been in continuous decline 1 74 cm year in the recent decades 2002 2016 this study provides a basis to advance the understanding of long term hydrologic changes in the himalayan region with important implications for improved water resources management keywords himalayan hydrology nepal hydrological hydrodynamic modeling flood dynamics terrestrial water storage groundwater depletion 1 introduction the himalayan region referred to as the water tower of asia supplies plentiful water to sustain river and groundwater systems in its downstream that provide water for human livelihood and critical ecosystems immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007 as the changes in the earth s environment continue to alter the monsoonal rainfall patterns that strongly modulate the hydrology of the region ghosh et al 2016 2012 mitra et al 2012 the spatio temporal dynamics of downstream water availability has become a topic of increasing concern dahal et al 2018 dimri et al 2018a 2018b immerzeel et al 2014 jeelani et al 2012 shrestha et al 2012 mounting evidence suggests that the himalayan region is highly vulnerable to climate change roy et al 2019 tewari et al 2017 among himalayan countries nepal accounts for significant upstream portions of himalayan region that has drastic elevation variation resulting in diverse climate karki et al 2016 and land cover characteristics and biodiversity across the nation bonekamp et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 singh et al 2019 hence understanding the hydrologic dynamics of river basins in nepal is of utmost importance to provide a better understanding of the spatio temporal changes in the himalayan hydrology surface water dynamics in nepal is governed primarily by himalayan snowmelt and monsoon rainfall the four major river basins namely the mahakali karnali gandaki and koshi fig 1 originate in the upper himalayan region receiving substantial snow and glacier melt water flow through rugged terrains in the central hilly areas of nepal and drain into the ganges river system in india overall the hydrologic dynamics of these river systems is strongly modulated by the rhythm of the south asian monsoon that brings 80 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon season june september panthi et al 2015 shrestha 2000 the intense monsoonal rains produce a typical unimodal hydrograph with a sharp rise in flow volumes often causing widespread flooding dhital and kayastha 2013 during the dry season flows reduce appreciably affecting downstream agricultural systems and causing issues for sustaining hydropower generation dahal et al 2020 poudyal et al 2019 the large climate and topographic gradient young geological formations and strong monsoon effect make the river basins of nepal highly susceptible not only to adverse climatic impacts e g floods droughts but also to natural hazards including glacial lake outburst flood glof and excessive soil erosion agarwal et al 2016 chen et al 2013 as the nation is undergoing rapid socio economic growth the threats of climate change impacts are further exacerbated by human induced changes in land water systems due to expanding agriculture urbanization and construction of dams for hydropower generation and irrigation which are all inevitable to support the growing needs for food water and energy chinnasamy et al 2015 dhakal et al 2019 paudel et al 2016 moreover the transboundary nature of the mahakali karnali gandaki and koshi basins that share some portions with china and india adds further challenges in making optimum use of resources among different regions while also considering the ecosystem needs as such these ongoing climate shifts and human induced alterations of land water systems have altogether resulted in an increasing threat to the region in terms of water and food security and ecological integrity analysis of long term observational data provides an insight for historical evolution however hydrometeorological observations are generally scarce in terms of both spatial and temporal coverages especially for regions like nepal in this vein hydrological models are indispensable tools for understanding the long term evolution of such complex and large scale hydrologic systems indeed large scale hydrologic studies have benefited from the advances made in hydrological modeling over the past two decades nazemi and wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2017 2016 wada et al 2017 in case of the himalayan region and specifically for nepal most studies have relied on limited observations e g karki et al 2020 sharma and shakya 2006 and modeling studies have not fully exploited the advances in recent model developments the outstanding challenges and limitations of existing hydrologic and hydrodynamic studies in nepal are primarily related to 1 a focus on river flow as the sole variable to describe the changing hydrology in the region e g bajracharya et al 2018 palazzoli et al 2015 pandey et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2017 sharma and shakya 2006 shrestha et al 2016a 2016b 2014 2013 and 2 sub national scale studies focusing on a part of the country e g babel et al 2014 bharati et al 2016 bhatta et al 2019 chinnasamy et al 2015 mishra et al 2018 regarding to the first issue identified above among many observation and modeling based studies in nepal most have focused on changes in river flow while river flow is a key indicator of water availability there are other hydrologic variables such as surface water depth inundated area and river floodplain water storage that provide a more comprehensive representation of the spatial and temporal changes in water resource systems for example pandey et al 2011 assess the adaptive capacity of water resources system of the bagmati river basin by using area of vegetation and wetland as a proxy for ecological capacity due to the limitation of data availability with the high resolution modeling variables such as the natural water availability can be explicitly derived from the simulated spatio temporal distribution of water storages which are useful for water resources management and ecological applications bharati et al 2014 as for the second issue hydrological simulations have generally been conducted for a portion of the nation to cope with the aforementioned compounded pressures it is essential to develop a holistic understanding of the long term and nationwide hydrologic changes since many water related problems are multi sectoral that should be addressed at the local national and regional scales friedman et al 1984 henriksen et al 2003 mcmillan et al 2016 the increased domain size also provides an opportunity to utilize the terrestrial water storage tws measurements from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites rarely used by previous studies in nepal as such the simulation of the hydrologic systems across all basins can provide a holistic view at the national level the objective of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of the spatio temporal changes in hydrologic fluxes and storages across all river basins of nepal and for a multi decadal historical period the results are based on high resolution integrated hydrological hydrodynamic modeling validated against ground and satellite based observations key research questions addressed in this study are follows 1 how has the dynamics of natural river discharge inundated areas and tws in the himalayan river basins of nepal evolved over the past four decades 2 are there any distinct spatial patterns and temporal signatures in low median and high river flows in those river basins 3 what are the similarities in inter annual and decadal trends across the river basins located in different geographic regions we answer these questions based on the simulation results of the historical river floodplain dynamics for 40 years i e 1979 2018 period at a spatial resolution of 5 km 3 arc minute where flood extent is downscaled to a further finer resolution of 90 m 3 arc second such advanced capability of high resolution hydrological modeling for a large domain is enabled by combining a global land surface model higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 and a global river floodplain hydrodynamic model cama flood yamazaki et al 2011 to our best knowledge this is the first study of such kind to use high resolution simulations of river floodplain dynamics over the entire nepal in which not only the changes in river discharge but also inundated areas and river floodplain water storages are examined through the high resolution modeling over the nationwide domain we provide important advances over previous studies in the region in that the simulations are conducted in a consistent modeling framework which allows collective comparisons of basin wise characteristics of hydrological responses this enables the understanding of how the hydrology in the region has evolved historically which is a key to future projections of water resources and hence sustainable development and climate change adaptation in the remainder of this paper the models higw mat and cama flood are introduced and observational data and research approach are described in section 2 results and discussions are provided in section 3 and summary and conclusion are presented in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 higw mat and cama flood models higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 is a global land surface model that simulates various hydrological processes from canopy to bedrock on a full physical basis by solving both energy and water balances cama flood yamazaki et al 2013 2011 is a global hydrodynamic model which computes river floodplain hydrodynamics i e river discharge flow velocity water level and inundated area by solving shallow water equations of open channel flow explicitly accounting for backwater effects using the local inertial approximation yamazaki et al 2013 we use a modeling framework that combines higw mat and cama flood such integration provides an optimal combination in terms of spatial resolution needed to resolve key hydrological processes at different scales higw mat is used to simulate local runoff by considering hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration snow melt infiltration and groundwater dynamics at a resolution of 0 5 50 km that is consistent with that of meteorological forcing namely the watch forcing data using the era interim wfdei data weedon et al 2018 the runoff from higw mat is then used in cama flood to simulate the finer details of river floodplain processes at a high resolution of 3 arcmin 5km because the focus of the present study is river discharge and floodplain processes this model combination has been widely used for regional to global scale studies burbano et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 yamazaki et al 2014 2012 zhao et al 2017 such multi scale modeling approach allows the simulations of long term changes in terrestrial water storage and flux at high resolution over the large domain with less computational burden higw mat derives from matsiro minimal advanced treatments of surface interaction and runoff takata et al 2003 which has been advanced over the years by adding various new schemes to simulate groundwater flow and human water management each grid cell of higw mat has four types of surfaces with and without canopy and snow respectively where energy fluxes are calculated separately considering sub grid heterogeneities canopy interception and transpiration are estimated based on the photosynthesis scheme in the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 sellers 1997 surface and subsurface runoff processes are modeled using a simplified topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 stieglitz et al 1997 soil moisture movement is simulated by solving the richards equation koirala et al 2014 richards 1931 yeh and eltahir 2005 and the water table depth is explicitly represented koirala et al 2014 higw mat includes the capability to simulate human water management practices pokhrel et al 2012a 2012b 2015 but we use higw mat in the natural setting i e the human water managements modules are turned off following our previous studies to provide runoff forcing to cama flood pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 since our objective is on investigating the hydrological changes stemming from natural climate variability which is the first order driver of flow regime change bower et al 2004 land surface properties including land cover soil type and associated model parameters are set to identical to those in our previous studies pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 we use cama flood version 3 94 with a spatial resolution of 5 km which includes the capability to downscale flood depth to a further higher resolution of 3 arcsec 90 m for river floodplain parameterizations e g flow direction river floodplain elevation profile river length and river width merit hydro is used which is a global hydrography dataset based on the merit multi error removed improved terrain yamazaki et al 2017 dem digital elevation model and multiple inland water body datasets yamazaki et al 2019 as errors including absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias yamazaki et al 2017 that prevail in the previously used srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem are removed an improved simulation of river floodplain dynamics is enabled a complete description of the model physics parameterization methods and sensitivities to input parameters in cama flood can be found in the previous literature yamazaki et al 2013 2011 and the user manual that is available for free download 2 2 observational data simulated river discharge is validated against the observational data at 23 gauging stations maintained by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal fig 1 the gauging stations are evenly distributed in both upstream and downstream regions and they include at least 16 years of data records the global surface water gsw data pekel et al 2016 are used to validate the simulated flood extent at 90 m resolution the gsw data are based on landsat satellite images from 1984 to present for the entire globe each pixel of landsat images is classified either as open water not open water or non valid class for valid classes i e open water and not open water classification results are combined on a monthly basis as a form of frequency of open water existence at a pixel here we calculate the flood occurrence from the modeled flood extents and compare it with the flood occurrence of gsw data for the identical period i e 1984 2018 due to the difference in spatial resolutions of the gsw data 0 0025 and cama flood 0 00083 or 3 arcsec the gsw data are upscaled to 0 0010 for the convenience of comparison simulated tws anomaly is compared with the data inferred from the grace satellite mission we use the mascon products which have advantages over traditional spherical harmonics products jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 and are available from two different processing centers the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 as the use of multiple grace products is recommended for a basin scale application scanlon et al 2016 tws anomaly is derived from the mean of the two mascon products using area weighted average over the modeling domain chaudhari et al 2019 for comparison with grace the simulated tws is first calculated by summing up canopy water snow water and subsurface water storages from higw mat and river floodplain storage from cama flood following pokhrel et al 2018 then the simulated tws anomaly is calculated as the deviation from mean of the simulated tws during 2004 2009 2 3 estimation of groundwater storage variations while the tws from grace provide the total tws as vertically integrated values of all relevant tws components i e canopy snow soil river floodplain and ground water storages the simulated results include explicitly resolved individual storage components hence the simulated results provide additional insights on the component contribution of different water storages to the total tws however the effects of water management activities specifically groundwater withdrawal which are captured in the grace data are not simulated in the models see section 2 1 thus we estimate the variations in groundwater storage caused by both natural variability and groundwater withdrawal following rodell et al 2009 in this approach groundwater storage variations are isolated by subtracting the other water storage components from model simulations i e canopy snow soil and river floodplain water storages from grace tws 2 4 statistical analysis methods 2 4 1 quantile analysis of river discharge to understand and visualize the historical evolution of river discharges at the major basin outlets we adopt and modify a quantile analysis method by rottler et al 2019 which combines quantile sampling trend analysis and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise ceemdan colominas et al 2014 torres et al 2011 the method enables analysis and visualization of the 1 long term seasonality 2 trend of seasonality change 3 temporal evolution of seasonality and 4 annual flow duration curve to do so three different quantiles are defined which vary from 0 01 small discharge to 0 99 large discharge quantile on a daily basis qday quantile within 30 day moving window qmov and quantile on a yearly basis qyea the long term seasonality of river discharge in different basins is directly illustrated by representing qday with respect to doy day of year qday is calculated for each doy without differentiating the years e g qday for may 16th is calculated from 40 values for may 16th of each year during the 1979 2018 period by using qday the seasonality at different level of quantiles can be represented at once the trend of seasonality change is assessed from a trend analysis of qmov qmov is calculated for each doy and each year e g qmov for may 16th 2001 is calculated among the values during its 15 days i e from may 1st 2001 to may 31st 2001 qmovs for may 16th of the other years other than 2001 are independently calculated for the trend analysis the theil sen method sen 1968 is used which is less sensitive to outliers than the least square method by compiling the results from different doys and probabilities the long term trend of seasonality change can be represented with respect to different quantile levels to supplement the trend analysis the temporal evolution of seasonality is investigated for 30 day moving average time series from the average daily time series the yearly time series for each doy is extracted e g the 30 day averaged river discharge for may 16th of each year here we use the ceemdan method to investigate the temporal evolution of seasonality we note that ceemdan decomposes the time series into a collection of intrinsic mode functions imfs and the last imf which is also referred to as the residue represents the trend of data the increasing residue values compared to the values in their prior years indicate an increasing trend and vice versa the residue of ceemdan can be nonmonotonic e g u shaped curve increase decrease abruptly at a certain year and flat hence the temporal evolution of seasonality can be assessed at diverse aspects when the residues of ceemdan for different doys are compiled together the deviation of residue of ceemdan for 30 day averaged flow hereafter δ 30 d is presented for comparisons to test the existence of monotonic trend the mann kendall mk test is used α 0 05 the change of annual flow duration curve is investigated using qyea qyea is essentially identical to an empirical flow duration curve derived from daily data for a year qyea is calculated for each year without differentiating doy e g qyea for 2001 is calculated among 365 values in the year qyeas for the other years are independently calculated the yearly time series of qyea is analyzed using ceemdan method for each quantile and the deviation of residue of ceemdan for qyea hereafter δ 1 y r from every quantile is compiled and presented the mk test is used to assess the existence of monotonic trend note that the plots are provided in two forms original values as in rottler et al 2019 and standardized values the standardization is conducted to make dry season flows and small quantile flows more discernible when they are plotted together with wet season flows and high quantile flows for standardization for the trend of seasonality change and the temporal evolution of seasonality a given value is divided by the mean of the values having the identical doy for the change of annual flow duration curve a given value is divided by the mean of the values having the identical exceedance probability 2 4 2 mapping of multi decadal change to examine the overall spatio temporal dynamics of river discharge across the nation we map the multi decadal trends in low q10 10 quantile in qyea median q50 50 quantile and high q90 90 quantile flows at all 5 km grid cells for every decade 10 year periods during 1979 1988 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 the decadal trend maps are generated from the trends in δ 1 y r section 2 4 1 estimated by using the theil sen method the existence of monotonic trend for each decade is examined using mk test α 0 05 the use of trend maps for low median and high flows and for four different decadal periods enables an explicit representation of the overall evolution of river discharge at the 5 km grids since the decadal trend is calculated as the rate of change within a given decade four snapshots are obtained for each quantile similarly to that for the decadal trends in river discharge we calculate the change in flood occurrence from one decade to the next that results in three snapshots of flood occurrence change between the decadal periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 river discharge 3 1 1 validation of river discharge evaluation of river discharges at 23 gauging stations is presented in fig 2 the spatial distribution of long term mean river discharge over the entire basins is presented in fig 1 also indicating the locations of the gauging stations as high coefficients of determination indicate r2 0 9 the seasonal cycle of river discharge is well reproduced not only at relatively downstream locations but also at small tributaries specifically the low flow is simulated remarkably well at most locations which is important for water resources management such as irrigation and hydropower operation note that the models are not tuned using observations and applied over a relatively large domain and the hydrologic processes are simulated by a land surface model using global forcing datasets hence a perfect match with observations is not expected further since the primary objective of this study is to examine the interannual variabilities in river discharges certain discrepancies in the flow seasonality are not of particular concern in quantifying the interannual variabilities analyzing differences in river discharge among different years can offset consistent overestimation or underestimation tendencies hence we consider the results to be of reasonable accuracy overall to investigate the long term evolution of river discharge 3 1 2 evolution of river discharge over four decades fig 3 shows the long term seasonality trend of seasonality temporal evolution of seasonality and change of annual discharge for the four major river basins from the long term seasonality the wet season is evidently found to be june july august and september jjas across the nation fig 3a high quantile flows i e high discharge and the wet season flows i e jjas are found to have decreased in all four basins fig 3b overall qmov trends are negative except for some high quantile flows in the dry season i e other than jjas where increasing trends become more noticeable as a basin is located farther east the prevalent decreasing qmov trends indicate the nationwide decrease in seasonal river discharge the increase in high quantile flows in the dry season suggests a tendency of increased flooding in the dry season with a higher magnitude in recent times than in the past the findings on river discharge evolution from qmov trends are explained in a greater detail in terms of the evolution of δ 30 d fig 3c it is worth recalling that the increasing values of δ 30 d compared to the values in their prior years indicate an increasing trend and vice versa interestingly during the latest two decades 1999 2018 all basins show decreasing δ 30 d in the wet season fig 3c other than that a basin further to the west tends to have a more consistent decreasing trend than that in the basins to the east more red bars in fig 3c in addition to geological location as the time windows of interest moves towards the dry season the transition patterns of δ 30 d become rather mixed e g decrease followed by increase in february april at karnali basin the change in annual flow duration curve is found to vary according to the basin locations fig 3d note that increasing δ 1 y r over time at a given quantile indicates an increase in qyea and vice versa overall a considerable decrease in qyea is found for the mahakali basin at most of quantiles from mid 1990 s through mid 2010 s fig 3d such transition over a decade is also found in the karnali basin but the timing varies according to the quantiles some quantiles vary from early 1990 s and others vary from early 2000 s the karnali basin shows another distinct change pattern at the quantiles from 0 3 to 0 6 in 2010 s where qyea increases in recent years the gandaki basin shows mixed trends decreasing trends are found at quantiles between 0 4 and 0 5 in the 1990 s between 0 5 and 0 8 and greater than 0 95 in the 2000 s and between 0 8 and 0 95 in the 2010 s increasing trends are also found at quantiles between 0 5 and 0 8 and greater than 0 9 that last until the early 1990 s the koshi basin shows similar trends in qyea for all quantiles increasing trends lasting until the mid 1990 s are followed by decreasing trends in the 2000 s in sum the annual flow duration curves of the major river basins of nepal are found to have evolved varyingly in the past four decades spatial distribution of decadal trends in low median and high flows are presented in fig 4 in general the decadal trends within the basins are similar to those at the basin outlets hence the overall observations from fig 3d apply also to these results for example it is evident that low median and high flows in the downstream regions have persistently declined during the last two decades 1999 2018 which is in line with what can be seen in fig 3d such nationwide decrease in river flow has an important implication for water resource management especially for hydropower development and irrigation specifically hydropower operation can be considerably limited by the decrease in low flow during the drying season due to the environmental flow requirement it is however worth noting that the trends at the basin outlets do not necessarily represent the trends over the entire basin for example the opposite trends at the basin outlets and a part of basins are found for northern part of karnali western part of gandaki and northern part of koshi basins such prevalent opposite trends within the basins compared to those at the basin outlets suggest substantial hydrological heterogeneity across the nation 3 2 water storage dynamics 3 2 1 inundated areas fig 5 shows the first results of the long term river floodplain storage over all nepalese river basins for the 1979 2018 period for selected regions the simulated flood occurrences from cama flood are compared with the gsw data for the 1984 2018 period fig 6 the broad spatial patterns of natural river floodplain storage are well captured by the model for large river basins in the downstream portions of the basins where floodplains are more developed than in the upper reaches the maximum flood extent and seasonally inundated areas are relatively prominent fig 5 some differences are found between flood occurrences simulated by cama flood and gsw data the differences can be attributed partly to the errors in dems used in cama flood but the gsw product also suffers from limitations in the landsat satellite images which are susceptible to atmospheric conditions i e cloud cover and are known to have substantial missing records specifically until early 2000 s shin et al 2020 the former generally results in the underestimation of gsw flood occurrence and maximum flood extent specifically for the wet season and the latter is suggested to cause general biases in the gsw flood occurrence specifically towards the recent years large water bodies are reproduced by the model but gradation of flood occurrence around the rim of those water bodies seen in the gws data is underrepresented in the simulated results e g west region in fig 6a middle region in fig 6d this is because of the hydrography data i e merit dem and merit hydro merit dem is based on shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem launched in 2000 and some other dem products yamazaki et al 2019 2017 thus elevation variations over a region where large water bodies existed before year 2000 are indicated as flat areas such that water spreads over those regions in cama flood simulation for the selected regions we further investigate how the inundation dynamics evolved over time fig 7 presents the decadal changes in flood occurrence overall the change in flood occurrence is found to have resulted from the combined effects of river discharge changes at different quantiles when high flow e g q90 increases the maximum inundation extent increases and the regions near the maximum extent are inundated more frequently and hence the flood occurrence in those regions increases and vice versa meanwhile when the duration of low to median flows e g q10 q50 increases the regions near river channels are inundated for a longer time so that the flood occurrence increases and vice versa overall the diverse spatial patterns of the changes in flood occurrence reflect various aspects of hydro climatic changes over the nation such investigation on the evolution of inundation dynamics over 40 years is enabled by the high resolution simulation of river floodplain processes 3 2 2 terrestrial water storage tws to understand how tws an integrated measure of overall water availability is changing across all basins we examine the tws anomalies from the models see section 2 1 and those from grace satellites fig 8 presents a comparison of simulated and grace based tws anomalies for 2002 2016 a period chosen considering grace data availability and averaged over all nepalese river basins fig 1 model results suggest that subsurface water storage i e soil moisture and ground water storage strongly dominates the overall tws dynamics that is compared to subsurface water storage the variations in the other storage components i e canopy river floodplain and snow storages are relatively small the contribution of individual components to total tws varies spatially depending on climate topography and level of human impacts the component contributions in the nepalese basins a relatively higher contribution of sub surface storage are found to be similar to those in other basins located in comparable latitudes felfelani et al 2017 ferreira et al 2020 in terms of within a year variability the simulated results well capture the general seasonal variations in tws seen in grace data however in terms of interannual variability continually decreasing trends in the grace data are not found in the simulated results this suggests that the decreasing trend in the grace tws is likely caused by growing groundwater exploitation pandey et al 2010 prasad pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2020 the effects of which are captured in grace data but not simulated in the model model results indicate an increase in tws and groundwater during the 2002 2016 period with a trend of 0 18 0 11 cm year which resulted from an initial decline at the rate of 0 21 0 10 cm year during 2002 2009 and a subsequent recovery of 0 92 0 52 cm year during 2010 2016 fig 8 however and as noted above a continually declining trend 1 67 1 58 and 1 85 cm year during 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively is found in the tws from grace data that vertically integrate all tws components to examine the changes only in groundwater storage caused by natural variability and groundwater withdrawal we use the results derived by using tws from grace and simulated soil moisture and surface water storages see section 2 3 it is evident from fig 8 that the changes in the other tws components than groundwater are relatively small and hence the majority of the decline in tws seen in grace comes from the decline in groundwater storage the trends in groundwater storage change for the 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods are 1 74 1 46 and 2 18 cm year respectively which closely align with the trends is grace based tws such consistent declines in the grace based tws and groundwater storage despite the recovery seen in the simulated tws as well as groundwater storage suggest that human impacts have been intensifying in recent years the contribution of human water use to tws and groundwater storage change is estimated at 1 85 1 85 cm year for 2002 2016 period and 1 37 1 36 and 2 77 2 70 cm year for 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively even though the spatial scale for applying grace data also referred to as the footprint is 150 000 km2 or larger girotto et al 2016 li et al 2012 the mascon products have been increasingly applied to even smaller areas in the range of 40 000 100 000 km2 scanlon et al 2016 our study domain 196 000 km2 is larger than the footprint but relatively small compared to sizes of major global basins scanlon et al 2016 hence there can be uncertainties in the grace tws and the groundwater storage change derived from it however the finding of declining trends of tws and groundwater within nepal and its surrounding regions is supported by other independent regional studies using various grace satellite products e g jing et al 2019 tiwari et al 2009 specifically tiwari et al 2009 estimate the human induced groundwater loss around nepal to 1 to 4 cm year for the 2002 2008 period which aligns with the estimation of this study in addition well observation data of the kathmandu valley aquifer in central nepal which indicate a drawdown of groundwater levels by 1 38 7 5 m during 2000 2008 pandey et al 2010 shrestha et al 2018 also support the finding of this study 4 summary and conclusion this study presents the first results of the long term 1979 2018 evolution of river floodplain dynamics over all river basins of nepal at a spatial resolution of 5 km for river flow and 90 m for flood extents the simulated river discharge is validated nationally using the observations from dhm nepal using simulated results historical changes in river discharge are then investigated using a quantile analysis method which effectively describes the temporal evolution of river discharge in terms of the long term seasonality qday trend of seasonality change qmov temporal evolution of seasonality δ 30 d and change of flow duration curve δ 1 y r then the spatio temporal variations in river discharge are examined through mapping of decadal trends for low flow q10 median flow q50 and high flow q90 the long term seasonality at the outlets of the major river basins is then analyzed using qday the results of qmov and δ 30 d suggest that the high quantile flows during the wet season i e jjas are persistently declining especially during the latest two decades 1999 2018 based on the analysis of δ 1 y r and the decadal trends of flow duration curves it is found that low median and high flows in the downstream regions have also decreased continually during the past two decades 1999 2018 further the annual flow duration curves are found to have evolved differently in different basins and the evolution patterns of trends at the basin outlets generally coincide with those within the basins however some opposite patterns are also found within the basins in the northern part of karnali western part of gandaki and northern part of koshi basins the comparison of high resolution simulated flood extent with satellite based data suggest that the model reasonably reproduces the inundation extents in the major flooded areas especially those in the southern parts of the country based on the evaluation of decadal changes in inundated areas over the major flooded regions it is found that not only the changes in high quantile flows cause changes in inundation extent but also the changes in low quantile flows modulate flood occurrence in riverine areas lastly the changes in tws during the 2002 2016 period is examined through combined use of model results and the grace data results suggest that the overall tws dynamics is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage and a growing influence of water management especially a potential increase in groundwater use has likely caused a continual decline in tws and groundwater storage the changes in grace tws are found to be 1 67 cm year during the 2002 2016 period and 1 58 and 1 85 cm year during the 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively the changes in groundwater storage caused by both natural variability and ground water withdrawal which is derived by combining model results and grace data is estimated to be 1 74 1 46 and 2 18 cm year for the 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively there are certain limitations to this study of which the most important one is the missing representation of water management processes in the models especially groundwater use the spatial resolution could also be further refined to better resolve hydrologic processes in the headwater catchments lastly uncertainties might have been introduced to the grace tws and the derived groundwater storage change because of the relatively small domain size grace data when applied over small domains may also suffer from leakage errors but those are expected to be small in the mascon products despite these limitations this study presents a modeling framework consisting of a global land surface model and global floodplain hydrodynamics model with a promising capability to simulate the changing hydrology of the himalayan region providing a basis for improved understanding of the long

4555,the hydrology of the himalayan region known as the water tower of asia is undergoing rapid transformations due to climate change and growing human influences and it is known that this region is one of those most vulnerable to climate change numerous studies have examined the changes in the hydrology of nepal which includes a significant upstream portion of the himalayas however there is a lack of holistic studies on the spatial temporal evolution of hydrologic dynamics over the entire nation and over long periods in this study we present a comprehensive assessment of the changes in river discharge flood occurrence and terrestrial water storage tws across all river basins in nepal using hydrological hydrodynamic simulations spanning for 40 years 1979 2018 at 5 km spatial resolution and downscaled flood attributes at 90 m resolution the spatio temporal variations in river discharge and inundation extent are examined through mapping of decadal trends using a quantile analysis method the results indicate that the dynamics of river discharge has evolved varyingly across different river basins the evolution pattern within a basin generally agrees with that at the basin outlet but notable exceptions are found indicating high hydro climatic heterogeneity within the basins the decadal evaluation of flood dynamics over major flooded areas suggests that inundation dynamics is strongly influenced by various flow characteristics including the timing duration and magnitude and that the evolution of flood dynamics is more complex than that of river discharge results indicate that the tws dynamics over entire nepal is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage and groundwater storage has been in continuous decline 1 74 cm year in the recent decades 2002 2016 this study provides a basis to advance the understanding of long term hydrologic changes in the himalayan region with important implications for improved water resources management keywords himalayan hydrology nepal hydrological hydrodynamic modeling flood dynamics terrestrial water storage groundwater depletion 1 introduction the himalayan region referred to as the water tower of asia supplies plentiful water to sustain river and groundwater systems in its downstream that provide water for human livelihood and critical ecosystems immerzeel et al 2010 viviroli et al 2007 as the changes in the earth s environment continue to alter the monsoonal rainfall patterns that strongly modulate the hydrology of the region ghosh et al 2016 2012 mitra et al 2012 the spatio temporal dynamics of downstream water availability has become a topic of increasing concern dahal et al 2018 dimri et al 2018a 2018b immerzeel et al 2014 jeelani et al 2012 shrestha et al 2012 mounting evidence suggests that the himalayan region is highly vulnerable to climate change roy et al 2019 tewari et al 2017 among himalayan countries nepal accounts for significant upstream portions of himalayan region that has drastic elevation variation resulting in diverse climate karki et al 2016 and land cover characteristics and biodiversity across the nation bonekamp et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 singh et al 2019 hence understanding the hydrologic dynamics of river basins in nepal is of utmost importance to provide a better understanding of the spatio temporal changes in the himalayan hydrology surface water dynamics in nepal is governed primarily by himalayan snowmelt and monsoon rainfall the four major river basins namely the mahakali karnali gandaki and koshi fig 1 originate in the upper himalayan region receiving substantial snow and glacier melt water flow through rugged terrains in the central hilly areas of nepal and drain into the ganges river system in india overall the hydrologic dynamics of these river systems is strongly modulated by the rhythm of the south asian monsoon that brings 80 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon season june september panthi et al 2015 shrestha 2000 the intense monsoonal rains produce a typical unimodal hydrograph with a sharp rise in flow volumes often causing widespread flooding dhital and kayastha 2013 during the dry season flows reduce appreciably affecting downstream agricultural systems and causing issues for sustaining hydropower generation dahal et al 2020 poudyal et al 2019 the large climate and topographic gradient young geological formations and strong monsoon effect make the river basins of nepal highly susceptible not only to adverse climatic impacts e g floods droughts but also to natural hazards including glacial lake outburst flood glof and excessive soil erosion agarwal et al 2016 chen et al 2013 as the nation is undergoing rapid socio economic growth the threats of climate change impacts are further exacerbated by human induced changes in land water systems due to expanding agriculture urbanization and construction of dams for hydropower generation and irrigation which are all inevitable to support the growing needs for food water and energy chinnasamy et al 2015 dhakal et al 2019 paudel et al 2016 moreover the transboundary nature of the mahakali karnali gandaki and koshi basins that share some portions with china and india adds further challenges in making optimum use of resources among different regions while also considering the ecosystem needs as such these ongoing climate shifts and human induced alterations of land water systems have altogether resulted in an increasing threat to the region in terms of water and food security and ecological integrity analysis of long term observational data provides an insight for historical evolution however hydrometeorological observations are generally scarce in terms of both spatial and temporal coverages especially for regions like nepal in this vein hydrological models are indispensable tools for understanding the long term evolution of such complex and large scale hydrologic systems indeed large scale hydrologic studies have benefited from the advances made in hydrological modeling over the past two decades nazemi and wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2017 2016 wada et al 2017 in case of the himalayan region and specifically for nepal most studies have relied on limited observations e g karki et al 2020 sharma and shakya 2006 and modeling studies have not fully exploited the advances in recent model developments the outstanding challenges and limitations of existing hydrologic and hydrodynamic studies in nepal are primarily related to 1 a focus on river flow as the sole variable to describe the changing hydrology in the region e g bajracharya et al 2018 palazzoli et al 2015 pandey et al 2019 rajbhandari et al 2017 sharma and shakya 2006 shrestha et al 2016a 2016b 2014 2013 and 2 sub national scale studies focusing on a part of the country e g babel et al 2014 bharati et al 2016 bhatta et al 2019 chinnasamy et al 2015 mishra et al 2018 regarding to the first issue identified above among many observation and modeling based studies in nepal most have focused on changes in river flow while river flow is a key indicator of water availability there are other hydrologic variables such as surface water depth inundated area and river floodplain water storage that provide a more comprehensive representation of the spatial and temporal changes in water resource systems for example pandey et al 2011 assess the adaptive capacity of water resources system of the bagmati river basin by using area of vegetation and wetland as a proxy for ecological capacity due to the limitation of data availability with the high resolution modeling variables such as the natural water availability can be explicitly derived from the simulated spatio temporal distribution of water storages which are useful for water resources management and ecological applications bharati et al 2014 as for the second issue hydrological simulations have generally been conducted for a portion of the nation to cope with the aforementioned compounded pressures it is essential to develop a holistic understanding of the long term and nationwide hydrologic changes since many water related problems are multi sectoral that should be addressed at the local national and regional scales friedman et al 1984 henriksen et al 2003 mcmillan et al 2016 the increased domain size also provides an opportunity to utilize the terrestrial water storage tws measurements from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites rarely used by previous studies in nepal as such the simulation of the hydrologic systems across all basins can provide a holistic view at the national level the objective of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of the spatio temporal changes in hydrologic fluxes and storages across all river basins of nepal and for a multi decadal historical period the results are based on high resolution integrated hydrological hydrodynamic modeling validated against ground and satellite based observations key research questions addressed in this study are follows 1 how has the dynamics of natural river discharge inundated areas and tws in the himalayan river basins of nepal evolved over the past four decades 2 are there any distinct spatial patterns and temporal signatures in low median and high river flows in those river basins 3 what are the similarities in inter annual and decadal trends across the river basins located in different geographic regions we answer these questions based on the simulation results of the historical river floodplain dynamics for 40 years i e 1979 2018 period at a spatial resolution of 5 km 3 arc minute where flood extent is downscaled to a further finer resolution of 90 m 3 arc second such advanced capability of high resolution hydrological modeling for a large domain is enabled by combining a global land surface model higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 and a global river floodplain hydrodynamic model cama flood yamazaki et al 2011 to our best knowledge this is the first study of such kind to use high resolution simulations of river floodplain dynamics over the entire nepal in which not only the changes in river discharge but also inundated areas and river floodplain water storages are examined through the high resolution modeling over the nationwide domain we provide important advances over previous studies in the region in that the simulations are conducted in a consistent modeling framework which allows collective comparisons of basin wise characteristics of hydrological responses this enables the understanding of how the hydrology in the region has evolved historically which is a key to future projections of water resources and hence sustainable development and climate change adaptation in the remainder of this paper the models higw mat and cama flood are introduced and observational data and research approach are described in section 2 results and discussions are provided in section 3 and summary and conclusion are presented in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 higw mat and cama flood models higw mat pokhrel et al 2015 is a global land surface model that simulates various hydrological processes from canopy to bedrock on a full physical basis by solving both energy and water balances cama flood yamazaki et al 2013 2011 is a global hydrodynamic model which computes river floodplain hydrodynamics i e river discharge flow velocity water level and inundated area by solving shallow water equations of open channel flow explicitly accounting for backwater effects using the local inertial approximation yamazaki et al 2013 we use a modeling framework that combines higw mat and cama flood such integration provides an optimal combination in terms of spatial resolution needed to resolve key hydrological processes at different scales higw mat is used to simulate local runoff by considering hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration snow melt infiltration and groundwater dynamics at a resolution of 0 5 50 km that is consistent with that of meteorological forcing namely the watch forcing data using the era interim wfdei data weedon et al 2018 the runoff from higw mat is then used in cama flood to simulate the finer details of river floodplain processes at a high resolution of 3 arcmin 5km because the focus of the present study is river discharge and floodplain processes this model combination has been widely used for regional to global scale studies burbano et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 yamazaki et al 2014 2012 zhao et al 2017 such multi scale modeling approach allows the simulations of long term changes in terrestrial water storage and flux at high resolution over the large domain with less computational burden higw mat derives from matsiro minimal advanced treatments of surface interaction and runoff takata et al 2003 which has been advanced over the years by adding various new schemes to simulate groundwater flow and human water management each grid cell of higw mat has four types of surfaces with and without canopy and snow respectively where energy fluxes are calculated separately considering sub grid heterogeneities canopy interception and transpiration are estimated based on the photosynthesis scheme in the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 sellers 1997 surface and subsurface runoff processes are modeled using a simplified topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 stieglitz et al 1997 soil moisture movement is simulated by solving the richards equation koirala et al 2014 richards 1931 yeh and eltahir 2005 and the water table depth is explicitly represented koirala et al 2014 higw mat includes the capability to simulate human water management practices pokhrel et al 2012a 2012b 2015 but we use higw mat in the natural setting i e the human water managements modules are turned off following our previous studies to provide runoff forcing to cama flood pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 since our objective is on investigating the hydrological changes stemming from natural climate variability which is the first order driver of flow regime change bower et al 2004 land surface properties including land cover soil type and associated model parameters are set to identical to those in our previous studies pokhrel et al 2018 shin et al 2020 we use cama flood version 3 94 with a spatial resolution of 5 km which includes the capability to downscale flood depth to a further higher resolution of 3 arcsec 90 m for river floodplain parameterizations e g flow direction river floodplain elevation profile river length and river width merit hydro is used which is a global hydrography dataset based on the merit multi error removed improved terrain yamazaki et al 2017 dem digital elevation model and multiple inland water body datasets yamazaki et al 2019 as errors including absolute bias stripe noise speckle noise and tree height bias yamazaki et al 2017 that prevail in the previously used srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem are removed an improved simulation of river floodplain dynamics is enabled a complete description of the model physics parameterization methods and sensitivities to input parameters in cama flood can be found in the previous literature yamazaki et al 2013 2011 and the user manual that is available for free download 2 2 observational data simulated river discharge is validated against the observational data at 23 gauging stations maintained by the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal fig 1 the gauging stations are evenly distributed in both upstream and downstream regions and they include at least 16 years of data records the global surface water gsw data pekel et al 2016 are used to validate the simulated flood extent at 90 m resolution the gsw data are based on landsat satellite images from 1984 to present for the entire globe each pixel of landsat images is classified either as open water not open water or non valid class for valid classes i e open water and not open water classification results are combined on a monthly basis as a form of frequency of open water existence at a pixel here we calculate the flood occurrence from the modeled flood extents and compare it with the flood occurrence of gsw data for the identical period i e 1984 2018 due to the difference in spatial resolutions of the gsw data 0 0025 and cama flood 0 00083 or 3 arcsec the gsw data are upscaled to 0 0010 for the convenience of comparison simulated tws anomaly is compared with the data inferred from the grace satellite mission we use the mascon products which have advantages over traditional spherical harmonics products jing et al 2019 scanlon et al 2016 and are available from two different processing centers the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 as the use of multiple grace products is recommended for a basin scale application scanlon et al 2016 tws anomaly is derived from the mean of the two mascon products using area weighted average over the modeling domain chaudhari et al 2019 for comparison with grace the simulated tws is first calculated by summing up canopy water snow water and subsurface water storages from higw mat and river floodplain storage from cama flood following pokhrel et al 2018 then the simulated tws anomaly is calculated as the deviation from mean of the simulated tws during 2004 2009 2 3 estimation of groundwater storage variations while the tws from grace provide the total tws as vertically integrated values of all relevant tws components i e canopy snow soil river floodplain and ground water storages the simulated results include explicitly resolved individual storage components hence the simulated results provide additional insights on the component contribution of different water storages to the total tws however the effects of water management activities specifically groundwater withdrawal which are captured in the grace data are not simulated in the models see section 2 1 thus we estimate the variations in groundwater storage caused by both natural variability and groundwater withdrawal following rodell et al 2009 in this approach groundwater storage variations are isolated by subtracting the other water storage components from model simulations i e canopy snow soil and river floodplain water storages from grace tws 2 4 statistical analysis methods 2 4 1 quantile analysis of river discharge to understand and visualize the historical evolution of river discharges at the major basin outlets we adopt and modify a quantile analysis method by rottler et al 2019 which combines quantile sampling trend analysis and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise ceemdan colominas et al 2014 torres et al 2011 the method enables analysis and visualization of the 1 long term seasonality 2 trend of seasonality change 3 temporal evolution of seasonality and 4 annual flow duration curve to do so three different quantiles are defined which vary from 0 01 small discharge to 0 99 large discharge quantile on a daily basis qday quantile within 30 day moving window qmov and quantile on a yearly basis qyea the long term seasonality of river discharge in different basins is directly illustrated by representing qday with respect to doy day of year qday is calculated for each doy without differentiating the years e g qday for may 16th is calculated from 40 values for may 16th of each year during the 1979 2018 period by using qday the seasonality at different level of quantiles can be represented at once the trend of seasonality change is assessed from a trend analysis of qmov qmov is calculated for each doy and each year e g qmov for may 16th 2001 is calculated among the values during its 15 days i e from may 1st 2001 to may 31st 2001 qmovs for may 16th of the other years other than 2001 are independently calculated for the trend analysis the theil sen method sen 1968 is used which is less sensitive to outliers than the least square method by compiling the results from different doys and probabilities the long term trend of seasonality change can be represented with respect to different quantile levels to supplement the trend analysis the temporal evolution of seasonality is investigated for 30 day moving average time series from the average daily time series the yearly time series for each doy is extracted e g the 30 day averaged river discharge for may 16th of each year here we use the ceemdan method to investigate the temporal evolution of seasonality we note that ceemdan decomposes the time series into a collection of intrinsic mode functions imfs and the last imf which is also referred to as the residue represents the trend of data the increasing residue values compared to the values in their prior years indicate an increasing trend and vice versa the residue of ceemdan can be nonmonotonic e g u shaped curve increase decrease abruptly at a certain year and flat hence the temporal evolution of seasonality can be assessed at diverse aspects when the residues of ceemdan for different doys are compiled together the deviation of residue of ceemdan for 30 day averaged flow hereafter δ 30 d is presented for comparisons to test the existence of monotonic trend the mann kendall mk test is used α 0 05 the change of annual flow duration curve is investigated using qyea qyea is essentially identical to an empirical flow duration curve derived from daily data for a year qyea is calculated for each year without differentiating doy e g qyea for 2001 is calculated among 365 values in the year qyeas for the other years are independently calculated the yearly time series of qyea is analyzed using ceemdan method for each quantile and the deviation of residue of ceemdan for qyea hereafter δ 1 y r from every quantile is compiled and presented the mk test is used to assess the existence of monotonic trend note that the plots are provided in two forms original values as in rottler et al 2019 and standardized values the standardization is conducted to make dry season flows and small quantile flows more discernible when they are plotted together with wet season flows and high quantile flows for standardization for the trend of seasonality change and the temporal evolution of seasonality a given value is divided by the mean of the values having the identical doy for the change of annual flow duration curve a given value is divided by the mean of the values having the identical exceedance probability 2 4 2 mapping of multi decadal change to examine the overall spatio temporal dynamics of river discharge across the nation we map the multi decadal trends in low q10 10 quantile in qyea median q50 50 quantile and high q90 90 quantile flows at all 5 km grid cells for every decade 10 year periods during 1979 1988 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 the decadal trend maps are generated from the trends in δ 1 y r section 2 4 1 estimated by using the theil sen method the existence of monotonic trend for each decade is examined using mk test α 0 05 the use of trend maps for low median and high flows and for four different decadal periods enables an explicit representation of the overall evolution of river discharge at the 5 km grids since the decadal trend is calculated as the rate of change within a given decade four snapshots are obtained for each quantile similarly to that for the decadal trends in river discharge we calculate the change in flood occurrence from one decade to the next that results in three snapshots of flood occurrence change between the decadal periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 river discharge 3 1 1 validation of river discharge evaluation of river discharges at 23 gauging stations is presented in fig 2 the spatial distribution of long term mean river discharge over the entire basins is presented in fig 1 also indicating the locations of the gauging stations as high coefficients of determination indicate r2 0 9 the seasonal cycle of river discharge is well reproduced not only at relatively downstream locations but also at small tributaries specifically the low flow is simulated remarkably well at most locations which is important for water resources management such as irrigation and hydropower operation note that the models are not tuned using observations and applied over a relatively large domain and the hydrologic processes are simulated by a land surface model using global forcing datasets hence a perfect match with observations is not expected further since the primary objective of this study is to examine the interannual variabilities in river discharges certain discrepancies in the flow seasonality are not of particular concern in quantifying the interannual variabilities analyzing differences in river discharge among different years can offset consistent overestimation or underestimation tendencies hence we consider the results to be of reasonable accuracy overall to investigate the long term evolution of river discharge 3 1 2 evolution of river discharge over four decades fig 3 shows the long term seasonality trend of seasonality temporal evolution of seasonality and change of annual discharge for the four major river basins from the long term seasonality the wet season is evidently found to be june july august and september jjas across the nation fig 3a high quantile flows i e high discharge and the wet season flows i e jjas are found to have decreased in all four basins fig 3b overall qmov trends are negative except for some high quantile flows in the dry season i e other than jjas where increasing trends become more noticeable as a basin is located farther east the prevalent decreasing qmov trends indicate the nationwide decrease in seasonal river discharge the increase in high quantile flows in the dry season suggests a tendency of increased flooding in the dry season with a higher magnitude in recent times than in the past the findings on river discharge evolution from qmov trends are explained in a greater detail in terms of the evolution of δ 30 d fig 3c it is worth recalling that the increasing values of δ 30 d compared to the values in their prior years indicate an increasing trend and vice versa interestingly during the latest two decades 1999 2018 all basins show decreasing δ 30 d in the wet season fig 3c other than that a basin further to the west tends to have a more consistent decreasing trend than that in the basins to the east more red bars in fig 3c in addition to geological location as the time windows of interest moves towards the dry season the transition patterns of δ 30 d become rather mixed e g decrease followed by increase in february april at karnali basin the change in annual flow duration curve is found to vary according to the basin locations fig 3d note that increasing δ 1 y r over time at a given quantile indicates an increase in qyea and vice versa overall a considerable decrease in qyea is found for the mahakali basin at most of quantiles from mid 1990 s through mid 2010 s fig 3d such transition over a decade is also found in the karnali basin but the timing varies according to the quantiles some quantiles vary from early 1990 s and others vary from early 2000 s the karnali basin shows another distinct change pattern at the quantiles from 0 3 to 0 6 in 2010 s where qyea increases in recent years the gandaki basin shows mixed trends decreasing trends are found at quantiles between 0 4 and 0 5 in the 1990 s between 0 5 and 0 8 and greater than 0 95 in the 2000 s and between 0 8 and 0 95 in the 2010 s increasing trends are also found at quantiles between 0 5 and 0 8 and greater than 0 9 that last until the early 1990 s the koshi basin shows similar trends in qyea for all quantiles increasing trends lasting until the mid 1990 s are followed by decreasing trends in the 2000 s in sum the annual flow duration curves of the major river basins of nepal are found to have evolved varyingly in the past four decades spatial distribution of decadal trends in low median and high flows are presented in fig 4 in general the decadal trends within the basins are similar to those at the basin outlets hence the overall observations from fig 3d apply also to these results for example it is evident that low median and high flows in the downstream regions have persistently declined during the last two decades 1999 2018 which is in line with what can be seen in fig 3d such nationwide decrease in river flow has an important implication for water resource management especially for hydropower development and irrigation specifically hydropower operation can be considerably limited by the decrease in low flow during the drying season due to the environmental flow requirement it is however worth noting that the trends at the basin outlets do not necessarily represent the trends over the entire basin for example the opposite trends at the basin outlets and a part of basins are found for northern part of karnali western part of gandaki and northern part of koshi basins such prevalent opposite trends within the basins compared to those at the basin outlets suggest substantial hydrological heterogeneity across the nation 3 2 water storage dynamics 3 2 1 inundated areas fig 5 shows the first results of the long term river floodplain storage over all nepalese river basins for the 1979 2018 period for selected regions the simulated flood occurrences from cama flood are compared with the gsw data for the 1984 2018 period fig 6 the broad spatial patterns of natural river floodplain storage are well captured by the model for large river basins in the downstream portions of the basins where floodplains are more developed than in the upper reaches the maximum flood extent and seasonally inundated areas are relatively prominent fig 5 some differences are found between flood occurrences simulated by cama flood and gsw data the differences can be attributed partly to the errors in dems used in cama flood but the gsw product also suffers from limitations in the landsat satellite images which are susceptible to atmospheric conditions i e cloud cover and are known to have substantial missing records specifically until early 2000 s shin et al 2020 the former generally results in the underestimation of gsw flood occurrence and maximum flood extent specifically for the wet season and the latter is suggested to cause general biases in the gsw flood occurrence specifically towards the recent years large water bodies are reproduced by the model but gradation of flood occurrence around the rim of those water bodies seen in the gws data is underrepresented in the simulated results e g west region in fig 6a middle region in fig 6d this is because of the hydrography data i e merit dem and merit hydro merit dem is based on shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem launched in 2000 and some other dem products yamazaki et al 2019 2017 thus elevation variations over a region where large water bodies existed before year 2000 are indicated as flat areas such that water spreads over those regions in cama flood simulation for the selected regions we further investigate how the inundation dynamics evolved over time fig 7 presents the decadal changes in flood occurrence overall the change in flood occurrence is found to have resulted from the combined effects of river discharge changes at different quantiles when high flow e g q90 increases the maximum inundation extent increases and the regions near the maximum extent are inundated more frequently and hence the flood occurrence in those regions increases and vice versa meanwhile when the duration of low to median flows e g q10 q50 increases the regions near river channels are inundated for a longer time so that the flood occurrence increases and vice versa overall the diverse spatial patterns of the changes in flood occurrence reflect various aspects of hydro climatic changes over the nation such investigation on the evolution of inundation dynamics over 40 years is enabled by the high resolution simulation of river floodplain processes 3 2 2 terrestrial water storage tws to understand how tws an integrated measure of overall water availability is changing across all basins we examine the tws anomalies from the models see section 2 1 and those from grace satellites fig 8 presents a comparison of simulated and grace based tws anomalies for 2002 2016 a period chosen considering grace data availability and averaged over all nepalese river basins fig 1 model results suggest that subsurface water storage i e soil moisture and ground water storage strongly dominates the overall tws dynamics that is compared to subsurface water storage the variations in the other storage components i e canopy river floodplain and snow storages are relatively small the contribution of individual components to total tws varies spatially depending on climate topography and level of human impacts the component contributions in the nepalese basins a relatively higher contribution of sub surface storage are found to be similar to those in other basins located in comparable latitudes felfelani et al 2017 ferreira et al 2020 in terms of within a year variability the simulated results well capture the general seasonal variations in tws seen in grace data however in terms of interannual variability continually decreasing trends in the grace data are not found in the simulated results this suggests that the decreasing trend in the grace tws is likely caused by growing groundwater exploitation pandey et al 2010 prasad pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2020 the effects of which are captured in grace data but not simulated in the model model results indicate an increase in tws and groundwater during the 2002 2016 period with a trend of 0 18 0 11 cm year which resulted from an initial decline at the rate of 0 21 0 10 cm year during 2002 2009 and a subsequent recovery of 0 92 0 52 cm year during 2010 2016 fig 8 however and as noted above a continually declining trend 1 67 1 58 and 1 85 cm year during 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively is found in the tws from grace data that vertically integrate all tws components to examine the changes only in groundwater storage caused by natural variability and groundwater withdrawal we use the results derived by using tws from grace and simulated soil moisture and surface water storages see section 2 3 it is evident from fig 8 that the changes in the other tws components than groundwater are relatively small and hence the majority of the decline in tws seen in grace comes from the decline in groundwater storage the trends in groundwater storage change for the 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods are 1 74 1 46 and 2 18 cm year respectively which closely align with the trends is grace based tws such consistent declines in the grace based tws and groundwater storage despite the recovery seen in the simulated tws as well as groundwater storage suggest that human impacts have been intensifying in recent years the contribution of human water use to tws and groundwater storage change is estimated at 1 85 1 85 cm year for 2002 2016 period and 1 37 1 36 and 2 77 2 70 cm year for 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively even though the spatial scale for applying grace data also referred to as the footprint is 150 000 km2 or larger girotto et al 2016 li et al 2012 the mascon products have been increasingly applied to even smaller areas in the range of 40 000 100 000 km2 scanlon et al 2016 our study domain 196 000 km2 is larger than the footprint but relatively small compared to sizes of major global basins scanlon et al 2016 hence there can be uncertainties in the grace tws and the groundwater storage change derived from it however the finding of declining trends of tws and groundwater within nepal and its surrounding regions is supported by other independent regional studies using various grace satellite products e g jing et al 2019 tiwari et al 2009 specifically tiwari et al 2009 estimate the human induced groundwater loss around nepal to 1 to 4 cm year for the 2002 2008 period which aligns with the estimation of this study in addition well observation data of the kathmandu valley aquifer in central nepal which indicate a drawdown of groundwater levels by 1 38 7 5 m during 2000 2008 pandey et al 2010 shrestha et al 2018 also support the finding of this study 4 summary and conclusion this study presents the first results of the long term 1979 2018 evolution of river floodplain dynamics over all river basins of nepal at a spatial resolution of 5 km for river flow and 90 m for flood extents the simulated river discharge is validated nationally using the observations from dhm nepal using simulated results historical changes in river discharge are then investigated using a quantile analysis method which effectively describes the temporal evolution of river discharge in terms of the long term seasonality qday trend of seasonality change qmov temporal evolution of seasonality δ 30 d and change of flow duration curve δ 1 y r then the spatio temporal variations in river discharge are examined through mapping of decadal trends for low flow q10 median flow q50 and high flow q90 the long term seasonality at the outlets of the major river basins is then analyzed using qday the results of qmov and δ 30 d suggest that the high quantile flows during the wet season i e jjas are persistently declining especially during the latest two decades 1999 2018 based on the analysis of δ 1 y r and the decadal trends of flow duration curves it is found that low median and high flows in the downstream regions have also decreased continually during the past two decades 1999 2018 further the annual flow duration curves are found to have evolved differently in different basins and the evolution patterns of trends at the basin outlets generally coincide with those within the basins however some opposite patterns are also found within the basins in the northern part of karnali western part of gandaki and northern part of koshi basins the comparison of high resolution simulated flood extent with satellite based data suggest that the model reasonably reproduces the inundation extents in the major flooded areas especially those in the southern parts of the country based on the evaluation of decadal changes in inundated areas over the major flooded regions it is found that not only the changes in high quantile flows cause changes in inundation extent but also the changes in low quantile flows modulate flood occurrence in riverine areas lastly the changes in tws during the 2002 2016 period is examined through combined use of model results and the grace data results suggest that the overall tws dynamics is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage and a growing influence of water management especially a potential increase in groundwater use has likely caused a continual decline in tws and groundwater storage the changes in grace tws are found to be 1 67 cm year during the 2002 2016 period and 1 58 and 1 85 cm year during the 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively the changes in groundwater storage caused by both natural variability and ground water withdrawal which is derived by combining model results and grace data is estimated to be 1 74 1 46 and 2 18 cm year for the 2002 2016 2002 2009 and 2010 2016 periods respectively there are certain limitations to this study of which the most important one is the missing representation of water management processes in the models especially groundwater use the spatial resolution could also be further refined to better resolve hydrologic processes in the headwater catchments lastly uncertainties might have been introduced to the grace tws and the derived groundwater storage change because of the relatively small domain size grace data when applied over small domains may also suffer from leakage errors but those are expected to be small in the mascon products despite these limitations this study presents a modeling framework consisting of a global land surface model and global floodplain hydrodynamics model with a promising capability to simulate the changing hydrology of the himalayan region providing a basis for improved understanding of the long

4556,although sub hourly rainfall temporal characteristics play an important role in occurrences and magnitudes of urban flash floods most stochastic rainfall models struggle to reproduce them when rainfall information is not available at sub hourly timescales this study suggests a simple approach to modifying poisson cluster rectangular pulse rainfall models to resolve this issue in this model the original rectangles representing a rain cell are replaced by a bell shape that is mathematically represented as y sin2 x such an alteration no longer makes it possible to obtain closed form expressions for the various rainfall statistics for model parameter calibration based on an assumption that this alteration would hardly alter the hourly and supra hourly statistics we calibrated the parameters of a rectangular pulse model with these statistics from 1 to 32 h and transplanted the same parameters to the sine squared pulse model to generate 500 years of 5 minute rainfall importantly this parameter transplant procedure does not require any sub hourly information so that it amounts to a downscaling algorithm for the generation of sub hourly rainfall our results show that both models reproduced well the rainfall mean variance autocovariance proportion of dry periods and extreme values at hourly to 72 hour timescales however the sine squared pulse model performed significantly better at sub hourly time scales the same 500 years of synthetic rainfall data and 69 years of observed rainfall data were then used as input of a dual drainage urban watershed model developed for a frequently flooded urban area of seoul while the traditional rectangular pulse model significantly underestimated the flooded area the new sine squared pulse model successfully reproduced the flooded area caused by the observed rainfall keywords urban flood rainfall generation disaggregation downscaling stochastic model sub hourly rainfall 1 introduction short duration intense rainfall presents a significant problem for society urban drainage systems can become quickly overwhelmed and parched or saturated ground can cause substantial runoff the consequent surface water flooding is hazardous to life and costly for insurers under global warming cloudburst events are expected to become more intense o gorman 2015 fischer and knutti 2016 bao et al 2017 barbero et al 2017 lenderink et al 2017 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 prein et al 2017c borodina et al 2017 rajczak and schär 2017 increasing the risks and making the problem worse rainfall simulation is a vital tool for water resources and flood risk management across a range of spatial and temporal scales however simulating short duration intense rainfall remains a challenge while dynamic climate models that can consider mesoscale convection prein et al 2017a 2017b 2017c and advances in our representation of the role of the clausius clapeyron relationship kendon et al 2014 chan et al 2016 lenderink et al 2017 barbero et al 2018 moustakis et al 2020 have greatly improved our understanding of short duration intense rainfall prerin et al 2013 2015 kendon et al 2017 chen et al 2020 they continue to be ill suited to practitioner use because they require significant computational resources to provide ensembles of long fine scale synthetic time series for flood risk analysis statistical rainfall models have been applied to overcome this limitation but many statistical models are scale dependent park et al 2019 kim and onof 2020 and only suited to coarse scale e g supra hourly rainfall in which the intermittency is simplified in addition most significantly rainfall data are often not available at the timescale of interest particularly at sub hourly scales meaning that simulation disaggregation and regionalization are needed to estimate intense rainfall events where sub daily rainfall data is available poisson cluster models are highly suited to capturing the intermittency of wet and dry periods however at sub hourly scales these models also struggle to replicate other properties such as the variance skewness and extreme behavior of the rainfall intensity poisson cluster rainfall models simulate rainfall with the clustering of rain cells in storms there are standard clustering algorithms bartlett lewis and neyman scott either of which can be used to emulate the phenomenology of rainfall generation in which the rainfall observed on the ground originates from superimposed pockets of rain in storms since their conception kavvas and delleur 1975 and early development rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rain cells have predominantly been represented by rectangular pulses this has the principal benefit of mathematical tractability although this simple assumption is arguably unrealistic since the fundamental structure was formalized in the late 1980s by rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 developments of the poisson cluster model have focused on improving the estimation of key summary statistics such as auto correlation or proportion of dry periods rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 improving the simulation of convective and stratiform events cowpertwait 1994 onof and wang 2020 reproducing long and short term rainfall persistence kim et al 2013a park et al 2019 kim and onof 2020 extending the temporal to a spatial temporal model cowpertwait 1995 northrop 1998 burton et al 2008 regionalizing the parameters kim et al 2013a 2016 and extending the model to represent for the non stationarity of the precipitation process burton et al 2010 evin and favre 2013 and kaczmarska et al 2015 a longstanding limitation of the poisson cluster rainfall models has been their tendency to underestimate rainfall extremes at fine e g sub hourly temporal scales cowpertwait et al 1996 verhoest et al 1997 cameron et al 2000c onof et al 2000 kaczmarska et al 2014 cross et al 2018 cowpertwait 1998 included the third central moment in the fitting statistics to better capture the skewness of the rainfall intensity while theoretically justified study results have been variable with very little benefit derived at sub hourly scales the use of thicker tailed distributions for the rain cell intensity has also had limited impact onof and wheater 1994a cameron et al 2000a a new version of the modified bartlett lewis model with randomised mean rain cell intensity improved the estimation of extremes at sub hourly scales kaczmarska et al 2014 although under estimation persisted at the finest resolutions a censored modelling approach was also investigated by cross et al 2018 which gave substantially improved estimation of sub hourly extremes although at the expense of time series generation for use in hydrological studies since only rainfall depths above a threshold are represented by this model recent work by onof and wang 2020 showed that calculating the skewness for each calendar month and averaging underestimates the skewness in fitting and consequently the estimation of extremes results have indicated that when skewness is calculated using all the data for a given month together as one sample sub hourly extremes are improved with all models and in particular the updated modified model of kaczmarska et al 2014 further work by kim and onof 2020 has also shown that the selection of a gamma distribution instead of typical exponential distribution for rain cell intensity and more importantly the introduction of an algorithm that shuffles both storms and months of the same calendar month to account for the memory of rainfall time series at scales up to years can significantly improve the estimation of extremes across all temporal scales however these studies require enough sub hourly rainfall data to obtain reliable estimates of the main statistics used in calibration for improved performance at sub hourly time scale even though rain cell shape has been extensively investigated based on observations in both lagrangian and eulerian frameworks zawadzki 1973 berndtsson et al 1994 lepioufle et al 2012 and schleiss et al 2014 there has been little research that incorporated the concept of temporally variable rain cell profile into poisson cluster rainfall models although see samuel 1999 this may be because modelled rain cells are unobserved and it is the aggregated process which is of interest furthermore the superposition of rain cells in the unobserved process has the effect of stacking up rainfall in ways which give rise to interesting and varied profiles changing the rain cell shape is computationally demanding and reduces model parsimony for what appears to be little gain ramesh et al 2018 introduced a model in which rain cells exponentially decay over time which improved the model s performance to reproduce extreme values northrop and stone 2005 developed a gaussian pulse version of the bartlett lewis model the model showed comparable performance to its rectangular pulse counterpart but at much greater computational cost an instantaneous pulse model was also developed by cowpertwait et al 2011 specifically for simulation of fine scale rainfall in which rectangular pulses were replaced with instantaneous bursts of equal rainfall intensity closely resembling a tip time rainfall record as stated earlier this model required more model parameters than its rectangular pulse counterpart yet did not offer any obvious benefit what motivates the present research is the fact that the effect of temporally variable rain cell profiles becomes more apparent as the time scale of aggregation of the time series becomes finer especially at sub hourly timescales there are disaggregation models which enable finer scale rainfall to be generated conditional upon the availability of coarser scale series a poisson cluster model can be used to generate rainfall at one timescale e g hourly and another model e e a multifractal cascade used to disaggregate this to finer scales e g 5 mins see onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 alternatively the poisson cluster model can play the role of the disaggregator e g kossieris et al 2018 if a series of daily observations is to be disaggregated to sub hourly scales unlike such disaggregation schemes the present model is simply a rainfall simulation model which can output time series at a resolution e g 5 mins that is finer than that of the input statistics e g hourly and coarser as such it is also describable as a downscaling model in this paper we demonstrate that because a very large proportion of rain cells generated by poisson cluster models have a duration of less than 1 h kaczmarska et al 2014 kim and olivera 2012 park et al 2019 the assumption of uniform intensity over the cell lifetime hypothesized by the rectangular shape induces systematic bias in the estimation of variance and skewness at sub hourly scales this limits their ability to accurately capture the intensity of cloudburst events and hence the underestimation of sub hourly rainfall extremes it is hypothesized that changing the temporal distribution of cell intensity to a bell curve will improve the estimation of these rainfall characteristics at fine temporal scales this will improve the simulation of intense rainfall profiles which is vital for surface water flood risk assessment and the design of urban drainage systems because closed form expressions for the standard rainfall statistics with the sine squared pulse shape have not been derived it is not possible directly to calibrate the sine squared pulse model we therefore assume that given the fact that a majority of cells last less than one hour fig 7 the hourly and coarser statistics will be approximately identical whether one uses rectangular or sine squared pulses this enables us to use a rectangular pulse model calibrated to hourly and coarser scale statistics and simulate from a sine squared pulse model with the same cell volume and duration section 2 3 1 in section 2 we set out our methodology for incorporating a non uniform cell intensity profile into the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model in section 3 we present and discuss our results using 5 minute rainfall data for bochum in germany in particular we check that the above assumption is correct in addition in the light of the results showing the potential of the new model to reproduce sub hourly statistics we examine how these results would be altered were we to include sub hourly statistics for the calibration of the rectangular pulse model our conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 data description we consider the 5 minute rainfall data measured at bochum in germany the recording period starts from january 1931 and ends december 1999 assuming stationarity the few missing records are filled in with records randomly selected from the same calendar months of the different years 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the randomized bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model with rain cell duration intensity inverse correlation this study uses a recent version of the randomised bartlett lewis rectangular pulse rblrp model of kaczmarska et al 2014 since it has been shown to outperform other types of bartlett lewis models cross et al 2018 onof and wang 2020 unlike the non randomised blrp model rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 and the traditional randomised rblrp model rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the rblrpx model introduces an inverse correlation between rainfall cell duration and intensity in line with the observed behaviour of intense convective rainfall lasting several minutes and milder frontal rainfall lasting for several days a detailed description of parameters table 1 on the rblrpx model is as follows 1 x1 t is a random variable representing the storm arrival time black dots in fig 1 a that is defined by a poisson process with the arrival rate of λ 1 t 2 x2 t is a random variable representing the storm activity duration blue arrows in fig 1a rain cells can arrive only within the storm activity time within each storm these values are randomly distributed according to an exponential distribution with storm dependent parameter γ 1 t this storm dependent parameter is itself a random variable it varies between storms so as to represent different storm types e g convective stratiform etc it is defined by the formula γ φ η where η 1 t is a random variable represented by a gamma distribution with rate parameter ν t scale parameter 1 ν and shape parameter α 3 x3 t is a random variable representing the rain cell arrival time yellow dots in fig 1b counted from the storm beginning its distribution within a storm is defined by another poisson process with storm dependent arrival rate β 1 t here parameter β is also randomized using a scaling formula β κ η note that the rblrpx model assumed that rain cell always occurs at the beginning of this poisson process as indicated by the rectangles attached to the black circles in fig 1c 4 x4 t is a random variable representing the duration of the rain cells width of the rectangles in fig 1c that are distributed according to an exponential distribution conditional upon the storm dependent parameter η 1 t 5 x5 l t is a random variable representing the rain cell intensity height of the rectangles in fig 1c that is typically exponentially or gamma distributed conditional upon the storm dependent parameter η 1 t in this study we choose the storm dependent gamma distribution with shape parameter ω and scale parameter ι η ω the conceptualization of the poisson cluster rainfall model composed of two poisson processes realistically emulates the physical rainfall process in which multiple rainstorms composed of multiple rain cells austin and houze jr 1972 olsson and burlando 2002 spatially move the models have been proven to successfully reproduce not only the first to the third order statistics of the depth distribution but also intermittency properties of the observed rainfall at various locations across the world bo et al 1994 cameron et al 2000b cowpertwait 1991 cowpertwait et al 2007 derzekos et al 2005 entekhabi et al 1989 glasbey et al 1995 1997 1990 1994a 1994b islam et al 1999 kaczmarska et al 2014 khaliq and cunnane 1996 kim et al 2016 2013b 2014 2017 kossieris et al 2015 2018 onof and wheater 1993 smithers et al 2002 velghe et al 1994 verhoest et al 1997 wasko et al 2015 ritschel et al 2017 2 2 2 temporal distribution of the rain cell depth the rectangular rain cell shape assumed by most poisson cluster rainfall models may be a required choice for the mathematical tractability of the model equations however we hypothesized that the rain cell internal structure can be better represented by relaxing this assumption several studies on radar precipitation and storm tracking algorithms han et al 2009 kim et al 2019 suggest that the rain cell spatial structure resembles the shape of the bell curves since the advection of such a shape would translate into bell shaped curves in time we propose to use the sine squared function as the shape of the rain cell instead of a rectangle fig 1d here the parameters of the sine squared function were determined so that i the cell duration is unchanged and ii the cell volume is unchanged i e the area under the sine squared function is identical to that of the rectangle this is achieved by the following function for the sine squared cell where the instantaneous rainfall intensity is given by r t 0 f o r t x 1 x 3 o r t x 1 x 3 x 4 1 r t 2 x 5 sin 2 π x 4 t x 1 x 3 f o r x 1 x 3 t x 1 x 3 x 4 numerical implementation of the above equations is described in appendix along with the matlab codes 2 3 rainfall generation 2 3 1 model parameter calibration as explained earlier the problem we face is that we are unable to calibrate the new model as we have no closed form expressions for the standard rainfall statistics this means that we can only estimate the parameters of the corresponding rblrpx model for all calendar months the assumption that enables us to simulate from the sine squared pulse model is that the statistics used for calibration i e hourly and coarser scale statistics are approximately identical for the two models this assumption will be validated in section 3 1 the particle swarm optimization algorithm first scatters thousands of particles over the parameter space then the particles are grouped into multiple swarms that communicate with each other to successively reach the optimal solution through iterations the algorithm was applied to rblrp model in previous studies cho et al 2011 kim et al 2012 2013a 2013b 2017 and kim and onof 2020 we employed the particle swarm optimization algorithm cho et al 2011 to determine the values of the seven parameters that minimize the following equation representing the difference between the statistics of the observed rainfall f k and those theoretically expressed in terms of the seven model parameters 2 of k 1 n w k f k λ ν α ι ϕ κ ω f k 2 w k represents the weight factor assigned to each of the different statistics which may be adjusted based upon their relative importance in defining the hydrologic responses kim and olivera 2012 in this study the weight factors were determined so that the statistics with greater interannual variability have smaller value jesus and chandler 2011 kaczmarska et al 2014 the observed rainfall statistics or f k s used for the calibration are the mean variance skewness auto covariance and the proportion of the dry period at 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 hourly aggregation intervals note that statistics at sub hourly aggregation intervals were not used for the calibration this is for the reason given above and this therefore has the additional advantage that this model provides a useful downscaling tool generating sub hourly rainfall time series when only hourly data are available calibrated parameters and the corresponding objective function values are summarized in table b1 crosshair marks in fig 2 show the location of the july parameters identified by the particle swarm optimization algorithm the background colours of each plot represent the logarithm of objective function values because it is impossible to visualize the location of the identified parameters in the 7 dimensional parameter search space we fixed five identified parameters and made the two remaining parameters vary to produce the background colour contours therefore a total of 21 plots 7 2 are shown the calibrated parameters are located at the bluest part of the parameter space which means that the algorithm successfully identified at least a local minimum in the search space the plots of the remaining months also showed the similar trend 2 3 2 rainfall generation two rainfall time series with a length of 500 years were generated one time series is based on the traditional rectangular rain cell and the other one assumes the sine squared shape of the rain cell the two time series share the same random variables x1 through x5 described in section 2 2 1 so we first generated the random variables x1 to x5 using the assumptions of the traditional rblrp model then using the functional form r t equation 1 and by computing the total rainfall it defines over an unit interval a b at the timescale of interest e g one hour see appendix we obtained the contribution of this cell to each of these time intervals fig 3 shows a part of the time series generated for november 2 4 urban flood inundation model rainfall characteristics at the sub hourly timescales particularly impact watersheds with short response time schilling 1991 dao et al 2020a 2020b oh et al 2016 in this study we developed a dual drainage flood inundation model using a commercial software tool xp swmm to see if flooded areas produced by the synthetic rainfall resemble those based on the observed rainfall the study area is the sinwol watershed located in seoul in the republic of korea fig 4 the sinwol watershed which has an area of 3 2 km 2 and concentration time of approximately 50 min was inundated several times during the last 10 years 2010 2011 and 2018 the model consists of 916 pipes 710 manholes and 108 sub watersheds the areas of which range from 0 0015 km 2 to 0 085 km 2 with an average of 0 015 km 2 a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 5 m is used to calculate the land surface slope lastly 1 minute observed rainfall data collected using a tipping bucket with 0 2 mm tipping amounts is used as input rainfall data for parameter calibration then the model parameters which are impervious area proportion 97 percent manning s roughness coefficient of pipes n 0 017 and scs curve number cn 98 values were calibrated to reproduce the water depth observed at the drainage pipe at the watershed outlet the result of model calibration for a storm event in 2013 is shown in fig 5 note that the location of the urban watershed model is korea but not bochum germany for which the rainfall model was developed this is because the watershed model could be built more realistically with the help of the extensive gis database containing information on elevation pipe network manhole location land use and land cover as well as observed flow height data used for model calibration in addition the area is highly impervious and has a very short response time so it provides a nice test bed to show the contrast between the rectangular model and sine squared pulse model so this watershed model corresponds to a virtual urban environment for the hydrological validation of the rainfall model this validation involves comparing flooded areas corresponding to observed and synthetic rainfall events with similar recurrence intervals lastly local rainfall data could not be used for validation because it is only 10 years long which makes it impossible to develop the control case of flooded area corresponding to observed rainfall with high recurrence intervals on the contrary it was possible to obtain the flooded area corresponding to 70 years of rainfall using the bochum rainfall data 3 results and discussions 3 1 reproduction of rainfall statistics fig 6 compares the standard statistics mean variance skewness autocovariance and proportion of dry periods of the observed rainfall x and the synthetic rainfall y at timescales ranging from 5 min to 3 days the subplots in each of the plot show the magnified view of the comparison at sub hourly timescales the coloured triangles and grey circles represent the result of the sine squared pulse model and the traditional rblrpx model respectively the colours of the triangles and brightness of the grey circles represent different timescales relative errors between standard statistics of observed and synthetic rainfall for 4 calendar months january april july and october and 5 aggregation intervals 5 60 480 1440 and 4320 min are also summarized in table 2 first the rainfall mean is reproduced by both models very well this is because the rainfall mean is not affected by the timescale second while both models reproduce well the rainfall variance at hourly and supra hourly timescales the traditional rectangular pulse model generally underestimates the variance and the sine squared pulse model overestimates the variance in a few calendar months at the sub hourly 5 and 15 minute timescale this is because of the sine squared function distributing the rain cell depth over time the temporally distributed rain cell depths following the shape of the sine squared function will have more variable values than the identically distributed rain cell depths based on the rectangular shape which yields the increased variance this is clearly shown in fig 2 that compares the synthetic rainfall time series generated by the traditional rectangular and the sine squared pulse model of this study however variances were overestimated for some calendar months which may be resolved by adjusting the powers applied to the sine function a detailed discussion of this issue is provided in section 3 3 note that this effect is reduced as the temporal aggregation interval becomes greater this is because the rainfall amount of a sine squared cell and that of a rectangular cell in a single time step of the aggregated time series are identical if their beginning and ending are contained in a single time step see the right most figure of fig a1 and the probability of this happening increases as the size of the time step becomes greater fig 7 shows the distribution of the rain cell durations x4 that were randomly drawn to generate the 500 years of synthetic rainfall the histogram suggests that the 71 percent of the 34 234 rain cells have a rain cell duration less than one hour which suggests that the effect of applying sine squared pulse including the variance inflation will be mostly active at the sub hourly timescale note that this rain cell duration distribution contributed to verify our working assumptions that the alteration of rain cell shape would hardly alter the hourly and supra hourly rainfall characteristics which made possible the transplant of rectangular model parameters to our new model third autocovariances are well reproduced at the hourly and the sub hourly timescales but they tend to be underestimated by both models as the timescale becomes coarser the degree of underestimation is smaller for the rectangular pulse model at the supra hourly timescale the underestimation of the autocovariance is associated with an overestimation of the proportion of dry periods when the model is calibrated the dry period is overestimated by the model as seen in fig 6e this means that the rainfall did not occur as many times as it would have in the observed rainfall which subsequently decreases the resemblance of the rainfall depths at the following timesteps resulting in an underestimated autocovariance the degree of resemblance between the rainfall depths at consecutive timesteps will be greater for the rectangular pulse model because the timesteps a rain cell is spread over will share exactly the same rainfall depths whereas the sine squared pulse model makes the timestep share the different rainfall depths that are distributed over time fourth the sine squared pulse model reduces the systematic underestimation of the skewness produced by the rectangular pulse rblrpx model especially for large skewness values at sub hourly timescales this is because the peak part of the rain cell whose profile has the sine squared shape increases the thickness of the tail part of the rainfall depth distribution as seen in fig 3b this effect decreases as the timescale gets coarser because time series are aggregated as mentioned above fifth the assumption which is used in the methodology proposed in this paper is only partly validated that is we find that both models generally exhibit close values of the statistics for hourly and supra hourly time steps but that is not always the case particularly for the variance at sub daily time scales in this comparison the sine squared pulse model is at a disadvantage since the calibration assumes a rectangular pulse model it is therefore not to be excluded that the sine squared pulse model s performance could be improved with more optimal parameters since the equations for model calibration are not mathematically tractable the traditional approach based on the method of moments cannot be used and that is why we calibrate the corresponding rectangular pulse model instead however the sine squared pulse model could be calibrated by employing a numerical calibration scheme in this scheme the parameters concerning rain cell temporal structures would be adjusted by iteratively matching the statistics of the observed rainfall and several hundred years of synthetically generated rainfall this is however beyond the scope of this paper lastly note that the overall fit of the statistics is not as good as those of previous studies e g kim and olivera 2012 as indicated by the values shown in table 2 this is primarily because the fit of the skewness which is important for reproducing extreme values introduces biases into the remaining statistics see fig b1 this result shows the difficulty of developing a parsimonious rainfall model capable of reproducing both usual and rare behaviour of rainfall process 3 2 reproduction of rainfall extreme values fig 8 shows the relationship between annual maximum rainfall depths and return periods for both observed and synthetic rainfall the blue dots represent the observed rainfall and the magenta and green solid line represents the synthetic rainfall generated by the traditional rectangular pulse model and sine squared pulse model both models simulate almost similar extreme values at supra hourly timescales and they successfully reproduce the observed extreme values without significant bias this is because the effect of distribution of rain cell depth is active only for the aggregation interval smaller than the rain cell durations the sine squared pulse model reproduces more accurate extreme values than the rectangular pulse model does at sub hourly timescales this is because the sub hourly timesteps containing the peak part of the sine squared pulse is greater than the one containing the rectangular pulse e g fig 3 fig 9 shows the ratio of the observed 70 year rainfall to the simulated 70 year rainfall varying with aggregation intervals the red and blue line correspond to the sine squared and rectangular pulse models respectively the degree of underestimation of extreme rainfall consistently increases as the aggregation interval decreases which amounts to 34 and 18 for the rectangular pulse and sine squared pulse model at the 5 minute aggregation interval respectively this underestimation at the sub hourly timescales can lead to significantly incorrect outputs when we analyse the hydrological model particularly for watersheds having short time of concentration such as urbanized areas to resolve this issue a mathematical function with sharper rising limbs may be adopted which however may entail sacrificing the good fit of the more common events that tend to have gently rising limbs another approach may be to incorporate the relationship between the intensity and the peakedness of rain cells into the modelling framework an idea we discuss in the next section 3 3 why squared why not other powers as discussed in the previous sections the sine squared function was chosen to represent rain cell shape because of the mathematical simplicity and model parsimony this section discusses how the choice of different mathematical functions would influence the model performance even though completely different mathematical forms may be tested only the sine power functions of powers 2 4 16 and 64 were tested here since they represent well the wide ranges of peakedness and the intermittency of rain cells as shown in fig 10 the lines in fig 9 shows the ratio of the simulated 70 year rainfall to the observed 70 year rainfall the yellow green and violet lines correspond to the powers of 4 16 and 64 respectively as the power increases the ratio increases meaning that the simulated extreme rainfall increases the figure also suggests that the power that guarantees the best fit between the observed and the estimated extreme rainfall may be identified e g somewhere around 4 in this case however it should also be noted that the application of different powers distorts the standard statistics representing usual rainfall behaviour fig 11 compares variances of observed and simulated rainfall distortion of rainfall variance at sub hourly timescales was assessed by comparing the slope of regression line fitted by sub hourly rainfall variance red dashed line the distortion is more significant for the models with the greater power 26 45 93 and 141 percent for the powers of 2 4 16 and 64 respectively this experiment suggests that the identification of a single power that ensures the fit of both the extreme value and the standard statistics is almost impossible this is because the current parsimonious model structure cannot represent the dynamic temporal structure of the rain cells influenced by a variety of atmospheric processes based on this experiment the sine squared function represents a reasonable compromise between reproducing extreme values and reproducing standard statistics as a matter of fact realizing complex rainfall characteristics through parsimonious model structure is a classic challenge of rainfall modeling for example random cascade models that originally adopted a single set of scale independent cascading parameters across the scales have evolved to apply multiple sets of scale dependent parameters to represent complex characteristics of rainfall veneziano et al 2006 rupp et al 2009 serinaldi 2010 analogously the model of this study may be improved by introducing an additional algorithm to adjust powers of the sine function depending upon rain cell duration and intensity 3 4 reproduction of the flood response in an urban watershed fig 12 shows the flooded area simulated by the urban drainage model caused by the 70 year rainfall extracted from the two synthetic rainfall data and the observed rainfall data here the return period of rainfall was obtained through the frequency analysis based on the series of annual maximum rainfall accumulated over the watershed time of concentration 40 min the annual maximum rainfall values were assumed to follow the generalized extreme value gev distribution the method of l moments was used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution note that the annual maximum rainfall values were assumed to be identically and independently distributed in the frequency analysis which may cause misinterpretation of true risk serinaldi 2015 fig 12 a and b show the result corresponding to the rectangular pulse and the sine squared pulse model respectively while the rectangular pulse model significantly underestimates the flooded area the sine squared pulse model reproduces the flooded area well fig 13 compares the flooded area caused by rainfall events with various recurrence intervals ranging between 5 years and 70 years the negative bias of the flooded area caused by the rectangular pulse model was dramatically improved by the sine squared pulse model the colour of the points in fig 13 a represents the recurrence interval of the synthetic rainfall events suggesting that greater rainfall does not always lead to greater flooded area this is because it is not only the accumulated rainfall depth but also its temporal variability that influences the size of the flooded area dao et al 2020a 2020b fig 13 b compares the accumulated observed rainfall depth and the flooded area varying with return periods of rainfall events the colour of the points in the plot represents the coefficient of the variation of the five 10 minute hyetograph values of 50 minute rainfall events the red and blue points are associated with the sudden rise and drop of the curve corresponding to the flooded area suggesting that rainfall with greater temporal variability is associated with greater flooded area this study performed the similar validation for four more urban watersheds of seoul see fig c1 for their locations to further verify the applicability of our model to urban watershed risk assessment the maps comparing the flooded areas corresponding to 70 year rainfall are provided in the appendix of this article fig c2 the result suggests that the sine squared pulse model resolves the systematic underestimation of flooded areas that is associated with the rectangular pulse model 3 5 rectangular pulse or sine squared pulse we have so far focused on the influence of applying the sine squared pulse instead of rectangular pulse at sub hourly time scales when sub hourly rainfall data are not available since the model showed improved performance in this case one might wonder if the sine squared pulse model would show a similar improved performance to that of the rectangular pulse model when sub hourly rainfall statistics are also considered for the model calibration importantly from the outset we should say that this is unlikely for the simple reason that we do not have the statistics required to calibrate the sin squared model with sub hourly data nevertheless in this section the performance of the sine squared pulse model was investigated with the parameters obtained from calibrating the rectangular pulse model at all available time scales i e 5 15 30 minutely and 1 2 4 8 16 32 hourly and simply replacing the rectangular by a sine squared pulse in the simulation phase fig 14 shows the relationship between the annual maximum rainfall depth and the return period at the timescales ranging from 5 min to 3 days when sub hourly rainfall statistics are additionally included for model calibration as expected the performance of the original rectangular pulse model improved at sub hourly time scale compared to the one calibrated using only hourly and supra hourly statistics fig 8 the sine squared pulse model significantly overestimated extreme values at fine time scales e g less than 15 min while not shown here the sine squared pulse model also systematically overestimated rainfall variance and skewness at the similar fine timescales replacing the rectangular pulses by sine squared pulse disturbs the statistics that are already well reproduced by the rectangular pulse model resulting in inflated variance skewness and extreme values it is nevertheless noteworthy that the sine squared pulse model calibrated based on hourly and supra hourly statistics fig 8 outperformed the rectangular pulse model calibrated based on all available rainfall statistics fig 14 in reproducing extreme values across the timescales between 5 min and 3 days this is because when sub hourly rainfall statistics is provided for calibration the model leans toward reproducing the sub hourly statistics at the expense of reproducing extreme values at the coarser timescales this issue is also associated with the inherent limitation of the poisson cluster rainfall models that cannot account for the correlation between the consecutive rainstorm depths a problem which was successfully resolved by kim and onof 2020 who proposed a model that successfully reproduces rainfall statistics including extremes at timescales between 5 min and a decade 4 conclusion although sub hourly rainfall variability poses significant adverse impact on urban hydrologic systems few stochastic models reproduce it simply because of a lack of sub hourly rainfall data with which to calibrate these models this study proposed a simple scheme to modify poisson cluster rectangular rainfall models for improved performance at sub hourly timescales without using sub hourly rainfall in this approach the rectangles representing rain cells in rainfall time series are replaced with bell shaped profiles of which the mathematical form is y sin2 x the newly proposed sine squared pulse model outperformed the rectangular pulse model in reproducing various statistics including extreme values especially at sub hourly timescale this is because durations of a significant portion of the generated rain cells are less than one hour when the model is calibrated based on hourly and supra hourly rainfall statistics so the additional within cell variability introduced by the sine squared function is effective in inflating the rainfall variability mostly at sub hourly timescale but not at hourly or coarser timescales the model was further validated for the case of dual drainage urban flood model the validation suggested that the new sine squared pulse model significantly reduces the bias of the flooded area caused by the rectangular pulse model the merit of our new model can be viewed from the perspective of model parsimony it does not require any additional parameter or distinct condition as compared with its predecessors aimed at improving performance at sub hourly timescales while it shows a dramatically improved performance in practical applications of urban flood modeling the model can be also computationally light for example the implementation computer codes written by the authors adopted the analytic integration form of the sine squared function which obviates the need for numerical integration that requires the function estimation at many sub grid levels of each timestep instead the analytical function eq a 1 needs to be calculated only at the beginning and or ending edge of the time grid see appendix a the concept of applying the smooth rain cell shape can easily be expanded for other space time model cowpertwait 1995 burton et al 2008 by replacing the space time disc with a 3 dimensional bell shaped function e g z sin 2 x 2 y 2 another avenue of further research for this model would be to consider different mathematical functions instead of y sin2 x e g different powers that may better account for the local characteristics of local rainfall by choosing these powers as

4556,although sub hourly rainfall temporal characteristics play an important role in occurrences and magnitudes of urban flash floods most stochastic rainfall models struggle to reproduce them when rainfall information is not available at sub hourly timescales this study suggests a simple approach to modifying poisson cluster rectangular pulse rainfall models to resolve this issue in this model the original rectangles representing a rain cell are replaced by a bell shape that is mathematically represented as y sin2 x such an alteration no longer makes it possible to obtain closed form expressions for the various rainfall statistics for model parameter calibration based on an assumption that this alteration would hardly alter the hourly and supra hourly statistics we calibrated the parameters of a rectangular pulse model with these statistics from 1 to 32 h and transplanted the same parameters to the sine squared pulse model to generate 500 years of 5 minute rainfall importantly this parameter transplant procedure does not require any sub hourly information so that it amounts to a downscaling algorithm for the generation of sub hourly rainfall our results show that both models reproduced well the rainfall mean variance autocovariance proportion of dry periods and extreme values at hourly to 72 hour timescales however the sine squared pulse model performed significantly better at sub hourly time scales the same 500 years of synthetic rainfall data and 69 years of observed rainfall data were then used as input of a dual drainage urban watershed model developed for a frequently flooded urban area of seoul while the traditional rectangular pulse model significantly underestimated the flooded area the new sine squared pulse model successfully reproduced the flooded area caused by the observed rainfall keywords urban flood rainfall generation disaggregation downscaling stochastic model sub hourly rainfall 1 introduction short duration intense rainfall presents a significant problem for society urban drainage systems can become quickly overwhelmed and parched or saturated ground can cause substantial runoff the consequent surface water flooding is hazardous to life and costly for insurers under global warming cloudburst events are expected to become more intense o gorman 2015 fischer and knutti 2016 bao et al 2017 barbero et

tool for water resources and flood risk management across a range of spatial and temporal scales however simulating short duration intense rainfall remains a challenge while dynamic climate models that can consider mesoscale convection prein et al 2017a 2017b 2017c and advances in our representation of the role of the clausius clapeyron relationship kendon et al 2014 chan et al 2016 lenderink et al 2017 barbero et al 2018 moustakis et al 2020 have greatly improved our understanding of short duration intense rainfall prerin et al 2013 2015 kendon et al 2017 chen et al 2020 they continue to be ill suited to practitioner use because they require significant computational resources to provide ensembles of long fine scale synthetic time series for flood risk analysis statistical rainfall models have been applied to overcome this limitation but many statistical models are scale dependent park et al 2019 kim and onof 2020 and only suited to coarse scale e g supra hourly rainfall in which the intermittency is simplified in addition most significantly rainfall data are often not available at the timescale of interest particularly at sub hourly scales meaning that simulation disaggregation and regionalization are needed to estimate intense rainfall events where sub daily rainfall data is available poisson cluster models are highly suited to capturing the intermittency of wet and dry periods however at sub hourly scales these models also struggle to replicate other properties such as the variance skewness and extreme behavior of the rainfall intensity poisson cluster rainfall models simulate rainfall with the clustering of rain cells in storms there are standard clustering algorithms bartlett lewis and neyman scott either of which can be used to emulate the phenomenology of rainfall generation in which the rainfall observed on the ground originates from superimposed pockets of rain in storms since their conception kavvas and delleur 1975 and early development rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rain cells have predominantly been represented by rectangular pulses this has the principal benefit of mathematical tractability although this simple assumption is arguably unrealistic since the fundamental structure was formalized in the late 1980s by rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 developments of the poisson cluster model have focused on improving the estimation of key summary statistics such as auto correlation or proportion of dry periods rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 improving the simulation of convective and stratiform events cowpertwait 1994 onof and wang 2020 reproducing long and short term rainfall persistence kim et al 2013a park et al 2019 kim and onof 2020 extending the temporal to a spatial temporal model cowpertwait 1995 northrop

2013 and kaczmarska et al 2015 a longstanding limitation of the poisson cluster rainfall models has been their tendency to underestimate rainfall extremes at fine e g sub hourly temporal scales cowpertwait et al 1996 verhoest et al 1997 cameron et al 2000c onof et al 2000 kaczmarska et al 2014 cross et al 2018 cowpertwait 1998 included the third central moment in the fitting statistics to better capture the skewness of the rainfall intensity while theoretically justified study results have been variable with very little benefit derived at sub hourly scales the use of thicker tailed distributions for the rain cell intensity has also had limited impact onof and wheater 1994a cameron et al 2000a a new version of the modified bartlett lewis model with randomised mean rain cell intensity improved the estimation of extremes at sub hourly scales kaczmarska et al 2014 although under estimation persisted at the finest resolutions a censored modelling approach was also investigated by cross et al 2018 which gave substantially improved estimation of sub hourly extremes although at the expense of time series generation for use in hydrological studies since only rainfall depths above a threshold are represented by this model recent work by onof and wang 2020 showed that calculating the skewness for each calendar month and averaging underestimates the skewness in fitting and consequently the estimation of extremes results have indicated that when skewness is calculated using all the data for a given month together as one sample sub hourly extremes are improved with all models and in particular the updated modified model of kaczmarska et al 2014 further work by kim and onof 2020 has also shown that the selection of a gamma distribution instead of typical exponential distribution for rain cell intensity and more importantly the introduction of an algorithm that shuffles both storms and months of the same calendar month to account for the memory of rainfall time series at scales up to years can significantly improve the estimation of extremes across all temporal scales however these studies require enough sub hourly rainfall data to obtain reliable estimates of the main statistics used in calibration for improved performance at sub hourly time scale even though rain cell shape has been extensively investigated based on observations in both lagrangian and eulerian frameworks zawadzki 1973 berndtsson et al 1994 lepioufle et al 2012 and schleiss et al 2014 there has been little research that incorporated the concept of temporally variable rain cell profile into poisson cluster rainfall models although see samuel 1999 this may be because modelled rain cells are unobserved and it is the aggregated process which is of interest furthermore the superposition of rain cells in the unobserved process has the effect of stacking up rainfall in ways which give rise to interesting and varied profiles changing the rain cell shape is computationally demanding and reduces model parsimony for what appears to be little gain ramesh et al 2018 introduced a model in which rain cells exponentially decay over time which improved the model s performance to reproduce extreme values northrop and stone 2005 developed a gaussian pulse version of the bartlett lewis model the model showed comparable performance to its rectangular pulse counterpart but at much greater computational cost an instantaneous pulse model was also developed by cowpertwait et al 2011 specifically for simulation of fine scale rainfall in which rectangular pulses were replaced with instantaneous bursts of equal rainfall intensity closely resembling a tip time rainfall record as stated earlier this model required more model parameters than its rectangular pulse counterpart yet did not offer any obvious benefit what motivates the present research is the fact that the effect of temporally variable rain cell profiles becomes more apparent as the time scale of aggregation of the time series becomes finer especially at sub hourly timescales there are disaggregation models which enable finer scale rainfall to be generated conditional upon the availability of coarser scale series a poisson cluster model can be used to generate rainfall at one timescale e g hourly and another model e e a multifractal cascade used to disaggregate this to finer scales e g 5 mins see onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 alternatively the poisson cluster model can play the role of the disaggregator e g kossieris et al 2018 if a series of daily observations is to be disaggregated to sub hourly scales unlike such disaggregation schemes the present model is simply a rainfall simulation model which can output time series at a resolution e g 5 mins that is finer than that of the input statistics e g hourly and coarser as such it is also describable as a downscaling model in this paper we demonstrate that because a very large proportion of rain cells generated by poisson cluster models have a duration of less than 1 h kaczmarska et al 2014 kim and olivera 2012 park et al 2019 the assumption of uniform intensity over the cell lifetime hypothesized by the rectangular shape induces systematic bias in the estimation of variance and skewness at sub hourly scales this limits their ability to accurately capture the intensity of cloudburst events and hence the underestimation of sub hourly rainfall extremes it is hypothesized that changing the temporal distribution of cell intensity to a bell curve will improve the estimation of these rainfall characteristics at fine temporal scales this will improve the simulation of intense rainfall profiles which is vital for surface water flood risk assessment and the design of urban drainage systems because closed form expressions for the standard rainfall statistics with the sine squared pulse shape have not been derived it is not possible directly to calibrate the sine squared pulse model we therefore assume that given the fact that a majority of cells last less than one hour fig 7 the hourly and coarser statistics will be approximately identical whether one uses rectangular or sine squared pulses this enables us to use a rectangular pulse model calibrated to hourly and coarser scale statistics and simulate from a sine squared pulse model with the same cell volume and duration section 2 3 1 in section 2 we set out our methodology for incorporating a non uniform cell intensity profile into the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model in section 3 we present and discuss our results using 5 minute rainfall data for bochum in germany in particular we check that the above assumption is correct in addition in the light of the results showing the potential of the new model to reproduce sub hourly statistics we examine how these results would be altered were we to include sub hourly statistics for the calibration of the rectangular pulse model our conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 data description we consider the 5 minute rainfall data measured at bochum in germany the recording period starts from january 1931 and ends december 1999 assuming stationarity the few missing records are filled in with records randomly selected from the same calendar months of the different years 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the randomized bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model with rain cell duration intensity inverse correlation this study uses a recent version of the randomised bartlett lewis rectangular pulse rblrp model of kaczmarska et al 2014 since it has been shown to outperform other types of bartlett lewis models cross et al 2018 onof and wang 2020 unlike the non randomised blrp model rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 and the traditional randomised rblrp model rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the rblrpx model introduces an inverse correlation between rainfall cell duration and intensity in line with the observed behaviour of intense convective rainfall lasting several minutes and milder frontal rainfall lasting for several days a detailed description of parameters table 1 on the rblrpx model is as follows 1 x1 t is a random variable representing the storm arrival time black dots in fig 1 a that is defined by a poisson process with the arrival rate of λ 1 t 2 x2 t is a random variable representing the storm activity duration blue arrows in fig 1a rain cells can arrive only within the storm activity time within each storm these values are randomly distributed according to an exponential distribution with storm dependent parameter γ 1 t this storm dependent parameter is itself a random variable it varies between storms so as to represent different storm types e g convective stratiform etc it is defined by the formula γ φ η where η 1 t is a random variable represented by a gamma distribution with rate parameter ν t scale parameter 1 ν and shape parameter α 3 x3 t is a random variable representing the rain cell arrival time yellow dots in fig 1b counted from the storm beginning its distribution within a storm is defined by another poisson process with storm dependent arrival rate β 1 t here parameter β is also randomized using a scaling formula β κ η note that the rblrpx model assumed that rain cell always occurs at the beginning of this poisson process as indicated by the rectangles attached to the black circles in fig 1c 4 x4 t is a random variable representing the duration of the rain cells width of the rectangles in fig 1c that are distributed according to an exponential distribution conditional upon the storm dependent parameter η 1 t 5 x5 l t is a random variable representing the rain cell intensity height of the rectangles in fig 1c that is typically exponentially or gamma distributed conditional upon the storm dependent parameter η 1 t in this study we choose the storm dependent gamma distribution with shape parameter ω and scale parameter ι η ω the conceptualization of the poisson cluster rainfall model composed of two poisson processes realistically emulates the physical rainfall process in which multiple rainstorms composed of multiple rain cells austin and houze jr 1972 olsson and burlando 2002 spatially move the models have been proven to successfully reproduce not only the first to the third order statistics of the depth distribution but also intermittency properties of the observed rainfall at various locations across the world bo et al 1994 cameron et al 2000b cowpertwait 1991 cowpertwait et al 2007 derzekos et al 2005 entekhabi et al 1989 glasbey et al 1995 1997 1990 1994a 1994b islam et al 1999 kaczmarska et al 2014 khaliq and cunnane 1996 kim et al 2016 2013b 2014 2017 kossieris et al 2015 2018 onof and wheater 1993 smithers et al 2002 velghe et al 1994 verhoest et al 1997 wasko et al 2015 ritschel et al 2017 2 2 2 temporal distribution of the rain cell depth the rectangular rain cell shape assumed by most poisson cluster rainfall models may be a required choice for the mathematical tractability of the model equations however we hypothesized that the rain cell internal structure can be better represented by relaxing this assumption several studies on radar precipitation and storm tracking algorithms han et al 2009 kim et al 2019 suggest that the rain cell spatial structure resembles the shape of the bell curves since the advection of such a shape would translate into bell shaped curves in time we propose to use the sine squared function as the shape of the rain cell instead of a rectangle fig 1d here the parameters of the sine squared function were determined so that i the cell duration is unchanged and ii the cell volume is unchanged i e the area under the sine squared function is identical to that of the rectangle this is achieved by the following function for the sine squared cell where the instantaneous rainfall intensity is given by r t 0 f o r t x 1 x 3 o r t x 1 x 3 x 4 1 r t 2 x 5 sin 2 π x 4 t x 1 x 3 f o r x 1 x 3 t x 1 x 3 x 4 numerical implementation of the above equations is described in appendix along with the matlab codes 2 3 rainfall generation 2 3 1 model parameter calibration as explained earlier the problem we face is that we are unable to calibrate the new model as we have no closed form expressions for the standard rainfall statistics this means that we can only estimate the parameters of the corresponding rblrpx model for all calendar months the assumption that enables us to simulate from the sine squared pulse model is that the statistics used for calibration i e hourly and coarser scale statistics are approximately identical for the two models this assumption will be validated in section 3 1 the particle swarm optimization algorithm first scatters thousands of particles over the parameter space then the particles are grouped into multiple swarms that communicate with each other to successively reach the optimal solution through iterations the algorithm was applied to rblrp model in previous studies cho et al 2011 kim et al 2012 2013a 2013b 2017 and kim and onof 2020 we employed the particle swarm optimization algorithm cho et al 2011 to determine the values of the seven parameters that minimize the following equation representing the difference between the statistics of the observed rainfall f k and those theoretically expressed in terms of the seven model parameters 2 of k 1 n w k f k λ ν α ι ϕ κ ω f k 2 w k represents the weight factor assigned to each of the different statistics which may be adjusted based upon their relative importance in defining the hydrologic responses kim and olivera 2012 in this study the weight factors were determined so that the statistics with greater interannual variability have smaller value jesus and chandler 2011 kaczmarska et al 2014 the observed rainfall statistics or f k s used for the calibration are the mean variance skewness auto covariance and the proportion of the dry period at 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 hourly aggregation intervals note that statistics at sub hourly aggregation intervals were not used for the calibration this is for the reason given above and this therefore has the additional advantage that this model provides a useful downscaling tool generating sub hourly rainfall time series when only hourly data are available calibrated parameters and the corresponding objective function values are summarized in table b1 crosshair marks in fig 2 show the location of the july parameters identified by the particle swarm optimization algorithm the background colours of each plot represent the logarithm of objective function values because it is impossible to visualize the location of the identified parameters in the 7 dimensional parameter search space we fixed five identified parameters and made the two remaining parameters vary to produce the background colour contours therefore a total of 21 plots 7 2 are shown the calibrated parameters are located at the bluest part of the parameter space which means that the algorithm successfully identified at least a local minimum in the search space the plots of the remaining months also showed the similar trend 2 3 2 rainfall generation two rainfall time series with a length of 500 years were generated one time series is based on the traditional rectangular rain cell and the other one assumes the sine squared shape of the rain cell the two time series share the same random variables x1 through x5 described in section 2 2 1 so we first generated the random variables x1 to x5 using the assumptions of the traditional rblrp model then using the functional form r t equation 1 and by computing the total rainfall it defines over an unit interval a b at the timescale of interest e g one hour see appendix we obtained the contribution of this cell to each of these time intervals fig 3 shows a part of the time series generated for november 2 4 urban flood inundation model rainfall characteristics at the sub hourly timescales particularly impact watersheds with short response time schilling 1991 dao et al 2020a 2020b oh et al 2016 in this study we developed a dual drainage flood inundation model using a commercial software tool xp swmm to see if flooded areas produced by the synthetic rainfall resemble those based on the observed rainfall the study area is the sinwol watershed located in seoul in the republic of korea fig 4 the sinwol watershed which has an area of 3 2 km 2 and concentration time of approximately 50 min was inundated several times during the last 10 years 2010 2011 and 2018 the model consists of 916 pipes 710 manholes and 108 sub watersheds the areas of which range from 0 0015 km 2 to 0 085 km 2 with an average of 0 015 km 2 a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 5 m is used to calculate the land surface slope lastly 1 minute observed rainfall data collected using a tipping bucket with 0 2 mm tipping amounts is used as input rainfall data for parameter calibration then the model parameters which are impervious area proportion 97 percent manning s roughness coefficient of pipes n 0 017 and scs curve number cn 98 values were calibrated to reproduce the water depth observed at the drainage pipe at the watershed outlet the result of model calibration for a storm event in 2013 is shown in fig 5 note that the location of the urban watershed model is korea but not bochum germany for which the rainfall model was developed this is because the watershed model could be built more realistically with the help of the extensive gis database containing information on elevation pipe network manhole location land use and land cover as well as observed flow height data used for model calibration in addition the area is highly impervious and has a very short response time so it provides a nice test bed to show the contrast between the rectangular model and sine squared pulse model so this watershed model corresponds to a virtual urban environment for the hydrological validation of the rainfall model this validation involves comparing flooded areas corresponding to observed and synthetic rainfall events with similar recurrence intervals lastly local rainfall data could not be used for validation because it is only 10 years long which makes it impossible to develop the control case of flooded area corresponding to observed rainfall with high recurrence intervals on the contrary it was possible to obtain the flooded area corresponding to 70 years of rainfall using the bochum rainfall data 3 results and discussions 3 1 reproduction of rainfall statistics fig 6 compares the standard statistics mean variance skewness autocovariance and proportion of dry periods of the observed rainfall x and the synthetic rainfall y at timescales ranging from 5 min to 3 days the subplots in each of the plot show the magnified view of the comparison at sub hourly timescales the coloured triangles and grey circles represent the result of the sine squared pulse model and the traditional rblrpx model respectively the colours of the triangles and brightness of the grey circles represent different timescales relative errors between standard statistics of observed and synthetic rainfall for 4 calendar months january april july and october and 5 aggregation intervals 5 60 480 1440 and 4320 min are also summarized in table 2 first the rainfall mean is reproduced by both models very well this is because the rainfall mean is not affected by the timescale second while both models reproduce well the rainfall variance at hourly and supra hourly timescales the traditional rectangular pulse model generally underestimates the variance and the sine squared pulse model overestimates the variance in a few calendar months at the sub hourly 5 and 15 minute timescale this is because of the sine squared function distributing the rain cell depth over time the temporally distributed rain cell depths following the shape of the sine squared function will have more variable values than the identically distributed rain cell depths based on the rectangular shape which yields the increased variance this is clearly shown in fig 2 that compares the synthetic rainfall time series generated by the traditional rectangular and the sine squared pulse model of this study however variances were overestimated for some calendar months which may be resolved by adjusting the powers applied to the sine function a detailed discussion of this issue is provided in section 3 3 note that this effect is reduced as the temporal aggregation interval becomes greater this is because the rainfall amount of a sine squared cell and that of a rectangular cell in a single time step of the aggregated time series are identical if their beginning and ending are contained in a single time step see the right most figure of fig a1 and the probability of this happening increases as the size of the time step becomes greater fig 7 shows the distribution of the rain cell durations x4 that were randomly drawn to generate the 500 years of synthetic rainfall the histogram suggests that the 71 percent of the 34 234 rain cells have a rain cell duration less than one hour which suggests that the effect of applying sine squared pulse including the variance inflation will be mostly active at the sub hourly timescale note that this rain cell duration distribution contributed to verify our working assumptions that the alteration of rain cell shape would hardly alter the hourly and supra hourly rainfall characteristics which made possible the transplant of rectangular model parameters to our new model third autocovariances are well reproduced at the hourly and the sub hourly timescales but they tend to be underestimated by both models as the timescale becomes coarser the degree of underestimation is smaller for the rectangular pulse model at the supra hourly timescale the underestimation of the autocovariance is associated with an overestimation of the proportion of dry periods when the model is calibrated the dry period is overestimated by the model as seen in fig 6e this means that the rainfall did not occur as many times as it would have in the observed rainfall which subsequently decreases the resemblance of the rainfall depths at the following timesteps resulting in an underestimated autocovariance the degree of resemblance between the rainfall depths at consecutive timesteps will be greater for the rectangular pulse model because the timesteps a rain cell is spread over will share exactly the same rainfall depths whereas the sine squared pulse model makes the timestep share the different rainfall depths that are distributed over time fourth the sine squared pulse model reduces the systematic underestimation of the skewness produced by the rectangular pulse rblrpx model especially for large skewness values at sub hourly timescales this is because the peak part of the rain cell whose profile has the sine squared shape increases the thickness of the tail part of the rainfall depth distribution as seen in fig 3b this effect decreases as the timescale gets coarser because time series are aggregated as mentioned above fifth the assumption which is used in the methodology proposed in this paper is only partly validated that is we find that both models generally exhibit close values of the statistics for hourly and supra hourly time steps but that is not always the case particularly for the variance at sub daily time scales in this comparison the sine squared pulse model is at a disadvantage since the calibration assumes a rectangular pulse model it is therefore not to be excluded that the sine squared pulse model s performance could be improved with more optimal parameters since the equations for model calibration are not mathematically tractable the traditional approach based on the method of moments cannot be used and that is why we calibrate the corresponding rectangular pulse model instead however the sine squared pulse model could be calibrated by employing a numerical calibration scheme in this scheme the parameters concerning rain cell temporal structures would be adjusted by iteratively matching the statistics of the observed rainfall and several hundred years of synthetically generated rainfall this is however beyond the scope of this paper lastly note that the overall fit of the statistics is not as good as those of previous studies e g kim and olivera 2012 as indicated by the values shown in table 2 this is primarily because the fit of the skewness which is important for reproducing extreme values introduces biases into the remaining statistics see fig b1 this result shows the difficulty of developing a parsimonious rainfall model capable of reproducing both usual and rare behaviour of rainfall process 3 2 reproduction of rainfall extreme values fig 8 shows the relationship between annual maximum rainfall depths and return periods for both observed and synthetic rainfall the blue dots represent the observed rainfall and the magenta and green solid line represents the synthetic rainfall generated by the traditional rectangular pulse model and sine squared pulse model both models simulate almost similar extreme values at supra hourly timescales and they successfully reproduce the observed extreme values without significant bias this is because the effect of distribution of rain cell depth is active only for the aggregation interval smaller than the rain cell durations the sine squared pulse model reproduces more accurate extreme values than the rectangular pulse model does at sub hourly timescales this is because the sub hourly timesteps containing the peak part of the sine squared pulse is greater than the one containing the rectangular pulse e g fig 3 fig 9 shows the ratio of the observed 70 year rainfall to the simulated 70 year rainfall varying with aggregation intervals the red and blue line correspond to the sine squared and rectangular pulse models respectively the degree of underestimation of extreme rainfall consistently increases as the aggregation interval decreases which amounts to 34 and 18 for the rectangular pulse and sine squared pulse model at the 5 minute aggregation interval respectively this underestimation at the sub hourly timescales can lead to significantly incorrect outputs when we analyse the hydrological model particularly for watersheds having short time of concentration such as urbanized areas to resolve this issue a mathematical function with sharper rising limbs may be adopted which however may entail sacrificing the good fit of the more common events that tend to have gently rising limbs another approach may be to incorporate the relationship between the intensity and the peakedness of rain cells into the modelling framework an idea we discuss in the next section 3 3 why squared why not other powers as discussed in the previous sections the sine squared function was chosen to represent rain cell shape because of the mathematical simplicity and model parsimony this section discusses how the choice of different mathematical functions would influence the model performance even though completely different mathematical forms may be tested only the sine power functions of powers 2 4 16 and 64 were tested here since they represent well the wide ranges of peakedness and the intermittency of rain cells as shown in fig 10 the lines in fig 9 shows the ratio of the simulated 70 year rainfall to the observed 70 year rainfall the yellow green and violet lines correspond to the powers of 4 16 and 64 respectively as the power increases the ratio increases meaning that the simulated extreme rainfall increases the figure also suggests that the power that guarantees the best fit between the observed and the estimated extreme rainfall may be identified e g somewhere around 4 in this case however it should also be noted that the application of different powers distorts the standard statistics representing usual rainfall behaviour fig 11 compares variances of observed and simulated rainfall distortion of rainfall variance at sub hourly timescales was assessed by comparing the slope of regression line fitted by sub hourly rainfall variance red dashed line the distortion is more significant for the models with the greater power 26 45 93 and 141 percent for the powers of 2 4 16 and 64 respectively this experiment suggests that the identification of a single power that ensures the fit of both the extreme value and the standard statistics is almost impossible this is because the current parsimonious model structure cannot represent the dynamic temporal structure of the rain cells influenced by a variety of atmospheric processes based on this experiment the sine squared function represents a reasonable compromise between reproducing extreme values and reproducing standard statistics as a matter of fact realizing complex rainfall characteristics through parsimonious model structure is a classic challenge of rainfall modeling for example random cascade models that originally adopted a single set of scale independent cascading parameters across the scales have evolved to apply multiple sets of scale dependent parameters to represent complex characteristics of rainfall veneziano et al 2006 rupp et al 2009 serinaldi 2010 analogously the model of this study may be improved by introducing an additional algorithm to adjust powers of the sine function depending upon rain cell duration and intensity 3 4 reproduction of the flood response in an urban watershed fig 12 shows the flooded area simulated by the urban drainage model caused by the 70 year rainfall extracted from the two synthetic rainfall data and the observed rainfall data here the return period of rainfall was obtained through the frequency analysis based on the series of annual maximum rainfall accumulated over the watershed time of concentration 40 min the annual maximum rainfall values were assumed to follow the generalized extreme value gev distribution the method of l moments was used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution note that the annual maximum rainfall values were assumed to be identically and independently distributed in the frequency analysis which may cause misinterpretation of true risk serinaldi 2015 fig 12 a and b show the result corresponding to the rectangular pulse and the sine squared pulse model respectively while the rectangular pulse model significantly underestimates the flooded area the sine squared pulse model reproduces the flooded area well fig 13 compares the flooded area caused by rainfall events with various recurrence intervals ranging between 5 years and 70 years the negative bias of the flooded area caused by the rectangular pulse model was dramatically improved by the sine squared pulse model the colour of the points in fig 13 a represents the recurrence interval of the synthetic rainfall events suggesting that greater rainfall does not always lead to greater flooded area this is because it is not only the accumulated rainfall depth but also its temporal variability that influences the size of the flooded area dao et al 2020a 2020b fig 13 b compares the accumulated observed rainfall depth and the flooded area varying with return periods of rainfall events the colour of the points in the plot represents the coefficient of the variation of the five 10 minute hyetograph values of 50 minute rainfall events the red and blue points are associated with the sudden rise and drop of the curve corresponding to the flooded area suggesting that rainfall with greater temporal variability is associated with greater flooded area this study performed the similar validation for four more urban watersheds of seoul see fig c1 for their locations to further verify the applicability of our model to urban watershed risk assessment the maps comparing the flooded areas corresponding to 70 year rainfall are provided in the appendix of this article fig c2 the result suggests that the sine squared pulse model resolves the systematic underestimation of flooded areas that is associated with the rectangular pulse model 3 5 rectangular pulse or sine squared pulse we have so far focused on the influence of applying the sine squared pulse instead of rectangular pulse at sub hourly time scales when sub hourly rainfall data are not available since the model showed improved performance in this case one might wonder if the sine squared pulse model would show a similar improved performance to that of the rectangular pulse model when sub hourly rainfall statistics are also considered for the model calibration importantly from the outset we should say that this is unlikely for the simple reason that we do not have the statistics required to calibrate the sin squared model with sub hourly data nevertheless in this section the performance of the sine squared pulse model was investigated with the parameters obtained from calibrating the rectangular pulse model at all available time scales i e 5 15 30 minutely and 1 2 4 8 16 32 hourly and simply replacing the rectangular by a sine squared pulse in the simulation phase fig 14 shows the relationship between the annual maximum rainfall depth and the return period at the timescales ranging from 5 min to 3 days when sub hourly rainfall statistics are additionally included for model calibration as expected the performance of the original rectangular pulse model improved at sub hourly time scale compared to the one calibrated using only hourly and supra hourly statistics fig 8 the sine squared pulse model significantly overestimated extreme values at fine time scales e g less than 15 min while not shown here the sine squared pulse model also systematically overestimated rainfall variance and skewness at the similar fine timescales replacing the rectangular pulses by sine squared pulse disturbs the statistics that are already well reproduced by the rectangular pulse model resulting in inflated variance skewness and extreme values it is nevertheless noteworthy that the sine squared pulse model calibrated based on hourly and supra hourly statistics fig 8 outperformed the rectangular pulse model calibrated based on all available rainfall statistics fig 14 in reproducing extreme values across the timescales between 5 min and 3 days this is because when sub hourly rainfall statistics is provided for calibration the model leans toward reproducing the sub hourly statistics at the expense of reproducing extreme values at the coarser timescales this issue is also associated with the inherent limitation of the poisson cluster rainfall models that cannot account for the correlation between the consecutive rainstorm depths a problem which was successfully resolved by kim and onof 2020 who proposed a model that successfully reproduces rainfall statistics including extremes at timescales between 5 min and a decade 4 conclusion although sub hourly rainfall variability poses significant adverse impact on urban hydrologic systems few stochastic models reproduce it simply because of a lack of sub hourly rainfall data with which to calibrate these models this study proposed a simple scheme to modify poisson cluster rectangular rainfall models for improved performance at sub hourly timescales without using sub hourly rainfall in this approach the rectangles representing rain cells in rainfall time series are replaced with bell shaped profiles of which the mathematical form is y sin2 x the newly proposed sine squared pulse model outperformed the rectangular pulse model in reproducing various statistics including extreme values especially at sub hourly timescale this is because durations of a significant portion of the generated rain cells are less than one hour when the model is calibrated based on hourly and supra hourly rainfall statistics so the additional within cell variability introduced by the sine squared function is effective in inflating the rainfall variability mostly at sub hourly timescale but not at hourly or coarser timescales the model was further validated for the case of dual drainage urban flood model the validation suggested that the new sine squared pulse model significantly reduces the bias of the flooded area caused by the rectangular pulse model the merit of our new model can be viewed from the perspective of model parsimony it does not require any additional parameter or distinct condition as compared with its predecessors aimed at improving performance at sub hourly timescales while it shows a dramatically improved performance in practical applications of urban flood modeling the model can be also computationally light for example the implementation computer codes written by the authors adopted the analytic integration form of the sine squared function which obviates the need for numerical integration that requires the function estimation at many sub grid levels of each timestep instead the analytical function eq a 1 needs to be calculated only at the beginning and or ending edge of the time grid see appendix a the concept of applying the smooth rain cell shape can easily be expanded for other space time model cowpertwait 1995 burton et al 2008 by replacing the space time disc with a 3 dimensional bell shaped function e g z sin 2 x 2 y 2 another avenue of further research for this model would be to consider different mathematical functions instead of y sin2 x e g different powers that may better account for the local characteristics of local rainfall by choosing these powers as

vulnerability variation over time due to groundwater depth variation caused by pumping reduction is an issue of great interest that should be properly investigated this is because pumping reduction results in groundwater level increase on the one hand and groundwater vulnerability increase as a result of groundwater depth decrease on the other hand in this context the present study introduces a novel approach which considers the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability and at the same time focuses on the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate i e the highest rate of pumping reduction under which the highest increase in groundwater levels occurs without an increase in groundwater vulnerability taking place in over exploited and contaminated aquifers in a first stage a dynamic and time dependent approach involving the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a groundwater flow model was developed in order to determine groundwater vulnerability changes under different pumping reduction rates 0 10 20 30 and 40 and thus to produce the necessary data sets for investigating their relationship subsequently regression analysis was conducted to define this relationship and estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate our implementation of the methodology showed that groundwater vulnerability displays small changes during the projection period for all reduction rates while decreasing for 0 and 10 reduction of withdrawals and increasing for 20 30 and 40 reduction after finding that a quadratic equation accurately describes the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction r2 0 999 an optimal reduction rate of 16 4 was estimated by confirming that no change in vulnerability occurs under this value during the projection period the validity of the equation defined was affirmed keywords groundwater vulnerability assessment groundwater resources management drastic model groundwater modeling regression analysis greece 1 introduction groundwater is a vital water resource for preserving human life and sustaining ecosystems function as well as for meeting the various water needs and supporting socio economic development in many regions around the world aslam et al 2018 babiker et al 2005 ouedraogo et al 2016 nowadays however extensive degradation of groundwater resources quantity and quality is observed due to rapid population growth intensive commercial agricultural and industrial activities and non proper management khosravi et al 2018 muhammad et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 the issue of groundwater quality deterioration is considered of crucial significance because on the one hand groundwater resources constitute the final receivers of various hazardous substances residues and derivatives of numerous human activities and on the other hand they are hard to restore in case of being polluted huan et al 2012 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 shrestha et al 2017 in addition groundwater pollution leads to the reduction of the exploitable amount of freshwater thus causing water scarcity problems abunada et al 2021 bear and cheng 2010 todd and mays 2005 it is then becoming clear that groundwater protection against various sources of pollution is considered essential especially when groundwater is intended for human consumption almasri 2008 moghaddam et al 2020 groundwater vulnerability assessment constitutes a primary but also an important step towards groundwater protection almasri 2008 brindha and elango 2015 hamza et al 2015 khosravi et al 2018 during recent decades intensive research upon groundwater vulnerability assessment has been carried out leading to the development of various methods that are generally classified into three categories a process based methods b statistical methods and c index overlay methods almasri 2008 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 yu et al 2010 chenini et al 2015 the most established method worldwide is drastic an index overlay method named for the seven factors considered in it i e d depth to groundwater r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone c hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 not only due to the advantages characterizing the index overlay methods in general huan et al 2012 javadi et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 panagopoulos et al 2006 sinan and razack 2009 but also because of the following a it uses a considerable number of parameters seven parameters which reduces the likelihood of ignoring some critical parameters and limits the effect of errors or uncertainties of the individual parameters on the final outcome aslam et al 2018 mfonka et al 2018 ouedraogo et al 2016 panagopoulos et al 2006 and b it is quite flexible as it can be adapted to incorporate other parameters as well asfaw and mengistu 2020 javadi et al 2017 li and merchant 2013 lima et al 2011 sener and davraz 2013 such as land use e g arauzo 2017 li and merchant 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 pacheco et al 2018 aquifer thickness e g huan et al 2012 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2007 wu et al 2016 groundwater velocity e g huan et al 2012 jia et al 2019 sinan and razack 2009 stevenazzi et al 2015 hydraulic resistance e g kazakis and voudouris 2015 lineaments e g sener and davraz 2013 etc the drastic model has been used in many studies worldwide to assess groundwater vulnerability both in the case of unconfined and confined aquifers e g abunada et al 2021 almasri 2008 barzegar et al 2019 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2018 ouedraogo et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 zghibi et al 2016 in most cases the drastic model has been implemented based on static conditions i e the model assesses vulnerability for a single point in time based on current conditions and without taking into consideration the time variation of certain parameters involved in vulnerability assessment i e groundwater depth net recharge which leads to vulnerability s time variation as well i e to changes in vulnerability s score and spatial distribution over time aslam et al 2018 butscher and huggenberger 2009 li and merchant 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 however not properly investigating groundwater vulnerability s changes over time may result in misleading decisions concerning future land use planning as well as the implementation of groundwater protection policies therefore it is necessary to do as much research as possible to investigate the temporal variations or trends of groundwater vulnerability when factors change in status stevenazzi et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2012 groundwater depth one of the most important parameters in groundwater vulnerability assessment aller et al 1987 hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 is included among the drastic factors that vary over time according to the existing climate conditions and pumping schemes any changes in climate conditions and or groundwater pumping may cause to a greater or lesser extent changes in groundwater depth s spatio temporal evolution due to its strong dependence on groundwater depth groundwater vulnerability is influenced by such changes as well hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 green et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 scibek and allen 2006 previous studies have shown that groundwater vulnerability may vary over time due to changing climate e g butscher and huggenberger 2009 hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 li and merchant 2013 luoma et al 2017 however based on the literature review in the field of groundwater vulnerability what is generally missing and should be investigated is how and to what extent groundwater vulnerability varies over time due to groundwater pumping schemes modifications and especially pumping reduction reducing groundwater withdrawals is a practice frequently applied in regions characterized by over exploitation conditions in an effort to reduce groundwater outflows and protect groundwater reserves from depletion ahmed and umar 2009 jia et al 2020 pisinaras et al 2007 however reduction of groundwater pumping actually results in an increase of groundwater levels which in turn decreases the depth to groundwater thus rendering the aquifer more vulnerable to pollution hao et al 2017 luoma et al 2017 as it is obvious even though pumping reduction leads to the preservation of groundwater reserves i e quantitative aspects it may adversely affect groundwater vulnerability to pollution i e qualitative aspects it is then prudent according to the principles of integrated water resources management to strike a balance between the increase of groundwater levels on the one hand and the increase of groundwater pollution potential on the other hand when planning and implementing pumping reduction policies in other words the optimal pumping reduction rate which is actually defined as the highest rate of pumping reduction under which the highest increase in groundwater levels occurs without an increase in groundwater vulnerability taking place should be determined in this perspective the present study incorporates a novel approach which considers the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability and at the same time focuses on the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction in order to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate in regions where degradation of both groundwater quantity and quality is observed the proposed methodology constitutes a generic methodology applicable to properly and effectively managing groundwater resources in the aforementioned regions while its case specific implementation seeks to define the optimal pumping reduction rate for the study area considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects the first objective of the study was to determine groundwater vulnerability s changes as a result of groundwater depth variation under various pumping scenarios and more specifically under either maintaining pumping rates at current levels do nothing scenario or reducing them by certain rates management scenarios in other words it was aimed to produce the necessary data sets associated with vulnerability s changes under various pumping reduction rates with the intention of establishing a relationship between the aforementioned parameters to achieve this a dynamic and time dependent modeling approach for groundwater vulnerability assessment that includes the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a transient groundwater flow model was developed in general the coupling between a vulnerability assessment model and a flow model has been applied in previous studies as well e g almarsi 2008 ghouili et al 2021 luoma et al 2017 nixdorf et al 2017 voutchkova et al 2021 witkowski et al 2003 in these studies either a steady state or a transient flow model was developed in order to quantify the depth to water d parameter for improving the vulnerability model however no study so far has performed the coupling between the vulnerability and the flow models in order to investigate the relationship between a specific characteristic of a groundwater system related to groundwater quality i e groundwater vulnerability and a crucial anthropogenic factor associated with groundwater quantity i e groundwater withdrawals the next objective was to infer the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction with the aim of forming a mathematical function associating the aforementioned variables to this task a regression analysis was performed and the curve of best fit along with its equation were defined in our analysis pumping reduction rates starting from 0 and ending at 40 were treated as the independent variable x while vulnerability changes i e decrease and or increase were treated as the dependent variable y finally the defined function allowed for achieving the ultimate goal of this study which is to determine the optimal pumping reduction rate the estimated value was also used in order to test the validity of the equation formed consequently the aim of this study is not to improve a drastic model through its coupling with a groundwater flow model for assessing groundwater vulnerability to pollution in an area of interest on the contrary its aim is to take advantage of this coupling in order to provide groundwater resources managers and decision makers with a useful tool for developing adequate pumping reduction policies which promote both sufficient quantity and good quality of water 2 study area τhe hydrological basin of nea moudania located in the south western part of the chalkidiki peninsula northern greece was selected as the study area fig 1 the basin extends over an area of about 127 km2 while its mean topographic elevation is about 176 m above sea level and its mean slope is about 12 the climate of the study area which is divided into two sub regions the flat area in the south 53 7 and the hilly area in the north 46 3 is semi arid to humid typically mediterranean with an average annual precipitation of 417 mm for the flat area and 504 mm for the hilly one almost 76 of the study area is used as agricultural land 20 is woodland mostly in the northern part and the remaining 4 accounts for urban and touristic development in terms of geology most of the region belongs to the peonia geologic zone and more specifically to the moudania geologic formation which is part of the neogene sediments located in western chalkidiki and is mainly composed of alternated beds of sandstones conglomerates sands silts and red to brick red clays moreover quaternary sediments consisting primarily of alluvial deposits gravels sands and clays and secondarily of terrace systems pebbles sands gravels and clays are detected in the region finally a small portion of nea moudania basin in the north east lies within the circum rhodope belt where rocky formations e g epigneisses greenschists dunites peridotites gabbro are located latinopoulos 2003 syridis 1990 fig 2 of the aforementioned geological formations loose formations and especially the neogene sediments moudania formation are of greater hydrological interest due to their great extension their considerable thickness and their high water storage capacity under natural conditions the nea moudania aquifer is a semi confined aquifer system which comprises various successive water bearing layers separated by lenses of semi permeable or impermeable materials nevertheless the large amount of private and municipal wells operating in the region have caused substantial decline of groundwater levels thus creating phreatic conditions in several locations especially in the central part of the study area siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 in general the nea moudania aquifer is characterized by a net deficit in its water balance since total water demand exceeds natural recharge due to this fact continuous decline of groundwater levels through the entire aquifer system is observed and especially in the central part of it where the bulk of pumpage is accumulated furthermore the study area is marked by significant degradation of groundwater quality nitrate contamination due to intensive farming activities along with seawater intrusion caused by groundwater over exploitation conditions are among the primary sources of pollution of the nea moudania aquifer siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 therefore the protection of both the quantitative and qualitative status of the aquifer under study by implementing effective measures is considered of utmost importance 3 methodology and data 3 1 general methodological framework the methodology developed in the present study aims to a investigate the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability i e quantify its changes over time under various pumping scenarios as a result of groundwater depth spatio temporal variation b determine the relationship between groundwater vulnerability change and groundwater pumping reduction and c provide the best management option with regards to the reduction of groundwater abstractions i e optimal pumping reduction rate by considering both quantitative i e groundwater levels and qualitative i e groundwater vulnerability aspects more analytically the methodological framework developed in this study comprises the following steps fig 3 step 1 building a transient groundwater flow model to study the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater depth d under various pumping scenarios as well as to obtain both current and projected for each scenario depth values for the drastic model in addition the flow model was used for providing the values of other drastic parameters as well such as net recharge r and hydraulic conductivity c both of which constitute main input parameters of the model in this case the results of the adjustment of the aforementioned parameters through the flow model calibration process were used in the drastic model step 2 applying the drastic model in a gis environment to estimate current groundwater vulnerability baseline period as well as to forecast future groundwater vulnerability under various pumping scenarios in the former case current groundwater depth values from step 1 corresponding to the beginning of the flow model s projection period were introduced in the drastic model while in the latter case projected groundwater depth values from step 1 for each scenario referring to the end of the flow model s projection period were used moreover comparison of future for each scenario and current vulnerability patterns was carried out in order to determine vulnerability changes between these certain time periods step 3 applying regression analysis in order to a form a mathematical function expressing the degree of relationship between groundwater vulnerability changes from step 2 and pumping reduction rates and b define the optimal pumping reduction rate under which no discrepancies between current and future groundwater vulnerability patterns are observed 3 2 groundwater flow model in the present study a calibrated validated transient groundwater flow and transport model already developed for the study area siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 was employed in order to determine both current and future groundwater depth patterns the latter under various pumping scenarios as well as to get the values for certain drastic parameters e g groundwater depth net recharge hydraulic conductivity this coupled flow and transport model was built in an effort to simulate seawater intrusion in the study area by applying the seawat code guo and langevin 2002 thus taking into consideration the effects of density variations on groundwater flow due to variations in solute concentrations chloride concentrations in particular detailed analysis of the modeling procedure including the construction and calibration validation of the coupled model is provided in siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 and thus is not repeated here furthermore such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present study which is mainly focused on the coupling between the groundwater flow and transport model and the drastic model however in the following the key elements of both the aquifer conceptual model and the flow simulation are presented siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 i the aquifer under study comprises the major part of the neogene sediments located in the region moudania formation while its boundaries match the boundaries of the nea moudania basin apart from the northern boundary which was defined on the basis of the piezometric conditions existing in the area fig 2 ii the various successive permeable stratigraphic layers form a single unified system with a uniform thickness of 250 m iii the aquifer s eastern and western boundaries are considered as no flow boundaries while the southern and northern boundaries are assigned as constant head boundary chb h 0 m and general head boundary ghb h 150 m respectively fig 4 regarding the latter hydraulic head values along the boundary decrease over time according to the overall hydraulic head decline observed in the region iv the study area is divided into six distinct zones fig 4 based on a few pumping tests conducted in individual wells latinopoulos 2003 each of these zones is assigned a different hydraulic parameter value e g hydraulic conductivity storativity effective porosity v the aquifer is primarily recharged by rainfall irrigation return flows and losses from both water supply and wastewater networks and secondarily from the south and north boundaries while the groundwater is abstracted through a large number of abstraction wells to meet irrigation domestic and livestock needs vi the spatial discretization of the numerical model involves the construction of a regularly spaced single layer grid with equal sized cells in the horizontal plane 100 m side and vii the temporal discretization of the numerical model involves a 33 year simulation period 2001 2034 and a 20 year projection period 2014 2034 meaning that current groundwater depth and vulnerability patterns refer to the year 2014 validation period of the coupled flow and transport model while future groundwater depth and vulnerability patterns refer to the year 2034 to determine the impact of groundwater pumping reduction on groundwater vulnerability a number of alternative scenarios were formed and simulated by applying the transient flow and transport model in these scenarios the pumping rates of irrigation wells operating in the study area were either maintained at current levels do nothing scenario s0 as defined during the model calibration validation procedure or reduced in relation to current pumping rates by certain rates management scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 more specifically in scenario 1 s1 the pumping rates of all irrigation wells were reduced by 10 in scenario 2 s2 by 20 in scenario 3 s3 by 30 and in scenario 4 s4 by 40 the rationale of this choice lies on the fact that in the present study it is aimed not to develop distinct spatial allocations of water use quotas for the reference area e g latinopoulos and siarkos 2014 latinopoulos et al 2011 but rather to investigate how groundwater vulnerability is generally influenced by groundwater pumping reduction 3 3 groundwater vulnerability assessment to assess both current and future groundwater vulnerability and therefore investigate its spatio temporal variation the drastic model eq 1 was employed each of the drastic factors was assigned ratings indicating the relative importance of data values within each factor and weights reflecting the relative importance of each factor in estimating groundwater vulnerability li and merchant 2013 merchant 1994 more analytically each drastic factor after being determined was divided either into numerical ranges for quantitative parameters or media types for qualitative parameters which were then rated on the grounds that higher ratings are assigned to the ranges or types indicating higher probability of contaminants reaching the aquifer in general the ratings assigned in the present study were similar to the typical ratings suggested in the original drastic method aller et al 1987 however the ratings of the d and c parameters have been properly adjusted to consider the full variability of these two parameters as defined in the present study in table 1 the ranges or types and ratings of the seven drastic parameters are presented with regards to the weights assigned to the drastic parameters they were adopted from the original drastic method aller et al 1987 table 2 after defining both ratings and weights the vulnerability index vi was calculated using the equation 1 vi d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r where d r a s t i c represent the seven parameters as defined earlier and the subscripts r and w are the corresponding ratings and weight coefficients the implementation of the drastic model was performed in a gis environment for each parameter involved in the drastic model digital geospatial data layers were formed in a raster grid format using the grid of the flow and transport model i e 100 m 100 m cells in the case of the d parameter data layers both for the baseline and future time periods were created since this parameter changes during the projection period under the various pumping scenarios with regards to the other drastic parameters the same data layers were used for both time periods which actually means that net recharge was considered constant during the projection period the rationale of this assumption lies on the fact that in the present study it is aimed to a exclusively investigate the impact of a crucial anthropogenic factor such as groundwater pumping on groundwater depth and hence on groundwater vulnerability since it is the dominant factor controlling groundwater flow regimes especially in over exploited aquifers while creating high fluctuations i e increase or decrease in hydraulic heads especially in the vicinity of the wells jia et al 2020 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 and b exclude climate projections i e regarding future precipitation and temperature patterns since they are generally characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and vary significantly among the different climate change models bloomfield et al 2006 li and merchant 2013 for constructing all drastic parameters gis layers the results of the groundwater flow and transport model along with data related to the topography geology and hydrogeology of the area under study were used more analytically the depth to water table d was computed by a subtracting the water table elevations produced by the flow and transport model from the ground surface elevations regarding the part of the aquifer being under unconfined conditions and b subtracting the aquifer s upper limit elevations from the ground surface elevations regarding the part of the aquifer being under semi confined conditions the net recharge r and the hydraulic conductivity c both being important input parameters of the flow and transport model were obtained from it after being properly adjusted and improved during the model calibration validation procedure the aquifer media a and the impact of the vadose zone i were determined taking into consideration the geological background of the study area fig 2 the soil type s was specified taking into account the particle size analysis results of several shallow depth 0 30 cm samples obtained from a soil survey in the study area misopolinos et al 2015 while creating thiessen polygons from the sample points and the surface slope t was calculated using a topographic map generated by digitizing contours from several continuous hellenic military geographical service hmgs map sheets with a 20 m contour line interval next ratings and weights were assigned to each parameter and the final vulnerability index was calculated both for the baseline and future periods the latter under the various pumping scenarios by overlaying the corresponding parameter maps and using eq 1 the vulnerability index calculated in each case was converted into three qualitative vulnerability categories i e low medium high with certain intervals based both on the range of the vulnerability index and the grading method applied for the classification in all cases the quantile classification scheme was utilized jaunat et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 finally in order to quantify groundwater vulnerability s changes between baseline and future time periods projected groundwater vulnerability patterns for each pumping scenario were compared with current ones baseline period particularly the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories i e low moderate and high between each pumping scenario and the baseline period was calculated and mapped to achieve this a method first proposed by brindha and elango 2015 was applied more specifically for all vulnerability maps produced both for the baseline period and future scenarios a numerical classification was used with a score of 1 for the low vulnerability class of 2 for the moderate vulnerability class and of 3 for the high vulnerability class the resulting map referring to the baseline period was then subtracted from each one of the resulting maps referring to various pumping scenarios thus allowing for both quantifying and spatially localizing the vulnerability s changes between baseline and future periods 3 4 regression analysis with the aim of inferring the relationship between groundwater pumping reduction and vulnerability s changes and defining the optimal pumping reduction rate under which no changes between current and future vulnerability patters are observed regression analysis was conducted by applying the straightforward steps noted below a initially a scatter diagram based on the results of the comparison between current and future vulnerability patterns for each pumping scenario was created in this diagram pumping reduction rates treated as the independent variable x were plotted against changes in groundwater vulnerability treated as the dependent variable y and particularly expressed as the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories i e low moderate and high between each pumping scenario and the baseline period b then the equation that best fits the data and therefore expresses the relationship between the two aforementioned variables was estimated and the corresponding curve was plotted to this task various curve fittings were examined e g simple linear and quadratic and evaluated by calculating r squared values c finally the pumping reduction rate resulting in no changes in groundwater vulnerability for the time period under consideration was calculated by setting the equation of the fitted curve equal to zero that is when the fitted curve intersects the x axis furthermore in order to validate and prove the usefulness of the equation defined a new pumping scenario in which the pumping rates of all irrigation wells were reduced by the estimated value was formed scenario 5 and a new future vulnerability map was created the new vulnerability map was then compared with the current vulnerability map and the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories between the two maps was again determined and mapped 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater flow model in this section the results of the transient flow model regarding the groundwater depth spatial distribution are presented and discussed since the present study focuses on investigating groundwater vulnerability variation due to variation in groundwater depth fig 5 shows the changes between projected for each alternative scenario and current groundwater depth values baseline period evidently under scenarios 0 do nothing scenario and 1 10 pumping reduction an increase in groundwater depth values with a mean value of 5 6 m and 2 5 m respectively over the entire study area is observed due to the decrease in groundwater levels with respect to scenarios 2 3 and 4 a decrease in groundwater depth values with a mean value of 0 5 m 3 4 m and 6 2 m respectively is generally observed especially in the central part of the study area where 50 of the total abstractions is located however it should be noted that under all three aforementioned scenarios an increase of groundwater depth is also observed this increase which is totally detected in the far north of the reference area is most likely attributable to the combination of the hydraulic head values assigned to the aquifer s northern boundary during the projection period and the relatively small number of wells operating in this part of the region 4 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment in this section the results of the comparison between projected 2034 for each alternative scenario and current 2014 groundwater vulnerability patterns i e the changes in groundwater vulnerability patterns between these certain time periods are presented and discussed firstly baseline and future for each scenario conditions of groundwater vulnerability are portrayed in fig 6 the greatest differences in vulnerability patterns among the various cases i e baseline period and future scenarios are mostly observed in the central part of the reference area where the greatest differences in groundwater depth values are noticed fig 5 next the results of the procedure followed in order to quantify the changes in vulnerability patterns between current period and future scenarios are depicted in fig 7 according to these results a difference of 1 red cells indicates that the calculated vulnerability increases by 1 class e g from moderate to high a difference of 1 green cells indicates that it decreases by 1 class e g from high to moderate while a difference of 0 grey cells indicates that the subtracted maps exhibit no alteration in fig 7 the percentage changes in area of different vulnerability categories between each pumping scenario and the baseline period which are used in the regression analysis are also provided groundwater vulnerability displays small changes through the study area under all future scenarios since in all cases the no difference area grey cells occupies the majority of the region 90 the greatest changes are projected to occur in the central part of the reference area where the greatest changes in groundwater depth are observed fig 5 in addition groundwater vulnerability depending on groundwater depth variation during the projection period does not similarly vary under all applied scenarios on the one hand under scenarios 0 and 1 future vulnerability decreases in relation to current vulnerability green cells as a result of the increase in groundwater depth in this case the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories which is used in the regression analysis equals 6 5 and 2 4 for scenarios 0 and 1 respectively on the other hand under scenarios 2 3 and 4 future vulnerability mainly increases in relation to current vulnerability red cells especially in the central part of the study area due to the decrease in groundwater depth however as it is shown in fig 7 under all three aforementioned scenarios vulnerability seems to slightly decrease as well since green cells also appear this decrease in vulnerability is exclusively detected in the northern part of the region where groundwater depth increases during the projection period fig 5 therefore in the case of scenarios 2 3 and 4 both groundwater vulnerability s increase and decrease should be taken into consideration in order to define its overall change through the study area under this condition the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories which is used in the regression analysis equals 1 3 4 2 and 6 3 for scenarios 2 3 and 4 respectively 4 3 regression analysis a quadratic regression produces the curve of best fit that best describes the relationship between pumping reduction rates independent variable x and percentage change in the vulnerability categories dependent variable y between each pumping scenario and the baseline period the equation of the curve of best fit produced is provided below eq 2 2 v u l n e r a b i l i t y c h a n g e 0 0029 p u m p i n g r e d u c t i o n r a t e 2 0 447 p u m p i n g r e d u c t i o n r a t e 6 5575 eq 2 accurately describes the relationship between the two variables as the estimated r squared value is almost equal to one r2 0 9999 the same conclusion also derives from the graphical representation of the data fig 8 the above equation produces an estimation of the overall groundwater vulnerability changes for any pumping reduction rate this estimation can be useful for a performing an initial evaluation of pumping reduction policies that consider a uniform decrease of withdrawals through an area of interest from a qualitative point of view and b defining the optimal reduction rate under which no discrepancies between current and future vulnerability are observed therefore following the above reasoning the optimal pumping reduction rate resulting by equating eq 2 to zero was found equal to 16 4 scenario 5 in fig 9 the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories between scenario 5 and the baseline period is shown under this scenario groundwater vulnerability slightly increases in the central part of the study area 0 9 of the study area becomes more vulnerable red cells whilst it slightly decreases in the north part 0 9 of the study area becomes less vulnerable green cells however since areas becoming more vulnerable are equal to areas becoming less vulnerable no overall change in vulnerability through the study area during the projection period is observed that is 0 9 0 9 0 thus confirming the validity of the equation defined 5 conclusions the present study attempted to develop a methodology that would be able to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate in the case of over exploited and contaminated aquifers by considering not only quantitative aspects i e groundwater levels but qualitative as well through the incorporation of groundwater vulnerability into the analysis in this framework a dynamic and time dependent modeling approach including the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a groundwater flow model was initially developed to determine changes between current and future vulnerability patterns under various pumping scenarios to test the methodology five different scenarios in which pumping rates were either maintained at current levels do nothing scenario s0 or reduced by certain rates management scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 were considered subsequently a regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction the knowledge of this relationship can be useful for the initial evaluation of pumping reduction policies and the estimation of the reduction rate under which no changes in vulnerability over time are observed i e of the optimal reduction rate in our case groundwater vulnerability exhibits small changes during the projection period under all future scenarios while decreasing for 0 and 10 reduction of withdrawals and increasing for 20 30 and 40 reduction this pattern was identified and described through the regression analysis and it was found that a specific quadratic equation accurately describes the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction r2 0 999 through this equation an optimal pumping reduction rate of 16 4 was estimated meaning that under higher reduction rates an increase in future groundwater pollution potential in relation to the current one is projected to occur by confirming that under the estimated pumping reduction rate no vulnerability change during the projection period is observed the validity of the equation defined was affirmed in conclusion this study provides useful insights concerning the potential effects of anthropogenic factors such as groundwater abstractions on groundwater vulnerability while it helps groundwater resources managers and decision makers in developing adequate pumping reduction policies promoting both sufficient quantity and good quality of water future research should include testing the proposed methodology in other locales and under different hydrogeological environments in addition it would be of great interest to implement the proposed methodology in a more generic fashion by including in the analysis factors other than groundwater withdrawals either natural factors such as climate variability and or climate change or anthropogenic factors such as land use conditions finally it is recommended that the impact of spatially allocated pumping reduction measures on groundwater vulnerability be investigated in order to incorporate the socio economic aspects of pumping reduction in the vulnerability assessment credit authorship contribution statement ilias siarkos conceptualization

vulnerability variation over time due to groundwater depth variation caused by pumping reduction is an issue of great interest that should be properly investigated this is because pumping reduction results in groundwater level increase on the one hand and groundwater vulnerability increase as a result of groundwater depth decrease on the other hand in this context the present study introduces a novel approach which considers the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability and at the same time focuses on the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate i e the highest rate of pumping reduction under which the highest increase in groundwater levels occurs without an increase in groundwater vulnerability taking place in over exploited and contaminated aquifers in a first stage a dynamic and time dependent approach involving the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a groundwater flow model was developed in order to determine groundwater vulnerability changes under different pumping reduction rates 0 10 20 30 and 40 and thus to produce the necessary data sets for investigating their relationship subsequently regression analysis was conducted to define this relationship and estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate our implementation of the methodology showed that groundwater vulnerability displays small changes during the projection period for all reduction rates while decreasing for 0 and 10 reduction of withdrawals and increasing for 20 30 and 40 reduction after finding that a quadratic equation accurately describes the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction r2 0 999 an optimal reduction rate of 16 4 was estimated by confirming that no change in vulnerability occurs under this value during the projection period the validity of the equation defined was affirmed keywords groundwater vulnerability assessment groundwater resources management drastic model groundwater modeling regression analysis greece 1 introduction groundwater is a vital water resource for preserving human life and sustaining ecosystems function as well as for meeting the various water needs and supporting socio economic development in many regions around the world aslam et al 2018 babiker et al 2005 ouedraogo et al 2016 nowadays however extensive degradation of groundwater resources quantity and quality is observed due to rapid population growth intensive commercial agricultural and industrial activities and non proper management khosravi et al 2018 muhammad et al 2015 shrestha et al 2017 the issue of groundwater quality deterioration is considered of crucial significance because on the one hand groundwater resources constitute the final receivers of various hazardous substances residues and derivatives of numerous human activities and on the other hand they are hard to restore in case of being polluted huan et al 2012 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2016 shrestha et al 2017 in addition groundwater pollution leads to the reduction of the exploitable amount of freshwater thus causing water scarcity problems abunada et al 2021 bear and cheng 2010 todd and mays 2005 it is then becoming clear that groundwater protection against various sources of pollution is considered essential especially when groundwater is intended for human consumption almasri 2008 moghaddam et al 2020 groundwater vulnerability assessment constitutes a primary but also an important step towards groundwater protection almasri 2008 brindha and elango 2015 hamza et al 2015 khosravi et al 2018 during recent decades intensive research upon groundwater vulnerability assessment has been carried out leading to the development of various methods that are generally classified into three categories a process based methods b statistical methods and c index overlay methods almasri 2008 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 yu et al 2010 chenini et al 2015 the most established method worldwide is drastic an index overlay method named for the seven factors considered in it i e d depth to groundwater r net recharge a aquifer media s soil media t topography i impact of the vadose zone c hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 not only due to the advantages characterizing the index overlay methods in general huan et al 2012 javadi et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 panagopoulos et al 2006 sinan and razack 2009 but also because of the following a it uses a considerable number of parameters seven parameters which reduces the likelihood of ignoring some critical parameters and limits the effect of errors or uncertainties of the individual parameters on the final outcome aslam et al 2018 mfonka et al 2018 ouedraogo et al 2016 panagopoulos et al 2006 and b it is quite flexible as it can be adapted to incorporate other parameters as well asfaw and mengistu 2020 javadi et al 2017 li and merchant 2013 lima et al 2011 sener and davraz 2013 such as land use e g arauzo 2017 li and merchant 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 pacheco et al 2018 aquifer thickness e g huan et al 2012 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2007 wu et al 2016 groundwater velocity e g huan et al 2012 jia et al 2019 sinan and razack 2009 stevenazzi et al 2015 hydraulic resistance e g kazakis and voudouris 2015 lineaments e g sener and davraz 2013 etc the drastic model has been used in many studies worldwide to assess groundwater vulnerability both in the case of unconfined and confined aquifers e g abunada et al 2021 almasri 2008 barzegar et al 2019 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2018 ouedraogo et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 zghibi et al 2016 in most cases the drastic model has been implemented based on static conditions i e the model assesses vulnerability for a single point in time based on current conditions and without taking into consideration the time variation of certain parameters involved in vulnerability assessment i e groundwater depth net recharge which leads to vulnerability s time variation as well i e to changes in vulnerability s score and spatial distribution over time aslam et al 2018 butscher and huggenberger 2009 li and merchant 2013 ouedraogo et al 2016 however not properly investigating groundwater vulnerability s changes over time may result in misleading decisions concerning future land use planning as well as the implementation of groundwater protection policies therefore it is necessary to do as much research as possible to investigate the temporal variations or trends of groundwater vulnerability when factors change in status stevenazzi et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2012 groundwater depth one of the most important parameters in groundwater vulnerability assessment aller et al 1987 hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 is included among the drastic factors that vary over time according to the existing climate conditions and pumping schemes any changes in climate conditions and or groundwater pumping may cause to a greater or lesser extent changes in groundwater depth s spatio temporal evolution due to its strong dependence on groundwater depth groundwater vulnerability is influenced by such changes as well hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 green et al 2011 li and merchant 2013 scibek and allen 2006 previous studies have shown that groundwater vulnerability may vary over time due to changing climate e g butscher and huggenberger 2009 hua et al 2020 huang et al 2017 li and merchant 2013 luoma et al 2017 however based on the literature review in the field of groundwater vulnerability what is generally missing and should be investigated is how and to what extent groundwater vulnerability varies over time due to groundwater pumping schemes modifications and especially pumping reduction reducing groundwater withdrawals is a practice frequently applied in regions characterized by over exploitation conditions in an effort to reduce groundwater outflows and protect groundwater reserves from depletion ahmed and umar 2009 jia et al 2020 pisinaras et al 2007 however reduction of groundwater pumping actually results in an increase of groundwater levels which in turn decreases the depth to groundwater thus rendering the aquifer more vulnerable to pollution hao et al 2017 luoma et al 2017 as it is obvious even though pumping reduction leads to the preservation of groundwater reserves i e quantitative aspects it may adversely affect groundwater vulnerability to pollution i e qualitative aspects it is then prudent according to the principles of integrated water resources management to strike a balance between the increase of groundwater levels on the one hand and the increase of groundwater pollution potential on the other hand when planning and implementing pumping reduction policies in other words the optimal pumping reduction rate which is actually defined as the highest rate of pumping reduction under which the highest increase in groundwater levels occurs without an increase in groundwater vulnerability taking place should be determined in this perspective the present study incorporates a novel approach which considers the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability and at the same time focuses on the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction in order to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate in regions where degradation of both groundwater quantity and quality is observed the proposed methodology constitutes a generic methodology applicable to properly and effectively managing groundwater resources in the aforementioned regions while its case specific implementation seeks to define the optimal pumping reduction rate for the study area considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects the first objective of the study was to determine groundwater vulnerability s changes as a result of groundwater depth variation under various pumping scenarios and more specifically under either maintaining pumping rates at current levels do nothing scenario or reducing them by certain rates management scenarios in other words it was aimed to produce the necessary data sets associated with vulnerability s changes under various pumping reduction rates with the intention of establishing a relationship between the aforementioned parameters to achieve this a dynamic and time dependent modeling approach for groundwater vulnerability assessment that includes the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a transient groundwater flow model was developed in general the coupling between a vulnerability assessment model and a flow model has been applied in previous studies as well e g almarsi 2008 ghouili et al 2021 luoma et al 2017 nixdorf et al 2017 voutchkova et al 2021 witkowski et al 2003 in these studies either a steady state or a transient flow model was developed in order to quantify the depth to water d parameter for improving the vulnerability model however no study so far has performed the coupling between the vulnerability and the flow models in order to investigate the relationship between a specific characteristic of a groundwater system related to groundwater quality i e groundwater vulnerability and a crucial anthropogenic factor associated with groundwater quantity i e groundwater withdrawals the next objective was to infer the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction with the aim of forming a mathematical function associating the aforementioned variables to this task a regression analysis was performed and the curve of best fit along with its equation were defined in our analysis pumping reduction rates starting from 0 and ending at 40 were treated as the independent variable x while vulnerability changes i e decrease and or increase were treated as the dependent variable y finally the defined function allowed for achieving the ultimate goal of this study which is to determine the optimal pumping reduction rate the estimated value was also used in order to test the validity of the equation formed consequently the aim of this study is not to improve a drastic model through its coupling with a groundwater flow model for assessing groundwater vulnerability to pollution in an area of interest on the contrary its aim is to take advantage of this coupling in order to provide groundwater resources managers and decision makers with a useful tool for developing adequate pumping reduction policies which promote both sufficient quantity and good quality of water 2 study area τhe hydrological basin of nea moudania located in the south western part of the chalkidiki peninsula northern greece was selected as the study area fig 1 the basin extends over an area of about 127 km2 while its mean topographic elevation is about 176 m above sea level and its mean slope is about 12 the climate of the study area which is divided into two sub regions the flat area in the south 53 7 and the hilly area in the north 46 3 is semi arid to humid typically mediterranean with an average annual precipitation of 417 mm for the flat area and 504 mm for the hilly one almost 76 of the study area is used as agricultural land 20 is woodland mostly in the northern part and the remaining 4 accounts for urban and touristic development in terms of geology most of the region belongs to the peonia geologic zone and more specifically to the moudania geologic formation which is part of the neogene sediments located in western chalkidiki and is mainly composed of alternated beds of sandstones conglomerates sands silts and red to brick red clays moreover quaternary sediments consisting primarily of alluvial deposits gravels sands and clays and secondarily of terrace systems pebbles sands gravels and clays are detected in the region finally a small portion of nea moudania basin in the north east lies within the circum rhodope belt where rocky formations e g epigneisses greenschists dunites peridotites gabbro are located latinopoulos 2003 syridis 1990 fig 2 of the aforementioned geological formations loose formations and especially the neogene sediments moudania formation are of greater hydrological interest due to their great extension their considerable thickness and their high water storage capacity under natural conditions the nea moudania aquifer is a semi confined aquifer system which comprises various successive water bearing layers separated by lenses of semi permeable or impermeable materials nevertheless the large amount of private and municipal wells operating in the region have caused substantial decline of groundwater levels thus creating phreatic conditions in several locations especially in the central part of the study area siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 in general the nea moudania aquifer is characterized by a net deficit in its water balance since total water demand exceeds natural recharge due to this fact continuous decline of groundwater levels through the entire aquifer system is observed and especially in the central part of it where the bulk of pumpage is accumulated furthermore the study area is marked by significant degradation of groundwater quality nitrate contamination due to intensive farming activities along with seawater intrusion caused by groundwater over exploitation conditions are among the primary sources of pollution of the nea moudania aquifer siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 therefore the protection of both the quantitative and qualitative status of the aquifer under study by implementing effective measures is considered of utmost importance 3 methodology and data 3 1 general methodological framework the methodology developed in the present study aims to a investigate the spatio temporal variation of groundwater vulnerability i e quantify its changes over time under various pumping scenarios as a result of groundwater depth spatio temporal variation b determine the relationship between groundwater vulnerability change and groundwater pumping reduction and c provide the best management option with regards to the reduction of groundwater abstractions i e optimal pumping reduction rate by considering both quantitative i e groundwater levels and qualitative i e groundwater vulnerability aspects more analytically the methodological framework developed in this study comprises the following steps fig 3 step 1 building a transient groundwater flow model to study the spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater depth d under various pumping scenarios as well as to obtain both current and projected for each scenario depth values for the drastic model in addition the flow model was used for providing the values of other drastic parameters as well such as net recharge r and hydraulic conductivity c both of which constitute main input parameters of the model in this case the results of the adjustment of the aforementioned parameters through the flow model calibration process were used in the drastic model step 2 applying the drastic model in a gis environment to estimate current groundwater vulnerability baseline period as well as to forecast future groundwater vulnerability under various pumping scenarios in the former case current groundwater depth values from step 1 corresponding to the beginning of the flow model s projection period were introduced in the drastic model while in the latter case projected groundwater depth values from step 1 for each scenario referring to the end of the flow model s projection period were used moreover comparison of future for each scenario and current vulnerability patterns was carried out in order to determine vulnerability changes between these certain time periods step 3 applying regression analysis in order to a form a mathematical function expressing the degree of relationship between groundwater vulnerability changes from step 2 and pumping reduction rates and b define the optimal pumping reduction rate under which no discrepancies between current and future groundwater vulnerability patterns are observed 3 2 groundwater flow model in the present study a calibrated validated transient groundwater flow and transport model already developed for the study area siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 was employed in order to determine both current and future groundwater depth patterns the latter under various pumping scenarios as well as to get the values for certain drastic parameters e g groundwater depth net recharge hydraulic conductivity this coupled flow and transport model was built in an effort to simulate seawater intrusion in the study area by applying the seawat code guo and langevin 2002 thus taking into consideration the effects of density variations on groundwater flow due to variations in solute concentrations chloride concentrations in particular detailed analysis of the modeling procedure including the construction and calibration validation of the coupled model is provided in siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 siarkos et al 2017 and thus is not repeated here furthermore such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present study which is mainly focused on the coupling between the groundwater flow and transport model and the drastic model however in the following the key elements of both the aquifer conceptual model and the flow simulation are presented siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 i the aquifer under study comprises the major part of the neogene sediments located in the region moudania formation while its boundaries match the boundaries of the nea moudania basin apart from the northern boundary which was defined on the basis of the piezometric conditions existing in the area fig 2 ii the various successive permeable stratigraphic layers form a single unified system with a uniform thickness of 250 m iii the aquifer s eastern and western boundaries are considered as no flow boundaries while the southern and northern boundaries are assigned as constant head boundary chb h 0 m and general head boundary ghb h 150 m respectively fig 4 regarding the latter hydraulic head values along the boundary decrease over time according to the overall hydraulic head decline observed in the region iv the study area is divided into six distinct zones fig 4 based on a few pumping tests conducted in individual wells latinopoulos 2003 each of these zones is assigned a different hydraulic parameter value e g hydraulic conductivity storativity effective porosity v the aquifer is primarily recharged by rainfall irrigation return flows and losses from both water supply and wastewater networks and secondarily from the south and north boundaries while the groundwater is abstracted through a large number of abstraction wells to meet irrigation domestic and livestock needs vi the spatial discretization of the numerical model involves the construction of a regularly spaced single layer grid with equal sized cells in the horizontal plane 100 m side and vii the temporal discretization of the numerical model involves a 33 year simulation period 2001 2034 and a 20 year projection period 2014 2034 meaning that current groundwater depth and vulnerability patterns refer to the year 2014 validation period of the coupled flow and transport model while future groundwater depth and vulnerability patterns refer to the year 2034 to determine the impact of groundwater pumping reduction on groundwater vulnerability a number of alternative scenarios were formed and simulated by applying the transient flow and transport model in these scenarios the pumping rates of irrigation wells operating in the study area were either maintained at current levels do nothing scenario s0 as defined during the model calibration validation procedure or reduced in relation to current pumping rates by certain rates management scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 more specifically in scenario 1 s1 the pumping rates of all irrigation wells were reduced by 10 in scenario 2 s2 by 20 in scenario 3 s3 by 30 and in scenario 4 s4 by 40 the rationale of this choice lies on the fact that in the present study it is aimed not to develop distinct spatial allocations of water use quotas for the reference area e g latinopoulos and siarkos 2014 latinopoulos et al 2011 but rather to investigate how groundwater vulnerability is generally influenced by groundwater pumping reduction 3 3 groundwater vulnerability assessment to assess both current and future groundwater vulnerability and therefore investigate its spatio temporal variation the drastic model eq 1 was employed each of the drastic factors was assigned ratings indicating the relative importance of data values within each factor and weights reflecting the relative importance of each factor in estimating groundwater vulnerability li and merchant 2013 merchant 1994 more analytically each drastic factor after being determined was divided either into numerical ranges for quantitative parameters or media types for qualitative parameters which were then rated on the grounds that higher ratings are assigned to the ranges or types indicating higher probability of contaminants reaching the aquifer in general the ratings assigned in the present study were similar to the typical ratings suggested in the original drastic method aller et al 1987 however the ratings of the d and c parameters have been properly adjusted to consider the full variability of these two parameters as defined in the present study in table 1 the ranges or types and ratings of the seven drastic parameters are presented with regards to the weights assigned to the drastic parameters they were adopted from the original drastic method aller et al 1987 table 2 after defining both ratings and weights the vulnerability index vi was calculated using the equation 1 vi d w d r r w r r a w a r s w s r t w t r i w i r c w c r where d r a s t i c represent the seven parameters as defined earlier and the subscripts r and w are the corresponding ratings and weight coefficients the implementation of the drastic model was performed in a gis environment for each parameter involved in the drastic model digital geospatial data layers were formed in a raster grid format using the grid of the flow and transport model i e 100 m 100 m cells in the case of the d parameter data layers both for the baseline and future time periods were created since this parameter changes during the projection period under the various pumping scenarios with regards to the other drastic parameters the same data layers were used for both time periods which actually means that net recharge was considered constant during the projection period the rationale of this assumption lies on the fact that in the present study it is aimed to a exclusively investigate the impact of a crucial anthropogenic factor such as groundwater pumping on groundwater depth and hence on groundwater vulnerability since it is the dominant factor controlling groundwater flow regimes especially in over exploited aquifers while creating high fluctuations i e increase or decrease in hydraulic heads especially in the vicinity of the wells jia et al 2020 siarkos and latinopoulos 2016 and b exclude climate projections i e regarding future precipitation and temperature patterns since they are generally characterized by a high degree of uncertainty and vary significantly among the different climate change models bloomfield et al 2006 li and merchant 2013 for constructing all drastic parameters gis layers the results of the groundwater flow and transport model along with data related to the topography geology and hydrogeology of the area under study were used more analytically the depth to water table d was computed by a subtracting the water table elevations produced by the flow and transport model from the ground surface elevations regarding the part of the aquifer being under unconfined conditions and b subtracting the aquifer s upper limit elevations from the ground surface elevations regarding the part of the aquifer being under semi confined conditions the net recharge r and the hydraulic conductivity c both being important input parameters of the flow and transport model were obtained from it after being properly adjusted and improved during the model calibration validation procedure the aquifer media a and the impact of the vadose zone i were determined taking into consideration the geological background of the study area fig 2 the soil type s was specified taking into account the particle size analysis results of several shallow depth 0 30 cm samples obtained from a soil survey in the study area misopolinos et al 2015 while creating thiessen polygons from the sample points and the surface slope t was calculated using a topographic map generated by digitizing contours from several continuous hellenic military geographical service hmgs map sheets with a 20 m contour line interval next ratings and weights were assigned to each parameter and the final vulnerability index was calculated both for the baseline and future periods the latter under the various pumping scenarios by overlaying the corresponding parameter maps and using eq 1 the vulnerability index calculated in each case was converted into three qualitative vulnerability categories i e low medium high with certain intervals based both on the range of the vulnerability index and the grading method applied for the classification in all cases the quantile classification scheme was utilized jaunat et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 finally in order to quantify groundwater vulnerability s changes between baseline and future time periods projected groundwater vulnerability patterns for each pumping scenario were compared with current ones baseline period particularly the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories i e low moderate and high between each pumping scenario and the baseline period was calculated and mapped to achieve this a method first proposed by brindha and elango 2015 was applied more specifically for all vulnerability maps produced both for the baseline period and future scenarios a numerical classification was used with a score of 1 for the low vulnerability class of 2 for the moderate vulnerability class and of 3 for the high vulnerability class the resulting map referring to the baseline period was then subtracted from each one of the resulting maps referring to various pumping scenarios thus allowing for both quantifying and spatially localizing the vulnerability s changes between baseline and future periods 3 4 regression analysis with the aim of inferring the relationship between groundwater pumping reduction and vulnerability s changes and defining the optimal pumping reduction rate under which no changes between current and future vulnerability patters are observed regression analysis was conducted by applying the straightforward steps noted below a initially a scatter diagram based on the results of the comparison between current and future vulnerability patterns for each pumping scenario was created in this diagram pumping reduction rates treated as the independent variable x were plotted against changes in groundwater vulnerability treated as the dependent variable y and particularly expressed as the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories i e low moderate and high between each pumping scenario and the baseline period b then the equation that best fits the data and therefore expresses the relationship between the two aforementioned variables was estimated and the corresponding curve was plotted to this task various curve fittings were examined e g simple linear and quadratic and evaluated by calculating r squared values c finally the pumping reduction rate resulting in no changes in groundwater vulnerability for the time period under consideration was calculated by setting the equation of the fitted curve equal to zero that is when the fitted curve intersects the x axis furthermore in order to validate and prove the usefulness of the equation defined a new pumping scenario in which the pumping rates of all irrigation wells were reduced by the estimated value was formed scenario 5 and a new future vulnerability map was created the new vulnerability map was then compared with the current vulnerability map and the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories between the two maps was again determined and mapped 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater flow model in this section the results of the transient flow model regarding the groundwater depth spatial distribution are presented and discussed since the present study focuses on investigating groundwater vulnerability variation due to variation in groundwater depth fig 5 shows the changes between projected for each alternative scenario and current groundwater depth values baseline period evidently under scenarios 0 do nothing scenario and 1 10 pumping reduction an increase in groundwater depth values with a mean value of 5 6 m and 2 5 m respectively over the entire study area is observed due to the decrease in groundwater levels with respect to scenarios 2 3 and 4 a decrease in groundwater depth values with a mean value of 0 5 m 3 4 m and 6 2 m respectively is generally observed especially in the central part of the study area where 50 of the total abstractions is located however it should be noted that under all three aforementioned scenarios an increase of groundwater depth is also observed this increase which is totally detected in the far north of the reference area is most likely attributable to the combination of the hydraulic head values assigned to the aquifer s northern boundary during the projection period and the relatively small number of wells operating in this part of the region 4 2 groundwater vulnerability assessment in this section the results of the comparison between projected 2034 for each alternative scenario and current 2014 groundwater vulnerability patterns i e the changes in groundwater vulnerability patterns between these certain time periods are presented and discussed firstly baseline and future for each scenario conditions of groundwater vulnerability are portrayed in fig 6 the greatest differences in vulnerability patterns among the various cases i e baseline period and future scenarios are mostly observed in the central part of the reference area where the greatest differences in groundwater depth values are noticed fig 5 next the results of the procedure followed in order to quantify the changes in vulnerability patterns between current period and future scenarios are depicted in fig 7 according to these results a difference of 1 red cells indicates that the calculated vulnerability increases by 1 class e g from moderate to high a difference of 1 green cells indicates that it decreases by 1 class e g from high to moderate while a difference of 0 grey cells indicates that the subtracted maps exhibit no alteration in fig 7 the percentage changes in area of different vulnerability categories between each pumping scenario and the baseline period which are used in the regression analysis are also provided groundwater vulnerability displays small changes through the study area under all future scenarios since in all cases the no difference area grey cells occupies the majority of the region 90 the greatest changes are projected to occur in the central part of the reference area where the greatest changes in groundwater depth are observed fig 5 in addition groundwater vulnerability depending on groundwater depth variation during the projection period does not similarly vary under all applied scenarios on the one hand under scenarios 0 and 1 future vulnerability decreases in relation to current vulnerability green cells as a result of the increase in groundwater depth in this case the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories which is used in the regression analysis equals 6 5 and 2 4 for scenarios 0 and 1 respectively on the other hand under scenarios 2 3 and 4 future vulnerability mainly increases in relation to current vulnerability red cells especially in the central part of the study area due to the decrease in groundwater depth however as it is shown in fig 7 under all three aforementioned scenarios vulnerability seems to slightly decrease as well since green cells also appear this decrease in vulnerability is exclusively detected in the northern part of the region where groundwater depth increases during the projection period fig 5 therefore in the case of scenarios 2 3 and 4 both groundwater vulnerability s increase and decrease should be taken into consideration in order to define its overall change through the study area under this condition the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories which is used in the regression analysis equals 1 3 4 2 and 6 3 for scenarios 2 3 and 4 respectively 4 3 regression analysis a quadratic regression produces the curve of best fit that best describes the relationship between pumping reduction rates independent variable x and percentage change in the vulnerability categories dependent variable y between each pumping scenario and the baseline period the equation of the curve of best fit produced is provided below eq 2 2 v u l n e r a b i l i t y c h a n g e 0 0029 p u m p i n g r e d u c t i o n r a t e 2 0 447 p u m p i n g r e d u c t i o n r a t e 6 5575 eq 2 accurately describes the relationship between the two variables as the estimated r squared value is almost equal to one r2 0 9999 the same conclusion also derives from the graphical representation of the data fig 8 the above equation produces an estimation of the overall groundwater vulnerability changes for any pumping reduction rate this estimation can be useful for a performing an initial evaluation of pumping reduction policies that consider a uniform decrease of withdrawals through an area of interest from a qualitative point of view and b defining the optimal reduction rate under which no discrepancies between current and future vulnerability are observed therefore following the above reasoning the optimal pumping reduction rate resulting by equating eq 2 to zero was found equal to 16 4 scenario 5 in fig 9 the percentage change in area of different vulnerability categories between scenario 5 and the baseline period is shown under this scenario groundwater vulnerability slightly increases in the central part of the study area 0 9 of the study area becomes more vulnerable red cells whilst it slightly decreases in the north part 0 9 of the study area becomes less vulnerable green cells however since areas becoming more vulnerable are equal to areas becoming less vulnerable no overall change in vulnerability through the study area during the projection period is observed that is 0 9 0 9 0 thus confirming the validity of the equation defined 5 conclusions the present study attempted to develop a methodology that would be able to estimate the optimal pumping reduction rate in the case of over exploited and contaminated aquifers by considering not only quantitative aspects i e groundwater levels but qualitative as well through the incorporation of groundwater vulnerability into the analysis in this framework a dynamic and time dependent modeling approach including the linkage between a gis based drastic model and a groundwater flow model was initially developed to determine changes between current and future vulnerability patterns under various pumping scenarios to test the methodology five different scenarios in which pumping rates were either maintained at current levels do nothing scenario s0 or reduced by certain rates management scenarios s1 s2 s3 and s4 were considered subsequently a regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction the knowledge of this relationship can be useful for the initial evaluation of pumping reduction policies and the estimation of the reduction rate under which no changes in vulnerability over time are observed i e of the optimal reduction rate in our case groundwater vulnerability exhibits small changes during the projection period under all future scenarios while decreasing for 0 and 10 reduction of withdrawals and increasing for 20 30 and 40 reduction this pattern was identified and described through the regression analysis and it was found that a specific quadratic equation accurately describes the relationship between vulnerability change and pumping reduction r2 0 999 through this equation an optimal pumping reduction rate of 16 4 was estimated meaning that under higher reduction rates an increase in future groundwater pollution potential in relation to the current one is projected to occur by confirming that under the estimated pumping reduction rate no vulnerability change during the projection period is observed the validity of the equation defined was affirmed in conclusion this study provides useful insights concerning the potential effects of anthropogenic factors such as groundwater abstractions on groundwater vulnerability while it helps groundwater resources managers and decision makers in developing adequate pumping reduction policies promoting both sufficient quantity and good quality of water future research should include testing the proposed methodology in other locales and under different hydrogeological environments in addition it would be of great interest to implement the proposed methodology in a more generic fashion by including in the analysis factors other than groundwater withdrawals either natural factors such as climate variability and or climate change or anthropogenic factors such as land use conditions finally it is recommended that the impact of spatially allocated pumping reduction measures on groundwater vulnerability be investigated in order to incorporate the socio economic aspects of pumping reduction in the vulnerability assessment credit authorship contribution statement ilias siarkos conceptualization

4558,a better understanding of the storm surge phenomenon is essential for coastal protection future planning and coastal ecosystem conservation using hourly sea level data from 15 tide gauges along the coastline of china the metrics skew surge and residual water level which are used to represent storm surges are compared in this study the relationship between residual water level skew surge and predicted high tide were analyzed using two statistical measurements the results showed that unlike the annual maximum residual water level the annual maximum skew surge and the astronomical high tide tended to coincide more frequently more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide thus the skew surge was more suitable than the residual water level for use in risk based coastal planning frameworks using the monthly maximum value and indices of the storm surge storm surge number duration and intensity we compared the performances of skew surge and residual water level in expressing changes of storm surges these two metrics can both capture changes in storm surge activities on seasonal decadal and long term scales and correlation coefficients of storm surge intensity between residual water level and skew surge were greater than 0 80 at 11 tide gauges at most tide gauges the skew surge was significantly correlated with 4 5 nearby tide gauges while the residual water level was correlated with only 1 2 tide gauges the skew surge may be a better metric for risk based coastal planning frameworks if the interpolation method is used the el niño southern oscillation enso can affect the storm surge frequency along the coastline of china the effects of the enso were more obvious when the residual water level was selected in conclusion the skew surge can be selected for use in risk based coastal planning frameworks while the residual water level may be a better metric for capturing the relationship between storm surges and climate changes keywords storm surge residual water level skew surge enso coastline of china 1 introduction the bulletin of china marine disaster 2018 shows that storm surge disasters caused 49 deaths and 11 1 billion chinese yuan in losses and affected 11 5 million people annually from 2000 to 2017 in china hallegatte et al 2013 classified the chinese coastal areas among the most vulnerable areas to storm surges under climate change in recent years growing concern regarding climate change has led to an increased prevalence of risk based coastal planning frameworks frihy and el sayed 2013 quinn et al 2014 pezza 2015 the accelerated sea level rise and changes in storm frequency and intensity are two major impacts expected to affect the coastal inundation risk bender et al 2010 harvey and nicholls 2008 previous studies have found that regional climatic variations such as el niño southern oscillation enso and north atlantic oscillation nao can significantly affect the frequency and intensity of storm surges marcos et al 2009 haigh et al 2010 menéndez and woodworth 2010 torres and tsimplis 2013 feng and tsimplis 2014 talke et al 2014 the accuracy of risk based coastal planning frameworks is highly dependent on the water level boundary conditions including the mean sea level astronomical tide and storm surge brown et al 2018 typically in the assessment of inundation risk storm surges are represented by the residual water level which is derived from the time series of sea level records by subtracting the predicted tide level although some storm surges or residual peaks can coincide with the highest astronomical tide williams et al 2016 assuming that any residual peak can occur at any high tide maximum in the predicted tide level can lead to an overestimation of the total water level because of the interaction between the tide and surge components horsburgh and wilson 2007 which may increase unnecessary costs in the risk based coastal planning frameworks many properties of the residual water level are only artifacts of small changes in the timing of predicted high water this tide surge interaction can lead to uncertainty in risk based coastal planning frameworks thereby posing problems to decision makers and project managers prime et al 2016 the tide surge interaction is more significant in shallow seas and estuaries which are usually at risk from storm surges e g east asia the european continental shelf and the canadian and northeastern usa coasts tide surge interactions have been extensively studied worldwide including in the north sea the river thames rossiter 1961 horsburgh and wilson 2007 the northeastern usa bernier and thompson 2007 bangladesh paul et al 2016 the coastline of china feng et al 2019 and the australian coast allen et al 2018 tide surge interactions result in residual water level peaks that tend to occur more often during the ebb and flood tide than at high tide horsburgh and wilson 2007 to solve this problem the skew surge which is the difference between the maximum observed sea level and the maximum predicted tide regardless of timing during the tidal cycle irrespective of the time of occurrence de vries et al 1995 fig 1 has become a more popular metric for use in storm surge studies in northwestern europe and the usa sterl et al 2009 howard et al 2010 wahl and chambers 2015 mawdsley and haigh 2016 williams et al 2016 in recent years previous researchers thought that variations in the skew surge height were independent of the tidal level therefore the skew surge approach reduces the risk of distorted results compared to that using the residual water level caused by timing errors in the data and tidal prediction however disputes also exist regarding the use of the skew surge for studying storm surges santamaria aguilar and vafeidis 2018 noted that extreme skew surges are not independent of the high tide level at some sites with mixed semidiurnal tidal regimes mawdsley and haigh 2016 found that there were large differences in the long term skew surge and residual water level trends at some tide gauges with a large tidal range more effort is needed to compare these two parameters for assessing storm surge activities china has the coastline more than 14 million kilometers storm surges that occur in china can be classified into two types tropical storm surges and extratropical storm surges yang 2000 in the bohai sea and the northern yellow sea cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones usually cause significant storm surges particularly in the winter half of the year feng et al 2016 in the southern yellow sea east china sea and south china sea typhoons often cause serious storm surges during summer and autumn feng and tsimplis 2014 in recent years more studies have begun to pay attention to the effects of climate change on storm surges along the coastline of china feng and tsimplis 2014 found that the enso can regulate the number of typhoons that make landfall in china oey and chou 2016 found evidence of a significant rise in the intensity and poleward shifting of location of typhoon surges in the western north pacific after the 1980 s there are also studies indicated that enso can affect the extratropical cyclones in the mid and high latitudes shapiro et al 2001 eichler and gottschalck 2013 lin and zhan 2000 indicated that when el niño occurred the sea surface temperature sst in the eastern equatorial pacific was warmer than that during la niña years and that more extratropical cyclones occurred in the bohai sea and yellow sea the number of extratropical cyclones reached peaks in 1972 1976 1979 1987 1990 and 1992 zhang et al 2019 found that the number of rapidly developing cyclones over the bohai yellow and east china seas was highly related to the underlying sst anomalies in the east china sea and japan sea hong et al 2001 indicated that the variation in sst anomalies in the japan sea is closely related to enso events and that el niño events would lead to a warmer winter in the japan sea currently most studies that focus on the temporal variability in storm surges from seasonal to long time scales are based on the residual water level menéndez and woodworth 2010 talke et al 2014 feng et al 2018a currently we did not identify any studies that used the skew surge to assess storm surge variations in this area because limited research has been conducted regarding storm surge variations using the skew surge along the coastline of china it is still uncertain whether the variations of storm surges assessed using the skew surge metric are the same as those determined using the residual water level in this region in addition it is also uncertain whether the skew surge can be used as an indicator that reflects the effects of regional climate change on storm surges therefore the objectives of this work were to 1 assess the relationship between the skew surge and the tide along the coastline of china 2 compare how the use of the skew surge or residual water level affect the assessment of storm surge activities and 3 determine whether the skew surge can represent the effects of regional climate change on storm surges the outline of this paper is as follows the datasets and methodology are briefly described in section 2 the results and discussions are presented in section 3 the conclusions are provided in the last section 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the tide gauge records used in this study were from marine monitoring stations along the coastline of china with 1985 national datum and 15 uniformly distributed tide gauges were sampled at hourly frequencies fig 2 table 1 the data range from 1958 to 2016 at the selected tide gauges and all tide gauges have more than 30 years of data with different starting time table 1 which is an appropriate amount from which to obtain trends in extremes feng et al 2015 all the data have been carefully quality controlled and missing values last for hours have been interpolated data with spurious jumps and time shifts were removed in addition years during which the data were less than 75 complete were excluded from the analysis the locations and detailed information of the tide gauges are shown in fig 2 and table 1 the best tracking data for the typhoons were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http tcdata typhoon org cn en zjljsjj zlhq html 2 2 methods the predicted tide levels were obtained by performing harmonic analyses of each calendar year of the tide gauge series using the t tide matlab package https www eoas ubc ca rich pawlowicz et al 2002 we used the standard set of 67 constituents the residual water level was obtained by subtracting the predicted tide from the observed water level fig 1 to obtain the skew surge the high tide level during every tide cycle were obtained firstly every high tide level was extracted by locating the turning points of the time series of the predicted tide mawdsley et al 2015 to ensure that we exactly obtained the high tide level in a mixed tidal regime the point was not selected if the predicted high tide level was less than 3 h away from the low tide then the difference between the observed water level and the nearest predicted high tide level over a tide cycle was calculated fig 1 the skew surge level was the maximum of the obtained time series as follows 2 2 ss m a x o b s i h t i 1 j where obs is the observed sea level during a tide cycle ht is the high tide level at this tide cycle and ss is the skew surge level at this tide cycle j was hours during a tide cycle two statistical measurements were used to assess the relationship between the skew surge and tide first we calculated the fraction of the annual maximum skew surge and residual water level that occurred at high tide respectively this was to statistic the fraction that the maximum water level occurred at the same time as the maximum predicted tide we used 1 h from the high tide second whether the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events followed the same distribution of all the high tides at the same tide gauge were assessed using the anderson darling test anderson and darling 1954 marsaglia 2004 if the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events presented the same distribution for all high tides then the magnitude of the extreme skew surge did not depend on the high tide level i e the skew surge could occur at any maxima tide level the monthly maxima of the skew surge and residual water level values were calculated to compare the seasonal variations to compare the decadal variations and the long term trends of the skew surge and residual water level the indices described by zhang et al 2000 were used as proxies for the intensity of the storm surges the indices are as follows 1 storm surge count the annual number of storm surges the residual water level skew surge level above a given threshold 2 storm surge duration the annual number of hours during which the storm surge levels were above a given threshold 3 storm surge intensity the annual total integral of the sea level curve above a given threshold here the threshold was set as the 99 level of the skew surge residual water level the significance of the trends and correlations identified in this study was carefully checked using t tests for correlations and mann kendall tests for trends von storch and zwiers 1999 feng et al 2015 the pre whitening method was used to avoid autocorrelations in the work kulkarni and von storch 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the skew surge and tide the percentage of the annual maximum skew surge or residual water level that occurred at high tide is shown in fig 3 results show that at 13 tide gauges less than 15 of the annual maximum residual water levels occurred at high tide blue bar moreover at qinhuangdao longkou rizhao dajishan zhenhai xiamen and haikou the percentage was less than 5 the percentage was higher at kanmen and shanwei about 15 and 25 respectively the skew surge results were very different from the residual water level results at huludao yantai rizhao lvsi dajishan zhenhai kanmen sansha and xiamen more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide the percentage was the highest at dajishan where approximately 94 37 out of 39 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide there were also some tide gauges qinhuangdao longkou shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai the annual max skew surge more often happened during the ebb or flood tide but the percentage of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide still ranged from 20 to 45 which was still much higher than that of the residual water level the results showed that the maximum skew surge more frequently occurred at high tide than during other periods above results indicated that a significant tide surge interaction exists at most tide gauges in surge risk assessment frameworks the maximum water level boundary conditions were usually a combination of the high tide level and maximum storm surge level lickley et al 2014 hsu et al 2018 as a result of tide surge interactions the maximum residual water level mostly occurred before after mostly 3 4 h the high tide fig 1 horsburgh and wilson 2007 feng et al 2018a allen et al 2018 which can lead to overestimations of the water level boundary conditions in contrast the maximum skew surge more frequently occurred at high tide than during other periods therefore the maximum water level boundary conditions will be more credible when using the skew surge for example the annual maximum residual water level was 1 07 m at xiamen in 2016 when the annual maximum skew surge was 0 47 m the maximum high tide is about 7 06 m when the residual water level was used the predicted maximum water level was 8 13 m however the observed maximum water level was 7 27 m the result of the skew surge was much better than the residual water level about 7 53 m the tides at many tide gauges showed semidiurnal and mixed semidiurnal characteristics at these tide gauges a tidal cycle consists of two unequal high tides in approximately a 24 h period the differences between higher high tide and lower high tide range from 0 15 rizhao to 1 2 zhapo at tide gauges with semidiurnal and mixed semidiurnal characteristics used in this work so it was also important to determine whether extreme skew surges happened at the higher high tide or lower high tide along the coastline of china the fraction of the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day was also calculated fig 3 the yellow bar the results show that at huludao rizhao dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen and zhapo the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 25 40 was less than that at the lower high tide the value of green bar minus the value of yellow bar the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 8 m 0 15 m 0 55 m 0 65 m 0 20 m 0 40 m and 1 2 m respectively at qinhuangdao shanwei haikou and beihai the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 75 100 was more than that at the lower high tide the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 17 m 1 0 m 0 35 m and 0 70 m respectively at longkou yantai and lvsi the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 40 60 and the annual maximum skew surge at the lower high tide showed little difference the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 55 m 0 34 m and 0 40 respectively the reason that extreme skew surges occurring time at higher high tide or lower high tide are supposed to be related to the tide type and topography at the tide gauges santamaria aguilar and vafeidis 2018 indicated that an interaction between the skew surge and tide existed at tide gauges located in a wide shallow continental shelf which made the extreme skew surges tend to occur during lower high tide therefore in the wide and shallow chinese continental shelf extreme skew surges should mainly occur at time of lower high tide such as stations huludao rizhao dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen and zhapo where the tidal types are semidiurnal tide however at stations qinhuangdao shanwei haikou and beihai their tidal types are mixed but primarily diurnal tides there are also some days that the tide has two high tide the proportion of higher high tide was much larger than that of lower high tide therefore extreme skew surges mainly occur at higher high tide at longkou yantai and lvsi the tidal types are mixed but primarily semidiurnal tides the number of higher high tide was larger than that of lower high tide but the differences was smaller than that of mixed but primarily diurnal tides so the occurrence differences of extreme skew surges between higher high tide and lower high tide was small but future research involving numerical model simulations is needed in order to better explore the dynamics of the interaction between extreme skew surge and tide the pdfs of all the high tides during the whole period and those high tide associated with the maximum skew surges were shown in fig 4 the results varied for different tide gauges at lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo the pdfs were consistent with each other for the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events and all high tides at huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen and beihai the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was lower than that of all high tides at kanmen and haikou the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was higher than that of all high tides these results therefore showed that at 9 out of 15 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen beihai kanmen and haikou the skew surges have tidal restriction where the extreme skew surge show high tide dependency the differences in the pdfs may be related to the locations of the tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen beihai and haikou are in semienclosed areas and lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo are located in exposed seas in the open continental shelf the aforementioned results indicate that using the skew surge is much better than using the residual water level for surge risk assessment frameworks engineers or decision makers can obtain more accurate water level conditions using skew surges instead of residual water levels if coastal planning frameworks are based on the statistical combination of a maximum predicted tide and a maximum surge where maximum in both cases is qualified by a specified statistical likelihood huang et al 2008 lin et al 2010 moreover because the skew surges at some tide gauges are not independent of the tide because of the tide skew surge interaction this metric should also be considered in practical applications 3 2 variations in storm surges the mean values of the monthly maximum skew surge and residual water level at 15 tide gauges were shown in fig 5 the results showed that pronounced seasonal variations exist at all the tide gauges along the coastline of china at huludao qinhuangdao longkou and yantai the storm surges were more serious from january to march and october to december where storm surges were mostly caused by cold air outbreaks and extratropical storms at rizhao lvsi dajishan and zhenhai the storm surges were more serious from january to march and august to december both typhoons and extratropical storms can cause storm surges at these four tide gauges at kanmen sansha xiamen shanwei zhaopo haikou and beihai the storm surges were mainly caused by typhoons the storm surges were more serious from july to october but the highest values occurred at different month due to the different locations the seasonal variations were similar at adjacent tide gauges the mean value of the monthly maximum skew surges was less than that of the residual water level at all the tide gauges the seasonal cycles in storm surge can be expressed by both the residual water level and the skew surge with correlation coefficient larger than 0 92 at 13 tide gauges there are also two tide gauges xiamen and beihai the differences especially during hurricane season between skew surge and residual water level are larger than others with the correlation about 0 86 and 0 88 respectively the annual storm surge intensities at the 15 tide gauges using the residual water level and skew surge above the 99 level were calculated and shown in fig 6 some common features existed between the skew surge and residual water level the interannual variability in the intensity was quite large for all tide gauges ranging from 15 to 25 h m the sizes of the interannual variability in the storm surge and mean sea level were at the same order of magnitude in these areas feng et al 2015 the skew surges and residual water levels showed similar interdecadal variations at most tide gauges except at xiamen and beihai where the interdecadal skew surge was smaller than the residual water level more than 15 h m the correlation coefficients between the residual water level and skew surge were all significant at the 95 confidence level the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 80 at 13 of the 15 tide gauges two tide gauges beihai and xiamen had correlation coefficients less than 0 50 the seasonal and interdecadal differences between residual water level and skew surge may be explained by the characteristics of the tide surge interactions at beihai and xiamen feng et al 2019 categorized the tide surge interaction process at tide gauges along the coastline of china into four distinct types phase alteration high water low water and long duration they found that because of the higher tide ranges at xiamen and beihai more residual water levels present phase alterations between sea levels and predicted tides while at most tide gauges along the coastline of china more residual water levels present long durations the residual is significant for two or more tide processes and a dip in the residual occurs during high tide under these circumstances the residual water levels and skew surges selected to calculate the annual storm surge intensity and monthly maximum values have a higher probability of coming from different storm surge events at xiamen and beihai regarding the linear trends of the residual water level fig 6 showed that there were statistically significant negative trends at three tide gauges p 0 02 huludao shanwei and haikou by using the mann kendall method for the skew surge there were also significant negative trends at three tide gauges huludao xiamen and shanwei overall 13 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao lvsi zhenhai sansha xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai had negative trends in the residual water level and 12 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao rizhao lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai had negative trends in skew surge previous studies have shown that cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones have decreased over the past few decades francis and vavrus 2012 zhang et al 2012 feng et al 2016 additionally studies have found that the frequency of typhoons occurring along the coastline of china shows a decreasing trend ho et al 2004 wang et al 2006 lin and chan 2015 the decreasing trend of the frequency of cold air outbreaks extratropical cyclones and typhoons has led to a negative trend of storm surges at most tide gauges along the coastline of china above results indicated that there were no significant differences between the residual water level and skew surge in the long term trends at most tide gauges in general spatial coherence occurs in the storm surge variability along the coastline stretches mawdsley and haigh 2016 for each tide gauge the correlation coefficient was calculated between the storm surge intensity the residual water level and skew surge time series at that tide gauge and each of the other 14 tide gauges fig 7 the results of the residual water level show that positive correlations occur among one or two nearby tide gauges the spatial coherence is much stronger along the coast when using the skew surge particularly north of xiamen for example five tide gauges show positive correlations with huludao due to the insufficient number and uneven distribution of tide stations the spatial interpolation method is widely used to process storm surge levels to obtain the water level boundary conditions in the risk assessment of storm surges rygel et al 2006 ramieri et al 2011 gao et al 2014 because the skew surge compared to the residual water level leads to much stronger spatial coherence along the coastline of china it may be a better metric if the interpolation method is used in risk based coastal planning frameworks previous studies have shown that changes in storm surges can affect changes in extreme sea levels at some tide gauges along the coastline of china feng et al 2015 2018b the correlation coefficients were calculated between the extreme sea level and skew surge and between extreme sea level and residual water level following woodworth and blackman 2004 the hourly data are ordered in terms of height and then used to compute percentile levels the 99 9 high level was used to represent the extreme sea level the results fig 8 show that at yantai longkou dajishan kanmen shanwei and zhapo the residual water level and skew surge are both statistically significantly positively correlated with the extreme sea level the correlation coefficients of the skew surge were greater than those of the residual water levels at longkou kanmen shanwei and zhapo here we compare only tide gauges for which the correlation coefficient was significant larger than 0 3 at p 0 05 only at yantai and qinhuangdao the correlation coefficients of the residual water level were greater than those of the skew surge the storm surges were mainly caused by cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones at yantai and qinhuangdao the storm surges were relatively weaker than that caused by the typhoons fig 6 feng et al 2018a showed that the extreme sea level in the bohai sea were usually associated with the high tide with the correlation larger than 0 6 larger than correlation of the storm surge the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was lower than that of all high tides at qinhuangdao and yantai fig 4 so the extreme sea levels at yantai and qinhuangdao did not correspond to the annual maximum skew surge but at most tide gauges results indicate that to better understand extreme sea levels the skew surge may be a better metric at most tide gauges 3 3 storm surge and climate change in the south yellow sea east china sea and south china sea tropical cyclones induce the largest storm surges feng and tsimplis 2014 previous studies have found that the changes of storm surges in the east and south china sea were related to changes of typhoon characteristics feng and tsimplis 2014 oey and chou 2016 typhoons in the western north pacific are significantly affected by the enso chan 2000 camargo et al 2005 feng and tsimplis 2014 kang et al 2019 the mean number of storm surges using the residual water level and skew surge above the 99 level during el niño years and la niña years was calculated and is shown in fig 9 at zhenhai xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai where storm surges are mostly caused by typhoons the number of residual water levels was smaller during el niño years than during la niña years at sansha xiamen shanwei haikou and beihai the number of skew surges was smaller during el niño years than la niña years these differences can be explained by the number of typhoons that have an effect on the coast of southern china between el niño years and la niña years using the best track data from the cma the number of typhoons that passed the study area 18 32 n 105 125 e during the el niño and la niña years was counted on average 29 13 typhoons passed this region during the el niño years and 33 58 typhoons on average passed during the la niña years additionally the numbers of typhoons that passed zhenhai xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai within 200 km during el niño years compared to those during la niña years are summarized the mean number of typhoons that passed these tide gauges range from 1 9 to 2 8 during the el niño years and more typhoons passed these tide gauges during the la niña years approximately 0 1 1 2 yr larger these results were basically in agreement with those of studies of typhoons in the east china sea and south china sea ho et al 2004 camargo et al 2006 liu and chan 2007 results also show that more events were selected for the skew surge 1 2 1 7 times the residual water level as the range of skew surge during a year was smaller than the residual water level the skew surge was more concentrated the differences between skew surge event were smaller than that of residual water level the skew surge numbers above the threshold were larger than that of residual method at all gauges the storm surge count of the residual water level above the 99 level fig 9 was closer to the number of typhoons that affected these tide gauges 1 9 2 8 per year feng and tsimplis 2014 so the residual water level may have more advantage in calculating the storm surge intensity than the skew surge we also found that at huludao qinhuangdao longkou rizhao and dajishan the number of residual water levels and skew surges was larger during el niño years than during la niña years the differences of residual water level were larger at huludao qinhuangdao yantai and rizhao this finding can be explained by the effects of the enso on extratropical cyclones over the mid latitude area studies have also indicated that if el niño occurs more extratropical cyclones are generated in the mid and high latitudes lin and zhan 2000 shapiro et al 2001 eichler and gottschalck 2013 previous results indicated that the residual water level showed a stronger relationship with enso than did the skew surge these may be caused by the differences in samples between residual water level and skew surge above the 99 threshold the results showed that more events were selected for the skew surge 1 2 1 7 times the residual water level the storm surge count of the residual water level above the 99 level was closer to the number of typhoons that affected these tide gauges feng and tsimplis 2014 therefore compared to the skew surge the residual water levels were more sensitive to the changes of enso 4 conclusions storm surges pose the most severe environmental risk to chinese coastal regions stakeholders and the public have placed increasing attention on storm surge activity under climate change in recent years to determine whether the skew surge is a more suitable metric than the residual water level for storm surges hourly sea level data from 15 tide gauges along the coastline of china were used to compare the performances of both metrics in assessing storm surge activity we found that at most tide gauges less than 10 of the annual maximum residual water levels occurred at high tide while more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide at dajishan approximately 94 thus the skew surge parameter appears to be more suitable than the residual water level for use in surge risk assessment frameworks the results also showed that at 6 tide gauges lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo the high tide pdfs associated with the annual maximum skew surge events were consistent and showed the same distribution as all high tides moreover at 2 tide gauges kanmen and haikou the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was higher than that of all high tides seasonal variations in storm surges can be expressed by both the residual water level and the skew surge and the differences between residual water level and skew surge are quite small skew surges and residual water levels show similar interdecadal variations at most tide gauges except at xiamen and beihai at most tide gauges the long term trends of both the residual water level and the skew surge were not statistically significant the trends of the skew surge were smaller than those of the residual water level at nearly all tide gauges the spatial coherence of the skew surge was more significant than that of the residual water level particularly north of xiamen the skew surge may be a better metric if the interpolation method is used in risk based coastal planning frameworks at 6 tide gauges yantai longkou dajishan kanmen shanwei and zhapo the residual water level and skew surge were both statistically significantly positively correlated with the extreme sea level in summary both the skew surge and the residual water level can be used to assess changes in storm surge activities and changes in the skew surge are more gradual than those in the residual water level the skew surge and residual water level results show that the enso can affect storm surge activities along the coastline of china both the skew surge and the residual water level can reflect the effects of climate change on storm surges but the residual water level showed a stronger relationship with enso than does the skew surge therefore the residual water level may be a better metric than the skew surge for use in studying the relationship between storm surges and regional climate changes 5 plain language summary storm surges pose the most severe environmental risks to coastal regions stakeholders and the public have placed increasing attention on storm surge activity under climate change during recent years the residual water level is commonly used to calculate storm surges however due to the tide surge interaction uncertainty exists in surge risk assessment frameworks in this work we test whether compared to the residual water level the skew surge is a better metric for calculating storm surges the results show that the skew surge is more suitable than the residual water level for use in surge risk assessment frameworks although both the residual water level and skew surge metrics can capture changes in storm surge activities in seasonal to long term trends the results show that the residual water level may be a better metric for capturing the relationship between storm surges and climate changes author contributions j f and l z conceptualized the research j f wrote the

4558,a better understanding of the storm surge phenomenon is essential for coastal protection future planning and coastal ecosystem conservation using hourly sea level data from 15 tide gauges along the coastline of china the metrics skew surge and residual water level which are used to represent storm surges are compared in this study the relationship between residual water level skew surge and predicted high tide were analyzed using two statistical measurements the results showed that unlike the annual maximum residual water level the annual maximum skew surge and the astronomical high tide tended to coincide more frequently more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide thus the skew surge was more suitable than the residual water level for use in risk based coastal planning frameworks using the monthly maximum value and indices of the storm surge storm surge number duration and intensity we compared the performances of skew surge and residual water level in expressing changes of storm surges these two metrics can both capture changes in storm surge activities on seasonal decadal and long term scales and correlation coefficients of storm surge intensity between residual water level and skew surge were greater than 0 80 at 11 tide gauges at most tide gauges the skew surge was significantly correlated with 4 5 nearby tide gauges while the residual water level was correlated with only 1 2 tide gauges the skew surge may be a better metric for risk based coastal planning frameworks if the interpolation method is used the el niño southern oscillation enso can affect the storm surge frequency along the coastline of china the effects of the enso were more obvious when the residual water level was selected in conclusion the skew surge can be selected for use in risk based coastal planning frameworks while the residual water level may be a better metric for capturing the relationship between storm surges and climate changes keywords storm surge residual water level skew surge enso coastline of china 1 introduction the bulletin of china marine disaster 2018 shows that storm surge disasters caused 49 deaths and 11 1 billion chinese yuan in losses and affected 11 5 million people annually from 2000 to 2017 in china hallegatte et al 2013 classified the chinese coastal areas among the most vulnerable areas to storm surges under climate change in recent years growing concern regarding climate change has led to an increased prevalence of risk based coastal planning frameworks frihy and el sayed 2013 quinn et al 2014 pezza 2015 the accelerated sea level rise and changes in storm frequency and intensity are two major impacts expected to affect the coastal inundation risk bender et al 2010 harvey and nicholls 2008 previous studies have found that regional climatic variations such as el niño southern oscillation enso and north atlantic oscillation nao can significantly affect the frequency and intensity of storm surges marcos et al 2009 haigh et al 2010 menéndez and woodworth 2010 torres and tsimplis 2013 feng and tsimplis 2014 talke et al 2014 the accuracy of risk based coastal planning frameworks is highly dependent on the water level boundary conditions including the mean sea level astronomical tide and storm surge brown et al 2018 typically in the assessment of inundation risk storm surges are represented by the residual water level which is derived from the time series of sea level records by subtracting the predicted tide level although some storm surges or residual peaks can coincide with the highest astronomical tide williams et al 2016 assuming that any residual peak can occur at any high tide maximum in the predicted tide level can lead to an overestimation of the total water level because of the interaction between the tide and surge components horsburgh and wilson 2007 which may increase unnecessary costs in the risk based coastal planning frameworks many properties of the residual water level are only artifacts of small changes in the timing of predicted high water this tide surge interaction can lead to uncertainty in risk based coastal planning frameworks thereby posing problems to decision makers and project managers prime et al 2016 the tide surge interaction is more significant in shallow seas and estuaries which are usually at risk from storm surges e g east asia the european continental shelf and the canadian and northeastern usa coasts tide surge interactions have been extensively studied worldwide including in the north sea the river thames rossiter 1961 horsburgh and wilson 2007 the northeastern usa bernier and thompson 2007 bangladesh paul et al 2016 the coastline of china feng et al 2019 and the australian coast allen et al 2018 tide surge interactions result in residual water level peaks that tend to occur more often during the ebb and flood tide than at high tide horsburgh and wilson 2007 to solve this problem the skew surge which is the difference between the maximum observed sea level and the maximum predicted tide regardless of timing during the tidal cycle irrespective of the time of occurrence de vries et al 1995 fig 1 has become a more popular metric for use in storm surge studies in northwestern europe and the usa sterl et al 2009 howard et al 2010 wahl and chambers 2015 mawdsley and haigh 2016 williams et al 2016 in recent years previous researchers thought that variations in the skew surge height were independent of the tidal level therefore the skew surge approach reduces the risk of distorted results compared to that using the residual water level caused by timing errors in the data and tidal prediction however disputes also exist regarding the use of the skew surge for studying storm surges santamaria aguilar and vafeidis 2018 noted that extreme skew surges are not independent of the high tide level at some sites with mixed semidiurnal tidal regimes mawdsley and haigh 2016 found that there were large differences in the long term skew surge and residual water level trends at some tide gauges with a large tidal range more effort is needed to compare these two parameters for assessing storm surge activities china has the coastline more than 14 million kilometers storm surges that occur in china can be classified into two types tropical storm surges and extratropical storm surges yang 2000 in the bohai sea and the northern yellow sea cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones usually cause significant storm surges particularly in the winter half of the year feng et al 2016 in the southern yellow sea east china sea and south china sea typhoons often cause serious storm surges during summer and autumn feng and tsimplis 2014 in recent years more studies have begun to pay attention to the effects of climate change on storm surges along the coastline of china feng and tsimplis 2014 found that the enso can regulate the number of typhoons that make landfall in china oey and chou 2016 found evidence of a significant rise in the intensity and poleward shifting of location of typhoon surges in the western north pacific after the 1980 s there are also studies indicated that enso can affect the extratropical cyclones in the mid and high latitudes shapiro et al 2001 eichler and gottschalck 2013 lin and zhan 2000 indicated that when el niño occurred the sea surface temperature sst in the eastern equatorial pacific was warmer than that during la niña years and that more extratropical cyclones occurred in the bohai sea and yellow sea the number of extratropical cyclones reached peaks in 1972 1976 1979 1987 1990 and 1992 zhang et al 2019 found that the number of rapidly developing cyclones over the bohai yellow and east china seas was highly related to the underlying sst anomalies in the east china sea and japan sea hong et al 2001 indicated that the variation in sst anomalies in the japan sea is closely related to enso events and that el niño events would lead to a warmer winter in the japan sea currently most studies that focus on the temporal variability in storm surges from seasonal to long time scales are based on the residual water level menéndez and woodworth 2010 talke et al 2014 feng et al 2018a currently we did not identify any studies that used the skew surge to assess storm surge variations in this area because limited research has been conducted regarding storm surge variations using the skew surge along the coastline of china it is still uncertain whether the variations of storm surges assessed using the skew surge metric are the same as those determined using the residual water level in this region in addition it is also uncertain whether the skew surge can be used as an indicator that reflects the effects of regional climate change on storm surges therefore the objectives of this work were to 1 assess the relationship between the skew surge and the tide along the coastline of china 2 compare how the use of the skew surge or residual water level affect the assessment of storm surge activities and 3 determine whether the skew surge can represent the effects of regional climate change on storm surges the outline of this paper is as follows the datasets and methodology are briefly described in section 2 the results and discussions are presented in section 3 the conclusions are provided in the last section 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the tide gauge records used in this study were from marine monitoring stations along the coastline of china with 1985 national datum and 15 uniformly distributed tide gauges were sampled at hourly frequencies fig 2 table 1 the data range from 1958 to 2016 at the selected tide gauges and all tide gauges have more than 30 years of data with different starting time table 1 which is an appropriate amount from which to obtain trends in extremes feng et al 2015 all the data have been carefully quality controlled and missing values last for hours have been interpolated data with spurious jumps and time shifts were removed in addition years during which the data were less than 75 complete were excluded from the analysis the locations and detailed information of the tide gauges are shown in fig 2 and table 1 the best tracking data for the typhoons were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma http tcdata typhoon org cn en zjljsjj zlhq html 2 2 methods the predicted tide levels were obtained by performing harmonic analyses of each calendar year of the tide gauge series using the t tide matlab package https www eoas ubc ca rich pawlowicz et al 2002 we used the standard set of 67 constituents the residual water level was obtained by subtracting the predicted tide from the observed water level fig 1 to obtain the skew surge the high tide level during every tide cycle were obtained firstly every high tide level was extracted by locating the turning points of the time series of the predicted tide mawdsley et al 2015 to ensure that we exactly obtained the high tide level in a mixed tidal regime the point was not selected if the predicted high tide level was less than 3 h away from the low tide then the difference between the observed water level and the nearest predicted high tide level over a tide cycle was calculated fig 1 the skew surge level was the maximum of the obtained time series as follows 2 2 ss m a x o b s i h t i 1 j where obs is the observed sea level during a tide cycle ht is the high tide level at this tide cycle and ss is the skew surge level at this tide cycle j was hours during a tide cycle two statistical measurements were used to assess the relationship between the skew surge and tide first we calculated the fraction of the annual maximum skew surge and residual water level that occurred at high tide respectively this was to statistic the fraction that the maximum water level occurred at the same time as the maximum predicted tide we used 1 h from the high tide second whether the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events followed the same distribution of all the high tides at the same tide gauge were assessed using the anderson darling test anderson and darling 1954 marsaglia 2004 if the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events presented the same distribution for all high tides then the magnitude of the extreme skew surge did not depend on the high tide level i e the skew surge could occur at any maxima tide level the monthly maxima of the skew surge and residual water level values were calculated to compare the seasonal variations to compare the decadal variations and the long term trends of the skew surge and residual water level the indices described by zhang et al 2000 were used as proxies for the intensity of the storm surges the indices are as follows 1 storm surge count the annual number of storm surges the residual water level skew surge level above a given threshold 2 storm surge duration the annual number of hours during which the storm surge levels were above a given threshold 3 storm surge intensity the annual total integral of the sea level curve above a given threshold here the threshold was set as the 99 level of the skew surge residual water level the significance of the trends and correlations identified in this study was carefully checked using t tests for correlations and mann kendall tests for trends von storch and zwiers 1999 feng et al 2015 the pre whitening method was used to avoid autocorrelations in the work kulkarni and von storch 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the skew surge and tide the percentage of the annual maximum skew surge or residual water level that occurred at high tide is shown in fig 3 results show that at 13 tide gauges less than 15 of the annual maximum residual water levels occurred at high tide blue bar moreover at qinhuangdao longkou rizhao dajishan zhenhai xiamen and haikou the percentage was less than 5 the percentage was higher at kanmen and shanwei about 15 and 25 respectively the skew surge results were very different from the residual water level results at huludao yantai rizhao lvsi dajishan zhenhai kanmen sansha and xiamen more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide the percentage was the highest at dajishan where approximately 94 37 out of 39 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide there were also some tide gauges qinhuangdao longkou shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai the annual max skew surge more often happened during the ebb or flood tide but the percentage of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide still ranged from 20 to 45 which was still much higher than that of the residual water level the results showed that the maximum skew surge more frequently occurred at high tide than during other periods above results indicated that a significant tide surge interaction exists at most tide gauges in surge risk assessment frameworks the maximum water level boundary conditions were usually a combination of the high tide level and maximum storm surge level lickley et al 2014 hsu et al 2018 as a result of tide surge interactions the maximum residual water level mostly occurred before after mostly 3 4 h the high tide fig 1 horsburgh and wilson 2007 feng et al 2018a allen et al 2018 which can lead to overestimations of the water level boundary conditions in contrast the maximum skew surge more frequently occurred at high tide than during other periods therefore the maximum water level boundary conditions will be more credible when using the skew surge for example the annual maximum residual water level was 1 07 m at xiamen in 2016 when the annual maximum skew surge was 0 47 m the maximum high tide is about 7 06 m when the residual water level was used the predicted maximum water level was 8 13 m however the observed maximum water level was 7 27 m the result of the skew surge was much better than the residual water level about 7 53 m the tides at many tide gauges showed semidiurnal and mixed semidiurnal characteristics at these tide gauges a tidal cycle consists of two unequal high tides in approximately a 24 h period the differences between higher high tide and lower high tide range from 0 15 rizhao to 1 2 zhapo at tide gauges with semidiurnal and mixed semidiurnal characteristics used in this work so it was also important to determine whether extreme skew surges happened at the higher high tide or lower high tide along the coastline of china the fraction of the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day was also calculated fig 3 the yellow bar the results show that at huludao rizhao dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen and zhapo the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 25 40 was less than that at the lower high tide the value of green bar minus the value of yellow bar the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 8 m 0 15 m 0 55 m 0 65 m 0 20 m 0 40 m and 1 2 m respectively at qinhuangdao shanwei haikou and beihai the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 75 100 was more than that at the lower high tide the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 17 m 1 0 m 0 35 m and 0 70 m respectively at longkou yantai and lvsi the annual maximum skew surge that occurred at the higher high tide during the day approximately 40 60 and the annual maximum skew surge at the lower high tide showed little difference the difference between higher high tide and lower high tide were 0 55 m 0 34 m and 0 40 respectively the reason that extreme skew surges occurring time at higher high tide or lower high tide are supposed to be related to the tide type and topography at the tide gauges santamaria aguilar and vafeidis 2018 indicated that an interaction between the skew surge and tide existed at tide gauges located in a wide shallow continental shelf which made the extreme skew surges tend to occur during lower high tide therefore in the wide and shallow chinese continental shelf extreme skew surges should mainly occur at time of lower high tide such as stations huludao rizhao dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen and zhapo where the tidal types are semidiurnal tide however at stations qinhuangdao shanwei haikou and beihai their tidal types are mixed but primarily diurnal tides there are also some days that the tide has two high tide the proportion of higher high tide was much larger than that of lower high tide therefore extreme skew surges mainly occur at higher high tide at longkou yantai and lvsi the tidal types are mixed but primarily semidiurnal tides the number of higher high tide was larger than that of lower high tide but the differences was smaller than that of mixed but primarily diurnal tides so the occurrence differences of extreme skew surges between higher high tide and lower high tide was small but future research involving numerical model simulations is needed in order to better explore the dynamics of the interaction between extreme skew surge and tide the pdfs of all the high tides during the whole period and those high tide associated with the maximum skew surges were shown in fig 4 the results varied for different tide gauges at lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo the pdfs were consistent with each other for the high tide associated with the annual maximum skew surge events and all high tides at huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen and beihai the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was lower than that of all high tides at kanmen and haikou the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was higher than that of all high tides these results therefore showed that at 9 out of 15 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen beihai kanmen and haikou the skew surges have tidal restriction where the extreme skew surge show high tide dependency the differences in the pdfs may be related to the locations of the tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao xiamen beihai and haikou are in semienclosed areas and lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo are located in exposed seas in the open continental shelf the aforementioned results indicate that using the skew surge is much better than using the residual water level for surge risk assessment frameworks engineers or decision makers can obtain more accurate water level conditions using skew surges instead of residual water levels if coastal planning frameworks are based on the statistical combination of a maximum predicted tide and a maximum surge where maximum in both cases is qualified by a specified statistical likelihood huang et al 2008 lin et al 2010 moreover because the skew surges at some tide gauges are not independent of the tide because of the tide skew surge interaction this metric should also be considered in practical applications 3 2 variations in storm surges the mean values of the monthly maximum skew surge and residual water level at 15 tide gauges were shown in fig 5 the results showed that pronounced seasonal variations exist at all the tide gauges along the coastline of china at huludao qinhuangdao longkou and yantai the storm surges were more serious from january to march and october to december where storm surges were mostly caused by cold air outbreaks and extratropical storms at rizhao lvsi dajishan and zhenhai the storm surges were more serious from january to march and august to december both typhoons and extratropical storms can cause storm surges at these four tide gauges at kanmen sansha xiamen shanwei zhaopo haikou and beihai the storm surges were mainly caused by typhoons the storm surges were more serious from july to october but the highest values occurred at different month due to the different locations the seasonal variations were similar at adjacent tide gauges the mean value of the monthly maximum skew surges was less than that of the residual water level at all the tide gauges the seasonal cycles in storm surge can be expressed by both the residual water level and the skew surge with correlation coefficient larger than 0 92 at 13 tide gauges there are also two tide gauges xiamen and beihai the differences especially during hurricane season between skew surge and residual water level are larger than others with the correlation about 0 86 and 0 88 respectively the annual storm surge intensities at the 15 tide gauges using the residual water level and skew surge above the 99 level were calculated and shown in fig 6 some common features existed between the skew surge and residual water level the interannual variability in the intensity was quite large for all tide gauges ranging from 15 to 25 h m the sizes of the interannual variability in the storm surge and mean sea level were at the same order of magnitude in these areas feng et al 2015 the skew surges and residual water levels showed similar interdecadal variations at most tide gauges except at xiamen and beihai where the interdecadal skew surge was smaller than the residual water level more than 15 h m the correlation coefficients between the residual water level and skew surge were all significant at the 95 confidence level the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 80 at 13 of the 15 tide gauges two tide gauges beihai and xiamen had correlation coefficients less than 0 50 the seasonal and interdecadal differences between residual water level and skew surge may be explained by the characteristics of the tide surge interactions at beihai and xiamen feng et al 2019 categorized the tide surge interaction process at tide gauges along the coastline of china into four distinct types phase alteration high water low water and long duration they found that because of the higher tide ranges at xiamen and beihai more residual water levels present phase alterations between sea levels and predicted tides while at most tide gauges along the coastline of china more residual water levels present long durations the residual is significant for two or more tide processes and a dip in the residual occurs during high tide under these circumstances the residual water levels and skew surges selected to calculate the annual storm surge intensity and monthly maximum values have a higher probability of coming from different storm surge events at xiamen and beihai regarding the linear trends of the residual water level fig 6 showed that there were statistically significant negative trends at three tide gauges p 0 02 huludao shanwei and haikou by using the mann kendall method for the skew surge there were also significant negative trends at three tide gauges huludao xiamen and shanwei overall 13 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao longkou yantai rizhao lvsi zhenhai sansha xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai had negative trends in the residual water level and 12 tide gauges huludao qinhuangdao rizhao lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai had negative trends in skew surge previous studies have shown that cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones have decreased over the past few decades francis and vavrus 2012 zhang et al 2012 feng et al 2016 additionally studies have found that the frequency of typhoons occurring along the coastline of china shows a decreasing trend ho et al 2004 wang et al 2006 lin and chan 2015 the decreasing trend of the frequency of cold air outbreaks extratropical cyclones and typhoons has led to a negative trend of storm surges at most tide gauges along the coastline of china above results indicated that there were no significant differences between the residual water level and skew surge in the long term trends at most tide gauges in general spatial coherence occurs in the storm surge variability along the coastline stretches mawdsley and haigh 2016 for each tide gauge the correlation coefficient was calculated between the storm surge intensity the residual water level and skew surge time series at that tide gauge and each of the other 14 tide gauges fig 7 the results of the residual water level show that positive correlations occur among one or two nearby tide gauges the spatial coherence is much stronger along the coast when using the skew surge particularly north of xiamen for example five tide gauges show positive correlations with huludao due to the insufficient number and uneven distribution of tide stations the spatial interpolation method is widely used to process storm surge levels to obtain the water level boundary conditions in the risk assessment of storm surges rygel et al 2006 ramieri et al 2011 gao et al 2014 because the skew surge compared to the residual water level leads to much stronger spatial coherence along the coastline of china it may be a better metric if the interpolation method is used in risk based coastal planning frameworks previous studies have shown that changes in storm surges can affect changes in extreme sea levels at some tide gauges along the coastline of china feng et al 2015 2018b the correlation coefficients were calculated between the extreme sea level and skew surge and between extreme sea level and residual water level following woodworth and blackman 2004 the hourly data are ordered in terms of height and then used to compute percentile levels the 99 9 high level was used to represent the extreme sea level the results fig 8 show that at yantai longkou dajishan kanmen shanwei and zhapo the residual water level and skew surge are both statistically significantly positively correlated with the extreme sea level the correlation coefficients of the skew surge were greater than those of the residual water levels at longkou kanmen shanwei and zhapo here we compare only tide gauges for which the correlation coefficient was significant larger than 0 3 at p 0 05 only at yantai and qinhuangdao the correlation coefficients of the residual water level were greater than those of the skew surge the storm surges were mainly caused by cold air outbreaks and extratropical cyclones at yantai and qinhuangdao the storm surges were relatively weaker than that caused by the typhoons fig 6 feng et al 2018a showed that the extreme sea level in the bohai sea were usually associated with the high tide with the correlation larger than 0 6 larger than correlation of the storm surge the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was lower than that of all high tides at qinhuangdao and yantai fig 4 so the extreme sea levels at yantai and qinhuangdao did not correspond to the annual maximum skew surge but at most tide gauges results indicate that to better understand extreme sea levels the skew surge may be a better metric at most tide gauges 3 3 storm surge and climate change in the south yellow sea east china sea and south china sea tropical cyclones induce the largest storm surges feng and tsimplis 2014 previous studies have found that the changes of storm surges in the east and south china sea were related to changes of typhoon characteristics feng and tsimplis 2014 oey and chou 2016 typhoons in the western north pacific are significantly affected by the enso chan 2000 camargo et al 2005 feng and tsimplis 2014 kang et al 2019 the mean number of storm surges using the residual water level and skew surge above the 99 level during el niño years and la niña years was calculated and is shown in fig 9 at zhenhai xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai where storm surges are mostly caused by typhoons the number of residual water levels was smaller during el niño years than during la niña years at sansha xiamen shanwei haikou and beihai the number of skew surges was smaller during el niño years than la niña years these differences can be explained by the number of typhoons that have an effect on the coast of southern china between el niño years and la niña years using the best track data from the cma the number of typhoons that passed the study area 18 32 n 105 125 e during the el niño and la niña years was counted on average 29 13 typhoons passed this region during the el niño years and 33 58 typhoons on average passed during the la niña years additionally the numbers of typhoons that passed zhenhai xiamen shanwei zhapo haikou and beihai within 200 km during el niño years compared to those during la niña years are summarized the mean number of typhoons that passed these tide gauges range from 1 9 to 2 8 during the el niño years and more typhoons passed these tide gauges during the la niña years approximately 0 1 1 2 yr larger these results were basically in agreement with those of studies of typhoons in the east china sea and south china sea ho et al 2004 camargo et al 2006 liu and chan 2007 results also show that more events were selected for the skew surge 1 2 1 7 times the residual water level as the range of skew surge during a year was smaller than the residual water level the skew surge was more concentrated the differences between skew surge event were smaller than that of residual water level the skew surge numbers above the threshold were larger than that of residual method at all gauges the storm surge count of the residual water level above the 99 level fig 9 was closer to the number of typhoons that affected these tide gauges 1 9 2 8 per year feng and tsimplis 2014 so the residual water level may have more advantage in calculating the storm surge intensity than the skew surge we also found that at huludao qinhuangdao longkou rizhao and dajishan the number of residual water levels and skew surges was larger during el niño years than during la niña years the differences of residual water level were larger at huludao qinhuangdao yantai and rizhao this finding can be explained by the effects of the enso on extratropical cyclones over the mid latitude area studies have also indicated that if el niño occurs more extratropical cyclones are generated in the mid and high latitudes lin and zhan 2000 shapiro et al 2001 eichler and gottschalck 2013 previous results indicated that the residual water level showed a stronger relationship with enso than did the skew surge these may be caused by the differences in samples between residual water level and skew surge above the 99 threshold the results showed that more events were selected for the skew surge 1 2 1 7 times the residual water level the storm surge count of the residual water level above the 99 level was closer to the number of typhoons that affected these tide gauges feng and tsimplis 2014 therefore compared to the skew surge the residual water levels were more sensitive to the changes of enso 4 conclusions storm surges pose the most severe environmental risk to chinese coastal regions stakeholders and the public have placed increasing attention on storm surge activity under climate change in recent years to determine whether the skew surge is a more suitable metric than the residual water level for storm surges hourly sea level data from 15 tide gauges along the coastline of china were used to compare the performances of both metrics in assessing storm surge activity we found that at most tide gauges less than 10 of the annual maximum residual water levels occurred at high tide while more than 50 of the annual maximum skew surges occurred at high tide at dajishan approximately 94 thus the skew surge parameter appears to be more suitable than the residual water level for use in surge risk assessment frameworks the results also showed that at 6 tide gauges lvsi dajishan zhenhai sansha shanwei and zhapo the high tide pdfs associated with the annual maximum skew surge events were consistent and showed the same distribution as all high tides moreover at 2 tide gauges kanmen and haikou the pdf peak of the high tide associated with skew surges was higher than that of all high tides seasonal variations in storm surges can be expressed by both the residual water level and the skew surge and the differences between residual water level and skew surge are quite small skew surges and residual water levels show similar interdecadal variations at most tide gauges except at xiamen and beihai at most tide gauges the long term trends of both the residual water level and the skew surge were not statistically significant the trends of the skew surge were smaller than those of the residual water level at nearly all tide gauges the spatial coherence of the skew surge was more significant than that of the residual water level particularly north of xiamen the skew surge may be a better metric if the interpolation method is used in risk based coastal planning frameworks at 6 tide gauges yantai longkou dajishan kanmen shanwei and zhapo the residual water level and skew surge were both statistically significantly positively correlated with the extreme sea level in summary both the skew surge and the residual water level can be used to assess changes in storm surge activities and changes in the skew surge are more gradual than those in the residual water level the skew surge and residual water level results show that the enso can affect storm surge activities along the coastline of china both the skew surge and the residual water level can reflect the effects of climate change on storm surges but the residual water level showed a stronger relationship with enso than does the skew surge therefore the residual water level may be a better metric than the skew surge for use in studying the relationship between storm surges and regional climate changes 5 plain language summary storm surges pose the most severe environmental risks to coastal regions stakeholders and the public have placed increasing attention on storm surge activity under climate change during recent years the residual water level is commonly used to calculate storm surges however due to the tide surge interaction uncertainty exists in surge risk assessment frameworks in this work we test whether compared to the residual water level the skew surge is a better metric for calculating storm surges the results show that the skew surge is more suitable than the residual water level for use in surge risk assessment frameworks although both the residual water level and skew surge metrics can capture changes in storm surge activities in seasonal to long term trends the results show that the residual water level may be a better metric for capturing the relationship between storm surges and climate changes author contributions j f and l z conceptualized the research j f wrote the

4559,subsurface flow plays an important role in the functioning of wetlands and in the maintenance of their ecosystem services specifically the transport and exchange of dissolved matter between sediments and surface waters is regulated by subsurface flow which can strongly affect ecological zonation and productivity having a quantitative understanding of this subsurface flow is therefore important field techniques based on darcy s equation or natural tracers are often used separately to assess flows here radon and heat both natural groundwater tracers and darcy s equation are used simultaneously to quantify the subsurface flow in a tidal wetland kooragang island newcastle australia and the results of the independent methods are compared a steady state radon mass balance model indicated an overall net subsurface exfiltration of 10 2 4 2 cm d while a 1d vertical fluid heat transport model indicated a net exfiltration of 4 3 2 9 cm d flow estimated from analysis of hydraulic heads indicated an exfiltration rate of 3 2 1 8 cm d the difference in flow rates is likely due to the localised measurement of the heat and head methods relative to radon and therefore these methods are less likely to capture zones of preferential subsurface flow the main advantage of radon is that it provides the total subsurface flow regardless of the driving force while head gradient or heat tracer method have the advantage of temporally quantify infiltration and exfiltration we highlight that these methods may underestimate subsurface flows in highly dynamic coastal systems such as tidal wetlands where a large portion of the subsurface flow is recirculated seawater this could potentially lead to errors in solute flux estimates this study highlights the importance of employing a multi

water quantity quality and the functioning of ecosystems in coastal wetland environments conant et al 2019 knights et al 2017 montiel et al 2018 however subsurface flows are particularly complex

environments have shown that multiple technique tracer approaches provide more robust and reliable results as different tracers are based on different physical principles detect different aspects of groundwater flow and have different advantages unland et al 2013 radon 222 is a noble gas with very low chemical reactivity that is usually enriched in groundwater relative to surface water peterson et al 2019 radon is produced in sediments via the decay of the radium 226 isotope radon decays with a half life of 3 8 days and this relative short half life and volatility means that it does not travel far in surface waters from its location of discharge hence its presence indicates local subsurface water discharge burnett 2008 heat tracing uses temperature variations at different depth in the subsurface to model the quantity and temporal spatial changes of the vertical component of groundwater movement by applying analytical and or numerical solutions of combined heat conduction and advective transport previous research using the heat tracing technique has focused mainly on the hyporheic zones of rivers and wetlands anibas et al 2012 bravo et al 2002 rau et al 2010 or tested the limits of applicability in temporal and spatial dimensions rau et al 2015 roshan et al 2012 sebok and müller 2019 in a coastal wetland groundwater surface water exchange is highly variable with changing flow directions during each tidal cycle del pilar alvarez et al 2015 this dynamic behavior of groundwater surface water interaction adds to the complexity of hydrologic and thermal processes found in non tidal wetlands and may be the reason why heat tracing is rarely used in coastal wetlands befus et al 2013 additionally often tidal wetlands are inaccessible and the deployment of a network of measurement devices is challenging to date studies using the heat tracer in coastal kurylyk et al 2019 swain and prinos 2018 or tidal settings halloran et al 2017 are limited radon and heat tracers can be used independently to investigate groundwater surface water interactions navarro martinez et al 2017 however researchers advise that multiple lines of evidence by combining different techniques can validate results and overcome limitations of a single method dujardin et al 2014 gilfedder et al 2015 the traditional technique to investigate subsurface flow is by hydraulic gradients which may underestimate subsurface flow compared to other techniques mulligan and charette 2006 su et al 2016 studies combining radon and heat tracers are limited to inland waterbodies and focus on river water infiltrating aquifers and residence time calculations of hyporheic groundwater cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and cirpka 2006 vogt et al 2010 heat tracing in the sediment allows for the calculation of subsurface flow at shorter temporal resolution than radon and can distinguish between infiltration and exfiltration heat tracing however provides point data and spatial extrapolation is associated with large uncertainty radon on the other hand does not have this problem with spatial uncertainty as it smooths out spatial heterogeneity and provides the total subsurface flow integrated over a certain time period calculating an estimate of the temporal resolution that is less than the tidal frequency via the radon technique is only possible using a detailed numerical model our study builds on the only available heat study in a tidal setting tidal creek in the literature halloran et al 2017 and aims to extend subsurface flow quantification in coastal wetlands that are dominated by tidal inundation to achieve this aim the study utilises time series measurements of both radon and heat tracers as well as hydraulic heads in groundwater discharge zones the flow directions are complex and varying in relation to the measurement location in the subsurface but also varying over time with wave action and tidal stage rakhimbekova et al 2018 turner et al 2016 flow directions are further complicated by density effects when both fresh and saline water are discharging andersen et al 2007 within the discharge zone vertical flows may dominate but varying in direction with the tidal stage while further inland flows are predominantly horizontal this dependence of location needs to be taken into consideration when designing field studies the radon tracer technique has the advantage of providing information on the total subsurface flow regardless of its salinity or subsurface source burnett et al 2007 for example when used in tidal environments radon integrates the discharge of both fresh regional and saline water originating from the surface but circulated through the subsurface su et al 2014 for both heat tracing and darcy methods the location and geometry of the observations field deployment needs to be considered for heat tracing studies temperature sensors are traditionally deployed vertically in the sediment for practical reasons and therefore mostly deployed directly in the discharge zone for such deployments the heat tracer technique will provide only the vertical component of flow regardless of whether the water is fresh or saline rau et al 2014 depending on the relative location of piezometer screens the darcy method can be used to determine either vertical or horizontal hydraulic head gradients in the discharge zone vertical gradients can be determined by two or more piezometers with screened intervals vertically arranged further landward laterally spaced piezometers can determine the horizontal fresh groundwater hydraulic head gradients the gradients can be converted to flows provided the hydraulic conductivity distribution between the screens is known appropriately quantifying the hydraulic conductivity distribution is one of the main challenges and source of uncertainty with the darcy method when the methods described above are used alone different quantitative results may be achieved representing either an integrated value radon or the particular parts of the system being observed heat and darcy however when the different methods are used in combination they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system and therefore add more confidence in the findings when results are in agreement the objective of this study is to evaluate groundwater surface water interactions in a tidal wetland using three independent methods simultaneously to 1 compare the methods of quantifying subsurface flow against each other 2 assess the capability of the heat tracer method in quantifying subsurface flow in tidal settings and 3 quantify various sources of the total subsurface flow by disaggregating the subsurface processes through jointly interpreting the techniques used at the study site 2 material and method 2 1 site description the field site is a tidal wetland on kooragang island 32 866707s 151 715561e fig 1 in the hunter river estuary located near newcastle new south wales australia approximately 7 km upstream of the river mouth the wetland is a low lying flat area with an elevation between 1 5 and 2 m above mean sea level the field site experiences a temperate climate with an average annual rainfall of 1122 mm and an average temperature of 22 5 c in summer and 12 c in winter bureau of meteorology www bom gov au the wetland is connected to the hunter river estuary via a 170 m long and 10 m wide tidal estuarine channel intertidal mudflats cover an area of 113 330 m2 of the overall catchment area 240 000 m2 the wetland has no upstream surface water inputs its hydrology is dominated by a semi diurnal tidal regime with spring and neap tides the wetland sediment is composed primarily of silt with numerous crab burrows across the intertidal zone that can increase permeability and facilitate porewater circulation stieglitz et al 2013 the top 0 3 m of the sediment has a muddy texture with partly decayed organic matter while the remaining sediment profile is dominated by estuarine silt and sand until 5 m below the surface the area did not receive any rainfall in the 15 days prior to the fieldwork however on 29th november 2018 during the field sampling there was a 20 mm rainfall event the site was selected for its small catchment area and narrow estuarine mouth which helps constrain the area under investigation additionally the site was secure from the public interfering with installations yet accessible for deploying measurement instrumentation the eastern and southern parts of kooragang island are characterized by a combination of port facilities and industrial land use but the majority of the island to the north and west is part of the kooragang nature reserve the island consists of unconsolidated quaternary sediments fig 2 and its hydrogeology is comprised of two sand aquifers a shallow unconfined and a deeper confined aquifer the shallow aquifer extends to a depth of 5 m the two aquifers are separated by a clay aquitard layer which has a thickness of 4 m robinson 2006 the unconfined aquifer of primary interest to this study is primarily recharged by rainfall directly within the nature reserve and the general groundwater flow on the island in the unconfined aquifer is towards the south channel of the hunter river estuary jones 2013 on the island the water table in this aquifer has been identified at depths of 0 3 to 1 5 m from the surface 2 2 surface water measurements fieldwork was carried out from 26th november 2nd december 2018 to install equipment and collect surface and groundwater data including radon hydraulic heads temperature time series and water quality measurements surface water physico chemical parameters were measured using a calibrated multiparameter water quality sonde ysi exo2 variables including salinity water temperature 0 01 c and depth 0 004 m were collected at 15 min intervals wind speed data 10 was collected onsite using a weather station model ph1000 current velocity direction and water depth were measured in the center of the tidal channel using a sontek argonaut acoustic doppler current profiler adcp at 10 min intervals the channel cross section depth was measured every 2 m at high tide assuming a homogeneous current velocity across the channel water level changes at shorter intervals were deemed to generally be below the measurement uncertainty and measurements at finer spatial scales than 2 m did not improve the accuracy of the flow estimate surface water discharge out of the wetland was estimated by multiplying wetted area per unit time by current velocity and integrating over time 2 3 radon in surface water radon time series measurements were conducted over the course of the fieldwork in the tidal channel at the wetland outlet fig 1 surface water was pumped from 0 2 m beneath the water surface at a rate of 2 5 l min into an air water exchanger that allowed the radon concentrations in air and water to equilibrate through a closed air loop system burnett and dulaiova 2003 the air was then pumped into a radon detector rad7 which measured radon concentrations every 30 min by detecting the α emitting daughters of radon 214 218po dulaiova et al 2005 the radon concentration in water was calculated based on the gas solubility incorporating the effects of water temperature and salinity schubert et al 2012 a 30 min lag time correction which is required for radon to reach equilibrium using this approach was applied to the data schubert et al 2012 2 4 radon diffusion from sediments and ingrowth three sediment samples from the wetland and up to 0 2 m depth were collected brought back to the laboratory placed in gas tight containers with radium free water sediment to water ratio by volume 0 2 and sealed for at least one month for measuring radon molecular diffusion from sediments the system was regularly mixed by tilting the water inside the containers was then collected into a 6l gas tight plastic bottle from the bottom up preventing any effects of heterogeneity within the core for radon measurements using a rad7 as described above lee and kim 2006 the principle behind this experiment was that after a month equal to 6 radon half lives the source emanation and diffusion and sink decay of the radon will reach steady state secular equilibrium within the sediment core santos and eyre 2011 to estimate radon ingrowth from the decay of dissolved radium 226ra as radon s parent isotope 40l containers were used to collect surface water at two low and two high tides the water was then filtered through a column containing 0 015 0 020 kg manganese oxide impregnated fibre which absorb 226ra moore 2003 the fibres were sealed and left for at least one month before 226ra concentration analysis following established procedures kim et al 2001 2 5 radon mass balance subsurface flow was estimated through a radon mass balance model developed based on time series measurements of radon following peterson et al 2019 the mass balance was calculated for three diel cycles with the final radon derived subsurface flow calculated as an aggregate of the resulting net flow from each of the diel cycles the mass balance model considers all known sources of radon incoming flow diffusion from sediments ingrowth from parent isotopes and inputs from porewater and sinks of radon outgoing flow atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay and assumes the missing radon to balance the model is provided by subsurface flow as follows 1 q gw 222 r n gw q in 222 r n in q dif a 222 r a λ 222 v q out 222 r n out 222 r n λ 222 v j atm where q gw is

ostwald solubility coefficient dimensionless describing the distribution of radon at equilibrium as the fluid to gas ratio and k g is the gas transfer velocity at the air water boundary which is driven by wind current and water depth in tidal environments the value of k g m d was calculated for each time interval using eqs 3 and 4 separately and the sum was used in equation 2 borges et al

transfer velocity driven by currents w is the water current m s and h is water depth m the schmidt number sc was determined using formulations from macintyre et al 1995 and ranged from 660 to 3400 during the sampling period wind speed ranged from 0 to 11 m s the area of the entire wetland 113 330 m2 was used to upscale wind evasions however only the estuarine tidal channel area 5 637 m2 was used to determine current driven evasions as currents in the intertidal mudflats approached zero 2 6 radon in groundwater groundwater samples n 14 were collected from the intertidal mudflat zones during low tides a hand auger was used to install shallow 0 05 m diameter pvc pipe piezometers up to depths of 2 m with 0 5 m long screens the piezometers were purged three times before collecting a sample using a peristaltic pump a 6l gas tight nalgene hdpe high density polyethylene bottle was used to collect and measure radon concentrations in groundwater samples were analysed in less than 24 hrs by connecting each bottle to a rad7 radon monitor device and running for at least 2 h to achieve an air water radon equilibrium with 5 uncertainty following standard protocols lee and kim 2006 2 7 measurement of temperature time series to gather temperature and water level time series four representative measurement locations were chosen within the tidal wetland and equipped with t arrays t1 to t4 fig 1 t4 was placed downstream near the mouth of the tidal channel of the wetland and approximately 5 m from the radon measurement location t2 was placed upstream where the wetlands main channel was shallow and narrow the other two t arrays were placed in the intertidal mudflats north t1 and south t3 of the tidal channel t4 was continuously inundated therefore its setting was similar to measurements in a riverbed rau et al 2014 the other t arrays experienced variable tidal inundation and exposure where due to their mud flat locations t1 and t3 experienced the longest periods of exposure the t arrays were purpose made fig 3 each consisted of two pvc pipes 0 032 m in diameter a 1 8 m long and a 1 m short pipe respectively the bottom 0 2 m of the long pipes were screened with a screen depth of around 1 1 2 m below surface while the short pipes were screened over the entire length the short pipes were entirely submerged during high tides the tops of the long pipes were continuously above the highest tidal level and vented to the atmosphere single temperature loggers solinst levelogger edge model 3001 were installed in the long pipes in the short pipes leveloggers were installed to measure surface water temperatures while additional loggers measured at 5 depths in the sediment at 0 02 and 0 05 m depth tidbit v2 utbi 001 were used these loggers were small and could therefore be placed close together to measure temperature at narrow depth intervals near the surface the three deeper temperature loggers at 0 10 0 23 and 0 42 m were hobo water temperature pro v2 u22 001 the measurement interval of all loggers was 60 s to account for potential variations in temperature data due to different logger types the temperature offsets between loggers were recorded in a water bath and the collected field data corrected for the offset to a common reference field measurements of bulk sediment thermal conductivity k and bulk heat capacity c were measured using a kd2 pro thermal properties analyzer field instrument the thermal properties were measured at different depths in the mudflats t1 and t3 in the upper part of the channel t2 and in the deep section of the channel near t4 thirty four measurements were performed in total hence several values were obtained at each location and depth for the heat transport analysis values presented in table 1 were applied for each individual t array 2 8 heat transport model the measured temperature time series were used to estimate vertical exchange fluxes in the tidal wetland by applying combined heat and fluid transport modelling based on the one dimensional vertical transport solution of suzuki 1960 and stallman 1965 they describe the one dimensional vertical anisothermal transport of fluid and heat through homogeneous porous media as 5 k 2 t z 2 q z c w t z c t t where k is the thermal conductivity of the soil water matrix in w mk t is the temperature in k at depth z at time t in the sediment c w is the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid in j m3k c the saturated volumetric heat capacity of the sediment fluid matrix in j m3k q z the vertical component of the darcy velocity in m s for convenience we use the unit of cm d a negative q z corresponds to water flowing from the surface into the sediment infiltration while a positive q z indicates flow from the sediment out to surface exfiltration the analysis of the analytical solution for eq 5 was conducted with the open access model environment 1dtemppro koch et al 2016 the physical sediment properties needed for 1dtemppro are bulk k c and the porosity of the saturated sediment ϕs a porosity ϕs of 0 60 was chosen for the site as reported by the nsw department of primary industries 2008 for the heat conduction and advective transport model the boundary conditions are defined at the interface between surface water and sediment i e a depth of 0 0 m at the uppermost logger of the short pipe and the location of the deepest logger in the subsurface located in the long pipe the other temperature time series are used to fit measured and modelled data the model was applied to each single high and low tide and integrated over three diel cycles i e the same period as for radon most parts of the wetland drained during low tides with visible seepage patterns it was assumed that although seepage has happened a saturated sediment profile remains present the 1dtemppro model calculates and integrates vertical exchange fluxes over the modelled period by changing its value until a minimal difference between modelled and measured subsurface temperature distribution is reached for presentation purposes this is expressed by the root mean square error rmse the quality of the model output was classified by the average rmse per t array and its standard deviation 2 9 darcy s flow calculation the piezometers used for calculating the subsurface flow were the same as those used for groundwater sampling water levels were measured every 15 min with solinst leveloggers placed in each piezometer the top of all piezometer was surveyed to australian height datum ahd using a trimble 5800 rtk gps real time kinematic global positioning system accurate to less than 20 mm the subsurface flow was calculated based on hydraulic heads for time increments of 15 min with negative values indicating infiltration and positive values representing exfiltration subsurface flow per unit width i e through a 1 m 1 m area perpendicular to the flow direction was calculated for each diel cycle separately by integrating the rising and falling head gradient data over each diel cycle the flow calculation was completed for all transects piezometers a c f d g h j i and m l and an average calculated darcy s law follows eq 6 darcy

per unit width 1 m for each transect m2 the results were upscaled using the length of representative shoreline for each transect the hydraulic conductivity for coastal wetland mangrove sediments perforated with animal burrows similar to the study site here is suggested to range from 1 to 10 m d susilo and ridd 2005 based on hydraulic head gradient measurements in conjunction with heat tracer derived fluxes a range of vertical hydraulic conductivities of 0 1 to 5 m d was estimated for the site here based on field data and the literature a k sat value of 5 m d was used and the distance between each piezometer was determined in arcgis v10 5 interpolation of hydraulic heads for creating groundwater maps was also prepared in arcgis v10 5 using the inverse weighted distance method sadat noori et al 2013 3 results 3 1 surface water time series and groundwater observations observed surface water levels indicated a semi diurnal tidal behaviour with water depths ranging from 0 1 to 1 7 m in the estuarine tidal channel entrance of the wetland during measurements fig 4 salinity was mostly at oceanic values 35 ppt and slightly increased during ebb tides during the rainfall event freshening occurred and surface water salinity dropped to 17 ppt surface water temperature ranged between 17 2 and 29 4 c and generally decreased at low tide flow velocity in the estuarine channel reduced at low tide and varied between 0 002 and 0 09 m s radon followed a trend opposite to the tides with concentrations increasing at low tide and decreasing at high tide ranging from 20 to 850 bq m3 groundwater in the wetland was hypersaline and salinity varied between 42 1 and 51 7 ppt across the wetland table 2 median groundwater temperature was 22 5 c which was one degree lower than median surface water temperature radon in groundwater varied between 710 and 1060 bq m3 with a median of 882 104 1 sd which was similar to radon concentrations in the surface water at low tide when maximum seepage is expected median radon concentrations in groundwater were 2 folds greater than those observed in the surface water 3 2 radon mass balance model surface water radon concentrations from the channel entrance at each measured time interval were multiplied by surface water discharge for the same time interval and integrated over three diel cycles based on the radon mass balance of measured sources and sinks it was found that tidal flow out of the system within each of diel cycles was the major radon loss and on average accounted for over 60 of total radon losses table 3 on average over the three diel cycles wind evasion accounted for 30 of total losses and the remaing loss was due to current evasion and radon radioactive decay table 3 the average calculated gas transfer velocity was 2 2 0 8 m d the most important source and sink of radon within the system wetland was from tidal flows ebb and flood indicating tides were the major driver of radon changes in the system for example the radon source to the wetland during flood tide were an order of magnitude higher than radon inputs from sediment diffusion and radon ingrowth indicating that advective flow was the dominant process in the system molecular diffusion rates from wetland sediments were small 5 2 1 5 bq m2 d and after upscaling to the whole wetland area accounted for less than 4 of all radon sources radon ingrowth from its parent isotope ra 226 was the smallest radon source the missing radon source to balance the equation was assumed to be groundwater inputs and was estimated by dividing the missing radon flux by the radon concentration in groundwater this resulted in a volumetric average subsurface flow of 0 13 0 05 m3 s over the three diel cycles considering the wetland area 113 330 m2 the subsurface flow was estimated to be 10 2 4 2 cm d on an areal basis table 3 over the three diel cycles results showed the highest net flow was during the 3rd diel cycle with an exfiltration of 4 9 2 2 cm d while the lowest net flow was during the 2nd diel cycle 2 0 8 cm d coinciding with the rainfall event fig 5 3 3 measured water temperatures and heat tracer analysis fig 6 presents the range of measured surface and groundwater temperatures per t array during the sampling period the temperature envelopes were drawn by connecting the maximum minimum and average temperatures measured per depth t4 located at the estuarine channel wetland entrance was constantly inundated and showed the smallest temperature range visible near the surface sediment interface i e 0 0 m the surface water temperature ranged from 17 1 c to 33 8 c for the other t arrays a temperature maximum of 36 8 c was measured at t2 and a minimum of 12 0 c at t3 while the temperature variation near the surface was very high it reduced strongly with depth below 0 23 m depth temperature varied less than 3 c at the deepest measurement location around 1 1 2 m below surface a maximum temperature of 21 0 c and a minimum of 19 2 c was observed while average temperatures are similar between t1 t3 t4 had higher average temperatures fig 5 shows the heat tracer derived vertical water exchange fluxes per diel cycle as vertical bars the results show temporal heterogeneity with values varying from an exfiltration fluxes of 13 9 cm d during the 1st diel cycle to infiltration fluxes of 18 8 cm d during the 3rd diel cycle while the exfiltration fluxes from the heat tracing method remain almost constant during the three measured diel cycles fig 5b the infiltration fluxes increase fig 5a the net flux during the 1st diel cycle is positive at 7 8 cm d but gradually shifts to a negative value of 6 2 cm d in the 3rd diel cycle fig 5c the heat tracer derived results were spatially extrapolated by assuming relative homogeneity across the wetland and assigning each t array to a representative part of the wetland to calculate volumetric subsurface flows the assigned areas covered 5 637 m2 for t4 and 44 334 m2 for t3 t1 and t2 cover 23 380 and 39 949 m2 respectively since t4 represented only the permanently inundated parts of the wetland its area was limited to the main channel during the three diel cycles a volumetric exfiltration of 33 919 m3 and an infiltration of 21 480 m3 was calculated resulting in a total exfiltration of 12 439 m3 summing up over the three tidal cycles a net exfiltration of 4 032 3 286 m3 d for the entire wetland was calculated equivalent to a vertical net subsurface flow of 4 3 2 9 cm d table 4 3 4 darcy s flow results hydraulic head in piezometers closest to the centre of the wetland i e c h l i d varied in a similar way following the tidal trend whereas piezometers located furthest away from the centre of the wetland i e a and f did not show significant variation fig 4 heads in piezometers a and c are shown as representative fig 7 shows groundwater flow maps for the highest and lowest tide during the measurement period during the highest tide hydraulic gradients were away from the central tidal channel and towards the fringes of the wetland indicating water being transported from the hunter river into the wetland via the central channel and then further distributed onto the mud flats fig 7a during the lowest tide the hydraulic gradients reverse and point towards the central tidal channel where subsurface water is drained exfiltration from the mud flats and transported out of the wetland via the central channel fig 7b due to the topography tidal waters did not affect water levels in piezometer f creating a reducing gradient from this piezometer towards the south channel of the hunter river during both high and low tide based on applying darcy s equation to the head data the highest net flow per unit width was from the transect of piezometers g h which also had the largest exfiltration at the lowest tide during the sampling period table 5 the smallest net flow per unit width was from piezometers e d overall estimated flows using darcy s equation showed nearly equal infiltration and exfiltration during each of the diel cycles over the sampling period resulting in small net flows the highest infiltration and exfiltration over the sampling period occurred during the 3rd diel cycle and were 3 8 2 0 and 6 2 2 9 cm d respectively as illustrated in fig 5 the average net flow per unit width from all piezometer transects was an exfiltration of 3 2 1 8 cm d which resulted in a volumetric flow of 792 420 m3 d the resulting flow from darcy s equation was 70 of those estimated from heat tracing and 30 of the flow calculated using the radon tracer 4 discussion limitations associated with each field method and their uncertainties arising as a consequence are explained below the dataset and subsurface flow processes occurring at the wetland as well as how each method captures these processes is then detailed the implications of the study regarding solute transport in coastal environments are also discussed 4 1 uncertainty and limitations of measurements 4 1 1 radon tracing the radon endmember concentration in groundwater is usually considered as the dominant source of uncertainty in a radon mass balance approach radon concentration can vary significantly over a small spatial scale and previous studies have used from 5 to 40 samples to determine the radon endmember concentration peterson et al 2008 su et al 2014 here we collected 14 groundwater samples spatially distributed across the site and located 1 km from the estuarine time series station to represent the groundwater radon composition at the wetland following recommendation from sadat noori et al 2015 the medianradon concentration 882 104 1 sd in groundwater samples was used as the endmember in the mass balance to calculate the radon derived subsurface flow the error associated with using this median concentration i e the standard error of all groundwater measurements is propagated through the subsurface flow calculations to highlight the uncertainty associated with this approach if the minimum radon groundwater endmember lowest value measured was used the exfiltration flow would increase by 25 and if the maximum radon groundwater endmember was used the exfiltration would decrease by 16 as radon is a gas quantifying losses through wind evasion can also be a source of uncertainty in the mass balance model dulaiova and burnett 2006 determining the gas transfer velocity k g through empirical gas exchange equations in dynamic coastal estuarine areas is often associated with some level of uncertainty burnett et al 2007 here we apply the most widely accepted gas exchange equation for estuarine environments in the literature borges et al 2004 the way in which wind speed data is incorporated into the overall radon wind evasion can also affect the results there is discrepancy in the literature regarding the best method to represent wind speed for radon wind evasion estimates previous studies have suggested using average wind speed data covering the sampling period dimova et al 2013 or averaged wind speed data from 5 to 10 days before sampling to account for the cumulated effect of evasion from the waterbody gilfedder et al 2015 in this study we use average daily 24 hrs cycle wind speeds if average daily wind speeds for a longer period e g 10 day was used no significant changes in radon wind evasion would occur i e resulting in similar subsurface flow rate as the variations in wind regime in the 10 day period before sampling was similar to the 24 h period before sampling sampling for longer periods and or several seasons could provide further insight in the variability of the groundwater surface water interaction processes however the long term deployment of such instrumentation is logistically and technically challenging 4 1 2 heat tracing three sources of error were investigated as part of the heat tracer analysis i influence of model parameters ii vertical uncertainty of the logger depth and iii model fit for i estimation errors on k of 0 1 wm k and on c with 0 3 106 j m3 k were assumed the average influence on the flux results was 1 2 cm d the error of a vertical misplacement of the t arrays of 2 cm yielded an error in the flow of 1 7 cm d the obtained errors were proportional with fluxes hence higher errors were found for higher fluxes the integration of errors yielded 2 9 cm d which was assigned to all calculated fluxes which is probably overstating the actual errors most heat tracing methods assume strictly 1d vertical flow within a homogeneous subsurface material natural sedimentary systems are usually a heterogeneous and layered structure karan et al 2013 in the investigated tidal wetland crab borrows and old root channels up to 0 1 m in diameter may have added preferential flow paths that cannot be simulated with point measurements and an assumption of homogenous conditions additionally even with perfect homogeneous conditions subsurface flow fields are 3d zlotnik and tartakovsky 2018 hence the predominant flow direction in the wetland may not be vertical or may shift in time from vertical to a more lateral direction such a behaviour could influence both the flux estimate and the volumetric flow calculation ferguson and bense 2011 lautz 2010 a further model assumption is a constant exchange flow during the modelled period while the exchange flow in the tidal wetland is thought to be variable in time the superposition of diurnal and tidal thermal signals may also influence the modelling results a model code like 1dtempro suffers from initialisation errors the subsurface temperature distribution at the start of the modelled time series is a linear interpolation of the measured starting values while the natural temperature distribution contains temperature information prior to the measurement 4 1 3 head gradients darcy s flow the largest uncertainty in the darcy flow calculations is the assignment of a value for hydraulic conductivity the value used in our study is derived from onsite head gradient measurements and the literature and we assign an uncertainty of 50 to the k sat value used in the calculations to account for potential errors associated with hydraulic conductivity if we use the higher end estimate of a k sat value of 10 m d in our study from the literature maximum exfiltration and infiltration fluxes would increase however the resulting net flux would not change significantly 3 8 2 3 cm day due to the integration of exfiltration and infiltration fluxes an additional source of error in using darcy s equation could be related to defining the subsurface cross section area of the flow we account for this in our estimation by assigning an uncertainty of 10 to both the length and the width of the cross sectional area further detailed geological studies would be required to get a better understanding of the subsurface cross sectional area for the study site 4 2 radon dynamics and related exchange fluxes radon accounts for total groundwater exchange i e fresh and saline terrestrial and recirculated as salinity has limited or no effect on radon concentrations in groundwater douglas et al 2020 here radon concentrations followed a clear tidal trend with high radon activity at low tide indicating groundwater exfiltration occurred at low tide mainly driven by the pressure gradient difference between groundwater and surface water levels at low tide fig 4 this is a common trend observed by others in coastal settings davis et al 2020 webb et al 2019 in such cases a significant inverse relationship between groundwater exfiltration and tidal height is expected call et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2017 as was also observed here fig 8 confirming that groundwater exfiltration was mostly driven by tidal pumping fig 4 fig 5c showed the lowest net flow occurred during the 2nd diel cycle which was caused by a shorter peak in surface water radon concentrations this in turn was due to radon dilution with rainwater during the time of the rainfall event fig 4 although the rainfall event could have influenced the subsurface flow the highest net flow observed in the 3rd diel cycle was most likely attributed to tidal range with larger peaks compared to previous tides causing a higher gradient between groundwater and surface water as the radon tracer was mainly driven by the tidal dynamics 4 3 measured temperatures and related exchange fluxes during the three diel cycles the temperature influence of tidal and radiation effects can be observed up to a depth of 0 05 m but do not affect any temperature measurements at 0 10 m and below fig 4 compared to t2 and t4 t1 and t3 show a strong temperature variation near the surface but the envelopes are narrower below 0 1 m depth and hence indicate less temperature variation in depth while the average temperatures for t1 t2 and t3 are very similar fig 6 t4 shows higher average temperatures these results indicate the transport of heat from the land surface into the sediment during measurements two phenomena may account for this namely i a different sediment composition with higher thermal conductivity and lower heat capacity as indicated in table 1 and or ii lower exfiltration or higher infiltration fluxes similar patterns of surface and groundwater temperatures were observed at another tidal location by halloran et al 2017 which in comparison to temperature time series measured in rivers are considerably more complex anibas et al 2016 driven by solar radiation diel temperature changes at the lands surface follow a sine function where during the day it heats up and during the night it cools down as they are also strongly influenced by tides fig 4 temperatures in a tidal wetland generally do not follow a sine wave the non stationary water levels in the wetland influences the subsurface temperatures during high tides high water levels dampen and delay subsurface temperature changes indicated by slower temperature rises during day and a delayed cooling during night high tides transport water from the hunter river estuary and hence its heat energy into the wetland which increases or decreases its subsurface temperature respectively for example high tides during night can create a temperature peak during low tides diel temperature changes are translated fast into the subsurface due to the decreasing heat capacity of the remaining water and eventually due to direct solar radiation on the sediment surface when not inundated the heat derived vertical net subsurface flow of 4 3 2 9 cm d was less than radon derived estimates but higher than darcy s flow heat tracer derived results indicate an increase in vertical infiltration flux over the three diel cycles while the exfiltration remains constant fig 5 this leads to a change from net exfiltration to a net infiltration during the three diel cycles this could be a consequence of the tidal range becoming larger towards the end of the measurement period e g approaching spring tide the rainfall event shortly prior to the 3rd diel cycle could also be responsible for this change in flow direction measured by the heat tracing method the rainfall could have temporally affected i e increased surface water levels and caused infiltrating conditions however the heat tracer derived flux results and their spatial upscaling yielded comparable values to the radon tracer experiment and darcy s flow calculations this clearly indicates the applicability of heat tracing in such highly dynamic environments as tidal wetlands the analysis of longer temperature timeseries measurements could reduce potential uncertainties in the quantification of subsurface flow using heat tracer in tidal wetlands 4 4 subsurface flow source recirculated seawater or regional flow regarding the magnitude and direction of subsurface flows the results of the three methods complimented and validated each other the values obtained with the three methods agreed within an order of magnitude hence the combination of methods increased the confidence in the flux calculations additionally this combination assisted in quantifying various flux processes explained below compared to a single method thereby providing a more holistic image of the system and its subsurface flows the three methods applied for this study provided different subsurface flow rates although all were within a similar range and indicative of net exfiltration during the study period table 6 while the net subsurface flow over the sampling period three diel cycles was positive exfiltration on shorter time scales e g during individual high and low tides flow direction changed from exfiltration to infiltration overall the system had a net discharge meaning that water was leaving the catchment mainly due to the general seaward gradient the radon derived flow represented the total subsurface flow to the wetland over the sampling period flows estimated from the heat and darcy s equation equated to 42 and 30 of the radon derived flow respectively other studies using multiple environmental methods to quantify subsurface flow in wetlands lakes have also reported darcy s equation producing the lowest flow rates compared to heat and isotope methods hunt et al 1996 mulligan and charette 2006 su et al 2016 here we interpret the darcy derived flow as mainly lateral subsurface flow and flow from heat tracing as vertical flow as the measurements are being done either along a predominantly horizontal plane or vertical plane respectively radon incorporated both total flows over the sampling period the difference in the estimated flows is likely because radon takes into account the discharging recirculated surface or seawater in addition to regional subsurface flows from the adjacent wetlands whereas the darcy calculation ignores the contribution from vertical gradients i e vertical upward gradients during low tide discharge the difference in fluxes can also indicate the influence of crab burrows and roots canals in increasing the porosity in the wetland s sediments which is not accounted for by heat tracing and head gradient methods fig 9 illustrates a conceptual model of the processes occurring and measured by each method at the wetland although the differences between the estimated fluxes are thought to be due to the vertical and horizontal orientation of the heat and head methods respectively the spatial scale of measurements can also explain part of these differences it is possible that exfiltration does not happen equally across the site due to spatial heterogeneity discharge can be high at certain locations where a narrow seepage face exists and consequently lower elsewhere the small scale heat and head installations may be localised and overlook exfiltration hotspots elsewhere on the tidal flat however radon integrates over the entire wetland including all zones of high and low flow the comparison of the three methods in table 6 indicate that the radon method provides a total discharge that is two to three times larger than the discharge estimated by the heat and head methods respectively this could indeed indicate that some seepage hotspots are not detected by the heat and head measurements while no information on the width of the seepage face is available for this wetland investigations elsewhere have shown seepage faces in the range of 1 200 m taniguchi et al 2003 surface water flow measurements at the entrance of the wetland indicated a net surface water discharge of 0 6 m3 s over the sampling period based on the subsurface flow estimates derived by the radon tracer which represented the total subsurface flow 0 13 m3 s subsurface flow contributed about 20 to the surface water exiting at the mouth of the wetland over this period this includes all subsurface flows from recirculated surface water seawater to regional fresh groundwater discharge leaving the catchment we assume the flow estimated by darcy s equation only represents the lateral regional subsurface flow and hence if subtracted from radon derived flow the remaining is likely to represent the recirculated surface water exchange this is defined as water that infiltrates the wetland during the flood tide and exchanges back out again during the ebb tide based on this approach the different components of the subsurface flow were separated and the contribution of the recirculated surface water component to the total subsurface flow leaving the wetlands was estimated to be 70 table 6 previous studies have shown that the recirculation component of the overall discharging subsurface flow in various coastal settings including tidal estuaries can be significant andersen et al 2007 beebe and lowery 2018 hays and ullman 2007 sadat noori et al 2016a 4 5 implications for dissolved material transport as coastal wetlands are amongst the most productive ecosystems on earth flow discharging from their sediment acts as a source and pathway for transporting solutes such as nutrients carbon trace metals and any other dissolved chemical into coastal waters porubsky et al 2014 on a global scale studies have shown that nutrient delivered to coastal waters through subsurface flow can rival those delivered by rivers cho et al 2018 additionally studies from asia hwang et al 2005 north america su et al 2014 europe leote et al 2008 australia makings et al 2014 and the mediterranean rodellas et al 2015 have linked coastal water eutrophication to dissolved chemicals delivered by subsurface flow this subsurface flow can either be meteoric regional groundwater or recirculated surface sea water each having different chemical signatures and nutrient loads moore 2010 therefore it is important to separate and accurately estimate these two flow components as this is essential for understanding their effect on the function and maintenance of coastal ecosystems burnett et al 2001 weinstein et al 2011 solute or dissolved chemical transport from sediments is usually estimated by multiplying the endmember concentration of the chemical in groundwater by the discharging subsurface flow rate beck et al 2015 with the latter part playing a significant role in the overall flux estimation the three methods used here had inherent differences and quantified overlapping physical processes however this allowed for distingushing the two components of the discharging subsurface flow within the system in studies focuing on biocgeochemical cycles and element budgets such information will contribute to better understanding the export flux of dissolved matter which has implications for quantifying coastal wetland chemical budgets such as for carbon and nitrogen moore 2006 santos et al 2019 in this study the resulting discharge estimates show that a variety of methods are needed to understand subsurface flow regimes across the land water boundary in coastal wetlands and quantify sediment solute transport 5 conclusions this study relied on three independent methods including head gradients and two natural groundwater tracers radon and heat to quantify subsurface flow in a coastal tidal wetland the simultaneous application of the three techniques in a tidal environment revealed that results from the radon mass balance were 3 folds larger than the heat tracing technique and those calculated by hydraulic gradient we highlight that these differences are thought to be driven by the different nature of the methods and by method specific sources of bias but more important that each method measures separate parts of the system while radon accounted for the total subsurface flow terrestrial regional flow and recirculated seawater head gradients represented lateral flow exfiltrating into the wetland surface water on the other hand heat tracers presented vertical subsurface flows solely relying on head gradients or heat may underestimate the flow rate and consequently the solute flux transported from tidal wetland to coastal waters however using heat or head methods provides additional valuable information to determine the terrestrial component of the subsurface flow radon measurements do not allow for high resolution temporal flux estimates which heat and head methods are capable of producing our work has implication for subsurface flow quantification in tidal environments as subsurface flow in tidal wetlands can significantly control the transport of dissolved matter to surface water in the future we recommend improving the robustness of field studies based on the methods employed in this study by increasing the spatial density of measurement points and longer field deployments to extend the observation periods it should be noted that this is usually constrained by the budget and availability of personnel for example having an additional radon measuring station located at the upstream parts of the wetland in addition to one at the mouth would allow for dividing the wetland into two compartment and thereby disaggregating the measurements this would help reducing some of the uncertainties when developing the radon mass balance model deploying two piezometers next to each other with screens at different depths can provide measurements of vertical hydraulic gradients and the vertical subsurface flow using darcy s equation if the hydraulic conductivity is also measured longer observation periods would provide a wider range of conditions and natural variability regardless of the method in particular longer periods of temperature observations e g 1 month would reduce data inversion uncertainties associated with this method overall a robust assessment of subsurface flow at any tidal wetland requires a combination of

4559,subsurface flow plays an important role in the functioning of wetlands and in the maintenance of their ecosystem services specifically the transport and exchange of dissolved matter between sediments and surface waters is regulated by subsurface flow which can strongly affect ecological zonation and productivity having a quantitative understanding of this subsurface flow is therefore important field techniques based on darcy s equation or natural tracers are often used separately to assess flows here radon and heat both natural groundwater tracers and darcy s equation are used simultaneously to quantify the subsurface flow in a tidal wetland kooragang island newcastle australia and the results of the independent methods are compared a steady state radon mass balance model indicated an overall net subsurface exfiltration of 10 2 4 2 cm d while a 1d vertical fluid heat transport model indicated a net exfiltration of 4 3 2 9 cm d flow estimated from analysis of hydraulic heads indicated an exfiltration rate of 3 2 1 8 cm d the difference in flow rates is likely due to the localised measurement of the heat and head methods relative to radon and therefore these methods are less likely to capture zones of preferential subsurface flow the main advantage of radon is that it provides the total subsurface flow regardless of the driving force while head gradient or heat tracer method have the advantage of temporally quantify infiltration and exfiltration we highlight that these methods may underestimate subsurface flows in highly dynamic coastal systems such as tidal wetlands where a large portion of the subsurface flow is recirculated seawater this could potentially lead to errors in solute flux estimates this study highlights the importance of employing a multi

surface water interactions anibas et al 2011 mccallum et al 2014 sadat noori et al 2016b and or estimate subsurface physical properties vandersteen et al 2015 several studies in freshwater environments have shown that multiple technique tracer approaches provide more robust and reliable results as different tracers are based on different physical principles detect different aspects of groundwater flow and have different advantages unland et al 2013 radon 222 is a noble gas with very low chemical reactivity that is usually enriched in groundwater relative to surface water peterson et al 2019 radon is produced in sediments via the decay of the radium 226 isotope radon decays with a half life of 3 8 days and this relative short half life and volatility means that it does not travel far in surface waters from its location of discharge hence its presence indicates local subsurface water discharge burnett 2008 heat tracing uses temperature variations at different depth in the subsurface to model the quantity and temporal spatial changes of the vertical component of groundwater movement by applying analytical and or numerical solutions of combined heat conduction and advective transport previous research using the heat tracing technique has focused mainly on the hyporheic zones of rivers and wetlands anibas et al 2012 bravo et al 2002 rau et al 2010 or tested the limits of applicability in temporal and spatial dimensions rau et al 2015 roshan et al 2012 sebok and müller 2019 in a coastal wetland groundwater surface water exchange is highly variable with changing flow directions during each tidal cycle del pilar alvarez et al 2015 this dynamic behavior of groundwater surface water interaction adds to the complexity of hydrologic and thermal processes found in non tidal wetlands and may be the reason why heat tracing is rarely used in coastal wetlands befus et al 2013 additionally often tidal wetlands are inaccessible and the deployment of a network of measurement devices is challenging to date studies using the heat tracer in coastal kurylyk et al 2019 swain and prinos 2018 or tidal settings halloran et al 2017 are limited radon and heat tracers can be used independently to investigate groundwater surface water interactions navarro martinez et al 2017 however researchers advise that multiple lines of evidence by combining different techniques can validate results and overcome limitations of a single method dujardin et al 2014 gilfedder et al 2015 the traditional technique to investigate subsurface flow is by hydraulic gradients which may underestimate subsurface flow compared to other techniques mulligan and charette 2006 su et al 2016 studies combining radon and heat tracers are limited to inland waterbodies and focus on river water infiltrating aquifers and residence time calculations of hyporheic groundwater cranswick et al 2014 hoehn and cirpka 2006 vogt et al 2010 heat tracing in the sediment allows for the calculation of subsurface flow at shorter temporal resolution than radon and can distinguish between infiltration and exfiltration heat tracing however provides point data and spatial extrapolation is associated with large uncertainty radon on the other hand does not have this problem with spatial uncertainty as it smooths out spatial heterogeneity and provides the total subsurface flow integrated over a certain time period calculating an estimate of the temporal resolution that is less than the tidal frequency via the radon technique is only possible using a detailed numerical model our study builds on the only available heat study in a tidal setting tidal creek in the literature halloran et al 2017 and aims to extend subsurface flow quantification in coastal wetlands that are dominated by tidal inundation to achieve this aim the study utilises time series measurements of both radon and heat tracers as well as hydraulic heads in groundwater discharge zones the flow directions are complex and varying in relation to the measurement location in the subsurface but also varying over time with wave action and tidal stage rakhimbekova et al 2018 turner et al 2016 flow directions are further complicated by density effects when both fresh and saline water are discharging andersen et al 2007 within the discharge zone vertical flows may dominate but varying in direction with the tidal stage while further inland flows are predominantly horizontal this dependence of location needs to be taken into consideration when designing field studies the radon tracer technique has the advantage of providing information on the total subsurface flow regardless of its salinity or subsurface source burnett et al 2007 for example when used in tidal environments radon integrates the discharge of both fresh regional and saline water originating from the surface but circulated through the subsurface su et al 2014 for both heat tracing and darcy methods the location and geometry of the observations field deployment needs to be considered for heat tracing studies temperature sensors are traditionally deployed vertically in the sediment for practical reasons and therefore mostly deployed directly in the discharge zone for such deployments the heat tracer technique will provide only the vertical component of flow regardless of whether the water is fresh or saline rau et al 2014 depending on the relative location of piezometer screens the darcy method can be used to determine either vertical or horizontal hydraulic head gradients in the discharge zone vertical gradients can be determined by two or more piezometers with screened intervals vertically arranged further landward laterally spaced piezometers can determine the horizontal fresh groundwater hydraulic head gradients the gradients can be converted to flows provided the hydraulic conductivity distribution between the screens is known appropriately quantifying the hydraulic conductivity distribution is one of the main challenges and source of uncertainty with the darcy method when the methods described above are used alone different quantitative results may be achieved representing either an integrated value radon or the particular parts of the system being observed heat and darcy however when the different methods are used in combination they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system and therefore add more confidence in the findings when results are in agreement the objective of this study is to evaluate groundwater surface water interactions in a tidal wetland using three independent methods simultaneously to 1 compare the methods of quantifying subsurface flow against each other 2 assess the capability of the heat tracer method in quantifying subsurface flow in tidal settings and 3 quantify various sources of the total subsurface flow by disaggregating the subsurface processes through jointly interpreting the techniques used at the study site 2 material and method

m wide tidal estuarine channel intertidal mudflats cover an area of 113 330 m2 of the overall catchment area 240 000 m2 the wetland has no upstream surface water inputs its hydrology is dominated by a semi diurnal tidal regime with spring and neap tides the wetland sediment is composed primarily of silt with numerous crab burrows across the intertidal zone that can increase permeability and facilitate porewater circulation stieglitz et al 2013 the top 0 3 m of the sediment has a muddy texture with partly decayed organic matter while the remaining sediment profile is dominated by estuarine silt and sand until 5 m below the surface the area did not receive any rainfall in the 15 days prior to the fieldwork however on 29th november 2018 during the field sampling there was a 20 mm rainfall event the site was selected for its small catchment area and narrow estuarine mouth which helps constrain the area under investigation additionally the site was secure from the public interfering with installations yet accessible for deploying measurement instrumentation the eastern and southern parts of kooragang island are characterized by a combination of port facilities and industrial land use but the majority of the island to the north and west is part of the kooragang nature reserve the island consists of unconsolidated quaternary sediments fig 2 and its hydrogeology is comprised of two sand aquifers a shallow unconfined and a deeper confined aquifer the shallow aquifer extends to a depth of 5 m the two aquifers are separated by a clay aquitard layer which has a thickness of 4 m robinson 2006 the unconfined aquifer of primary interest to this study is primarily recharged by rainfall directly within the nature reserve and the general groundwater flow on the island in the unconfined aquifer is towards the south channel of the hunter river estuary jones 2013 on the island the water table in this aquifer has been identified at depths of 0 3 to 1 5 m from the surface 2 2 surface water measurements fieldwork was carried out from 26th november 2nd december 2018 to install equipment and collect surface and groundwater data including radon hydraulic heads temperature time series and water quality measurements surface water physico chemical parameters were measured using a calibrated multiparameter water quality sonde ysi exo2 variables including salinity water temperature 0 01 c and depth 0 004 m were collected at 15 min intervals wind speed data 10 was collected onsite using a weather station model ph1000 current velocity direction and water depth were measured in the center of the tidal channel using a sontek argonaut acoustic doppler current profiler adcp at 10 min intervals the channel cross section depth was measured every 2 m at high tide assuming a homogeneous current velocity across the channel water level changes at shorter intervals were deemed to generally be below the measurement uncertainty and measurements at finer spatial scales than 2 m did not improve the accuracy of the flow estimate surface water discharge out of the wetland was estimated by multiplying wetted area per unit time by current velocity and integrating over time 2 3 radon in surface water radon time series measurements were conducted over the course of the fieldwork in the tidal channel at the wetland outlet fig 1 surface water was pumped from 0 2 m beneath the water surface at a rate of 2 5 l min into an air water exchanger that allowed the radon concentrations in air and water to equilibrate through a closed air loop system burnett and dulaiova 2003 the air was then pumped into a radon detector rad7 which measured radon concentrations every 30 min by detecting the α emitting daughters of radon 214 218po dulaiova et al 2005 the radon concentration in water was calculated based on the gas solubility incorporating the effects of water temperature and salinity schubert et al 2012 a 30 min lag time correction which is required for radon to reach equilibrium using this approach was applied to the data schubert et al 2012 2 4 radon diffusion from sediments and ingrowth three sediment samples from the wetland and up to 0 2 m depth were collected brought back to the laboratory placed in gas tight containers with radium free water sediment to water ratio by volume 0 2 and sealed for at least one month for measuring radon molecular diffusion from sediments the system was regularly mixed by tilting the water inside the containers was then collected into a 6l gas tight plastic bottle from the bottom up preventing any effects of heterogeneity within the core for radon measurements using a rad7 as described above lee and kim 2006 the principle behind this experiment was that after a month equal to 6 radon half lives the source emanation and diffusion and sink decay of the radon will reach steady state secular equilibrium within the sediment core santos and eyre 2011 to estimate radon ingrowth from the decay of dissolved radium 226ra as radon s parent isotope 40l containers were used to collect surface water at two low and two high tides the water was then filtered through a column containing 0 015 0 020 kg manganese oxide impregnated fibre which absorb 226ra moore 2003 the fibres were sealed and left for at least one month before 226ra concentration analysis following established procedures kim et al 2001 2 5 radon mass balance subsurface flow was estimated through a radon mass balance model developed based on time series measurements of radon following peterson et al 2019 the mass balance was calculated for three diel cycles with the final radon derived subsurface flow calculated as an aggregate of the resulting net flow from each of the diel cycles the mass balance model considers all known sources of radon incoming flow diffusion from sediments ingrowth from parent isotopes and inputs from porewater and sinks of radon outgoing flow atmospheric evasion and radioactive decay and assumes the missing radon to balance the model is provided by subsurface flow as follows 1 q gw 222 r n gw q in 222 r n in q dif a 222 r a λ 222 v q out 222 r n out 222 r n λ 222 v j atm where q gw is

ostwald solubility coefficient dimensionless describing the distribution of radon at equilibrium as the fluid to gas ratio and k g is the gas transfer velocity at the air water boundary which is driven by wind current and water depth in tidal environments the value of k g m d was calculated for each time interval using eqs 3 and 4 separately and the sum was used in equation 2 borges et al

during the sampling period wind speed ranged from 0 to 11 m s the area of the entire wetland 113 330 m2 was used to upscale wind evasions however only the estuarine tidal channel area 5 637 m2 was used to determine current driven evasions as currents in the intertidal mudflats approached zero 2 6 radon in groundwater groundwater samples n 14 were collected from the intertidal mudflat zones during low tides a hand auger was used to install shallow 0 05 m diameter pvc pipe piezometers up to depths of 2 m with 0 5 m long screens the piezometers were purged three times before collecting a sample using a peristaltic pump a 6l gas tight nalgene hdpe high density polyethylene bottle was used to collect and measure radon concentrations in groundwater samples were analysed in less than 24 hrs by connecting each bottle to a rad7 radon monitor device and running for at least 2 h to achieve an air water radon equilibrium with 5 uncertainty following standard protocols lee and kim 2006 2 7 measurement of temperature time series to gather temperature and water level time series four representative measurement locations were chosen within the tidal wetland and equipped with t arrays t1 to t4 fig 1 t4 was placed downstream near the mouth of the tidal channel of the wetland and approximately 5 m from the radon measurement location t2 was placed upstream where the wetlands main channel was shallow and narrow the other two t arrays were placed in the intertidal mudflats north t1 and south t3 of the tidal channel t4 was continuously inundated therefore its setting was similar to measurements in a riverbed rau et al 2014 the other t arrays experienced variable tidal inundation and exposure where due to their mud flat locations t1 and t3 experienced the longest periods of exposure the t arrays were purpose made fig 3 each consisted of two pvc pipes 0 032 m in diameter a 1 8 m long and a 1 m short pipe respectively the bottom 0 2 m of the long pipes were screened with a screen depth of around 1 1 2 m below surface while the short pipes were screened over the entire length the short pipes were entirely submerged during high tides the tops of the long pipes were continuously above the highest tidal level and vented to the atmosphere single temperature loggers solinst levelogger edge model 3001 were installed in the long pipes in the short pipes leveloggers were installed to measure surface water temperatures while additional loggers measured at 5 depths in the sediment at 0 02 and 0 05 m depth tidbit v2 utbi 001 were used these loggers were small and could therefore be placed close together to measure temperature at narrow depth intervals near the surface the three deeper temperature loggers at 0 10 0 23 and 0 42 m were hobo water temperature pro v2 u22 001 the measurement interval of all loggers was 60 s to account for potential variations in temperature data due to different logger types the temperature offsets between loggers were recorded in a water bath and the collected field data corrected for the offset to a common reference field measurements of bulk sediment thermal conductivity k and bulk heat capacity c were measured using a kd2 pro thermal properties analyzer field instrument the thermal properties were measured at different depths in the mudflats t1 and t3 in the upper part of the channel t2 and in the deep section of the channel near t4 thirty four measurements were performed in total hence several values were obtained at each location and depth for the heat transport analysis values presented in table 1 were applied for each individual t array 2 8 heat transport model the measured temperature time series were used to estimate vertical exchange fluxes in the tidal wetland by applying combined heat and fluid transport modelling based on the one dimensional vertical transport solution of suzuki 1960 and stallman 1965 they describe the one dimensional vertical anisothermal transport of fluid and heat through homogeneous porous media as 5 k 2 t z 2 q z c w t z c t t where k is the thermal conductivity of the soil water matrix in w mk t is the temperature in k at depth z at time t in the sediment c w is the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid in j m3k c the saturated volumetric heat capacity of the sediment fluid matrix in j m3k q z the vertical component of the darcy velocity in m s for convenience we use the unit of cm d a negative q z corresponds to water flowing from the surface into the sediment infiltration while a positive q z indicates flow from the sediment out to surface exfiltration the analysis of the analytical solution for eq 5 was conducted with the open access model environment 1dtemppro koch et al 2016 the physical sediment properties needed for 1dtemppro are bulk k c and the porosity of the saturated sediment ϕs a porosity ϕs of 0 60 was chosen for the site as reported by the nsw department of primary industries 2008 for the heat conduction and advective transport model the boundary conditions are defined at the interface between surface water and sediment i e a depth of 0 0 m at the uppermost logger of the short pipe and the location of the deepest logger in the subsurface located in the long pipe the other temperature time series are used to fit measured and modelled data the model was applied to each single high and low tide and integrated over three diel cycles i e the same period as for radon most parts of the wetland drained during low tides with visible seepage patterns it was assumed that although seepage has happened a saturated sediment profile remains present the 1dtemppro model calculates and integrates vertical exchange fluxes over the modelled period by changing its value until a minimal difference between modelled and measured subsurface temperature distribution is reached for presentation purposes this is expressed by the root mean square error rmse the quality of the model output was classified by the average rmse per t array and its standard deviation 2 9 darcy s flow calculation the piezometers used for calculating the subsurface flow were the same as those used for groundwater sampling water levels were measured every 15 min with solinst leveloggers placed in each piezometer the top of all piezometer was surveyed to australian height datum ahd using a trimble 5800 rtk gps real time kinematic global positioning system accurate to less than 20 mm the subsurface flow was calculated based on hydraulic heads for time increments of 15 min with negative values indicating infiltration and positive values representing exfiltration subsurface flow per unit width i e through a 1 m 1 m area perpendicular to the flow direction was calculated for each diel cycle separately by integrating the rising and falling head gradient data over each diel cycle the flow calculation was completed for all transects piezometers a c f d g h j i and m l and an average calculated darcy s law follows eq 6 darcy

perforated with animal burrows similar to the study site here is suggested to range from 1 to 10 m d susilo and ridd 2005 based on hydraulic head gradient measurements in conjunction with heat tracer derived fluxes a range of vertical hydraulic conductivities of 0 1 to 5 m d was estimated for the site here based on field data and the literature a k sat value of 5 m d was used and the distance between each piezometer was determined in arcgis v10 5 interpolation of hydraulic heads for creating groundwater maps was also prepared in arcgis v10 5 using the inverse weighted distance method sadat noori et al 2013 3 results 3 1 surface water time series and groundwater observations observed surface water levels indicated a semi diurnal tidal behaviour with water depths ranging from 0 1 to 1 7 m in the estuarine tidal channel entrance of the wetland during measurements fig 4 salinity was mostly at oceanic values 35 ppt and slightly increased during ebb tides during the rainfall event freshening occurred and surface water salinity dropped to 17 ppt surface water temperature ranged between 17 2 and 29 4 c and generally decreased at low tide flow velocity in the estuarine channel reduced at low tide and varied between 0 002 and 0 09 m s radon followed a trend opposite to the tides with concentrations increasing at low tide and decreasing at high tide ranging from 20 to 850 bq m3 groundwater in the wetland was hypersaline and salinity varied between 42 1 and 51 7 ppt across the wetland table 2 median groundwater temperature was 22 5 c which was one degree lower than median surface water temperature radon in groundwater varied between 710 and 1060 bq m3 with a median of 882 104 1 sd which was similar to radon concentrations in the surface water at low tide when maximum seepage is expected median radon concentrations in groundwater were 2 folds greater than those observed in the surface water 3 2 radon mass balance model surface water radon concentrations from the channel entrance at each measured time interval were multiplied by surface water discharge for the same time interval and integrated over three diel cycles based on the radon mass balance of measured sources and sinks it was found that tidal flow out of the system within each of diel cycles was the major radon loss and on average accounted for over 60 of total radon losses table 3 on average over the three diel cycles wind evasion accounted for 30 of total losses and the remaing loss was due to current evasion and radon radioactive decay table 3 the average calculated gas transfer velocity was 2 2 0 8 m d the most important source and sink of radon within the system wetland was from tidal flows ebb and flood indicating tides were the major driver of radon changes in the system for example the radon source to the wetland during flood tide were an order of magnitude higher than radon inputs from sediment diffusion and radon ingrowth indicating that advective flow was the dominant process in the system molecular diffusion rates from wetland sediments were small 5 2 1 5 bq m2 d and after upscaling to the whole wetland area accounted for less than 4 of all radon sources radon ingrowth from its parent isotope ra 226 was the smallest radon source the missing radon source to balance the equation was assumed to be groundwater inputs and was estimated by dividing the missing radon flux by the radon concentration in groundwater this resulted in a volumetric average subsurface flow of 0 13 0 05 m3 s over the three diel cycles considering the wetland area 113 330 m2 the subsurface flow was estimated to be 10 2 4 2 cm d on an areal basis table 3 over the three diel cycles results showed the highest net flow was during the 3rd diel cycle with an exfiltration of 4 9 2 2 cm d while the lowest net flow was during the 2nd diel cycle 2 0 8 cm d coinciding with the rainfall event fig 5 3 3 measured water temperatures and heat tracer analysis fig 6 presents the range of measured surface and groundwater temperatures per t array during the sampling period the temperature envelopes were drawn by connecting the maximum minimum and average temperatures measured per depth t4 located at the estuarine channel wetland entrance was constantly inundated and showed the smallest temperature range visible near the surface sediment interface i e 0 0 m the surface water temperature ranged from 17 1 c to 33 8 c for the other t arrays a temperature maximum of 36 8 c was measured at t2 and a minimum of 12 0 c at t3 while the temperature variation near the surface was very high it reduced strongly with depth below 0 23 m depth temperature varied less than 3 c at the deepest measurement location around 1 1 2 m below surface a maximum temperature of 21 0 c and a minimum of 19 2 c was observed while average temperatures are similar between t1 t3 t4 had higher average temperatures fig 5 shows the heat tracer derived vertical water exchange fluxes per diel cycle as vertical bars the results show temporal heterogeneity with values varying from an exfiltration fluxes of 13 9 cm d during the 1st diel cycle to infiltration fluxes of 18 8 cm d during the 3rd diel cycle while the exfiltration fluxes from the heat tracing method remain almost constant during the three measured diel cycles fig 5b the infiltration fluxes increase fig 5a the net flux during the 1st diel cycle is positive at 7 8 cm d but gradually shifts to a negative value of 6 2 cm d in the 3rd diel cycle fig 5c the heat tracer derived results were spatially extrapolated by assuming relative homogeneity across the wetland and assigning each t array to a representative part of the wetland to calculate volumetric subsurface flows the assigned areas covered 5 637 m2 for t4 and 44 334 m2 for t3 t1 and t2 cover 23 380 and 39 949 m2 respectively since t4 represented only the permanently inundated parts of the wetland its area was limited to the main channel during the three diel cycles a volumetric exfiltration of 33 919 m3 and an infiltration of 21 480 m3 was calculated resulting in a total exfiltration of 12 439 m3 summing up over the three tidal cycles a net exfiltration of 4 032 3 286 m3 d for the entire wetland was calculated equivalent to a vertical net subsurface flow of 4 3 2 9 cm d table 4 3 4 darcy s flow results hydraulic head in piezometers closest to the centre of the wetland i e c h l i d varied in a similar way following the tidal trend whereas piezometers located furthest away from the centre of the wetland i e a and f did not show significant variation fig 4 heads in piezometers a and c are shown as representative fig 7 shows groundwater flow maps for the highest and lowest tide during the measurement period during the highest tide hydraulic gradients were away from the central tidal channel and towards the fringes of the wetland indicating water being transported from the hunter river into the wetland via the central channel and then further distributed onto the mud flats fig 7a during the lowest tide the hydraulic gradients reverse and point towards the central tidal channel where subsurface water is drained exfiltration from the mud flats and transported out of the wetland via the central channel fig 7b due to the topography tidal waters did not affect water levels in piezometer f creating a reducing gradient from this piezometer towards the south channel of the hunter river during both high and low tide based on applying darcy s equation to the head data the highest net flow per unit width was from the transect of piezometers g h which also had the largest exfiltration at the lowest tide during the sampling period table 5 the smallest net flow per unit width was from piezometers e d overall estimated flows using darcy s equation showed nearly equal infiltration and exfiltration during each of the diel cycles over the sampling period resulting in small net flows the highest infiltration and exfiltration over the sampling period occurred during the 3rd diel cycle and were 3 8 2 0 and 6 2 2 9 cm d respectively as illustrated in fig 5 the average net flow per unit width from all piezometer transects was an exfiltration of 3 2 1 8 cm d which resulted in a volumetric flow of 792 420 m3 d the resulting flow from darcy s equation was 70 of those estimated from heat tracing and 30 of the flow calculated using the radon tracer 4 discussion limitations associated with each field method and their uncertainties arising as a consequence are explained below the dataset and subsurface flow processes occurring at the wetland as well as how each method captures these processes is then detailed the implications of the study regarding solute transport in coastal environments are also discussed 4 1 uncertainty and limitations of measurements 4 1 1 radon tracing the radon endmember concentration in groundwater is usually considered as the dominant source of uncertainty in a radon mass balance approach radon concentration can vary significantly over a small spatial scale and previous studies have used from 5 to 40 samples to determine the radon endmember concentration peterson et al 2008 su et al 2014 here we collected 14 groundwater samples spatially distributed across the site and located 1 km from the estuarine time series station to represent the groundwater radon composition at the wetland following recommendation from sadat noori et al 2015 the medianradon concentration 882 104 1 sd in groundwater samples was used as the endmember in the mass balance to calculate the radon derived subsurface flow the error associated with using this median concentration i e the standard error of all groundwater measurements is propagated through the subsurface flow calculations to highlight the uncertainty associated with this approach if the minimum radon groundwater endmember lowest value measured was used the exfiltration flow would increase by 25 and if the maximum radon groundwater endmember was used the exfiltration would decrease by 16 as radon is a gas quantifying losses through wind evasion can also be a source of uncertainty in the mass balance model dulaiova and burnett 2006 determining the gas transfer velocity k g through empirical gas exchange equations in dynamic coastal estuarine areas is often associated with some level of uncertainty burnett et al 2007 here we apply the most widely accepted gas exchange equation for estuarine environments in the literature borges et al 2004 the way in which wind speed data is incorporated into the overall radon wind evasion can also affect the results there is discrepancy in the literature regarding the best method to represent wind speed for radon wind evasion estimates previous studies have suggested using average wind speed data covering the sampling period dimova et al 2013 or averaged wind speed data from 5 to 10 days before sampling to account for the cumulated effect of evasion from the waterbody gilfedder et al 2015 in this study we use average daily 24 hrs cycle wind speeds if average daily wind speeds for a longer period e g 10 day was used no significant changes in radon wind evasion would occur i e resulting in similar subsurface flow rate as the variations in wind regime in the 10 day period before sampling was similar to the 24 h period before sampling sampling for longer periods and or several seasons could provide further insight in the variability of the groundwater surface water interaction processes however the long term deployment of such instrumentation is logistically and technically challenging 4 1 2 heat tracing three sources of error were investigated as part of the heat tracer analysis i influence of model parameters ii vertical uncertainty of the logger depth and iii model fit for i estimation errors on k of 0 1 wm k and on c with 0 3 106 j m3 k were assumed the average influence on the flux results was 1 2 cm d the error of a vertical misplacement of the t arrays of 2 cm yielded an error in the flow of 1 7 cm d the obtained errors were proportional with fluxes hence higher errors were found for higher fluxes the integration of errors yielded 2 9 cm d which was assigned to all calculated fluxes which is probably overstating the actual errors most heat tracing methods assume strictly 1d vertical flow within a homogeneous subsurface material natural sedimentary systems are usually a heterogeneous and layered structure karan et al 2013 in the investigated tidal wetland crab borrows and old root channels up to 0 1 m in diameter may have added preferential flow paths that cannot be simulated with point measurements and an assumption of homogenous conditions additionally even with perfect homogeneous conditions subsurface flow fields are 3d zlotnik and tartakovsky 2018 hence the predominant flow direction in the wetland may not be vertical or may shift in time from vertical to a more lateral direction such a behaviour could influence both the flux estimate and the volumetric flow calculation ferguson and bense 2011 lautz 2010 a further model assumption is a constant exchange flow during the modelled period while the exchange flow in the tidal wetland is thought to be variable in time the superposition of diurnal and tidal thermal signals may also influence the modelling results a model code like 1dtempro suffers from initialisation errors the subsurface temperature distribution at the start of the modelled time series is a linear interpolation of the measured starting values while the natural temperature distribution contains temperature information prior to the measurement 4 1 3 head gradients darcy s flow the largest uncertainty in the darcy flow calculations is the assignment of a value for hydraulic conductivity the value used in our study is derived from onsite head gradient measurements and the literature and we assign an uncertainty of 50 to the k sat value used in the calculations to account for potential errors associated with hydraulic conductivity if we use the higher end estimate of a k sat value of 10 m d in our study from the literature maximum exfiltration and infiltration fluxes would increase however the resulting net flux would not change significantly 3 8 2 3 cm day due to the integration of exfiltration and infiltration fluxes an additional source of error in using darcy s equation could be related to defining the subsurface cross section area of the flow we account for this in our estimation by assigning an uncertainty of 10 to both the length and the width of the cross sectional area further detailed geological studies would be required to get a better understanding of the subsurface cross sectional area for the study site 4 2 radon dynamics and related exchange fluxes radon accounts for total groundwater exchange i e fresh and saline terrestrial and recirculated as salinity has limited or no effect on radon concentrations in groundwater douglas et al 2020 here radon concentrations followed a clear tidal trend with high radon activity at low tide indicating groundwater exfiltration occurred at low tide mainly driven by the pressure gradient difference between groundwater and surface water levels at low tide fig 4 this is a common trend observed by others in coastal settings davis et al 2020 webb et al 2019 in such cases a significant inverse relationship between groundwater exfiltration and tidal height is expected call et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2017 as was also observed here fig 8 confirming that groundwater exfiltration was mostly driven by tidal pumping fig 4 fig 5c showed the lowest net flow occurred during the 2nd diel cycle which was caused by a shorter peak in surface water radon concentrations this in turn was due to radon dilution with rainwater during the time of the rainfall event fig 4 although the rainfall event could have influenced the subsurface flow the highest net flow observed in the 3rd diel cycle was most likely attributed to tidal range with larger peaks compared to previous tides causing a higher gradient between groundwater and surface water as the radon tracer was mainly driven by the tidal dynamics 4 3 measured temperatures and related exchange fluxes during the three diel cycles the temperature influence of tidal and radiation effects can be observed up to a depth of 0 05 m but do not affect any temperature measurements at 0 10 m and below fig 4 compared to t2 and t4 t1 and t3 show a strong temperature variation near the surface but the envelopes are narrower below 0 1 m depth and hence indicate less temperature variation in depth while the average temperatures for t1 t2 and t3 are very similar fig 6 t4 shows higher average temperatures these results indicate the transport of heat from the land surface into the sediment during measurements two phenomena may account for this namely i a different sediment composition with higher thermal conductivity and lower heat capacity as indicated in table 1 and or ii lower exfiltration or higher infiltration fluxes similar patterns of surface and groundwater temperatures were observed at another tidal location by halloran et al 2017 which in comparison to temperature time series measured in rivers are considerably more complex anibas et al 2016 driven by solar radiation diel temperature changes at the lands surface follow a sine function where during the day it heats up and during the night it cools down as they are also strongly influenced by tides fig 4 temperatures in a tidal wetland generally do not follow a sine wave the non stationary water levels in the wetland influences the subsurface temperatures during high tides high water levels dampen and delay subsurface temperature changes indicated by slower temperature rises during day and a delayed cooling during night high tides transport water from the hunter river estuary and hence its heat energy into the wetland which increases or decreases its subsurface temperature respectively for example high tides during night can create a temperature peak during low tides diel temperature changes are translated fast into the subsurface due to the decreasing heat capacity of the remaining water and eventually due to direct solar radiation on the sediment surface when not inundated the heat derived vertical net subsurface flow of 4 3 2 9 cm d was less than radon derived estimates but higher than darcy s flow heat tracer derived results indicate an increase in vertical infiltration flux over the three diel cycles while the exfiltration remains constant fig 5 this leads to a change from net exfiltration to a net infiltration during the three diel cycles this could be a consequence of the tidal range becoming larger towards the end of the measurement period e g approaching spring tide the rainfall event shortly prior to the 3rd diel cycle could also be responsible for this change in flow direction measured by the heat tracing method the rainfall could have temporally affected i e increased surface water levels and caused infiltrating conditions however the heat tracer derived flux results and their spatial upscaling yielded comparable values to the radon tracer experiment and darcy s flow calculations this clearly indicates the applicability of heat tracing in such highly dynamic environments as tidal wetlands the analysis of longer temperature timeseries measurements could reduce potential uncertainties in the quantification of subsurface flow using heat tracer in tidal wetlands 4 4 subsurface flow source recirculated seawater or regional flow regarding the magnitude and direction of subsurface flows the results of the three methods complimented and validated each other the values obtained with the three methods agreed within an order of magnitude hence the combination of methods increased the confidence in the flux calculations additionally this combination assisted in quantifying various flux processes explained below compared to a single method thereby providing a more holistic image of the system and its subsurface flows the three methods applied for this study provided different subsurface flow rates although all were within a similar range and indicative of net exfiltration during the study period table 6 while the net subsurface flow over the sampling period three diel cycles was positive exfiltration on shorter time scales e g during individual high and low tides flow direction changed from exfiltration to infiltration overall the system had a net discharge meaning that water was leaving the catchment mainly due to the general seaward gradient the radon derived flow represented the total subsurface flow to the wetland over the sampling period flows estimated from the heat and darcy s equation equated to 42 and 30 of the radon derived flow respectively other studies using multiple environmental methods to quantify subsurface flow in wetlands lakes have also reported darcy s equation producing the lowest flow rates compared to heat and isotope methods hunt et al 1996 mulligan and charette 2006 su et al 2016 here we interpret the darcy derived flow as mainly lateral subsurface flow and flow from heat tracing as vertical flow as the measurements are being done either along a predominantly horizontal plane or vertical plane respectively radon incorporated both total flows over the sampling period the difference in the estimated flows is likely because radon takes into account the discharging recirculated surface or seawater in addition to regional subsurface flows from the adjacent wetlands whereas the darcy calculation ignores the contribution from vertical gradients i e vertical upward gradients during low tide discharge the difference in fluxes can also indicate the influence of crab burrows and roots canals in increasing the porosity in the wetland s sediments which is not accounted for by heat tracing and head gradient methods fig 9 illustrates a conceptual model of the processes occurring and measured by each method at the wetland although the differences between the estimated fluxes are thought to be due to the vertical and horizontal orientation of the heat and head methods respectively the spatial scale of measurements can also explain part of these differences it is possible that exfiltration does not happen equally across the site due to spatial heterogeneity discharge can be high at certain locations where a narrow seepage face exists and consequently lower elsewhere the small scale heat and head installations may be localised and overlook exfiltration hotspots elsewhere on the tidal flat however radon integrates over the entire wetland including all zones of high and low flow the comparison of the three methods in table 6 indicate that the radon method provides a total discharge that is two to three times larger than the discharge estimated by the heat and head methods respectively this could indeed indicate that some seepage hotspots are not detected by the heat and head measurements while no information on the width of the seepage face is available for this wetland investigations elsewhere have shown seepage faces in the range of 1 200 m taniguchi et al 2003 surface water flow measurements at the entrance of the wetland indicated a net surface water discharge of 0 6 m3 s over the sampling period based on the subsurface flow estimates derived by the radon tracer which represented the total subsurface flow 0 13 m3 s subsurface flow contributed about 20 to the surface water exiting at the mouth of the wetland over this period this includes all subsurface flows from recirculated surface water seawater to regional fresh groundwater discharge leaving the catchment we assume the flow estimated by darcy s equation only represents the lateral regional subsurface flow and hence if subtracted from radon derived flow the remaining is likely to represent the recirculated surface water exchange this is defined as water that infiltrates the wetland during the flood tide and exchanges back out again during the ebb tide based on this approach the different components of the subsurface flow were separated and the contribution of the recirculated surface water component to the total subsurface flow leaving the wetlands was estimated to be 70 table 6 previous studies have shown that the recirculation component of the overall discharging subsurface flow in various coastal settings including tidal estuaries can be significant andersen et al 2007 beebe and lowery 2018 hays and ullman 2007 sadat noori et al 2016a 4 5 implications for dissolved material transport as coastal wetlands are amongst the most productive ecosystems on earth flow discharging from their sediment acts as a source and pathway for transporting solutes such as nutrients carbon trace metals and any other dissolved chemical into coastal waters porubsky et al 2014 on a global scale studies have shown that nutrient delivered to coastal waters through subsurface flow can rival those delivered by rivers cho et al 2018 additionally studies from asia hwang et al 2005 north america su et al 2014 europe leote et al 2008 australia makings et al 2014 and the mediterranean rodellas et al 2015 have linked coastal water eutrophication to dissolved chemicals delivered by subsurface flow this subsurface flow can either be meteoric regional groundwater or recirculated surface sea water each having different chemical signatures and nutrient loads moore 2010 therefore it is important to separate and accurately estimate these two flow components as this is essential for understanding their effect on the function and maintenance of coastal ecosystems burnett et al 2001 weinstein et al 2011 solute or dissolved chemical transport from sediments is usually estimated by multiplying the endmember concentration of the chemical in groundwater by the discharging subsurface flow rate beck et al 2015 with the latter part playing a significant role in the overall flux estimation the three methods used here had inherent differences and quantified overlapping physical processes however this allowed for distingushing the two components of the discharging subsurface flow within the system in studies focuing on biocgeochemical cycles and element budgets such information will contribute to better understanding the export flux of dissolved matter which has implications for quantifying coastal wetland chemical budgets such as for carbon and nitrogen moore 2006 santos et al 2019 in this study the resulting discharge estimates show that a variety of methods are needed to understand subsurface flow regimes across the land water boundary in coastal wetlands and quantify sediment solute transport 5 conclusions this study relied on three independent methods including head gradients and two natural groundwater tracers radon and heat to quantify subsurface flow in a coastal tidal wetland the simultaneous application of the three techniques in a tidal environment revealed that results from the radon mass balance were 3 folds larger than the heat tracing technique and those calculated by hydraulic gradient we highlight that these differences are thought to be driven by the different nature of the methods and by method specific sources of bias but more important that each method measures separate parts of the system while radon accounted for the total subsurface flow terrestrial regional flow and recirculated seawater head gradients represented lateral flow exfiltrating into the wetland surface water on the other hand heat tracers presented vertical subsurface flows solely relying on head gradients or heat may underestimate the flow rate and consequently the solute flux transported from tidal wetland to coastal waters however using heat or head methods provides additional valuable information to determine the terrestrial component of the subsurface flow radon measurements do not allow for high resolution temporal flux estimates which heat and head methods are capable of producing our work has implication for subsurface flow quantification in tidal environments as subsurface flow in tidal wetlands can significantly control the transport of dissolved matter to surface water in the future we recommend improving the robustness of field studies based on the methods employed in this study by increasing the spatial density of measurement points and longer field deployments to extend the observation periods it should be noted that this is usually constrained by the budget and availability of personnel for example having an additional radon measuring station located at the upstream parts of the wetland in addition to one at the mouth would allow for dividing the wetland into two compartment and thereby disaggregating the measurements this would help reducing some of the uncertainties when developing the radon mass balance model deploying two piezometers next to each other with screens at different depths can provide measurements of vertical hydraulic gradients and the vertical subsurface flow using darcy s equation if the hydraulic conductivity is also measured longer observation periods would provide a wider range of conditions and natural variability regardless of the method in particular longer periods of temperature observations e g 1 month would reduce data inversion uncertainties associated with this method overall a robust assessment of subsurface flow at any tidal wetland requires a combination of
