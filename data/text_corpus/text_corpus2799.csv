substance for existence of life in the universe in recent years industrialization agricultural activities rapid population growth and urbanization contribute extensively to the high levels of agrochemicals heavy metals dyes and organic pollutants 1 3 among these pollutants exposure of heavy metals in aqueous solution makes a severe threat to environment along with several health issues such as lung cancer as well as various renal problems occurs due to their non biodegradability and toxicity 4 6 several metals like hg ii cr iii pb ii cd ii and as iii are considered as either known or probable human carcinogens 7 9 the environmental protection agency has set the maximum permissible exposure limit for pb ii and hg ii in drinking water i e less than 0 015 and 0 002 mg l 1 respectively 10 as a result there is highly demand to adsorb these toxic metals from aqueous medium before their release into the environment 11 13 nowadays several techniques have been practically

disadvantages such as high energy supplies fewer effectiveness incomplete elimination weak equipped environment and expensive disposal among these techniques adsorption is the mainly broadly used method for the elimination of toxic metals from contaminated water 17 20 therefore several adsorbents such as clays zeolite natural products activated carbon and polymeric resin have been use for the

functional groups which can be tune according to the requirements 22 24 25 previously several polymer based adsorbents have been used for the adsorption of heavy metal from the contaminated water due to the availability of the various functional groups 26 29 however pure polymers have some limitations such as low stability and separation of the adsorbents from wastewater after adsorption treatment especially in powdered form 24 30 31 if the used adsorbent can be recovered efficiently it can be regenerated and re used to minimize the capital investment on the other hand magnetic polymer nanocomposites are new kind of hybrid organic inorganic materials with unique properties such as high surface area excellent environmental stability presence of active functional groups with high adsorption capacity as well as easily separated using external magnet 32 34 keeping these ideas in our mind herein we fabricate the magnetic polymer nanocomposite using ethylenediaminediacetic edda

was added to this mixture the resulting brown precipitate was formed instantly representing the formation of copper ferrite nanoparticles the reaction solution was stirred at 90 c for 6 h resulting nanoparticles were separated using external magnet washed with distilled water and dried in vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h and stored for further use 2 2 preparation of the magnetic nanocomposite the magnetic nanocomposite was prepared using edda and glutaraldehyde eg cufe2o4 3 52 g 2 mmol edda was mixed in 20 ml distilled water and 2 0 g of previously fabricated cufe2o4 nanoparticles was added to this solution the mixture was sonicate and 5 ml of glutaraldehyde was added into the above mixture the ph of resulting mixture was adjust 8 using naoh solution and the temperature was maintained at 70 c for 3 h the resulting viscous mixture was precipitated in aqueous solution and separated using external magenta and dried in vacuum to get the eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite power the fabricated nanocomposite was characterized via several analytical techniques and used for the adsorption of hg ii and pb ii from aqueous solution details is given in supporting information 3 results and discussions the magnetic polymeric nanocomposite was prepared using edda and glutaraldehyde in at ph 8 and the synthetic route was illustrated in fig 1 the results exposed that the cufe2o4 are fine embedded into the polymer matrix resulting nanocomposite so magnetic behavior the results of elemental study explained that nanocomposite contains c 45 23 h 4 44 n 10 42 fe 8 23 and cu 4 82 the presence of the functional groups in the nanocomposites was supported via ftir spectra as shown in fig 2 a it is clear that eg cufe2o4 shows peaks at 3448 and 1715 cm 1 which are corresponding to the oh and carbonyl co groups respectively 35 another bands appear at 2960 2844 cm 1 are associated with ch stretching vibration for symmetric asymmetric stretching respectively cn stretching 36 other bands at the bands at 1594 1146 998 and 952 cm 1 for eg cufe2o4 were attributed to co2 νc n νc c ch2coo and νc c ch2cooh bending vibrations respectively the presence of the cufe2o4 nanoparticles in the nanocomposites shows the stretching vibrations in low region 550 and 410 cm 1 the absorption peak located in 400 450 cm 1 is due to the presence of octahedral m2 o2 on the other hand the peak at 540 600 cm 1 is due to the tetrahedral m3 o2 bond and assigned to the constructed tetragonal structure of copper ferrite nanoparticles 37 38 the tga curve of the fabricated nanocomposite and the cufe2o4 are shown in fig 2 b the fabricated eg cufe2o4 was decomposed in three steps the first step was observed form room temperature to 200 c in this region only 5 60 and 5 00 weight loss was found with eg cufe2o4 and cufe2o4 respectively 39 the second degradation stage was notices between 200 and 500 c in this region 15 23 weight loss was found with the nanocomposite and the last degradation is the fast degradation and was found between 500 and 600 c in the third step about to 53 34 weight loss was observed the adsorbent show the residue weight about to 23 92 at 850 c due to the presence of the metal oxides 40 42 xrd patterns for the cufe2o4 and eg cufe2o4 are shown in fig 3 a the xrd spectrum of cufe2o4 nanoparticles show diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 22 35 44 43 26 53 61 57 04 and 62 68 were indexed to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of cubic spinal cufe2o4 icsd no 98 015 3013 43 on the other hand the xrd spectrum of the eg cufe2o4 supports the presence of the cufe2o4 nanoparticles due to the presence of the similar diffraction peaks however the diffraction peaks become less intense and broad corresponding to the amorphous behavior of polymer matrix and observed in the region between 2θ 14 and 26 the xrd pattern of eg cufe2o4 showed that the existence of the polymer matrix in to the nanocomposites does not destroy the structure and chemistry of cufe2o4 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm as well as the equivalent pore size distribution curves of the nanocomposite is shown in fig 3 b and the outcomes reveals that the eg cufe2o4 showed a typical iupac type iv pattern suggesting the presence of mesoporous 44 it is observed that the eg cufe2o4 exhibit a bet specific surface area of 226 34 m2 g 1 and the maximum pore size distribution is around 30 nm with a relatively broad size distribution proposing a macroporous and mesoporous structure of the nanocomposite these pores were improved the absorption of pollutants providing close contact between adsorbent surface and adsorbate materials the particle sizes and morphologies of the fabricated eg cufe2o4 were shown by sem image as illustrated in supporting fig 1 the fesem image as shown in fig 4 a show that the nanocomposite has rough and rugged surfaces amorphous and porous nature with embedded with spherical non uniform size cufe2o4 nanoparticles with the range of 10 15 nm some cufe2o4 nanoparticles are aggregated with each other in the polymer matrix exhibit some aggregation which should be caused by magnetization in the magnetic separation process fig 4 b illustrate tem of the eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite it shows the cufe2o4 nanoparticles are agglomerated as shown in the sem image the cufe2o4 nanoparticles are spherical shape and the average size was found to be 13 nm the hrtem image has been taken on a cufe2o4 nanoparticles and illustrated in fig 4 c the nanoparticles show the distance of the lattice planes d spacing are measured and found to be 0 248 and which are support to the 211 plane of cufe2o4 nanoparticles 45 the saed pattern illustrate in fig 4 d and found the diffraction rings belongs to the 111 200 311 511 and 440 planes and support the existence of the cufe2o4 nanoparticles after mixing with the eg cufe2o4 mixed composite during the fabrication or tem grid preparation 46 the surface composition and the state of the elements in the nanocomposite is determine using xps the wild xps spectrum of the nanocomposite show the existence of c o n fe iii and cu ii as illustrated in fig 5 a the c1s spectrum of nanocomposite can be split into four bands as shown in fig 5 b at binding energies of 283 6 285 4 286 4 and 288 7 ev corresponding to cc cn co and oc o groups respectively the coh peak at 286 4 ev and oc o peak at 288 7 ev support the presence of carboxyl functional groups 47 the n 1s spectrum of eg cufe2o4 can be divided into two component peaks at 400 2 ev and 398 9 ev corresponding to n atoms in nc3 and nh respectively as shown in fig 5 c the appearance of the peak at 400 2 ev supports the polymerization of the edda with glutaraldehyde the o 1s peak as shown in fig 5 d is decomposed into four fitted peaks with binding energies located at 529 6 ev 530 34 ev and 532 80 ev attributed to cuo feo co and co respectively 48 as shown in fig 4 e the typical peaks at 710 9 and 724 2 ev can be attributed to fe 2p3 2and fe 2p1 2 and the shakeup satellites peaks at 718 3 ev and 726 1 ev are found the above signs confirm the existence of fe iii into magnetic eg cufe2o4 49 fig 5 f show the xps spectrum for cu2p the main peaks at 932 3 ev and 952 4 ev are assigned to the binding energy for 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively and support the existence of cu ii on octahedral sites the satellite peaks at 939 6 ev 2p3 2 941 8 ev 2p3 2 and 960 4 ev 2p1 2 represented cu ii on tetrahedral sites 50 vsm was carried out to examine the magnetic capability of the fabricated nanocomposite to be used as a magnetic adsorbent and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a and both the cufe2o4 nanoparticles and the nanocomposite typical hysteresis loops when subjected to a periodically reversing magnetic field the results revealed that high saturation magnetization ms was found to be 48 7 and 31 7 emu g 1 for the cufe2o4 nanoparticles and the eg cufe2o4 respectively 51 the corrective force hc were found to be 542 2 0 8 oe in both cases on the other hand rtentivity were found to be 23 31 emu and 14 11 emu for cufe2o4 nanoparticles and eg cufe2o4 respectively it was observed that the saturation magnetization was found lower in the case for nanocomposite the cufe2o4 nanoparticles due to the presence of diamagnetic polymers while the width of the loop is not affected into the polymer matrix however the eg cufe2o4 adsorbent still had a good magnetism so that it recovered easily by magnetic separation the zeta potentials of the eg cufe2o4 with several ph values was calculated the zeta potentials of eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite decreased with the increasing the ph values from 2 to 11 and illustrated in fig 6 b the point of zero charge pzc was determined as 4 79 that show electrophilic nature as well as positive charge surface below the pzc while nucleophilic nature negative charge surface is found above 4 79 at lower ph the carboxylate groups were protonated however at higher ph value they lose their protons the negative charge was increased on the whole nanocomposite at neutral the eg cufe2o4 surface exhibited a negative charged because of the effects of the carboxylate groups 4 adsorption assay 4 1 effect of solution ph the ph value of pollutants solutions acts key role in the adsorption it will not only change the surface charge of the fabricated eg cufe2o4 but also the functional groups and metal ions chemistry also as shown form the fig 7 a it was observed that in the case of both metal hg ii and pb ii the adsorption capacity was increased with increasing the ph from 2 to 6 and found to be 188 44 mg g 1 and 171 74 mg g 1 respectively at ph 6 however when the ph of the solution was increased more than 6 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was reduced this is because at lower ph level the protons h are available on the surface of the eg cufe2o4 which repels the positively change hg ii and pb ii ions however when the ph was increased from 2 to 6 the repulsion between the metal ions and the h are decreased and promote the better adsorption of hg ii and pb ii ions on the eg cufe2o4 in addition according to zeta potentials and point of zero charge pzc of the eg cufe2o4 at higher ph the surface of the adsorbent become negatively charge and enhance the electrostatic attraction with both hg ii and pb ii ions to increase the adsorption process on the other hand at ph more than 6 5 the metal ions started to precipitate the adsorption efficiency of the eg cufe2o4 was decreased 52 therefore the best absorption for both hg ii and pb ii ions was found at ph 6 and this ph was used for further experiments as optimal 4 2 effect of concentration to investigation of initial concentration for the adsorption of both the metal ions the adsorption was measured at initial concentration in the range of 5 200 mg l 1 of hg ii and pb ii at optimal ph fig 7 b shows the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of eg cufe2o4 for hg ii and pb ii the adsorption capacity was observed to increase sharply with increasing initial concentration up 80 mg g 1 after this concentration the adsorption efficiency of the nanocomposite increased slowly and at 200 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of the eg cufe2o4 was found to be 224 41 and 218 36 mg g 1 for pb ii and hg ii respectively this state of saturation can be attributed to the occupation of the majority of the available active sites on the adsorbent surface by metal ions at 80 mg l 1 initial concentration 53 therefore there was no a clear improvement in the adsorption of hg ii and pb ii amount at higher concentration of these ions 4 3 effect of contact time contact time is also one of the most important factors affecting adsorption capacity and experimentally optimized using optimal ph 6 and initial concentration 80 mg l 1 equilibrium time experiments revealed that the adsorption of both hg ii and pb ii was a time dependent process and illustrated in fig 7 c it results revealed that initially a rapid adsorption of hg ii ions over eg cufe2o4 nanocomposites was increased with increasing adsorption time and after 60 min the adsorption of hg ii ions become sallow where in the case of pb ii ions the adsorption increased upto 100 min and then increased slowly 37 54 55 therefore these times were selected as the optimum contact time for all further experiments 4 4 effect of temperature the adsorption capacity of the fabricated nanocomposites was also determined after changing the temperature of the adsorption experiments with other optimal conditions ph 6 time 60 min for hg ii and 100 min for pb ii initial concentration 80 mg l 1 and the results are illustrated in fig 7 d the adsorption results revealed that the adsorption of both metal ions was increase as the temperature was increased the highest adsorption capacity in the case of hg ii ions is noticed to be 216 4 mg g at 318 k 54 the adsorption capacities are found to be 188 4 192 2 202 9 and214 8 mg g at 298 k 303 k 308 k 313 k and 318 k respectively on the other hand the adsorption of pb ii ions is enhanced from 171 74 to 201 40 mg g as the temperature was increased from 298 k to 318 k indicating that the adsorption was an endothermic process 4 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms can be determined by the adsorption process and mechanism the langmuir freundlich and temkin models are employed to explain the characteristic of the nonlinear adsorption isotherms 56 58 the monolayer adsorption of the metal ions over the nanocomposites was describe using langmuir model as shown as follows 7 q e k l q m a x c e 1 k l c e where ce and qe is equilibrium concentration of hg ii and pb ii and the adsorption capacity of eg cufe2o4 at equilibrium qmax is the amount of hg ii and pb ii adsorbed to afford monolayer coverage and kl is the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm deal with both homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces and both physical and chemical adsorption the nonlinear freundlich isotherm is expressed as follows 8 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g 1 and n are the freundlich constants the temkin isotherm has generally been applied in the following nonlinear form as follows 9 q e r t b t l n k t c where kt l gm is temkin isotherm constant bt is temkin constant which is related to the heat of sorption j mol the nonlinear plots isotherms are presented in fig 8 a and b and their parameters are recorded in supporting table 1 according to high r2 values as 0 9814 and 0 9903 for hg ii and pb ii respectively the langmuir isotherm provides a satisfactory fit to the isotherm results than freundlich and temkin isotherm the fact that the langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data very well may be due to homogenous distribution of active sites on the adsorbents surface langmuir isotherm is generally suitable for describing the chemisorption process when ionic or covalent chemical bonds are formed between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 4 6 adsorption kinetics in order to figure out the adsorption mechanism the non linear pseudo first order pfo model and pseudo second order pso models and intraparticle diffusion model were used 8 59 60 the pseudo first order nonlinear model is generally described as follows 3 q t q e q e e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts adsorbed per unit mass at equilibrium and at any time t and k1 is the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant the pseudo second order kinetic is based on the adsorption equilibrium capacity of the solid phase to uptake ions the nonlinear model is shown as follows 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant to study the diffusion mechanism the intraparticle diffusion model was used which is represented in the following equation 5 q t k d i f t 1 2 c where kdif mmol g 1 min 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate coefficient c is constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer the nonlinear form of these kinetic models are fitted and illustrated in fig 8 c and d and the important kinetic parameters obtained from experimental data fitting are summarized in supporting table 2 after comparing the correlation coefficient values of these models it is clear that the adsorption of both hg ii and pb ii ions onto eg cufe2o4 follows pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 99 in the adsorption for both metals rather than first order and intra particle diffusion furthermore there is a good agreement between the calculated and experimental qe values for both hg ii and pb ii ions this agreement confirms that the pseudo second order kinetic model is well describing the obtained kinetic results and the adsorption is chemisorption process in nature previous works also demonstrated that the pseudo second order kinetic model could be used to show the kinetics of metal ions 4 7 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamics parameters for the adsorption of both the metals pb ii and hg ii over eg cufe2o4 were calculated based on the van t hoff equation 58 61 as shown below eqs 9 and 10 9 l n k c δ s r δ h r t 10 δ g δ h t δ s where δg δh and δs are the gibb s free energy change enthalpy and entropy change while kc is an equilibrium constant which is equal to qe ce from the linear fittings of lnkc against 1 t for hg ii and pb ii adsorption on eg cufe2o4 are illustrated in fig 9 a and the results are summarized in supporting table 3 the positive values of δh and δs show that the adsorption was an endothermic process and increased with increasing temperatures a negative gibbs free energy change indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous 4 8 reusability study the recyclability of the adsorbent would affect production costs and save adsorption time which would show great importance in practical uses to study the recyclability of eg cufe2o4 after the adsorption of the metal ions the samples was washed using 0 1 m hcl 62 the regenerated eg cufe2o4 nanocomposites was reused for next cycles and the results are illustrated in fig 9 b it was observed that after seven cycles the regenerated nanocomposites show 179 54 mg g 1 and 160 23 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for hg ii and pb ii respectively these results indicates that in acidic medium the sorbent surface has hydrogen ions well pronounced on it allowing for desorption of positively charged ions and used for next cycles with excellent adsorption efficiency as shown in fig 10 4 9 adsorption mechanism to understand the adsorption mechanism the adsorption of pb ii and hg ii were carried out over pure cufe2o4 nanoparticles pure polymer eg and the nanocomposite eg cufe2o4 at optimal condition as shown in supporting fig 2 the results revealed that the adsorption was carried out via polymer while the cufe2o4 nanoparticles did not exhibit adsorption capacity and were used only for the magnetic separation the high adsorption capacity of hg ii and pb ii onto eg cufe2o4 can be summarized in fig 10 the amino and carboxylic acid functional groups provided the binding sites due to the presence of lone pair of electron over nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms respectively these donor functional groups behave as lewis bases which can donate their available electron pairs to metal ions which behave as a lewis acids therefore the adsorbent makes coordinate covalent bond with metal ions and adsorbed to further understand the interaction mechanism the ftir and xps studies were performed by choosing hg ii and pb ii adsorption as a representative case the ftir spectra as shown in fig 10 a revealed that the peaks in the region 3200 3400 cm 1 become sharp and less broadness when compared with the eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite this is because after the adsorption of the metal ions the hydrogen bonding decreased due to deprotonation of the adsorbent the adsorption of pb ii and hg ii was further supported using xps analysis the xps analysis after the absorption of pb ii and hg ii are illustrated in fig 10 b the xps results for eg hg ii cufe2o4 show some additional peaks at 103 ev due to hg 4f on the other and in the case of eg pb ii cufe2o4 one sharp peaks at 140 2 ev support the adsorption of pb4f these xps results revealed that both the metal ions are in bivalent species that indicated that hg ii and pb ii cations were not reduced to metallic hg and pb respectively and confirmed the coordination adsorption mechanism 5 conclusion in this study we have fabricated a magnetic nanocomposite as an adsorbent contains amino and carboxylic groups like a polymeric form of edta eg cufe2o4 show fast kinetics excellent re usability excellent adsorption capacity for hg ii and pb ii the fabricated nanocomposite was characterized using several analytical techniques the influence of ph suggests the optimal adsorption value is 6 the adsorption kinetics of both the metal ions on to eg cufe2o4 fitted with the pseudo second order model additionally the adsorption data corresponded well to the langmuir isotherm model and the maximum removal capacity was approximately 188 4 mg g 1 and 171 74 mg g 1 for hg ii and pb ii at 298 k the adsorption thermodynamic results show that the adsorption of both the metal is spontaneous the interaction between heavy metals and eg cufe2o4 was further supported using ftir and the xps the present work revealed that the as synthesized eg cufe2o4 could be used as an efficient and magnetic adsorbent for removing heavy metallic ions from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest or

the fast degradation and was found between 500 and 600 c in the third step about to 53 34 weight loss was observed the adsorbent show the residue weight about to 23 92 at 850 c due to the presence of the metal oxides 40 42 xrd patterns for the cufe2o4 and eg cufe2o4 are shown in fig 3 a the xrd spectrum of cufe2o4 nanoparticles show diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 22 35 44 43 26 53 61 57 04 and 62 68 were indexed to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of cubic spinal cufe2o4 icsd no 98 015 3013 43 on the other hand the xrd spectrum of the eg cufe2o4 supports the presence of the cufe2o4 nanoparticles due to the presence of the similar diffraction peaks however the diffraction peaks become less intense and broad corresponding to the amorphous behavior of polymer matrix and observed in the region between 2θ 14 and 26 the xrd pattern of eg cufe2o4 showed that the existence of the polymer matrix in to the nanocomposites does not destroy the structure and chemistry of cufe2o4 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm as well as the equivalent pore size distribution curves of the nanocomposite is shown in fig 3 b and the outcomes reveals that the eg cufe2o4 showed a typical iupac type iv pattern suggesting the presence of mesoporous 44 it is observed that the eg cufe2o4 exhibit a bet specific surface area of 226 34 m2 g 1 and the maximum pore size distribution is around 30 nm with a relatively broad size distribution proposing a macroporous and mesoporous structure of the nanocomposite these pores were improved the absorption of pollutants providing close contact between adsorbent surface and adsorbate materials the particle sizes and morphologies of the fabricated eg cufe2o4 were shown by sem image as illustrated in supporting fig 1 the fesem image as shown in fig 4 a show that the nanocomposite has rough and rugged surfaces amorphous and porous nature with embedded with spherical non uniform size cufe2o4 nanoparticles with the range of 10 15 nm some cufe2o4 nanoparticles are aggregated with each other in the polymer matrix exhibit some aggregation which should be caused by magnetization in the magnetic separation process fig 4 b illustrate tem of the eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite it shows the cufe2o4 nanoparticles are agglomerated as shown in the sem image the cufe2o4 nanoparticles are spherical shape and the average size was found to be 13 nm the hrtem image has been taken on a cufe2o4 nanoparticles and illustrated in fig 4 c the nanoparticles show the distance of the lattice planes d spacing are measured and found to be 0 248 and which are support to the 211 plane of cufe2o4 nanoparticles 45 the saed pattern illustrate in fig 4 d and found the diffraction rings belongs to the 111 200 311 511 and 440 planes and support the existence of the cufe2o4 nanoparticles after mixing with the eg cufe2o4 mixed composite during the fabrication or tem grid preparation 46 the surface composition and the state of the elements in the nanocomposite is determine using xps the wild xps spectrum of the nanocomposite show the existence of c o n fe iii and cu ii as illustrated in fig 5 a the c1s spectrum of nanocomposite can be split into four bands as shown in fig 5 b at binding energies of 283 6 285 4 286 4 and 288 7 ev corresponding to cc cn co and oc o groups respectively the coh peak at 286 4 ev and oc o peak at 288 7 ev support the presence of carboxyl functional groups 47 the n 1s spectrum of eg cufe2o4 can be divided into two component peaks at 400 2 ev and 398 9 ev corresponding to n atoms in nc3 and nh respectively as shown in fig 5 c the appearance of the peak at 400 2 ev supports the polymerization of the edda with glutaraldehyde the o 1s peak as shown in fig 5 d is decomposed into four fitted peaks with binding energies located at 529 6 ev 530 34 ev and 532 80 ev attributed to cuo feo co and co respectively 48 as shown in fig 4 e the typical peaks at 710 9 and 724 2 ev can be attributed to fe 2p3 2and fe 2p1 2 and the shakeup satellites peaks at 718 3 ev and 726 1 ev are found the above signs confirm the existence of fe iii into magnetic eg cufe2o4 49 fig 5 f show the xps spectrum for cu2p the main peaks at 932 3 ev and 952 4 ev are assigned to the binding energy for 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively and support the existence of cu ii on octahedral sites the satellite peaks at 939 6 ev 2p3 2 941 8 ev 2p3 2 and 960 4 ev 2p1 2 represented cu ii on tetrahedral sites 50 vsm was carried out to examine the magnetic capability of the fabricated nanocomposite to be used as a magnetic adsorbent and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a and both the cufe2o4 nanoparticles and the nanocomposite typical hysteresis loops when subjected to a periodically reversing magnetic field the results revealed that high saturation magnetization ms was found to be 48 7 and 31 7 emu g 1 for the cufe2o4 nanoparticles and the eg cufe2o4 respectively 51 the corrective force hc were found to be 542 2 0 8 oe in both cases on the other hand rtentivity were found to be 23 31 emu and 14 11 emu for cufe2o4 nanoparticles and eg cufe2o4 respectively it was observed that the saturation magnetization was found lower in the case for nanocomposite the cufe2o4 nanoparticles due to the presence of diamagnetic polymers while the width of the loop is not affected into the polymer matrix however the eg cufe2o4 adsorbent still had a good magnetism so that it recovered easily by magnetic separation the zeta potentials of the eg cufe2o4 with several ph values was calculated the zeta potentials of eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite decreased with the increasing the ph values from 2 to 11 and illustrated in fig 6 b the point of zero charge pzc was determined as 4 79 that show electrophilic nature as well as positive charge surface below the pzc while nucleophilic nature negative charge surface is found above 4 79 at lower ph the carboxylate groups were protonated however at higher ph value they lose their protons the negative charge was increased on the whole nanocomposite at neutral the eg cufe2o4 surface exhibited a negative charged because of the effects of the carboxylate groups 4 adsorption assay 4 1 effect of solution ph the ph value of pollutants solutions acts key role in the adsorption it will not only change the surface charge of the fabricated eg cufe2o4 but also the functional groups and metal ions chemistry also as shown form the fig 7 a it was observed that in the case of both metal hg ii and pb ii the adsorption capacity was increased with increasing the ph from 2 to 6 and found to be 188 44 mg g 1 and 171 74 mg g 1 respectively at ph 6 however when the ph of the solution was increased more than 6 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was reduced this is because at lower ph level the protons h are available on the surface of the eg cufe2o4 which repels the positively change hg ii and pb ii ions however when the ph was increased from 2 to 6 the repulsion between the metal ions and the h are decreased and promote the better adsorption of hg ii and pb ii ions on the eg cufe2o4 in addition according to zeta potentials and point of zero charge pzc of the eg cufe2o4 at higher ph the surface of the adsorbent become negatively charge and enhance the electrostatic attraction with both hg ii and pb ii ions to increase the adsorption process on the other hand at ph more than 6 5 the metal ions started to precipitate the adsorption efficiency of the eg cufe2o4 was decreased 52 therefore the best absorption for both hg ii and pb ii ions was found at ph 6 and this ph was used for further experiments as optimal 4 2 effect of concentration to investigation of initial concentration for the adsorption of both the metal ions the adsorption was measured at initial concentration in the range of 5 200 mg l 1 of hg ii and pb ii at optimal ph fig 7 b shows the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of eg cufe2o4 for hg ii and pb ii the adsorption capacity was observed to increase sharply with increasing initial concentration up 80 mg g 1 after this concentration the adsorption efficiency of the nanocomposite increased slowly and at 200 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of the eg cufe2o4 was found to be 224 41 and 218 36 mg g 1 for pb ii and hg ii respectively this state of saturation can be attributed to the occupation of the majority of the available active sites on the adsorbent surface by metal ions at 80 mg l 1 initial concentration 53 therefore there was no a clear improvement in the adsorption of hg ii and pb ii amount at higher concentration of these ions 4 3 effect of contact time contact time is also one of the most important factors affecting adsorption capacity and experimentally optimized using optimal ph 6 and initial concentration 80 mg l 1 equilibrium time experiments revealed that the adsorption of both hg ii and pb ii was a time dependent process and illustrated in fig 7 c it results revealed that initially a rapid adsorption of hg ii ions over eg cufe2o4 nanocomposites was increased with increasing adsorption time and after 60 min the adsorption of hg ii ions become sallow where in the case of pb ii ions the adsorption increased upto 100 min and then increased slowly 37 54 55 therefore these times were selected as the optimum contact time for all further experiments 4 4 effect of temperature the adsorption capacity of the fabricated nanocomposites was also determined after changing the temperature of the adsorption experiments with other optimal conditions ph 6 time 60 min for hg ii and 100 min for pb ii initial concentration 80 mg l 1 and the results are illustrated in fig 7 d the adsorption results revealed that the adsorption of both metal ions was increase as the temperature was increased the highest adsorption capacity in the case of hg ii ions is noticed to be 216 4 mg g at 318 k 54 the adsorption capacities are found to be 188 4 192 2 202 9 and214 8 mg g at 298 k 303 k 308 k 313 k and 318 k respectively on the other hand the adsorption of pb ii ions is enhanced from 171 74 to 201 40 mg g as the temperature was increased from 298 k to 318 k indicating that the adsorption was an endothermic process 4 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms can be determined by the adsorption process and mechanism the langmuir freundlich and temkin models are employed to explain the characteristic of the nonlinear adsorption isotherms 56 58 the monolayer adsorption of the metal ions over the nanocomposites was describe using langmuir model as shown as follows 7 q e k l q m a x c e 1 k l c e where ce and qe is equilibrium concentration of hg ii and pb ii and the adsorption capacity of eg cufe2o4 at equilibrium qmax is the amount of hg ii and pb ii adsorbed to afford monolayer coverage and kl is the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm deal with both homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces and both physical and chemical adsorption the nonlinear freundlich isotherm is expressed as follows 8 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g 1 and n are the freundlich constants the temkin isotherm has generally been applied in the following nonlinear form as follows 9 q e r t b t l n k t c where kt l gm is temkin isotherm constant bt is temkin constant which is related to the heat of sorption j mol the nonlinear plots isotherms are presented in fig 8 a and b and their parameters are recorded in supporting table 1 according to high r2 values as 0 9814 and 0 9903 for hg ii and pb ii respectively the langmuir isotherm provides a satisfactory fit to the isotherm results than freundlich and temkin isotherm the fact that the langmuir isotherm fits the experimental data very well may be due to homogenous distribution of active sites on the adsorbents surface langmuir isotherm is generally suitable for describing the chemisorption process when ionic or covalent chemical bonds are formed between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 4 6 adsorption kinetics in order to figure out the adsorption mechanism the non linear pseudo first order pfo model and pseudo second order pso models and intraparticle diffusion model were used 8 59 60 the pseudo first order nonlinear model is generally described as follows 3 q t q e q e e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts adsorbed per unit mass at equilibrium and at any time t and k1 is the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant the pseudo second order kinetic is based on the adsorption equilibrium capacity of the solid phase to uptake ions the nonlinear model is shown as follows 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where k1 is the pseudo second order adsorption rate constant to study the diffusion mechanism the intraparticle diffusion model was used which is represented in the following equation 5 q t k d i f t 1 2 c where kdif mmol g 1 min 1 2 is the intra particle diffusion rate coefficient c is constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer the nonlinear form of these kinetic models are fitted and illustrated in fig 8 c and d and the important kinetic parameters obtained from experimental data fitting are summarized in supporting table 2 after comparing the correlation coefficient values of these models it is clear that the adsorption of both hg ii and pb ii ions onto eg cufe2o4 follows pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 99 in the adsorption for both metals rather than first order and intra particle diffusion furthermore there is a good agreement between the calculated and experimental qe values for both hg ii and pb ii ions this agreement confirms that the pseudo second order kinetic model is well describing the obtained kinetic results and the adsorption is chemisorption process in nature previous works also demonstrated that the pseudo second order kinetic model could be used to show the kinetics of metal ions 4 7 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamics parameters for the adsorption of both the metals pb ii and hg ii over eg cufe2o4 were calculated based on the van t hoff equation 58 61 as shown below eqs 9 and 10 9 l n k c δ s r δ h r t 10 δ g δ h t δ s where δg δh and δs are the gibb s free energy change enthalpy and entropy change while kc is an equilibrium constant which is equal to qe ce from the linear fittings of lnkc against 1 t for hg ii and pb ii adsorption on eg cufe2o4 are illustrated in fig 9 a and the results are summarized in supporting table 3 the positive values of δh and δs show that the adsorption was an endothermic process and increased with increasing temperatures a negative gibbs free energy change indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous 4 8 reusability study the recyclability of the adsorbent would affect production costs and save adsorption time which would show great importance in practical uses to study the recyclability of eg cufe2o4 after the adsorption of the metal ions the samples was washed using 0 1 m hcl 62 the regenerated eg cufe2o4 nanocomposites was reused for next cycles and the results are illustrated in fig 9 b it was observed that after seven cycles the regenerated nanocomposites show 179 54 mg g 1 and 160 23 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for hg ii and pb ii respectively these results indicates that in acidic medium the sorbent surface has hydrogen ions well pronounced on it allowing for desorption of positively charged ions and used for next cycles with excellent adsorption efficiency as shown in fig 10 4 9 adsorption mechanism to understand the adsorption mechanism the adsorption of pb ii and hg ii were carried out over pure cufe2o4 nanoparticles pure polymer eg and the nanocomposite eg cufe2o4 at optimal condition as shown in supporting fig 2 the results revealed that the adsorption was carried out via polymer while the cufe2o4 nanoparticles did not exhibit adsorption capacity and were used only for the magnetic separation the high adsorption capacity of hg ii and pb ii onto eg cufe2o4 can be summarized in fig 10 the amino and carboxylic acid functional groups provided the binding sites due to the presence of lone pair of electron over nitrogen and oxygen donor atoms respectively these donor functional groups behave as lewis bases which can donate their available electron pairs to metal ions which behave as a lewis acids therefore the adsorbent makes coordinate covalent bond with metal ions and adsorbed to further understand the interaction mechanism the ftir and xps studies were performed by choosing hg ii and pb ii adsorption as a representative case the ftir spectra as shown in fig 10 a revealed that the peaks in the region 3200 3400 cm 1 become sharp and less broadness when compared with the eg cufe2o4 nanocomposite this is because after the adsorption of the metal ions the hydrogen bonding decreased due to deprotonation of the adsorbent the adsorption of pb ii and hg ii was further supported using xps analysis the xps analysis after the absorption of pb ii and hg ii are illustrated in fig 10 b the xps results for eg hg ii cufe2o4 show some additional peaks at 103 ev due to hg 4f on the other and in the case of eg pb ii cufe2o4 one sharp peaks at 140 2 ev support the adsorption of pb4f these xps results revealed that both the metal ions are in bivalent species that indicated that hg ii and pb ii cations were not reduced to metallic hg and pb respectively and confirmed the coordination adsorption mechanism 5 conclusion in this study we have fabricated a magnetic nanocomposite as an adsorbent contains amino and carboxylic groups like a polymeric form of edta eg cufe2o4 show fast kinetics excellent re usability excellent adsorption capacity for hg ii and pb ii the fabricated nanocomposite was characterized using several analytical techniques the influence of ph suggests the optimal adsorption value is 6 the adsorption kinetics of both the metal ions on to eg cufe2o4 fitted with the pseudo second order model additionally the adsorption data corresponded well to the langmuir isotherm model and the maximum removal capacity was approximately 188 4 mg g 1 and 171 74 mg g 1 for hg ii and pb ii at 298 k the adsorption thermodynamic results show that the adsorption of both the metal is spontaneous the interaction between heavy metals and eg cufe2o4 was further supported using ftir and the xps the present work revealed that the as synthesized eg cufe2o4 could be used as an efficient and magnetic adsorbent for removing heavy metallic ions from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest or

13996,colourants substances in palm oil mill effluent pome are carcinogenic unfortunately the commonly applied conventional activated sludge system has been unable to remediate these contaminants the need for more efficient treatment approach is fundamental in order to sanctuary the environment a novel start up approach which involves augmentation of yeast extract and diary waste as recipes added into activated sludge to remediate colourants concentration in pome was employed in this study the decolourization performance obtained was compared with that of the conventional activated sludge operated under the same conditions the augmented recipes that best sustained the active biomass was identified and then applied in the subsequent studies because of this the acclimation duration drastically shortens to 31 days as against 87 days of that of the conventional method the swift acclimation was due to the adequacy and stability of the sludge active sites which was successfully increased by 35 31 using the augmented recipe the decolourization efficiency at steady aeration of 5 l min and olr of 0 895gcod l 1d 1 using augmented sludge was 63 45 which was far greater than 37 obtained by the conventional sludge monod kinetic model excellently described the degradation process of both augmented and conventional sludge based on cod depletion with a respective r2 value of 0 9923 and 0 9839 the calculated kinetic coefficients proved that microbial growth substrate utilization rate of the augmented sludge was superior with biomass yield of 2 1142 mg mlvss mg cod the significant improvement in the decolourization was attributed to the augmented recipes which successfully enhanced the metabolic and xenobiotic activities of the active biomass keywords aerobic degradation bio decolourization active biomass augmentation yeast extract diary waste kinetic coefficients 1 introduction the industrial extraction of oil palm entails series of operations and this is usually in concomitant with the generation of a large amount of wastewater commonly known as palm oil mill effluent pome about 5 7 5 tons of water is required for the production of 1 ton of crude palm oil but over 50 of the water ends up as pome 1 due to the seeming increase of palm oil based industries the rate of pome generation is expected to increase particularly in the asian continent 2 recently the environmental effect of pome has drawn considerable attention due to its excessive chemical oxygen demand cod 70 500 mg l biochemical oxygen demand 34 950 mg l and other inorganic compounds such as no2 so2 and co2 3 in addition the presence of residual coloured particles in the surface water is esthetically undesirable and annoys the aquatic biosphere due to reduction of sunlight penetration and depletion of the dissolved oxygen due to their recalcitrance properties coloured particles can also contribute to the failure of biological processes in wastewater treatment plants further the regulations imposed for the discharged coloured effluents have become more stringent and thus motivated the industries to improve their effluent de colourization technology 4 the conventional ponding systems are the most common treatment methods 5 the widely acceptance might be due to its simplicity and a comparable low running cost 6 principally the method involves the use of microorganism to remediate the biodegradable pollutants contained in the pome though several limitations have been attributed to such practices and these include long start up period over 60 days protracting hydraulic retention time hrt 30 days numerous modular emission of odour and inefficient remediation to comply with the discharge standard 7 more so the presence of recalcitrant substances undermines the overall performance of the ponding methods in the effort to avert the negative impact of the poorly treated pome researchers have explored several modifications on the use of activated sludge integrated chemical oxidation process 8 9 ultrasound system 10 11 and microbial inoculation 12 13 with activated sludge are the most common modifications comparing with the conventional ponding method considerable improvements in terms of flocs settleability contaminants removal dewatering performance and shorter treatment cycle were achieved furthermore vijayaraghavan et al 14 attempted using aerobic activated sludge bioreactor equipped with air diffuser to decontaminant pome at a various level of cod the system got acclimatized after 9 weeks seeding under continues aeration conditions similarly chan et al 15 use a sequential batch reactor to remediate anaerobically treated pome under aerobic conditions according to this study the system takes 42 days to acclimatize with an overall organic removal efficiency of 76 it can be noticed that none of the above literature reported on colour removal this is because the existing sludge systems were unable to degrade the colourants due to its recalcitrant nature in concurrence with the aromatic structure 16 more so the combination of ultrasound and chemical oxidation with activated sludge system may not be economically viable for industrial scale due to the high capital involvement 15 the most notable drawback associated with the microbial inoculum sludge system is the rapid multiplication of the biomass and this resulted in difficulty to control the growth rate 17 though activated sludge system with air diffuser presented remarkable cod removal efficiency over 54 83 14 15 the start up duration 42 62 days is considerably long and this seems no difference compared to the ponding system nevertheless despite the aptitude of augmented yeast extract and diary waste as a recipe capable of enhancing the density and adaptability of the bio active sites to sustain faster biodegradation process information on its application for remediating colour pigments in wastewater is still very limited 18 to overcome the stated drawbacks of the current conventional sludge system and provide new information on colour treatment using modified sludge this study focuses on applying a novel start up approach to sustain adequate availability of active biomass for effectual degradation of colourants compound present in pome the primarily activated sludges used in this study were collected from a palm oil mill in facultative and aerobic ponds which were later mixed at an equal ratio combinations of yeast extract and diary wastes were prepared at three different levels and then used to augment the inoculated sludge mixtures in order to examine the impact of the augmented recipe the decolourization performance of the modified sludge was compared with that of the conventional sludge under the same operating conditions more so the morphology and biomass build up of the augmented sludge were continuously monitored using scanned electron microscopy sem analysis active biomass build up mlss and mlvss and settleability index svi during the seeding stage the results of organic cod remediation by the augmented and conventional sludge were fitted with monod models in order to determine the kinetic coefficients 2 materials and methods 2 1 sourcing influent pome anaerobically treated pome ant pome was sourced from an oil palm mill located at carey island malaysia the physicochemical analyses of the ant pome were conducted using standard procedure 19 this is to examine the nutrient balance and contaminants level contained in the sample table 1 normally the minimum nutrients requisite for aerobic growth based on bod n p ratio is 100 5 1 15 from table 1 it can be noticed that the bod n p ratio of the pome sample was 100 7 83 1 and this indicates that the available nutrients are adequate for the aerobic conditions 2 2 sourcing and nutritional characterization of the yeast extract ye and diary waste dw the yeast extract ye saccharomyces cerevisiae emulsifier 491 and ascorbic acid 300 mauri pan were locally procured while the diary wastewater dw was obtained from a dairy farm located in selangor malaysia the nutrition compositions of the ye and dw were analysed using standard procedures this analysis assists in assessing the nitrogen and carbon supplements by the augmented ye and dw to sustain the metabolic alongside with the degradation activities of the active biomass present in the activated sludge 20 the details discussion on the nutritional composition of the augmented ye and dw has been reported under section 3 1 2 3 experimental setup the effect of the augmented yeast extract ye fixed at 10 g and diary waste dw 500 1000 and 1500 ml was examined by comparing the colourants remediation performance to that obtained without the augmented recipe the experimental setup constitutes two identical bioreactor ra and rb with an equal working volume of 29 60 l rb contains the activated sludge with augmented yeast extract and diary waste ye dw while the second reactor ra contains only the activated sludge which was run as the control experiment conventional sludge fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the setups an equal volume 6 l of the mixed activated sludges was inoculated into the two bioreactors initially the activated sludge with augmented yeast extract and diary waste ye dw was cultured for 10 days under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 and the morphology of the active biomass was examined using sem svi mlvss and mlss analysis in order to examine the impact of the augmented recipe on colourants remediation both setups ra and rb were acclimatized under same conditions of gradual loading olr 0 559 0 895 g cod l d and then applied for colour treatment in pome the summary of the treatment conditions during the acclimatization and steady stages alongside with comparable literature data were presented in table 2 on average the operating temperatures and ph s values were relatively in the same ranges but the major differences centred on the type of seeds applied table 2 vijayaraghavan et al 14 use a mixture of activated sludge and cow dung supplemented with nutrients ni co k fe and ca as seed while chan et al 21 only uses activated sludge collected from wastewater treatment plant but they limited the working volume to only 1 8 l the concentration of active biomass mlvss applied in the current study during the start up stage is comparably in the same range with that of chan et al 21 table 2 however it can be noticed that both vijayaraghavan et al 14 and chan et al 21 did not examine the effect of aeration intensity during the steady stage but rather maintained at a fixed value table 2 2 4 start up 2 4 1 seeding bioreactor with rb and without ra augmented recipe activated sludges from facultative and aerobic ponds were obtained from an oil palm mill located at carey island malaysia the sludges were mixed at equal volume 3 l and homogenized using electro electro mechanical agitator am40 d pro argolab at 75 rpm for 30 min certain amounts 500 1000 and 1500 ml of dairy wastewater collected from a dairy farm malaysia together with a fixed amount 10 g of commercial yeast extract saccharomyces cerevisiae emulsifier 491 and ascorbic acid 300 mauri pan were added into the sludges mixture as a recipe to promote microbes cells reproductions and adaptability 22 the sludge mixtures were agitated again at 75 rpm for another 30 min afterwards the mixture was inoculated into the rb and then cultured under continues aeration of 3 l min 1 for 10 days these procedures allow a rapid increase in active biomass population alongside with drastic relegation of autochthonous organic matter 15 the mixture of the augmented recipe ye dw 10 g 500 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml that best sustained the active biomass was identified based on mlvss build up and active biomass index the morphology and building up of the active biomass were monitored using sem mlvss mlss and sludge volume index svi on the other hand the ra was inoculated with the 6 l of the activated sludges mixtures without any augmentation the inoculum was subjected to steady aeration of 3 l min 1 intensity for a period of 48 h to ensure good adaptation 15 2 4 2 acclimatizing bioreactors ra and rb after the completion of the seeding stage both ra and rb were gradually acclimatized to pome degradation by increasing the concentration from the lowest olr to the highest the pome concentrations were varied using dilutions factor of 4 3 2 and 1 and these give a corresponding loading of 0 559 0 746 0 839 and 0 895 g cod l 1 d 1 respectively throughout this stage steady aeration was applied in order to maintain the dissolved oxygen do above 2 mg l 15 the acclimation of the two reactors was monitored based on the depletion percentages of the effluent cod and tss in this study stabilization is considered accomplished with consistent effluent cod removal for three consecutive days 15 2 5 steady state bioremediation performance to compare the remediation performance and stability of the ra and rb after acclimatization both reactors were subjected to thorough evaluation under continues flow conditions at variable hrt 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 h and aeration intensity 3 4 and 5 l min 1 the experimental layout was developed using randomised multi level categoric design trial stat ease design expert v10 0 7 in this experiment the influent ant pome was undiluted and thus the initial colour and cod concentrations were 8570 admi and 4470 mg l respectively all the treatments were replicated thrice this amounted to 54 treatments applied for each of the bioreactors at the end of each treatment the sample of the treated effluent was collected and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and then the final colour and cod concentrations of the clarified supernatants were analysed using calorimetric method 2 6 analytical method 2 6 1 sem analysis about 10 ml of the augmented mixed sludge mixed liquor was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was discarded the accumulated biomass was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehude for 4 h at 4 c subsequently the sample was washed with 0 1 m sodium cacodyl ate buffer and then subjected to post fixing with 1 of osmium tetroxide for a period of 2 h at 4 c the post treated sample was washed again with 0 1 m sodium cacodyl ate buffer and dehydrated using diluted acetone afterwards the dehydrated sample was mounted onto the stub using double sided carbon tape and sputtered coated with a thin gold layer for the microstructures imaging using sem s 3400n 2 6 2 uv spectrophotometric analysis the colour and cod were analysed using uv spectrophotometer hach dr 4000u at an absorbance wavelength of 400 and 620 nm respectively apha 2005 about 2 ml of the samples were pipetted into the cod vials 1500 high range digested at 150 c for 2 h and then allowed to cool before the analysis while the turbidity was analysed at 870 nm wavelength using undigested sample 19 the removal efficiencies were determined using eq 1 1 r e m o v a l 1 c e c i 100 where ce is effluent concentration mg l while ci is influent concentration in mg l 2 6 3 analysis for suspended solids the mlss and mlvss were determined using eqs 2 and 3 respectively initially 100 ml of the sample was filtered through a 0 48 μm filter paper whatman china and then the mass of the retained residues after oven dried at 105 c for 5 h was determined the dried filtered sample was further ignited at 550 c using a muffle furnace for 15 min the mass of the volatile matter was determined as the difference between the mass of the dried and ignited filter furthermore the svi was calculated using eq 4 by measuring the volume of the settled sludge after 30 min standing in 1000 ml imhotep cone while abr was determined simply by taken the ratio of mlvss to mlss using eq 5 2 m l s s m g l m s o l u t e s v s 1000 3 m l v s s m g l m s o l u t e s m 550 c v s 1000 4 s v i 30 m i n l m g v s l

carbohydrate was quantified using calorimetric method using glucose as the reference standard and the procedures were as per le and stuckey 23 ii the kjeldahl method was employed for the determination

iv ash moisture and crude fibre content were determined using astm standard procedure as reported by nordin et al 26 while the energy content of the ye was determined using bomb calorimetric method as detailed by lau et al 27 2 6 5 other analysis the bod5 of the initial ant pome sample and the sludges were analysed by standard procedure 28 the samples were prepared in bod bottles and then incubated under continuous stirring for 5 days at 20 c in a dark environment the ph was measured using digital ph meter ionix ph5s while the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were analysed based on hach test using persulfate and molybdovanadate reagents respectively the dissolved oxygen do and salinity were determined using ysi probe arachem 27 181 d 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of the augmentation recipe ye dw 10 g 500 ml 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml on the biomass build up during seeding was analysed using paired t test at 95 confidence level in addition the experimental data obtained during the steady state evaluation were analysed with design expert 10 0 7 software package using analysis of variance anova the significance of the treatment factors was examined based on the magnitude of the f values while the p value less than 0 05 is considered to be statistically significant with 95 confidence level besides the accuracy of the regression model was examined using diagnostic analysis 2 8 kinetic studies microbial kinetics involves the metabolizing process to precede biodegradation of carbonaceous substrate 29 this shows that kinetics of microbial remediation can be express as a function of substrate utilization and the concurrent biomass growth 30 thus this could be a useful model for estimating bioremediation performances for a better understanding of the kinetic degradation taking place in ra and rb monod kinetics models were used to characterize the process by fitting the experimental data into the model the important kinetic coefficients μ max y and kd were determined from the gradients and interceptions of the model plots this procedure is following park et al 30 and tchobanoglous et al 31 the linearized form of the monod kinetic models was presented in eq 6 8 6 h r t c o d i c o d e m l v s s k s k 1 c o d e 1 k 7 k μ m a x y 8 1 h r t 1 y c o d i c o d e m l v s s h r t k d where μ max is specific maximum growth d 1 y is biomass yield g mlvss g cod kd is decay coefficient d 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical analysis of pome and nutritional composition of augmented ye and dw the presence of adequate carbon and nitrogen nutrients along with phosphorous is an important requirement for active microbes to effectively remove carbonaceous pollutants from wastewater 32 the availability of balanced nutrients not only sustains biodegradation of contaminants but also promote microbial proliferation from table 1 the nutritional balance ratio based on bod n p of the sludge s facultative pond 1 aerobic pond 2 and pome sample were all above the minimum requirement 100 5 1 for aerobic growth table 1 this ensures the availability of adequate active biomass mlvss for effectual degradation of organic contaminants 33 however at denser active biomass the available carbon and nitrogen got depleted rapidly and this could result in the endogenous process 30 this shows that augmenting the available carbon and nitrogen as well as phosphorous could assist in checking the endogenous problem on front thus sustaining denser active biomass and better biodegradation processes 21 table 3 shows the proximate analysis and nutritional values of the augmented ye and dw the composition of protein and carbohydrate in the ye were 46 8 and 39 2 g 100 g respectively this level of nutritional composition in conjunction with that of the dw table 3 could greatly sustain effectual biomass metabolic processes and proliferation 14 21 32 based on the previous studies west and strohfus 34 investigated the impact of yeast extract on sphingomonas p growth and they observed that at 0 1 ye concentration maximum yield of 5 11 mg ml was obtained after 3 d retention in addition the stationary growth stage became shorten and this is indicating adequate availability of carbon and nitrogen to sustain rapid autolysis similarly xi et al 20 investigated the effect of augmented ye on the survival and growth rate from the results 30 40 g of the augmented ye not only improve the growth rate but also enhanced the survival rate from 80 47 95 13 3 2 seeding and active biomass build up in rb the presence of adequate carbon and nitrogen along with phosphorous is an important requirement to sustain the microbes for effective degradation of pollutants present in wastewater 32 therefore well balanced nutrients not only sustain biodegradation activity of the microbes but also promote proliferation 35 in this regards the inoculated activated sludge in rb was augmented with yeast extract and diary waste ye dw at a variable combination level 10 g 500 ml 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml then the mixtures were cultured under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 for 10d to enhance the active biomass build up the impact of the augmentation on the active biomass was accessed using the mlvss mlvss mlss abs ratio and svi as indices usually the magnitude of mlvss indicates the level of available active biomass 36 while the svi30 measured the settleability properties of the suspended biomass 37 table 4 presents the results of the active biomass build up using an augmented recipe ye dw the augmented recipe of ye dw 10 g 1500 ml improves the mlvss of the activated sludge to 23 601 mg l after 8th day of culturing under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 and the corresponding svi30 and abr index were 59 87 and 0 8539991 respectively this might be due to the adequate availability of the carbon and nitrogen nutrients which were supplemented by the augmented ye and dw to sustain the biomass activities and aggregation 38 from the proximate characteristics and nutritional values of the augmented ye and dw table 3 the composition contains substantial protein 46 8 g 100 g and 48 mg l and carbohydrate 39 2 g 100 g which could easily get reduced biologically to supplement the available carbon and nitrogen to sustain the biomass metabolic activities and proliferation 20 during these processes the density of the aggregating active biomass increases and thus svi 30 reduces accordingly 38 it can be observed from table 4 that 10 g 1000 ml augmentation had a comparable mlvss of 23585 55 mg l with better settleability index svi30 of 40 02 and 0 9353 abr on the contrary 10 g 500 ml augmentation attained its highest mlvss concentration on the 7th day with 19337 0 mg l and this is much lower compared to the former in addition the corresponding svi30 and abr indices were 132 53 and 0 8453136 respectively the settleability properties of the aggregated biomass in the activated sludge deteriorates with the decrease in the recipe in addition the disparity between the mlvss obtained with 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml augmentation levels seem not much table 4 this suggests that the two augmentations may likely demonstrate a comparable degradation performance under the same treatment conditions however the svi30 and abr index for the 10 g 1000 ml augmentation level was superior table 4 it is likely that the nutrients balance at this level of augmentation gives more favourable conditions for better sustenance of biomass granulation and thus improving the settleability properties 39 based on settleability properties in concurrence with the high abr index 0 8539991 0 9353 the 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml augmentation level were further screened using paired t test analysis to examine the significance in the disparity 3 3 screening augmentation level of the recipe from table 4 the trend in the sludge mlvss build up with augmentation of 10 g 1500 ml and 10 g 1000 ml are very similar however on the 8th day of culture the augmentation of 10 g 1000 ml recorded a better settleability performance with highest abr index of 0 9353 on average this gives a quantitative increment of over 35 31 in the active biomass density in order to examine the significance of the disparity the mlvss and svi30 data for the two augmentation level were subjected to paired t test analysis at 95 confidence level table 5 presents the summary of the statistical analysis and it can be noticed that the p value for the mlvss analysis was 0 027 which is far less than 0 05 this implies that the compared sludge mlvss were statistically not different on the other hand a p value of 0 214 was obtained for the svi30 analysis which is extremely greater than 0 05 thus the differences in the svi30 is significant therefore it can be reasonably deduced that the tendency to attain an equal amount of active biomass with the two augmentation level is 95 high but the 10 g 1000 ml recipes level gives a superior settleability performance furthermore in order to verify the transformation in the granulation sem was used to examine the morphology of the augmented sludge both on day 1 and then on the 8th day the detailed is presented in the subsequent sub section 3 4 morphology of active biomass after identifying the augmentation level with most desirable settleability 40 02 and abr index 0 9353 the morphology of the active biomass in the augmented sludge was examined using sem fig 2 a present s the profile of the sludge active biomass growth mlvss alongside with the mlss and abr index the progressive increase in the active biomass from 17 266 to 23362 45 mg l is an indication of a good balance between the nutrients and biomass at this augmentation level in conjunction with the steady aeration 40 on the 8th to 10th day of seeding a relative constant mlvss concentration was observed fig 2a in order to check the structural transformations sem was used to inspect the morphology fig 2 b and c shows the pictorial microstructure of the biomass present in the augmented sludge on the day one and after 8th day of culture respectively from fig 2 b smooth and scarce granules structures of microbes were observed this clearly shows that the initial seed contained less microbial density on day one however fig 2 c presented larger clusters of bio granules after 8th day of seeding the availability of the numerous larger granules suggests a dynamic bio activities with a stupendous increase in microbial population density which is normally resulted through metabolic and reproduction activities 41 3 5 acclimation results of ra and rb in this study remediation trend in cod and tss were used as indices for monitoring the acclimation process this procedure is as per previous studies 21 29 fig 3 a presents the acclimation profile of the control experiment ra at gradually increasing organic loading olr 0 559 to 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 at olr of 0 559 g cod l 1d 1 it takes over 13 days to attain relatively steady removal of cod and tss of 64 and 47 respectively then the olr was increased to 0 746 g cod l 1d 1 which resulted in a sharp drop in the cod tss removal and the dramatic decrease might be due to a shocking load 21 at this loading ra takes over 20 days to attain stability fig 3 a the effects of the shocking load were repeatedly noticed throughout at every increase in the olr in overall ra with the conventional sludge takes a total of 87 days to achieve acclimation with a relative steady cod tss removal of 57 99 46 25 as indicated in fig 3 a the inconsistency and perceptible shocking effect has been attributed to the poor resistance to inhibitory effect in conjunction with the limited availability of active biomass in the sludge 29 however a different scenario was noticed in the second set ups rb with augmented activated sludge throughout the acclimatization period the rb was relatively stable with respect to the varying olr fig 3 b at olr of 0 559 g cod l 1d 1 a remarkable cod and tss removal efficiency of 99 11 and 99 99 were achieved after 6th day s retention respectively nevertheless on increasing the olr to 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 the cod and tss removal efficiencies slightly dropped to 92 28 and 96 89 respectively it takes almost 11 days to attain stabilization at this stage this shows that the influent feed introduced an additional raw none active biomass in conjunction with recalcitrant substances and this antagonised the metabolic activities 21 compared to ra the rb attained acclimation stability faster at this olr as can be noticed in fig 3b though rb also experiences moderate shocking but easily got adapted to the increased loading olr this might be due to the adequate availability of active biomass which was achieved via sludge augmentation with the recipe 40 more so rb takes only 31 d to attained acclimation with relatively steady cod and tss removal of 92 58 and 96 89 respectively whereas the ra required 87 d to attain acclimation with grossly lower cod and tss removal efficiency of 57 99 and 46 25 respectively fig 3a therefore it can be reasonably deduced that the synergy of metabolic activities of the dense active biomass resulted in a better and consistency degradation performance with varying olr 42 this could be a good reason for the significant reduction in the acclimation time as well as resistance to shocking due to loading 21 43 3 6 bio decolourization performance of ra and rb after acclimation 3 6 1 the combined effect of hrt and aeration on colour removal fig 4 a presents the decolourization percentage obtained using the conventional set up ra at a variable combination of aeration intensities and hrt from fig 4 it can be noticed that the removal efficiency varies between 15 and 37 at aeration of 5 l min 1 an upturn of 37 decolourization was achieved after a retention period of 36 h as the aeration intensity reduces to 3 l min 1 the colour removal efficiency diminished to 22 at this same hrt of 36 h this indicates that to attain effective colour removal a synergy of sufficient hrt with adequate aeration intensity is required to sustain good degradation of the colourants biopolymers lignin tannin and melanoidin into a simpler form such α dicarbonyl 44 although higher removal efficiencies were observed in rb set up when operated under the same conditions fig 4b with rb setup highest colour removal of 63 45 was observed at 5 l min 1 aerations and 36 h hrt in addition at this same aeration intensity with shorter hrt of 24 and 30 h the colour removals efficiencies were 61 85 and 62 90 respectively the appreciable colour removal with rb as against that of ra could be due to the overwhelming and highly adaptive biomass which provides synergistic larger active sites for effectual xenobiotic degradation of the recalcitrant contaminants 45 comparably it is obvious that irrespective of the hrt the treatments performances obtained with 5 l min 1 aerations were superior across all the retention periods fig 4b for example at lower aeration 4 and 3 l min 1 and hrt of 36 h the obtainable remediation efficiencies were 59 58 and 55 08 respectively therefore this shows that sufficient do which is attainable via higher aeration intensity meritoriously support xenobiotic biomass substrate interactions for effective degradation alongside with bio sorption of colour pigments such as lignin and tannin 46 this is because even after extended retentions of 36 h the do in the ra and rb remains relatively steady at 3 10 and 2 85 mg l with the aerations intensity of 5 l min 1 respectively the detailed do profile with respect to varied aerations intensities and hrt are reported in section 3 5 3 more so this condition not only supports the biomass substrate interaction but also averts bulking promote the prolificacy and the entire microbial activities 45 one of the most essential microbial activities is the secretion of extracellular enzymes required for the degradation of the contaminants such as colourants therefore the do concentration must be maintained above a threshold level 2 mg l alongside with sufficient retention to ensure synergy of simultaneous bio enzymatic extracellular reactions metabolic process in conjunction with bio sorption of contaminants colourants 46 therefore it can be reasonably deduced that prolonging the hrt with an adequate supply of aeration warrants the formation of suitable enzymes to sustain the entire bio decolourization processes 47 3 6 2 combined effect of hrt and aeration on organic cod removal cod depletion depends primarily on the metabolic activities of the active biomass 15 fig 5 a presents the synergistic effect of hrt and aeration on the cod removal using the conventional set up ra at a fixed olr of 0 895 g cod l d at 5 l min 1 aeration the highest cod removal efficiency of 70 39 at 24 h hrt in addition at this treatment conditions the do concentration was 3 14 mg l which is adequate to sustain the degradation process 21 33 though it was noticed that the removal efficiency remains relatively constant even at longer retention time 24 h fig 5a as the aeration reduces to 3 l min 1 lower cod removals efficiencies were recorded even at same retention periods as that of 5 l min 1 this observation is analogous to the colour remediation trend in fig 4 a however unlike the colourants contaminants that require longer retention time the degradable cod was virtually depleted completely after 24 h of retention this further confirms the recalcitrant nature of the colourants which always prove difficult to degrade due to their complex aromatic structure 48 in overall the synergy of the treatment factors hrt and aeration demonstrated a notable influence on the cod remediation process this remark concurs with the previous studies 49 51 similar trending influences of the treatment factors were observed in rb set up but with better remediation performances fig 5 b shows the combined effect of the hrt and aeration on cod removal using the rb set up a progressive increase in removal efficiency was observed with hrt at hrt of 36 h and 4 l min 1 aerations the best cod removal of 94 30 was attained however the cod removal dropped to 90 53 at higher aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 even at this same hrt 36 h the decrease in removal efficiency might be due to the shearing effect of the intensive aeration which consequentially disintegrates the bio granular 52 thus the disintegrated granules re contaminate the treated effluent hence lessening the remediation efficiency however a different scenario was observed at hrts of 6 12 and 18 h when rb was operated at the aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 at these stated hrts the cod removal efficiencies obtained with 5 l min 1 were superior to that of the 3 and 4 l min 1 fig 5 b this confirms that extensive exposure of the bio granular to intensive aeration for a longer hrt could undermine the treatment efficiency 52 therefore an adequate level of treatment factors for efficient cod removal is critical furthermore the aeration of 3 l min 1 intensity demonstrated some level of sustenance to the cod degradation process with respect to the hrt but it seems compromising the churning efficacy and this limited the remediation efficiencies because of the loose biomass substrate interaction 49 3 6 3 do concentration of the ra and rb after acclimation stage the foremost impact of the do concentration on remediation performance of activated sludge is usually noticed through the growth of filamentous bacteria and the formation has been attributed low availability of do 21 53 consequentially the predominance of filamentous bacteria could promote bulking as such limits oxygen transfer efficiency into sludge flocs in addition this is capable to cause a significant diminution in the overall biodegradation performance 53 in this study sludge bulking owing to excessive growth of the filamentous were not observed this might be due to the adequate availability of do maintained throughout the experiments fig 6 a and b present the profile of the do concentration for the ra and rb after acclimation respectively it was generally observed that the do reduces with increase in the hrt fig 6a and 6b from fig 6a with the aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 the do concentration of 3 60 mg l at 6 h retention reduces to 3 1 mg l after hrt of 20 h and further diminishes to a relatively steady value of 2 99 mg l after a longer hrt of 30 36 h at lower aeration intensity of 3 4 l min 1 the relatively steady do concentrations were 2 10 and 2 30 mg l respectively comparably the do profile of the rb has a similar trend with that of the ra though with the aeration of 5 l min 1 a dramatic reduction in the do from 3 65 to 2 85 mg l was noticed after 25 h retention this is indicating a significant upsurge in the rate of oxygen utilization by the active biomass due to the geometric increase in the density as well as the overall microbial metabolic activities 54 however the least relatively steady do concentration obtained with 3 l min 1 aeration after 36 h retention was 2 03 mg l fig 6b in overview it can be deduced that adequate availability of the do concentrations 2 03 3 65 mg l was maintained throughout to sustained the metabolic activities and this assist in averting possibilities of bulking in the mixed liquor this remarks and observation are in good agreements with previous studies 21 54 3 7 statistical analysis 3 7 1 anova of bio decolourization data the experimental data obtained based on randomized multi level categoric design at variable hrt 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 h and aeration intensity 3 4 and 5 l min 1 were analysed using analysis of variance anova at 95 level of confidence the summary of the anova results for the colour removal percentage obtained with ra and rb are shown in table 6 the model f values of the regression analysis for the colour removal by ra and rb were 40 64 and 50 15 respectively this shows that the model regression analysis for both reactors was significant 55 also the prob f values for both analyses were all less than 0 0001 as such it is only 0 01 fortuitous for error to transpire due to noise noticeably in the ra the aeration intensity exhibited more influences on the bio decolourization process as indicated by the f value of 47 43 table 6 this is affirming that higher aeration intensity not only provides the required do but also assisted in transporting the biomass within the mixed liquor and thus promoting adequate interaction with the colourants for better degradation 56 however a distinct scenario was observed with rb the hrt demonstrated an upturn impact on the colour remediation process with an f value of 58 40 this shows that the supplied aerations were sufficient to sustain the entire bio activities of the overwhelm suspended active biomass and thus longer retention period hrt promotes better bio decolourization process 57 58 this remark is strongly in agreement with previous studies 57 58 in addition the proximity of the adj r2 ra 0 9420 rb 0 9529 to the pred r2 ra 0 8895 rb 0 9103 together with the respective coefficient of variation cv of 7 03 and 3 28 for the ra and rb shows that the model has a good accuracy since cv below 10 per cent is considered reproducible 55 3 7 2 error diagnostic analysis fig 7 a and b illustrates the actual experimental versus the software predicted values for the ra and rb it is usually applied to diagnose nonlinearity in comparing data 59 from these figures the data points of the actual experimental and predictor s data deviated negligibly from the diagonal lines as shown in the figures the points were scattered close to the diagonal reference line and this is indicating that the errors in the model regression were minimal for both ra and rb 59 60 furthermore normal plots of residuals were used to analyse the compliance of the regression model to the anova assumptions and also the level residual error 60 both figs 7 b and and 8 a show a normal distribution of information by closely aligning with the reference straight line this infers that the bio decolourization data obtained from the ra and rb were normally distributed without significant deviation from the normal plot therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the data were highly inclined to normality as such do not need any transformation however the associated negligible deviations might be due to some unavoidable error source such as human factor 3 8 monod kinetic model the kinetic coefficients μ max y and kd for each reactor ra and rb were evaluated based on the utilization of organic matter cod during the steady state this procedure was in accordance to park et al 30 and chan et al 29 the results of the cod removal obtained at the best sustainable aeration intensity for ra 5 l min 1 and rb 4 l min 1 with respect to the hrt were fitted with the monod kinetic model then the coefficients were determined using the gradients and intercepts of the linearized graphs of the models fig 9 a d the best lines of fits were obtained using least square of linear regression method in order to obtain the corresponding coefficient values with high accuracy 29 the calculated biodegradation kinetic coefficients for ra and rb are summarized in table 7 the maximum specific growth μ max and biomass yield y for ra and rb were 14 12 d 1 1 55 g mlvss g cod and 15 33d 1 2 11 g mlvss g cod respectively in addition the decay coefficient of ra 0 6684 d 1 was far greater than that of rb 0 2091 d 1 in practical application y coefficient is an index showing the correlation between the microbial growth rate and substrate utilization rate since the former grows at the expense of the later 30 therefore based on these results it can be reasonably deduced that the microbial growth substrate utilization rate in rb was successfully improved with the assistance of the augmentation recipe the kd usually measure the level of endogenous decay and as such it is usually preferred low 61 despite the denser active biomass in rb the kd value was within the acceptable value of 0 2091 d 1 while that for the ra was 300 greater this is showing the level of viability and consistency in the bio degradation as well as oxidation processes in the rb 61 the experimental data of the two reactors ra and rb fits excellently with the monod kinetic model and the coefficient of correlations r2 were 0 9839 and 0 9923 respectively besides the kinetic coefficients rb obtained in this study were also compared with the previous literature table 7 despite the higher level cod 4470 mg l applied in this study the kinetic coefficients of rb setup were comparably better to that reported by nakhla et al 62 raj and anjaneyulu 63 couillard et al 64 and vogelar et al 65 nakhla et al 62 examined the kinetic coefficient under aerobic condition using food waste as substrate and the results of the biomass yield y fluctuate between 0 08 0 85 g mlvss g cod and also the kd was considerably high 0 21 0 66 d 1 similarly raj and anjaneyulu 63 reported 0 805 g mlvss g cod of biomass yield at influence cod of 4000 mg l with parallel kd value of 0 45 d 1 in addition both vogelar et al 65 and couillard et al 64 attempted operating aerobic reactor with much lower influent cod 727 2310 mg l and the obtainable y ranges between 0 30 0 45 with kd of 0 32 0 41 d 1 in overall it can be noticed that the augmented activated sludge applied in this study rb has a superior substrate utilization rate with lower tendencies of endogenous decay occurrences this might be due to the impact of the recipe which consequently enhances the density as well as adaptability of the active biomass to give more degradation performances and oxidation of contaminants 42 thus this assisted in cushioning the inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant contaminants while the overall degradation process and microbial cells reproduction improves 21 42 4 conclusion the impact of augmented activated sludge with yeast extract diary waste as the recipe was investigated and then the performances were compared to a conventional activated sludge based on pome decolourization from the results of this study the possible conclusions were outlined as follows the recipes augmentation into the activated sludge mixture improves the active biomass by 35 31 after 8 d of culture the improvement in the available active sites in the augmented sludge drastically shorten the acclimation period to 31 d as against 87 d of that of the conventional activated sludge during acclimatization augmented sludge only exhibited moderate shock with the increase in olr 559 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 and then biodegradation kinetics easily got reverted with a steady cod removal of 92 28 at 0 895 olr a contrary scenario was observed with the conventional sludge at every increase in olr a sharp drop in the cod removal was often noticed but managed to get stabilized at 57 99 after an extended retention period of 87 d the shocking susceptibility at every increase in loading might be due to the inhibitory effect in conjunction with the inadequacy of the active biomass at the same treatment conditions of 36 h hrt and 5 l min 1 aeration the augmented sludge demonstrated a superior colour removal with 63 45 as against 37 of that of the conventional this is indicating that the availability of more active sites gives better colour remediation under adequate treatment conditions the estimated kinetic coefficients proof that the augmented sludge have better microbial growth substrate utilization rate with a biomass yield of 2 1142 mg mlvss mg cod in addition the decay coefficient kd of the conventional sludge was 0 6684 d 1 which is far greater than that of the augmented sludge 0 2091 d 1 this implies that conventional sludge is highly prone to endogenous decay this study suggested that the activated sludge augmented with yeast extract diary waste as recipe gives better decolourization performance than the conventional sludge under same operating conditions the significant improvement in the remediation performance was attributed to the augmented recipes applied into the inoculum declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was

13996,colourants substances in palm oil mill effluent pome are carcinogenic unfortunately the commonly applied conventional activated sludge system has been unable to remediate these contaminants the need for more efficient treatment approach is fundamental in order to sanctuary the environment a novel start up approach which involves augmentation of yeast extract and diary waste as recipes added into activated sludge to remediate colourants concentration in pome was employed in this study the decolourization performance obtained was compared with that of the conventional activated sludge operated under the same conditions the augmented recipes that best sustained the active biomass was identified and then applied in the subsequent studies because of this the acclimation duration drastically shortens to 31 days as against 87 days of that of the conventional method the swift acclimation was due to the adequacy and stability of the sludge active sites which was successfully increased by 35 31 using the augmented recipe the decolourization efficiency at steady aeration of 5 l min and olr of 0 895gcod l 1d 1 using augmented sludge was 63 45 which was far greater than 37 obtained by the conventional sludge monod kinetic model excellently described the degradation process of both augmented and conventional sludge based on cod depletion with a respective r2 value of 0 9923 and 0 9839 the calculated kinetic coefficients proved that microbial growth substrate utilization rate of the augmented sludge was superior with biomass yield of 2 1142 mg mlvss mg cod the significant improvement in the decolourization was attributed to the augmented recipes which successfully enhanced the metabolic and xenobiotic activities of the active biomass keywords aerobic degradation bio decolourization active biomass augmentation yeast extract diary waste kinetic coefficients 1 introduction the industrial extraction of oil palm entails series of operations and this is usually in concomitant with the generation of a large amount of wastewater commonly known as palm oil mill effluent pome about 5 7 5 tons of water is required for the production of 1 ton of crude palm oil but over 50 of the water ends up as pome 1 due to the seeming increase of palm oil based industries the rate of pome generation is expected to increase particularly in the asian continent 2 recently the environmental effect of pome has drawn considerable attention due to its excessive chemical oxygen demand cod 70 500 mg l biochemical oxygen demand 34 950 mg l and other inorganic compounds such as no2 so2 and co2 3 in addition the presence of residual coloured particles in the surface water is esthetically undesirable and annoys the aquatic biosphere due to reduction of sunlight penetration and depletion of the dissolved oxygen due to their recalcitrance properties coloured particles can also contribute to the failure of biological processes in wastewater treatment plants further the regulations imposed for the discharged coloured effluents have become more stringent and thus motivated the industries to improve their effluent de colourization technology 4 the conventional ponding systems are the most common treatment methods 5 the widely acceptance might be due to its simplicity and a comparable low running cost 6 principally the method involves the use of microorganism to remediate the biodegradable pollutants contained in the pome though several limitations have been attributed to such practices and these include long start up period over 60 days protracting hydraulic retention time hrt 30 days numerous modular emission of odour and inefficient remediation to comply with the discharge standard 7 more so the presence of recalcitrant substances undermines the overall performance of the ponding methods in the effort to avert the negative impact of the poorly treated pome researchers have explored several modifications on the use of activated sludge integrated chemical oxidation process 8 9 ultrasound system 10 11 and microbial inoculation 12 13 with activated sludge are the most common modifications comparing with the conventional ponding method considerable improvements in terms of flocs settleability contaminants removal dewatering performance and shorter treatment cycle were achieved furthermore vijayaraghavan et al 14 attempted using aerobic activated sludge bioreactor equipped with air diffuser to decontaminant pome at a various level of cod the system got acclimatized after 9 weeks seeding under continues aeration conditions similarly chan et al 15 use a sequential batch reactor to remediate anaerobically treated pome under aerobic conditions according to this study the system takes 42 days to acclimatize with an overall organic removal efficiency of 76 it can be noticed that none of the above literature reported on colour removal this is because the existing sludge systems were unable to degrade the colourants due to its recalcitrant nature in concurrence with the aromatic structure 16 more so the combination of ultrasound and chemical oxidation with activated sludge system may not be economically viable for industrial scale due to the high capital involvement 15 the most notable drawback associated with the microbial inoculum sludge system is the rapid multiplication of the biomass and this resulted in difficulty to control the growth rate 17 though activated sludge system with air diffuser presented remarkable cod removal efficiency over 54 83 14 15 the start up duration 42 62 days is considerably long and this seems no difference compared to the ponding system nevertheless despite the aptitude of augmented yeast extract and diary waste as a recipe capable of enhancing the density and adaptability of the bio active sites to sustain faster biodegradation process information on its application for remediating colour pigments in wastewater is still very limited 18 to overcome the stated drawbacks of the current conventional sludge system and provide new information on colour treatment using modified sludge this study focuses on applying a novel start up approach to sustain adequate availability of active biomass for effectual degradation of colourants compound present in pome the primarily activated sludges used in this study were collected from a palm oil mill in facultative and aerobic ponds which were later mixed at an equal ratio combinations of yeast extract and diary wastes were prepared at three different levels and then used to augment the inoculated sludge mixtures in order to examine the impact of the augmented recipe the decolourization performance of the modified sludge was compared with that of the conventional sludge under the same operating conditions more so the morphology and biomass build up of the augmented sludge were continuously monitored using scanned electron microscopy sem analysis active biomass build up mlss and mlvss and settleability index svi during the seeding stage the results of organic cod remediation by the augmented and conventional sludge were fitted with monod models in order to determine the kinetic coefficients 2 materials and methods 2 1 sourcing influent pome anaerobically treated pome ant pome was sourced from an oil palm mill located at carey island malaysia the physicochemical analyses of the ant pome were conducted using standard procedure 19 this is to examine the nutrient balance and contaminants level contained in the sample table 1 normally the minimum nutrients requisite for aerobic growth based on bod n p ratio is 100 5 1 15 from table 1 it can be noticed that the bod n p ratio of the pome sample was 100 7 83 1 and this indicates that the available nutrients are adequate for the aerobic conditions 2 2 sourcing and nutritional characterization of the yeast extract ye and diary waste dw the yeast extract ye saccharomyces cerevisiae emulsifier 491 and ascorbic acid 300 mauri pan were locally procured while the diary wastewater dw was obtained from a dairy farm located in selangor malaysia the nutrition compositions of the ye and dw were analysed using standard procedures this analysis assists in assessing the nitrogen and carbon supplements by the augmented ye and dw to sustain the metabolic alongside with the degradation activities of the active biomass present in the activated sludge 20 the details discussion on the nutritional composition of the augmented ye and dw has been reported under section 3 1 2 3 experimental setup the effect of the augmented yeast extract ye fixed at 10 g and diary waste dw 500 1000 and 1500 ml was examined by comparing the colourants remediation performance to that obtained without the augmented recipe the experimental setup constitutes two identical bioreactor ra and rb with an equal working volume of 29 60 l rb contains the activated sludge with augmented yeast extract and diary waste ye dw while the second reactor ra contains only the activated sludge which was run as the control experiment conventional sludge fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the setups an equal volume 6 l of the mixed activated sludges was inoculated into the two bioreactors initially the activated sludge with augmented yeast extract and diary waste ye dw was cultured for 10 days under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 and the morphology of the active biomass was examined using sem svi mlvss and mlss analysis in order to examine the impact of the augmented recipe on colourants remediation both setups ra and rb were acclimatized under same conditions of gradual loading olr 0 559 0 895 g cod l d and then applied for colour treatment in pome the summary of the treatment conditions during the acclimatization and steady stages alongside with comparable literature data were presented in table 2 on average the operating temperatures and ph s values were relatively in the same ranges but the major differences centred on the type of seeds applied table 2 vijayaraghavan et al 14 use a mixture of activated sludge and cow dung supplemented with nutrients ni co k fe and ca as seed while chan et al 21 only uses activated sludge collected from wastewater treatment plant but they limited the working volume to only 1 8 l the concentration of active biomass mlvss applied in the current study during the start up stage is comparably in the same range with that of chan et al 21 table 2 however it can be noticed that both vijayaraghavan et al 14 and chan et al 21 did not examine the effect of aeration intensity during the steady stage but rather maintained at a fixed value table 2 2 4 start up 2 4 1 seeding bioreactor with rb and without ra augmented recipe activated sludges from facultative and aerobic ponds were obtained from an oil palm mill located at carey island malaysia the sludges were mixed at equal volume 3 l and homogenized using electro electro mechanical agitator am40 d pro argolab at 75 rpm for 30 min certain amounts 500 1000 and 1500 ml of dairy wastewater collected from a dairy farm malaysia together with a fixed amount 10 g of commercial yeast extract saccharomyces cerevisiae emulsifier 491 and ascorbic acid 300 mauri pan were added into the sludges mixture as a recipe to promote microbes cells reproductions and adaptability 22 the sludge mixtures were agitated again at 75 rpm for another 30 min afterwards the mixture was inoculated into the rb and then cultured under continues aeration of 3 l min 1 for 10 days these procedures allow a rapid increase in active biomass population alongside with drastic relegation of autochthonous organic matter 15 the mixture of the augmented recipe ye dw 10 g 500 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml that best sustained the active biomass was identified based on mlvss build up and active biomass index the morphology and building up of the active biomass were monitored using sem mlvss mlss and sludge volume index svi on the other hand the ra was inoculated with the 6 l of the activated sludges mixtures without any augmentation the inoculum was subjected to steady aeration of 3 l min 1 intensity for a period of 48 h to ensure good adaptation 15 2 4 2 acclimatizing bioreactors ra and rb after the completion of the seeding stage both ra and rb were gradually acclimatized to pome degradation by increasing the concentration from the lowest olr to the highest the pome concentrations were varied using dilutions factor of 4 3 2 and 1 and these give a corresponding loading of 0 559 0 746 0 839 and 0 895 g cod l 1 d 1 respectively throughout this stage steady aeration was applied in order to maintain the dissolved oxygen do above 2 mg l 15 the acclimation of the two reactors was monitored based on the depletion percentages of the effluent cod and tss in this study stabilization is considered accomplished with consistent effluent cod removal for three consecutive days 15 2 5 steady state bioremediation performance to compare the remediation performance and stability of the ra and rb after acclimatization both reactors were subjected to thorough evaluation under continues flow conditions at variable hrt 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 h and aeration intensity 3 4 and 5 l min 1 the experimental layout was developed using randomised multi level categoric design trial stat ease design expert v10 0 7 in this experiment the influent ant pome was undiluted and thus the initial colour and cod concentrations were 8570 admi and 4470 mg l respectively all the treatments were replicated thrice this amounted to 54 treatments applied for each of the bioreactors at the end of each treatment the sample of the treated effluent was collected and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and then the final colour and cod concentrations of the clarified supernatants were analysed using calorimetric method 2 6 analytical method 2 6 1 sem analysis about 10 ml of the augmented mixed sludge mixed liquor was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was discarded the accumulated biomass was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehude for 4 h at 4 c subsequently the sample was washed with 0 1 m sodium cacodyl ate buffer and then subjected to post fixing with 1 of osmium tetroxide for a period of 2 h at 4 c the post treated sample was washed again with 0 1 m sodium cacodyl ate buffer and dehydrated using diluted acetone afterwards the dehydrated sample was mounted onto the stub using double sided carbon tape and sputtered coated with a thin gold layer for the microstructures imaging using sem s 3400n 2 6 2 uv spectrophotometric analysis the colour and cod were analysed using uv spectrophotometer hach dr 4000u at an absorbance wavelength of 400 and 620 nm respectively apha 2005 about 2 ml of the samples were pipetted into the cod vials 1500 high range digested at 150 c for 2 h and then allowed to cool before the analysis while the turbidity was analysed at 870 nm wavelength using undigested sample 19 the removal efficiencies were determined using eq 1 1 r e m o v a l 1 c e c i 100 where ce is effluent concentration mg l while ci is influent concentration in mg l 2 6 3 analysis for suspended solids the mlss and mlvss were determined using eqs 2 and 3 respectively initially 100 ml of the sample was filtered through a 0 48 μm filter paper whatman china and then the mass of the retained residues after oven dried at 105 c for 5 h was determined the dried filtered sample was further ignited at 550 c using a muffle furnace for 15 min the mass of the volatile matter was determined as the difference between the mass of the dried and ignited filter furthermore the svi was calculated using eq 4 by measuring the volume of the settled sludge after 30 min standing in 1000 ml imhotep cone while abr was determined simply by taken the ratio of mlvss to mlss using eq 5 2 m l s s m g l m s o l u t e s v s 1000 3 m l v s s m g l m s o l u t e s m 550 c v s 1000 4 s v i 30 m i n l m g v s l u d g e m l s s 1000 5 a b r m l v s s m l s s where vsludge is sludge volume ml vs is sample volume ml while abr is active biomass ratio 2 6 4 proximate and nutritional compositions i the total carbohydrate was quantified using calorimetric method using glucose as the reference standard and the procedures were as per le and stuckey 23 ii the kjeldahl method was employed for the determination of the protein content following the standard procedures as reported by chang and zhang 24 iii fat content analysis was calculated as mentioned in oluwayemisi et al 25 using soxhlet extraction method iv ash moisture and crude fibre content were determined using astm standard procedure as reported by nordin et al 26 while the energy content of the ye was determined using bomb calorimetric method as detailed by lau et al 27 2 6 5 other analysis the bod5 of the initial ant pome sample and the sludges were analysed by standard procedure 28 the samples were prepared in bod bottles and then incubated under continuous stirring for 5 days at 20 c in a dark environment the ph was measured using digital ph meter ionix ph5s while the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were analysed based on hach test using persulfate and molybdovanadate reagents respectively the dissolved oxygen do and salinity were determined using ysi probe arachem 27 181 d 2 7 statistical analysis the significance of the augmentation recipe ye dw 10 g 500 ml 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml on the biomass build up during seeding was analysed using paired t test at 95 confidence level in addition the experimental data obtained during the steady state evaluation were analysed with design expert 10 0 7 software package using analysis of variance anova the significance of the treatment factors was examined based on the magnitude of the f values while the p value less than 0 05 is considered to be statistically significant with 95 confidence level besides the accuracy of the regression model was examined using diagnostic analysis 2 8 kinetic studies microbial kinetics involves the metabolizing process to precede biodegradation of carbonaceous substrate 29 this shows that kinetics of microbial remediation can be express as a function of substrate utilization and the concurrent biomass growth 30 thus this could be a useful model for estimating bioremediation performances for a better understanding of the kinetic degradation taking place in ra and rb monod kinetics models were used to characterize the process by fitting the experimental data into the model the important kinetic coefficients μ max y and kd were determined from the gradients and interceptions of the model plots this procedure is following park et al 30 and tchobanoglous et al 31 the linearized form of the monod kinetic models was presented in eq 6 8 6 h r t c o d i c o d e m l v s s k s k 1 c o d e 1 k 7 k μ m a x y 8 1 h r t 1 y c o d i c o d e m l v s s h r t k d where μ max is specific maximum growth d 1 y is biomass yield g mlvss g cod kd is decay coefficient d 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical analysis of pome and nutritional composition of augmented ye and dw the presence of adequate carbon and nitrogen nutrients along with phosphorous is an important requirement for active microbes to effectively remove carbonaceous pollutants from wastewater 32 the availability of balanced nutrients not only sustains biodegradation of contaminants but also promote microbial proliferation from table 1 the nutritional balance ratio based on bod n p of the sludge s facultative pond 1 aerobic pond 2 and pome sample were all above the minimum requirement 100 5 1 for aerobic growth table 1 this ensures the availability of adequate active biomass mlvss for effectual degradation of organic contaminants 33 however at denser active biomass the available carbon and nitrogen got depleted rapidly and this could result in the endogenous process 30 this shows that augmenting the available carbon and nitrogen as well as phosphorous could assist in checking the endogenous problem on front thus sustaining denser active biomass and better biodegradation processes 21 table 3 shows the proximate analysis and nutritional values of the augmented ye and dw the composition of protein and carbohydrate in the ye were 46 8 and 39 2 g 100 g respectively this level of nutritional composition in conjunction with that of the dw table 3 could greatly sustain effectual biomass metabolic processes and proliferation 14 21 32 based on the previous studies west and strohfus 34 investigated the impact of yeast extract on sphingomonas p growth and they observed that at 0 1 ye concentration maximum yield of 5 11 mg ml was obtained after 3 d retention in addition the stationary growth stage became shorten and this is indicating adequate availability of carbon and nitrogen to sustain rapid autolysis similarly xi et al 20 investigated the effect of augmented ye on the survival and growth rate from the results 30 40 g of the augmented ye not only improve the growth rate but also enhanced the survival rate from 80 47 95 13 3 2 seeding and active biomass build up in rb the presence of adequate carbon and nitrogen along with phosphorous is an important requirement to sustain the microbes for effective degradation of pollutants present in wastewater 32 therefore well balanced nutrients not only sustain biodegradation activity of the microbes but also promote proliferation 35 in this regards the inoculated activated sludge in rb was augmented with yeast extract and diary waste ye dw at a variable combination level 10 g 500 ml 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml then the mixtures were cultured under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 for 10d to enhance the active biomass build up the impact of the augmentation on the active biomass was accessed using the mlvss mlvss mlss abs ratio and svi as indices usually the magnitude of mlvss indicates the level of available active biomass 36 while the svi30 measured the settleability properties of the suspended biomass 37 table 4 presents the results of the active biomass build up using an augmented recipe ye dw the augmented recipe of ye dw 10 g 1500 ml improves the mlvss of the activated sludge to 23 601 mg l after 8th day of culturing under steady aeration of 3 l min 1 and the corresponding svi30 and abr index were 59 87 and 0 8539991 respectively this might be due to the adequate availability of the carbon and nitrogen nutrients which were supplemented by the augmented ye and dw to sustain the biomass activities and aggregation 38 from the proximate characteristics and nutritional values of the augmented ye and dw table 3 the composition contains substantial protein 46 8 g 100 g and 48 mg l and carbohydrate 39 2 g 100 g which could easily get reduced biologically to supplement the available carbon and nitrogen to sustain the biomass metabolic activities and proliferation 20 during these processes the density of the aggregating active biomass increases and thus svi 30 reduces accordingly 38 it can be observed from table 4 that 10 g 1000 ml augmentation had a comparable mlvss of 23585 55 mg l with better settleability index svi30 of 40 02 and 0 9353 abr on the contrary 10 g 500 ml augmentation attained its highest mlvss concentration on the 7th day with 19337 0 mg l and this is much lower compared to the former in addition the corresponding svi30 and abr indices were 132 53 and 0 8453136 respectively the settleability properties of the aggregated biomass in the activated sludge deteriorates with the decrease in the recipe in addition the disparity between the mlvss obtained with 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml augmentation levels seem not much table 4 this suggests that the two augmentations may likely demonstrate a comparable degradation performance under the same treatment conditions however the svi30 and abr index for the 10 g 1000 ml augmentation level was superior table 4 it is likely that the nutrients balance at this level of augmentation gives more favourable conditions for better sustenance of biomass granulation and thus improving the settleability properties 39 based on settleability properties in concurrence with the high abr index 0 8539991 0 9353 the 10 g 1000 ml and 10 g 1500 ml augmentation level were further screened using paired t test analysis to examine the significance in the disparity 3 3 screening augmentation level of the recipe from table 4 the trend in the sludge mlvss build up with augmentation of 10 g 1500 ml and 10 g 1000 ml are very similar however on the 8th day of culture the augmentation of 10 g 1000 ml recorded a better settleability performance with highest abr index of 0 9353 on average this gives a quantitative increment of over 35 31 in the active biomass density in order to examine the significance of the disparity the mlvss and svi30 data for the two augmentation level were subjected to paired t test analysis at 95 confidence level table 5 presents the summary of the statistical analysis and it can be noticed that the p value for the mlvss analysis was 0 027 which is far less than 0 05 this implies that the compared sludge mlvss were statistically not different on the other hand a p value of 0 214 was obtained for the svi30 analysis which is extremely greater than 0 05 thus the differences in the svi30 is significant therefore it can be reasonably deduced that the tendency to attain an equal amount of active biomass with the two augmentation level is 95 high but the 10 g 1000 ml recipes level gives a superior settleability performance furthermore in order to verify the transformation in the granulation sem was used to examine the morphology of the augmented sludge both on day 1 and then on the 8th day the detailed is presented in the subsequent sub section 3 4 morphology of active biomass after identifying the augmentation level with most desirable settleability 40 02 and abr index 0 9353 the morphology of the active biomass in the augmented sludge was examined using sem fig 2 a present s the profile of the sludge active biomass growth mlvss alongside with the mlss and abr index the progressive increase in the active biomass from 17 266 to 23362 45 mg l is an indication of a good balance between the nutrients and biomass at this augmentation level in conjunction with the steady aeration 40 on the 8th to 10th day of seeding a relative constant mlvss concentration was observed fig 2a in order to check the structural transformations sem was used to inspect the morphology fig 2 b and c shows the pictorial microstructure of the biomass present in the augmented sludge on the day one and after 8th day of culture respectively from fig 2 b smooth and scarce granules structures of microbes were observed this clearly shows that the initial seed contained less microbial density on day one however fig 2 c presented larger clusters of bio granules after 8th day of seeding the availability of the numerous larger granules suggests a dynamic bio activities with a stupendous increase in microbial population density which is normally resulted through metabolic and reproduction activities 41 3 5 acclimation results of ra and rb in this study remediation trend in cod and tss were used as indices for monitoring the acclimation process this procedure is as per previous studies 21 29 fig 3 a presents the acclimation profile of the control experiment ra at gradually increasing organic loading olr 0 559 to 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 at olr of 0 559 g cod l 1d 1 it takes over 13 days to attain relatively steady removal of cod and tss of 64 and 47 respectively then the olr was increased to 0 746 g cod l 1d 1 which resulted in a sharp drop in the cod tss removal and the dramatic decrease might be due to a shocking load 21 at this loading ra takes over 20 days to attain stability fig 3 a the effects of the shocking load were repeatedly noticed throughout at every increase in the olr in overall ra with the conventional sludge takes a total of 87 days to achieve acclimation with a relative steady cod tss removal of 57 99 46 25 as indicated in fig 3 a the inconsistency and perceptible shocking effect has been attributed to the poor resistance to inhibitory effect in conjunction with the limited availability of active biomass in the sludge 29 however a different scenario was noticed in the second set ups rb with augmented activated sludge throughout the acclimatization period the rb was relatively stable with respect to the varying olr fig 3 b at olr of 0 559 g cod l 1d 1 a remarkable cod and tss removal efficiency of 99 11 and 99 99 were achieved after 6th day s retention respectively nevertheless on increasing the olr to 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 the cod and tss removal efficiencies slightly dropped to 92 28 and 96 89 respectively it takes almost 11 days to attain stabilization at this stage this shows that the influent feed introduced an additional raw none active biomass in conjunction with recalcitrant substances and this antagonised the metabolic activities 21 compared to ra the rb attained acclimation stability faster at this olr as can be noticed in fig 3b though rb also experiences moderate shocking but easily got adapted to the increased loading olr this might be due to the adequate availability of active biomass which was achieved via sludge augmentation with the recipe 40 more so rb takes only 31 d to attained acclimation with relatively steady cod and tss removal of 92 58 and 96 89 respectively whereas the ra required 87 d to attain acclimation with grossly lower cod and tss removal efficiency of 57 99 and 46 25 respectively fig 3a therefore it can be reasonably deduced that the synergy of metabolic activities of the dense active biomass resulted in a better and consistency degradation performance with varying olr 42 this could be a good reason for the significant reduction in the acclimation time as well as resistance to shocking due to loading 21 43 3 6 bio decolourization performance of ra and rb after acclimation 3 6 1 the combined effect of hrt and aeration on colour removal fig 4 a presents the decolourization percentage obtained using the conventional set up ra at a variable combination of aeration intensities and hrt from fig 4 it can be noticed that the removal efficiency varies between 15 and 37 at aeration of 5 l min 1 an upturn of 37 decolourization was achieved after a retention period of 36 h as the aeration intensity reduces to 3 l min 1 the colour removal efficiency diminished to 22 at this same hrt of 36 h this indicates that to attain effective colour removal a synergy of sufficient hrt with adequate aeration intensity is required to sustain good degradation of the colourants biopolymers lignin tannin and melanoidin into a simpler form such α dicarbonyl 44 although higher removal efficiencies were observed in rb set up when operated under the same conditions fig 4b with rb setup highest colour removal of 63 45 was observed at 5 l min 1 aerations and 36 h hrt in addition at this same aeration intensity with shorter hrt of 24 and 30 h the colour removals efficiencies were 61 85 and 62 90 respectively the appreciable colour removal with rb as against that of ra could be due to the overwhelming and highly adaptive biomass which provides synergistic larger active sites for effectual xenobiotic degradation of the recalcitrant contaminants 45 comparably it is obvious that irrespective of the hrt the treatments performances obtained with 5 l min 1 aerations were superior across all the retention periods fig 4b for example at lower aeration 4 and 3 l min 1 and hrt of 36 h the obtainable remediation efficiencies were 59 58 and 55 08 respectively therefore this shows that sufficient do which is attainable via higher aeration intensity meritoriously support xenobiotic biomass substrate interactions for effective degradation alongside with bio sorption of colour pigments such as lignin and tannin 46 this is because even after extended retentions of 36 h the do in the ra and rb remains relatively steady at 3 10 and 2 85 mg l with the aerations intensity of 5 l min 1 respectively the detailed do profile with respect to varied aerations intensities and hrt are reported in section 3 5 3 more so this condition not only supports the biomass substrate interaction but also averts bulking promote the prolificacy and the entire microbial activities 45 one of the most essential microbial activities is the secretion of extracellular enzymes required for the degradation of the contaminants such as colourants therefore the do concentration must be maintained above a threshold level 2 mg l alongside with sufficient retention to ensure synergy of simultaneous bio enzymatic extracellular reactions metabolic process in conjunction with bio sorption of contaminants colourants 46 therefore it can be reasonably deduced that prolonging the hrt with an adequate supply of aeration warrants the formation of suitable enzymes to sustain the entire bio decolourization processes 47 3 6 2 combined effect of hrt and aeration on organic cod removal cod depletion depends primarily on the metabolic activities of the active biomass 15 fig 5 a presents the synergistic effect of hrt and aeration on the cod removal using the conventional set up ra at a fixed olr of 0 895 g cod l d at 5 l min 1 aeration the highest cod removal efficiency of 70 39 at 24 h hrt in addition at this treatment conditions the do concentration was 3 14 mg l which is adequate to sustain the degradation process 21 33 though it was noticed that the removal efficiency remains relatively constant even at longer retention time 24 h fig 5a as the aeration reduces to 3 l min 1 lower cod removals efficiencies were recorded even at same retention periods as that of 5 l min 1 this observation is analogous to the colour remediation trend in fig 4 a however unlike the colourants contaminants that require longer retention time the degradable cod was virtually depleted completely after 24 h of retention this further confirms the recalcitrant nature of the colourants which always prove difficult to degrade due to their complex aromatic structure 48 in overall the synergy of the treatment factors hrt and aeration demonstrated a notable influence on the cod remediation process this remark concurs with the previous studies 49 51 similar trending influences of the treatment factors were observed in rb set up but with better remediation performances fig 5 b shows the combined effect of the hrt and aeration on cod removal using the rb set up a progressive increase in removal efficiency was observed with hrt at hrt of 36 h and 4 l min 1 aerations the best cod removal of 94 30 was attained however the cod removal dropped to 90 53 at higher aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 even at this same hrt 36 h the decrease in removal efficiency might be due to the shearing effect of the intensive aeration which consequentially disintegrates the bio granular 52 thus the disintegrated granules re contaminate the treated effluent hence lessening the remediation efficiency however a different scenario was observed at hrts of 6 12 and 18 h when rb was operated at the aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 at these stated hrts the cod removal efficiencies obtained with 5 l min 1 were superior to that of the 3 and 4 l min 1 fig 5 b this confirms that extensive exposure of the bio granular to intensive aeration for a longer hrt could undermine the treatment efficiency 52 therefore an adequate level of treatment factors for efficient cod removal is critical furthermore the aeration of 3 l min 1 intensity demonstrated some level of sustenance to the cod degradation process with respect to the hrt but it seems compromising the churning efficacy and this limited the remediation efficiencies because of the loose biomass substrate interaction 49 3 6 3 do concentration of the ra and rb after acclimation stage the foremost impact of the do concentration on remediation performance of activated sludge is usually noticed through the growth of filamentous bacteria and the formation has been attributed low availability of do 21 53 consequentially the predominance of filamentous bacteria could promote bulking as such limits oxygen transfer efficiency into sludge flocs in addition this is capable to cause a significant diminution in the overall biodegradation performance 53 in this study sludge bulking owing to excessive growth of the filamentous were not observed this might be due to the adequate availability of do maintained throughout the experiments fig 6 a and b present the profile of the do concentration for the ra and rb after acclimation respectively it was generally observed that the do reduces with increase in the hrt fig 6a and 6b from fig 6a with the aeration intensity of 5 l min 1 the do concentration of 3 60 mg l at 6 h retention reduces to 3 1 mg l after hrt of 20 h and further diminishes to a relatively steady value of 2 99 mg l after a longer hrt of 30 36 h at lower aeration intensity of 3 4 l min 1 the relatively steady do concentrations were 2 10 and 2 30 mg l respectively comparably the do profile of the rb has a similar trend with that of the ra though with the aeration of 5 l min 1 a dramatic reduction in the do from 3 65 to 2 85 mg l was noticed after 25 h retention this is indicating a significant upsurge in the rate of oxygen utilization by the active biomass due to the geometric increase in the density as well as the overall microbial metabolic activities 54 however the least relatively steady do concentration obtained with 3 l min 1 aeration after 36 h retention was 2 03 mg l fig 6b in overview it can be deduced that adequate availability of the do concentrations 2 03 3 65 mg l was maintained throughout to sustained the metabolic activities and this assist in averting possibilities of bulking in the mixed liquor this remarks and observation are in good agreements with previous studies 21 54 3 7 statistical analysis 3 7 1 anova of bio decolourization data the experimental data obtained based on randomized multi level categoric design at variable hrt 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 h and aeration intensity 3 4 and 5 l min 1 were analysed using analysis of variance anova at 95 level of confidence the summary of the anova results for the colour removal percentage obtained with ra and rb are shown in table 6 the model f values of the regression analysis for the colour removal by ra and rb were 40 64 and 50 15 respectively this shows that the model regression analysis for both reactors was significant 55 also the prob f values for both analyses were all less than 0 0001 as such it is only 0 01 fortuitous for error to transpire due to noise noticeably in the ra the aeration intensity exhibited more influences on the bio decolourization process as indicated by the f value of 47 43 table 6 this is affirming that higher aeration intensity not only provides the required do but also assisted in transporting the biomass within the mixed liquor and thus promoting adequate interaction with the colourants for better degradation 56 however a distinct scenario was observed with rb the hrt demonstrated an upturn impact on the colour remediation process with an f value of 58 40 this shows that the supplied aerations were sufficient to sustain the entire bio activities of the overwhelm suspended active biomass and thus longer retention period hrt promotes better bio decolourization process 57 58 this remark is strongly in agreement with previous studies 57 58 in addition the proximity of the adj r2 ra 0 9420 rb 0 9529 to the pred r2 ra 0 8895 rb 0 9103 together with the respective coefficient of variation cv of 7 03 and 3 28 for the ra and rb shows that the model has a good accuracy since cv below 10 per cent is considered reproducible 55 3 7 2 error diagnostic analysis fig 7 a and b illustrates the actual experimental versus the software predicted values for the ra and rb it is usually applied to diagnose nonlinearity in comparing data 59 from these figures the data points of the actual experimental and predictor s data deviated negligibly from the diagonal lines as shown in the figures the points were scattered close to the diagonal reference line and this is indicating that the errors in the model regression were minimal for both ra and rb 59 60 furthermore normal plots of residuals were used to analyse the compliance of the regression model to the anova assumptions and also the level residual error 60 both figs 7 b and and 8 a show a normal distribution of information by closely aligning with the reference straight line this infers that the bio decolourization data obtained from the ra and rb were normally distributed without significant deviation from the normal plot therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the data were highly inclined to normality as such do not need any transformation however the associated negligible deviations might be due to some unavoidable error source such as human factor 3 8 monod kinetic model the kinetic coefficients μ max y and kd for each reactor ra and rb were evaluated based on the utilization of organic matter cod during the steady state this procedure was in accordance to park et al 30 and chan et al 29 the results of the cod removal obtained at the best sustainable aeration intensity for ra 5 l min 1 and rb 4 l min 1 with respect to the hrt were fitted with the monod kinetic model then the coefficients were determined using the gradients and intercepts of the linearized graphs of the models fig 9 a d the best lines of fits were obtained using least square of linear regression method in order to obtain the corresponding coefficient values with high accuracy 29 the calculated biodegradation kinetic coefficients for ra and rb are summarized in table 7 the maximum specific growth μ max and biomass yield y for ra and rb were 14 12 d 1 1 55 g mlvss g cod and 15 33d 1 2 11 g mlvss g cod respectively in addition the decay coefficient of ra 0 6684 d 1 was far greater than that of rb 0 2091 d 1 in practical application y coefficient is an index showing the correlation between the microbial growth rate and substrate utilization rate since the former grows at the expense of the later 30 therefore based on these results it can be reasonably deduced that the microbial growth substrate utilization rate in rb was successfully improved with the assistance of the augmentation recipe the kd usually measure the level of endogenous decay and as such it is usually preferred low 61 despite the denser active biomass in rb the kd value was within the acceptable value of 0 2091 d 1 while that for the ra was 300 greater this is showing the level of viability and consistency in the bio degradation as well as oxidation processes in the rb 61 the experimental data of the two reactors ra and rb fits excellently with the monod kinetic model and the coefficient of correlations r2 were 0 9839 and 0 9923 respectively besides the kinetic coefficients rb obtained in this study were also compared with the previous literature table 7 despite the higher level cod 4470 mg l applied in this study the kinetic coefficients of rb setup were comparably better to that reported by nakhla et al 62 raj and anjaneyulu 63 couillard et al 64 and vogelar et al 65 nakhla et al 62 examined the kinetic coefficient under aerobic condition using food waste as substrate and the results of the biomass yield y fluctuate between 0 08 0 85 g mlvss g cod and also the kd was considerably high 0 21 0 66 d 1 similarly raj and anjaneyulu 63 reported 0 805 g mlvss g cod of biomass yield at influence cod of 4000 mg l with parallel kd value of 0 45 d 1 in addition both vogelar et al 65 and couillard et al 64 attempted operating aerobic reactor with much lower influent cod 727 2310 mg l and the obtainable y ranges between 0 30 0 45 with kd of 0 32 0 41 d 1 in overall it can be noticed that the augmented activated sludge applied in this study rb has a superior substrate utilization rate with lower tendencies of endogenous decay occurrences this might be due to the impact of the recipe which consequently enhances the density as well as adaptability of the active biomass to give more degradation performances and oxidation of contaminants 42 thus this assisted in cushioning the inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant contaminants while the overall degradation process and microbial cells reproduction improves 21 42 4 conclusion the impact of augmented activated sludge with yeast extract diary waste as the recipe was investigated and then the performances were compared to a conventional activated sludge based on pome decolourization from the results of this study the possible conclusions were outlined as follows the recipes augmentation into the activated sludge mixture improves the active biomass by 35 31 after 8 d of culture the improvement in the available active sites in the augmented sludge drastically shorten the acclimation period to 31 d as against 87 d of that of the conventional activated sludge during acclimatization augmented sludge only exhibited moderate shock with the increase in olr 559 0 895 g cod l 1d 1 and then biodegradation kinetics easily got reverted with a steady cod removal of 92 28 at 0 895 olr a contrary scenario was observed with the conventional sludge at every increase in olr a sharp drop in the cod removal was often noticed but managed to get stabilized at 57 99 after an extended retention period of 87 d the shocking susceptibility at every increase in loading might be due to the inhibitory effect in conjunction with the inadequacy of the active biomass at the same treatment conditions of 36 h hrt and 5 l min 1 aeration the augmented sludge demonstrated a superior colour removal with 63 45 as against 37 of that of the conventional this is indicating that the availability of more active sites gives better colour remediation under adequate treatment conditions the estimated kinetic coefficients proof that the augmented sludge have better microbial growth substrate utilization rate with a biomass yield of 2 1142 mg mlvss mg cod in addition the decay coefficient kd of the conventional sludge was 0 6684 d 1 which is far greater than that of the augmented sludge 0 2091 d 1 this implies that conventional sludge is highly prone to endogenous decay this study suggested that the activated sludge augmented with yeast extract diary waste as recipe gives better decolourization performance than the conventional sludge under same operating conditions the significant improvement in the remediation performance was attributed to the augmented recipes applied into the inoculum declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was

sulfadimethoxine sdm is an antimicrobial drug used in veterinary medicine 2 and is effective against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as against protozoa 3 in some countries it is approved for use in humans to treat urinary tract infections vaginal infections streptococcal pharyngitis and some staphylococcus aureus infections 4 sdm use may result in the development of pathogenic bacterial resistance to drugs and disinfection products 5 7 moreover sdm is continuously introduced into aquatic environments through runoff from manure application to crops or in the case of aquafarming by direct discharge into surface waters endangering aquatic ecosystems sdm has been regularly detected in surface water underground water and drinking water at concentrations of 0 164 91 48 ng l 1 8 9 the prevalence of sulfonamide resistant bacteria and significant enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes has been observed in pig slurry river water sediments and soils adjacent to livestock production facilities worldwide 10 13 consequently a wide range of physical chemical and biological treatments have been developed to eliminate sdm from water 14 16 conventional water treatment techniques including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and disinfection are ineffective in removing sulfonamide antibiotics dissolved in water 17 18 ultraviolet uv light irradiation

light two available lamps are most commonly used low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury vapor lamps lp lamps emit uv light in a narrow band at 254 nm even though h2o2 does not absorb as effectively at 254 nm as it does at other wavelengths good hydroxyl radical yield is achieved with lp lamps due to negligible uv absorption by water mp lamps emit a broad spectrum of light between 200 800 nm mp uv h2o2 systems bear greater photo degradation capacity but lower efficiency and a higher potential for by product formation 20 some studies show that the uv h2o2 process can produce a large number of nonselective hydroxyl radicals ho that attack a wide range of refractory organic compounds under uv radiation with wavelengths of 200 280 nm 21 23 this oxidation process is simple efficient and does not generate secondary pollution of the treated water so it is considered ideal for advanced treatment of drinking water uv h2o2 oxidation has been used to treat sulfonamide antibiotics in water 24 27 yang et al studied the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate and found that uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments were effective in eliminating the drug but that oxidation by uv persulfate could generate toxic products rendering uv h2o2 the more appropriate method 24 understanding the transformation products and the toxicity of sdm in aquatic environments following uv h2o2 treatment is critical but few study has reported the degradation kinetics and dynamics of s sdm following uv h2o2 treatment we investigated the degradation efficiencies of sdm by uv light with wavelengths of 200 280 nm uv c and by uv c h2o2 treatment the effects of the h2o2 concentration reaction time ph and water matrix such as natural organic matter and inorganic anions were evaluated reaction kinetics and sdm degradation byproducts were also assessed besides in order to elucidate the degradation kinetics of targeted pollutant and oh a competitive dynamics experiment could be conducted 28 29 the degradation byproducts were identified using high resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry a potential pathway was proposed involving the initial one electron oxidation of sdm by oh and further reactions of the formed cation intermediate finally the toxicity of the transformation products was estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sdm and

to study water matrix species each experiment was conducted with the addition of a single organic or inorganic species using three concentrations table s1 each experiment was duplicated under identical conditions blank samples containing only deionized water and h2o2 were prepared and monitored for the duration of the experiment as a control these blank samples indicated insignificant sdm volatilization or adsorption losses on the glassware some experiments were carried out with filtered surface water these water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm fiber filters and stored at 4 c 2 3

carbonate delivered at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 2 4 toxicity analysis to assess the acute toxicity of sdm treated by uv c and uv c h2o2 we measured the bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri beijing zhongxiyuanda technology co ltd beijing china using a luminometer promega glomax 20 20 madison wi usa the initial sdm concentration was 0 5 μmol l in deionized water ph 7 and the h2o2 concentration was 10 μmol l the reaction time was 0 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics sdm degradation can be expressed using a first order kinetic model eqs 1 and 2 1 d sdm d t k 1 sdm k d k i sdm 2 l n

first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results direct uv photolysis of sdm was performed in deionized water throughout the treatment fig 1 shows the removal of sdm by the four methods sdm can be significantly removed in uv c ps and uv c h2o2 system h2o2 alone barely removed any sdm from the solution surprisingly direct photolysis by uv c had a notable effect on sdm degradation and processing efficiency was nearly 70 with a first order kinetics constant of 0 005 min 1 at a high uv fluence of 1015 mj cm2 uv c ps system had a better effect on sdm degradation with a first order kinetics constant of 0 0208 min 1 compared with uv c and uv c ps system uv c h2o2 system showed the best processing efficiency of sdm with the high kinetics constant of 0 029 min 1 overall the degradation efficiency of sdm follows the order uv c h2o2 uv c ps uv c photolysis h2o2 we compared this finding with the sdm removal rate by uv c h2o2 h2o2 was initially added at a concentration of 2 20 μmol l prior to irradiation sdm was removed with 90 efficiency at a concentration of 0 5 μmol l sdm ph 7 at a uv fluence of 761 mj cm2 with 10 μmol l h2o2 the uv c h2o2 degradation kinetics result was in agreement with the first order kinetics model and the constant k was 0 029 min 1 the kinetics of oh indirect oxidation were six times faster than those of uv c direct photolysis indicating that uv c h2o2 oxidation is more efficient than uv c photolysis 3 1 2 effect of h2o2 concentration h2o2 concentrations were 2 5 8 10 12 15 and 20 μmol l removal efficiencies and pseudo first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results fig 1b table s2 summarizes the rate constants and correlation coefficient values of uv c h2o2 oxidation using various h2o2 concentrations uv c and uv c h2o2 photolysis followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics r 2 0 99 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 2 μmol l to 10 μmol l during uv c h2o2 treatment the sdm removal efficiencies increased but increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 μmol l to 20 μmol l fig 1b decreased sdm removal efficiency increasing the h2o2 concentration after an optimum value leads to decrease in degradation efficiency that is because h2o2 present in excess can act as a oh scavenger to reduce the oxidation activity of the uv h2o2 system 31 32 it may be that the removal efficiency depends on the reaction rate and the degradation pathway the increase in the sdm removal rate following uv c h2o2 treatment is attributable to the formation of free radicals eq 3 high levels of h2o2 increased the consumption of oh to induce a competition for oh radicals eqs 4 6 28 the sdm removal rate constant varied greatly by h2o2 concentration table s2 3 h 2 o 2 h γ 2 oh 4 oh h

efficiencies and the pseudo first order kinetics rate constant were used to express the results fig 2 sdm removal varied by solution ph the sdm degradation efficiency and rate increased in acidic solutions and decreased in alkaline solutions the notable decrease observed as alkalinity increased may be attributable to the instability and decomposition of h2o2 under alkaline conditions eq 7 23 in addition alkalinity favors the generation of the hydroperoxide anion h o 2 eq 8 which may facilitate the formation of oh eq 9 but may also react with h2o2 and act as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals eqs 10 and 11 33 7 2h 2 o 2 2h 2 o o 2 8 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 h o 2 oh h 2 o o 2 10 h o 2 oh ho 2 oh 11 h o 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 oh sdm degradation efficiencies varied greatly in acidic solutions perhaps owing to the compound s stability under acidic conditions sdm concentrations declined sharply which may have reduced the degradation efficiencies fig s1 3 1 4 effect of water matrix species natural water contains both inorganic and organic matter which may affect the treatment of waterborne pollutants 34 35 the effects of natural organic material and inorganic anions such as chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 nitrogen dioxide no2 and bicarbonate hco3 were investigated using deionized water spiked with varying concentrations of matrix species table s1 each experiment was conducted with the addition of a single factor to the solution removal efficiencies and pseudo first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results fig 3 shows the single factor effect of water matrix species sdm degradation was notably inhibited by natural organic material and hco3 after 30 min of treatment fig 3a hco3 cl and natural organic material reduced sdm degradation because of the scavenging of oh fig 3 shows the effects of 100 200 mg l cl on sdm degradation by uv c h2o2 the sdm removal efficiencies were nearly identical but the removal rate was reduced by 17 2 24 1 and 41 4 at cl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l respectively showing that the addition of cl affected the degradation kinetics cl scavenged oh and similar findings were also reported by chen et al in their work on degradation of the insecticide acetamiprid by uv c h2o2 36 38 alkalinity in natural water is mainly governed by the presence of hco3 carbonate co3 2 and hydroxide hco3 and co3 2 can trap protons in water we used hco3 concentrations of 100 200 mg l to study the influence of alkalinity on uv c h2o2 treatment fig 3 hco3 inhibited uv c h2o2 oxidation of sdm reducing its rate constants with increasing hco3 concentrations perhaps by competition of the radical species with sdm and the scavenger hco3 natural organic material is commonly present in water at a concentration of about 10 mg l several studies have shown that natural organic material can have a significant effect on treatments to remove organic pollutants from water 39 41 we spiked humic acid into sdm solutions at concentrations of 10 20 mg l to assess its effects on sdm removal by uv h2o2 and noted a marked effect the rate constant k for respective concentrations were 0 023 0 020 0 015 min 1 at the same time the color of reaction solution dissolving ha became lighter gradually as the extension of time hco3 and natural organic material can react with oh to form less reactive species with lower redox potential eqs s1 s4 the reaction rate constant k oh hc o 3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 is smaller than that of natural organic material k oh nom 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 42 which may lead to less sdm degradation in addition natural organic material can absorb uv light 43 we found that hco3 cl and natural organic material decreased the rate constant by 24 34 17 41 and 21 48 respectively fig 3b 3 2 sdm degradation in natural water to evaluate sdm degradation by uv c h2o2 in natural water we used surface water and treated water from yuqing lake in jinan of china as samples of natural water table s3 removal efficiencies and pseudo first order rate constants were used to express the results fig 4 removal efficiencies were reduced from the efficiency in deionized water by 7 8 in surface water and 4 4 in treated water furthermore the sdm degradation rate decreased to 0 019 min 1 in surface water and 0 021 min 1 in treated water perhaps because of competition between sdm and the background species previous studies have shown that oh scavengers turbidity total organic carbon hco3 and cl can inhibit sdm degradation 44 45 the treated water we sampled had been purified to meet chinese national standards for drinking water but the oh competitors cl 92 mg l and alkalinity 104 mg l remained in the water reducing the rate constant furthermore the treatment efficiency in surface water was lower than that of treated water perhaps because of the relatively high content of dissolved organic carbon 14 3 mg l in addition the high turbidity 3 25 ntu and chrominance 15 characteristics of the surface water may affect the behavior of light inhibiting sdm removal 43 44 3 3 sdm degradation mechanisms 3 3 1 competition dynamics model to elucidate the degradation kinetics of sdm and oh by uv c h2o2 we conducted a competitive dynamics experiment to determine the second order rate constants k h o s d m between sdm and oh competitor pcba k oh pcba 5 109 m 1 s 1 and sdm at the same concentration 0 5 μmol l were subjected to uv photolysis and uv h2o2 oxidation the competition kinetic model can be calculated from eqs 12 14 12 k oh sdm k oh pcba k i sdm k i pcba 13 k i pcba k 1 pcba k d pcba 14 k i sdm k 1 sdm k d sdm k i s d m k i p c b a are the first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba for indirect photolysis per minute k 1 s d m k 1 p c b a are the observed first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba per minute k d sdm k d pcba are the pseudo first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba for uv direct photolysis per second the values of k d pcba k t pcba k d sdm and k 1 sdm were 0 027 0 124 0 005 and 0 029 per minute respectively suggesting that almost all of the oh produced via uv h2o2 was depleted by pcba consequently the second order rate constant between sdm and oh was calculated to be 2 2 109 per mole per second showing that the reaction kinetics were intense this is in line with the findings of other studies which reported a general distribution range of the second order rate constant between oh and organic pollutants as 106 1010 per mole per second 46 3 3 2 identification of sdm byproducts degradation products were closely related to the mineralization degree i e removal efficiency of total organic carbon of the parent compound although the residual of the parent compound was already very low the total organic carbon losses after 1 2 and 3 h were only 22 2 45 6 and 62 3 respectively demonstrating that sdm was transformed into intermediate organic compounds and then further mineralized into inorganic substances fig s2 the degradation byproducts of sdm during uv c h2o2 oxidation were identified using a mass spectrometer the fragmentation ions of the degradation byproducts with high peak intensity 1 104 or more were selected as candidates for further study table 1 during uv c h2o2 photolysis 11 major byproducts of sdm degradation were identified table 1 fig s3 at different reaction time signal intensities of the 11 major byproducts were different whereas the trend was consistent which was shown in fig 5 3 3 3 proposed transformation pathways the chemical structures of the byproducts suggested possible sdm degradation pathways during uv h2o2 oxidation scheme 1 these transformation products were formed through cleavage by photolysis or oxidation by reactive species such as 1o2 oh so4 and co3 for uv c direct photolysis we hypothesize that byproducts may form through dimethoxy derivatives hydroxylation and stepwise dechlorination sdm degradation involves three bond cleavages 1 c1 and c5 were formed through cleavage of sdm s n s bond scheme 1 r1 2 c7 was formed through cleavage of the co bond scheme 1 r2 consistent with observations in previous studies 47 3 c2 and c11 were formed through cleavage of sdm s c s bond scheme 1 r3 previous studies reported that the formation of aniline was the result of cleavage of the c s bond by solar irradiation 48 49 in agreement with our findings scheme 1 proposed reaction pathways for sulfadimethoxine degradation following ultraviolet light irradiation combined with hydrogen peroxide treatment high reactivity between oh and anilines has been shown 50 where the abstraction of hydrogen is a preferred reaction pathway oh was expected to attack aniline on various positions such as the ortho position para position and nh2 group 51 hydrolysis of aniline radicals could form hydroxylated radicals which could then react with o2 to yield hydroxylated anilines the formation of c9 through aniline reaction can be explained by the above mechanism c10 was formed through coupling of n centered radicals derived from the nh2 group the above aromatic products would then undergo a ring cleaving process eventually being mineralized into organic and inorganic small molecules 3 4 toxicity of transformation products for the acute toxicity test luminescence inhibition we want to compare the acute toxicity of byproducts by uv c and uv h2o2 fig 6 shows the acute toxicity effects luminescence inhibition of sdm on v fischeri following treatment with uv c or uv c h2o2 l 0 is the luminescence of each sample without treatment while l t is the luminescence of the sample at a given time point the ratio l t l 0 is used as an indicator of acute toxicity a lower l t l 0 value indicates higher acute toxicity acute toxicity of the byproducts of uv c h2o2 treatment was lower than the toxicity of the products of uv c treatment 4 conclusions uv c h2o2 treatment removed sdm more effectively than uv c photolysis and the degradation reaction followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics we identified 11 byproducts of the process and proposed the degradation mechanisms involved the main reactions in uv c h2o2 oxidation include bond cleavage electron pair transfer and hydroxylation by oh as well as interreaction of the byproducts the luminescence inhibition results of vibrio fischeri by sdm after uv c or uv c h2o2 process show that the acute toxicity of by products by uv c h2o2 is lower than that of by uv c the results indicate that uv c h2o2 process can remove sdm in water effectively overall classical advanced oxidation process uv c h2o2 was of great potential to control of sdm acknowledgement this study was supported by national major projects on water pollution control and management technology

number of nonselective hydroxyl radicals ho that attack a wide range of refractory organic compounds under uv radiation with wavelengths of 200 280 nm 21 23 this oxidation process is simple efficient and does not generate secondary pollution of the treated water so it is considered ideal for advanced treatment of drinking water uv h2o2 oxidation has been used to treat sulfonamide antibiotics in water 24 27 yang et al studied the degradation of sulfamethoxazole by uv uv h2o2 and uv persulfate and found that uv h2o2 and uv persulfate treatments were effective in eliminating the drug but that oxidation by uv persulfate could generate toxic products rendering uv h2o2 the more appropriate method 24 understanding the transformation products and the toxicity of sdm in aquatic environments following uv h2o2 treatment is critical but few study has reported the degradation kinetics and dynamics of s sdm following uv h2o2 treatment we investigated the degradation efficiencies of sdm by uv light with wavelengths of 200 280 nm uv c and by uv c h2o2 treatment the effects of the h2o2 concentration reaction time ph and water matrix such as natural organic matter and inorganic anions were evaluated reaction kinetics and sdm degradation byproducts were also assessed besides in order to elucidate the degradation kinetics of targeted pollutant and oh a competitive dynamics experiment could be conducted 28 29 the degradation byproducts were identified using high resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry a potential pathway was proposed involving the initial one electron oxidation of sdm by oh and further reactions of the formed cation intermediate finally the toxicity of the transformation products was estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sdm and para chlorobenzoic acid pcba were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa h2o2 solution 35 w w was acquired from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china humic acid was supplied by

to study water matrix species each experiment was conducted with the addition of a single organic or inorganic species using three concentrations table s1 each experiment was duplicated under identical conditions blank samples containing only deionized water and h2o2 were prepared and monitored for the duration of the experiment as a control these blank samples indicated insignificant sdm volatilization or adsorption losses on the glassware some experiments were carried out with filtered surface water these water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm fiber filters and stored at 4 c 2 3 analytical methods sdm concentrations in solution were determined by uplc ms ms waters xevo tq s milford ma usa with a c18 chromatographic column 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm waters acquity uplc the column

carbonate delivered at a flow rate of 0 7 ml min 2 4 toxicity analysis to assess the acute toxicity of sdm treated by uv c and uv c h2o2 we measured the bioluminescence of vibrio fischeri beijing zhongxiyuanda technology co ltd beijing china using a luminometer promega glomax 20 20 madison wi usa the initial sdm concentration was 0 5 μmol l in deionized water ph 7 and the h2o2 concentration was 10 μmol l the reaction time was 0 120 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics sdm degradation can be expressed using a first order kinetic model eqs 1 and 2 1 d sdm d t k 1 sdm k d k i sdm 2 l n

per liter 3 1 1 sdm degradation by uv c uv persulfate and uv c h2o2 we studied the efficacy of oxidation by h2o2 alone 10 μmol l uv c uv c persulfate uv c ps and uv c h2o2 removal efficiencies and first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results direct uv photolysis of sdm was performed in deionized water throughout the treatment fig 1 shows the removal of sdm by the four methods sdm can be significantly removed in uv c ps and uv c h2o2 system h2o2 alone barely removed any sdm from the solution surprisingly direct photolysis by uv c had a notable effect on sdm degradation and processing efficiency was nearly 70 with a first order kinetics constant of 0 005 min 1 at a high uv fluence of 1015 mj cm2 uv c ps system had a better effect on sdm degradation with a first order kinetics constant of 0 0208 min 1 compared with uv c and uv c ps system uv c h2o2 system showed the best processing efficiency of sdm with the high kinetics constant of 0 029 min 1 overall the degradation efficiency of sdm follows the order uv c h2o2 uv c ps uv c photolysis h2o2 we compared this finding with the sdm removal rate by uv c h2o2 h2o2 was initially added at a concentration of 2 20 μmol l prior to irradiation sdm was removed with 90 efficiency at a concentration of 0 5 μmol l sdm ph 7 at a uv fluence of 761 mj cm2 with 10 μmol l h2o2 the uv c h2o2 degradation kinetics result was in agreement with the first order kinetics model and the constant k was 0 029 min 1 the kinetics of oh indirect oxidation were six times faster than those of uv c direct photolysis indicating that uv c h2o2 oxidation is more efficient than uv c photolysis 3 1 2 effect of h2o2 concentration h2o2 concentrations were 2 5 8 10 12 15 and 20 μmol l removal efficiencies and pseudo first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results fig 1b table s2 summarizes the rate constants and correlation coefficient values of uv c h2o2 oxidation using various h2o2 concentrations uv c and uv c h2o2 photolysis followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics r 2 0 99 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 2 μmol l to 10 μmol l during uv c h2o2 treatment the sdm removal efficiencies increased but increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 μmol l to 20 μmol l fig 1b decreased sdm removal efficiency increasing the h2o2 concentration after an optimum value leads to decrease in degradation efficiency that is because h2o2 present in excess can act as a oh scavenger to reduce the oxidation activity of the uv h2o2 system 31 32 it may be that the removal efficiency depends on the reaction rate and the degradation pathway the increase in the sdm removal rate following uv c h2o2 treatment is attributable to the formation of free radicals eq 3 high levels of h2o2 increased the consumption of oh to induce a competition for oh radicals eqs 4 6 28 the sdm removal rate constant varied greatly by h2o2 concentration table s2 3 h 2 o 2 h γ 2 oh 4 oh h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 5 oh h 2 o 2 h o 3 oh o h h 2 o o 3 1 3 effect of ph the ph of the solution is an important parameter in uv c h2o2 oxidation and varied in the sdm solutions between 5 and 9 removal efficiencies and the pseudo first order kinetics rate constant were used to express the results fig 2 sdm removal varied by solution ph the sdm degradation efficiency and rate increased in acidic solutions and decreased in alkaline solutions the notable decrease observed as alkalinity increased may be attributable to the instability and decomposition of h2o2 under alkaline conditions eq 7 23 in addition alkalinity favors the generation of the hydroperoxide anion h o 2 eq 8 which may facilitate the formation of oh eq 9 but may also react with h2o2 and act as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals eqs 10 and 11 33 7 2h 2 o 2 2h 2 o o 2 8 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 9 h 2 o 2 h o 2 oh h 2 o o 2 10 h o 2 oh ho 2 oh 11 h o 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 oh sdm degradation efficiencies varied greatly in acidic solutions perhaps owing to the compound s stability under acidic conditions sdm concentrations declined sharply which may have reduced the degradation efficiencies fig s1 3 1 4 effect of water matrix species natural water contains both inorganic and organic matter which may affect the treatment of waterborne pollutants 34 35 the effects of natural organic material and inorganic anions such as chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 nitrogen dioxide no2 and bicarbonate hco3 were investigated using deionized water spiked with varying concentrations of matrix species table s1 each experiment was conducted with the addition of a single factor to the solution removal efficiencies and pseudo first order kinetics rate constants were used to express the results fig 3 shows the single factor effect of water matrix species sdm degradation was notably inhibited by natural organic material and hco3 after 30 min of treatment fig 3a hco3 cl and natural organic material reduced sdm degradation because of the scavenging of oh fig 3 shows the effects of 100 200 mg l cl on sdm degradation by uv c h2o2 the sdm removal efficiencies were nearly identical but the removal rate was reduced by 17 2 24 1 and 41 4 at cl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l respectively showing that the addition of cl affected the degradation kinetics cl scavenged oh and similar findings were also reported by chen et al in their work on degradation of the insecticide acetamiprid by uv c h2o2 36 38 alkalinity in natural water is mainly governed by the presence of hco3 carbonate co3 2 and hydroxide hco3 and co3 2 can trap protons in water we used hco3 concentrations of 100 200 mg l to study the influence of alkalinity on uv c h2o2 treatment fig 3 hco3 inhibited uv c h2o2 oxidation of sdm reducing its rate constants with increasing hco3 concentrations perhaps by competition of the radical species with sdm and the scavenger hco3 natural organic material is commonly present in water at a concentration of about 10 mg l several studies have shown that natural organic material can have a significant effect on treatments to remove organic pollutants from water 39 41 we spiked humic acid into sdm solutions at concentrations of 10 20 mg l to assess its effects on sdm removal by uv h2o2 and noted a marked effect the rate constant k for respective concentrations were 0 023 0 020 0 015 min 1 at the same time the color of reaction solution dissolving ha became lighter gradually as the extension of time hco3 and natural organic material can react with oh to form less reactive species with lower redox potential eqs s1 s4 the reaction rate constant k oh hc o 3 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 is smaller than that of natural organic material k oh nom 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 42 which may lead to less sdm degradation in addition natural organic material can absorb uv light 43 we found that hco3 cl and natural organic material decreased the rate constant by 24 34 17 41 and 21 48 respectively fig 3b 3 2 sdm degradation in natural water to evaluate sdm degradation by uv c h2o2 in natural water we used surface water and treated water from yuqing lake in jinan of china as samples of natural water table s3 removal efficiencies and pseudo first order rate constants were used to express the results fig 4 removal efficiencies were reduced from the efficiency in deionized water by 7 8 in surface water and 4 4 in treated water furthermore the sdm degradation rate decreased to 0 019 min 1 in surface water and 0 021 min 1 in treated water perhaps because of competition between sdm and the background species previous studies have shown that oh scavengers turbidity total organic carbon hco3 and cl can inhibit sdm degradation 44 45 the treated water we sampled had been purified to meet chinese national standards for drinking water but the oh competitors cl 92 mg l and alkalinity 104 mg l remained in the water reducing the rate constant furthermore the treatment efficiency in surface water was lower than that of treated water perhaps because of the relatively high content of dissolved organic carbon 14 3 mg l in addition the high turbidity 3 25 ntu and chrominance 15 characteristics of the surface water may affect the behavior of light inhibiting sdm removal 43 44 3 3 sdm degradation mechanisms 3 3 1 competition dynamics model to elucidate the degradation kinetics of sdm and oh by uv c h2o2 we conducted a competitive dynamics experiment to determine the second order rate constants k h o s d m between sdm and oh competitor pcba k oh pcba 5 109 m 1 s 1 and sdm at the same concentration 0 5 μmol l were subjected to uv photolysis and uv h2o2 oxidation the competition kinetic model can be calculated from eqs 12 14 12 k oh sdm k oh pcba k i sdm k i pcba 13 k i pcba k 1 pcba k d pcba 14 k i sdm k 1 sdm k d sdm k i s d m k i p c b a are the first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba for indirect photolysis per minute k 1 s d m k 1 p c b a are the observed first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba per minute k d sdm k d pcba are the pseudo first order kinetic rate constants of sdm and pcba for uv direct photolysis per second the values of k d pcba k t pcba k d sdm and k 1 sdm were 0 027 0 124 0 005 and 0 029 per minute respectively suggesting that almost all of the oh produced via uv h2o2 was depleted by pcba consequently the second order rate constant between sdm and oh was calculated to be 2 2 109 per mole per second showing that the reaction kinetics were intense this is in line with the findings of other studies which reported a general distribution range of the second order rate constant between oh and organic pollutants as 106 1010 per mole per second 46 3 3 2 identification of sdm byproducts degradation products were closely related to the mineralization degree i e removal efficiency of total organic carbon of the parent compound although the residual of the parent compound was already very low the total organic carbon losses after 1 2 and 3 h were only 22 2 45 6 and 62 3 respectively demonstrating that sdm was transformed into intermediate organic compounds and then further mineralized into inorganic substances fig s2 the degradation byproducts of sdm during uv c h2o2 oxidation were identified using a mass spectrometer the fragmentation ions of the degradation byproducts with high peak intensity 1 104 or more were selected as candidates for further study table 1 during uv c h2o2 photolysis 11 major byproducts of sdm degradation were identified table 1 fig s3 at different reaction time signal intensities of the 11 major byproducts were different whereas the trend was consistent which was shown in fig 5 3 3 3 proposed transformation pathways the chemical structures of the byproducts suggested possible sdm degradation pathways during uv h2o2 oxidation scheme 1 these transformation products were formed through cleavage by photolysis or oxidation by reactive species such as 1o2 oh so4 and co3 for uv c direct photolysis we hypothesize that byproducts may form through dimethoxy derivatives hydroxylation and stepwise dechlorination sdm degradation involves three bond cleavages 1 c1 and c5 were formed through cleavage of sdm s n s bond scheme 1 r1 2 c7 was formed through cleavage of the co bond scheme 1 r2 consistent with observations in previous studies 47 3 c2 and c11 were formed through cleavage of sdm s c s bond scheme 1 r3 previous studies reported that the formation of aniline was the result of cleavage of the c s bond by solar irradiation 48 49 in agreement with our findings scheme 1 proposed reaction pathways for sulfadimethoxine degradation following ultraviolet light irradiation combined with hydrogen peroxide treatment high reactivity between oh and anilines has been shown 50 where the abstraction of hydrogen is a preferred reaction pathway oh was expected to attack aniline on various positions such as the ortho position para position and nh2 group 51 hydrolysis of aniline radicals could form hydroxylated radicals which could then react with o2 to yield hydroxylated anilines the formation of c9 through aniline reaction can be explained by the above mechanism c10 was formed through coupling of n centered radicals derived from the nh2 group the above aromatic products would then undergo a ring cleaving process eventually being mineralized into organic and inorganic small molecules 3 4 toxicity of transformation products for the acute toxicity test luminescence inhibition we want to compare the acute toxicity of byproducts by uv c and uv h2o2 fig 6 shows the acute toxicity effects luminescence inhibition of sdm on v fischeri following treatment with uv c or uv c h2o2 l 0 is the luminescence of each sample without treatment while l t is the luminescence of the sample at a given time point the ratio l t l 0 is used as an indicator of acute toxicity a lower l t l 0 value indicates higher acute toxicity acute toxicity of the byproducts of uv c h2o2 treatment was lower than the toxicity of the products of uv c treatment 4 conclusions uv c h2o2 treatment removed sdm more effectively than uv c photolysis and the degradation reaction followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics we identified 11 byproducts of the process and proposed the degradation mechanisms involved the main reactions in uv c h2o2 oxidation include bond cleavage electron pair transfer and hydroxylation by oh as well as interreaction of the byproducts the luminescence inhibition results of vibrio fischeri by sdm after uv c or uv c h2o2 process show that the acute toxicity of by products by uv c h2o2 is lower than that of by uv c the results indicate that uv c h2o2 process can remove sdm in water effectively overall classical advanced oxidation process uv c h2o2 was of great potential to control of sdm acknowledgement this study was supported by national major projects on water pollution control and management technology

13998,cationic charged polymer species were synthesized via emulsion polymerization and used as polyelectrolytes in polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration peuf for the removal of the anionic dye methyl orange mo a cellulose membrane with a 30 kda molecular weight cut off mwco was used for the separation process showing almost complete mo removal for a polymer concentration of 1 g l 1 and a

removal efficiency was lower and only ttab and ctab showed removal efficiencies above 90 the flux for the polymer species is slightly lower as for the surfactants but the removal efficiency is higher and carbon leaching into the purified stream is much lower keywords peuf meuf ctab polymer species methyl orange mo 1 introduction water contamination is one of the major problems today for which water treatment has become an urgent issue to provide clean water in the future 1 there are several classical water treatment and recycling technologies that include physical mechanical chemical and biochemical treatment e g adsorption filtration sedimentation coagulation flotation etc 2 also new methods have been developed one of these new methods is micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf in meuf surfactant micelles formed from surfactant monomers above the critical micelle concentration cmc selectively bind to dissolved contaminants and are removed together via membrane filtration 3 although the examples for successful contaminant removal are manifold 3 the method has a severe drawback which is related to the surfactant itself during the filtration the surfactant monomers will pass the membranes and can be found in the purified stream therefore a further treatment step e g an active carbon filter acf as shown by bade et al 4 to remove the surfactant as a second pollutant is required in the case of ionic surfactants which are required to remove charged pollutants this is very problematic because ionic surfactants have much higher cmc values e g 2 4 g l 1 for the often applied anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds approaches to reduce the surfactant concentration in the purified stream are ionic surfactants with lower cmc e g ro90 5 6 or the use of mixed micellar solutions 7 a better alternative for contaminant removal is the use of polyelectrolytes that provide the necessary charge for contaminant binding because the cmc problematic can be avoided besides polyelectrolytes have high molecular weights and can be easily removed by membrane filtration this extension of a classical ultrafiltration process is called polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration peuf recently an extensive review was published by huang and feng 8 in peuf the water soluble polyelectrolyte defines the performance of the peuf process one important type of contaminants are dyes and different removal techniques are reviewed by ahmad et al 9 dye removal via meuf is well investigated and almost complete dye removal is obtained using a surfactant with the opposite charge e g sds for methylene blue removal 10 high removal efficiency for cationic dyes 99 is also obtained for anionic polyelectrolytes in peuf 11 15 interestingly literature about anionic dye removal with polyelectrolytes is scarce one published example is methyl orange removal 86 removal efficiency using chitosan 16 for anionic dyes or other anionic contaminants cationic polyelectrolytes are required cationic polyelectrolytes play an important role in water treatment as shown by wilts et al 17 but mostly in flocculation and coagulation different cationic polyelectrolytes e g poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac are commercially available but in this contribution cationic charged co polymer species were synthesized via emulsion polymerization and investigated as polyelectrolyte in peuf based on our earlier experience for the recycling of a negatively charged homogenous catalyst complex using the polymer species 18 we were interested in their performance in peuf for the removal of methyl orange as a model for anionic contaminants in wastewater the mo dye was selected as the model contaminant because a it has an anionic character b it is quite frequently used by researchers as a model compound in decontamination processes and c its concentration in the aqueous solution containing polyelectrolyte or surfactant is easily accessible by uv vis spectroscopy the peuf performance was evaluated and the results were compared to the analogue meuf process using four classical cationic surfactants from the ctab family 2 experimental part

wtw germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the polymer species the utilized polymer species resemble a polymerized micelle with a nonpolar cross linked polystyrene core and a polar polyethylene glycol peg shell this makes them fully suspendable in water they are functionalized with cationic amino groups which leads to poly cationic polymer species the composition of the polymer species is 74 5 mol of styrene 1 5 mol of divinyl benzene dvb 4 mol of peg monomer and 20 mol of the cationic monomer this leads to a concentration of ionic groups per polymer species of 0 92 mmol g 1 and they are expected to be on the surface of the polymer see fig 1 the polymer species has already been applied as a phase transfer agent and catalyst carrier in multiphasic hydroformylation reactions 18 20 24 it could be shown that the polymer species acts a as carrier for catalyst complexes that are negatively charged e g rh tppts 18 the size of the polymer species is around 80 nm in diameter but the peg chains extend in water and the hydrodynamic radius is around 100 nm the zeta potential of about 50 ms is high enough to electrostatically stabilize the polymer species and shows that the charges are not shielded by the peg shell 3 2 membrane screening in this contribution positively charged polymer species are investigated as an alternative for surfactants in the removal of anionic contaminants from aqueous streams via membrane filtration as a model for anionic contaminants the mo dye was selected a membrane screening to remove the polymer species was performed prior to the filtration experiments with dye four cellulose membranes with different mwco were studied with respect to membrane resistance flux and the removal of polymer species the results are summarized in table 1 with increasing mwco the membrane resistance decreases and the total flux increases because a membrane with a higher mwco provides larger pores so that the liquid permeates easier the results for the membrane resistance are comparable to earlier published values 5 25 interestingly the relative flux slightly increases for the low mwco membrane this can be attributed to a wetting effect due to the adsorbed polymer molecules a similar observation has been published by cornelis et al for the filtration of nonionic surfactants through nanofiltration membranes 26 at higher mwco the relative flux decreases as the larger pores will increase the probability of pore blocking the main goal to remove the polymer species via membrane filtration was achieved in all cases for 5 30 kda the removal of the polymer species is higher than 96 only for the 100 kda membrane the value is slightly lower this result can be explained by the size of the polymer species that are about 100 nm and therefore larger than the size of the membrane pores based on the size of the polymer species the removal efficiency of 100 is expected for the 100 kda membrane the broader pore size distribution might lead to a loss in polymer species and lower removal efficiency for the other membranes we assume that some monomers from the synthesis process might be dissolved in the polymer species which passes the membrane during the filtration process however within an estimated analytical error of 3 for the selected toc analysis the removal is almost complete for further experiments the 30 kda membrane was selected in order to have high flux and a high removal efficiency at the same time for comparison the removal of four cationic surfactants namely detab dtab ttab and ctab with varying chain lengths c10 c16 and the same trimethylammonium bromide head group was studied under similar operating conditions as the cmc values of the four surfactants are very different and vary from 62 1 mmol l 1 for detab to 1 mmol l 1 for ctab 23 the micellar concentration cm cm c cmc was kept constant at 0 562 mmol l in comparison to the individual cmc of the surfactants this difference is low indicating a working point close to the cmc as the cmc values for detab and dtab are very high the total surfactant removal in the filtration process was very low at about 5 for ttab and ctab the surfactant removal was a bit higher at about 9 and 16 respectively gzara and dhabi applied ctab for the removal of chromate ions and in the absence of chromate ions the surfactant removal for a 10 kda polysulfone membrane was about 60 27 this value is higher because the applied polysulfone membrane is hydrophobic and ionic surfactants show a higher tendency for surfactant adsorption as shown by majewska nowak et al 28 although the total surfactant removal close to the cmc is low the removal efficiency for the surfactant micelles is high and adsorbed contaminants can be removed through the filtration process see 3 3 2 based on the results for the filtration of polymer species and cationic surfactants it can be concluded that the polymer species can be removed more efficiently and the permeate solution depending on the mwco of the applied membrane is almost free of carbon contaminant 3 3 removal of methyl orange 3 3 1 polymer species based on the promising results for the filtration of the polymer species in the next step the performance for the removal of mo as a model for negatively charged contaminants was investigated the concentration of the polymer species was kept constant at 1 g l 1 and the mo concentration was varied in a broad range from 5 to 200 mg l 1 the removal efficiency is shown in fig 2 until a mo concentration of about 50 mg l 1 the removal is almost complete above this concentration the efficiency drops the mo dye removal can be explained by the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged mo and the positively charged polymer species fig 3 the concentration of total positive charges of 1 g l 1 polymer species is 0 92 mm with 0 92 mm bf4 so the highest mo dye exchange capacity is 0 92 mm 300 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 we do not reach the maximum adsorption capacity the accessible cationic groups depend on the affinity of mo and bf4 to the quaternary ammonium groups because the distribution of anions in the aqueous phase and on the polymer phase depends on both selectivity and concentration as the concentration of bf4 is constant and only the concentration of mo increases electrostatic repulsion between the mo molecules and steric hindrance at the quaternary ammonium ions lower the maximum binding capacity it has to be mentioned that mo membrane adsorption might contribute to mo removal efficiency to a certain amount depending on the total mo concentration however the main reason for mo dye removal is the filtration of the polymer species with electrostatically bound mo dye besides the distribution coefficient d the binding constant kp and the polymer loading lp were calculated from eq 4 eq 6 4 d c r c p 5 k p l m o l c r c p c p s r 6 l p m o l m o l c r c p s r cp and cr are the methyl orange concentrations in permeate and retentate respectively sr is the concentration of the polymer species in the retentate solution all values as a function of the methyl orange concentration in the feed solution are shown in fig 4 with an increasing feed concentration the removal efficiency decreases as already discusses above as a result of the higher mo concentration which also leads to a higher number of charges and an increased ionic strength the partition characteristics log kp and d shows a decreasing trend from the curves the mo feed concentration of 10 mg l 1 shows the best performance which results in p mo mass ratio of 100 to verify that electrostatic interaction is the main reason for mo removal two reference experiments were performed in the first experiment mo was replaced by the positively charged dye mb and filtered under similar conditions in the second one a mixture of mo and mb was filtered under similar conditions in both cases the retentate and permeate solutions were investigated by uv vis spectroscopy fig 5 in the absence of mo the intensity of the mb peak was lowered caused by mb adsorption about 25 on the membrane surface indicated by a change in membrane color in the presence of mo the permeate solution does not show a peak for mo it is assumed that the main contribution for mo dye removal is due to the polymer even though an adsorbed mb layer may support the mo dye removal as further proof that the mo molecules are adsorbed at the polymer species the highest mo concentration of 200 mg l was filtered through the 30 kda membrane in the absence of polymer species the uv vis spectra are shown in fig 6 in the absence of the cationic charged polymer species the mo dye removal efficiency is only 26 as expected this value is much lower than in the presence of the polymer species rmo 83 at higher dye concentrations the dye can adsorb to the membrane surface to a higher extend which can explain the removal efficiency of about 26 as an example posniak et al studied the removal of dyes with sds and ctab as surfactants using a pes membrane and in the absence of the surfactant the removal efficiency of mo dye was about 20 29 3 3 2 cationic surfactants after investigating the polymer species for the separation process four cationic surfactants were investigated for mo removal the mo removal efficiency in comparison to the polymer species is shown for the 30 kda membrane in fig 7 for detab and dtab the removal efficiency is low at about 15 and 37 respectively for ttab the removal efficiency is already above 90 and for ctab the removal efficiency is 95 and comparable to the polymer species the high removal efficiency for anionic dyes with cationic surfactants e g ctab or cpc often with lower membrane mwco has already been reported in the literature e g for alizarin red s 98 8 30 mordant black 11 99 3 31 or ramazol dyes 95 32 however there is no report about a systematic study of cationic surfactants of the same family here we could systematically change the chain length of the cationic surfactant from c10 to c16 with increasing length of the carbon chain within the cationic surfactant the cmc value decreases from 62 1 mmol l 1 detab to 1 0 mmol l 1 ctab 23 the aggregation number increases from 48 dtab to 62 ctab 33 and the hydrodynamic radius rh of the micelles increases from 0 95 nm dtab 34 to about 3 nm ctab 35 the different cmc values of the cationic surfactants have already been considered during the experiments so that a higher total surfactant concentration was used for the low chain cationic surfactants therefore the removal efficiency can t be explained by the surfactant concentration however the size of ctab is about three times higher than the size of dtab and can be regarded as the main cause for the high removal efficiency of ctab it should be mentioned that a membrane with relatively large pores was applied for the experiments the d50 value for the 30 kda membrane is given with 6 3 nm by schwarze et al 36 which is much larger than the rh value of dtab but close to the value of ctab a membrane with a smaller mwco will increase the removal efficiency for detab or dtab but the 30 kda membrane was selected to combine higher flux and higher removal efficiency using the polymer species the permeate flux is shown in fig 8 as obvious from fig 8 the flux for the different systems is in the same order of magnitude and differs only slightly the flux for the cationic surfactants is in the following order ctab ttab detab dtab interestingly a maximum flux is observed for dtab as the concentration c cmc was kept constant the explanation for the flux dependency is difficult because the cmc values for the surfactants are very different detab has the highest cmc and a higher extend of pore blocking due to the much higher surfactant concentration might be the reason for the lower flux however the cmc of ctab is the lowest and it shows the lowest flux the permeate fluxes for both the best surfactant system and the polymer species are almost equal considering only the flux and mo removal efficiency ctab and polymer species show similar ultrafiltration performance with a slightly higher removal efficiency for mo using the polymer species see fig 7 although the mo removal efficiency with ctab is very high the high cmc is still the major drawback and ctab will be found in the permeate stream after treatment in contrast the polymer species show a very high mo removal efficiency with less carbon leaching into the permeate solution 4 conclusions positively charged polymer species were synthesized and applied in peuf for the removal of methyl orange almost complete mo removal was achieved for a mo concentration up to 50 mg l 1 and a polymer concentration of 1 g l 1 using a 30 kda cellulose membrane at higher mo concentrations the removal efficiency decreases because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance the main reason for mo dye removal is the electrostatic interaction between the mo dye and the polymer species that also allows for very efficient separation of dyes with different charges e g mo and mb from four investigated cationic surfactants detab ttab dtab and ctab that strongly differ in their cmc values only dtab and ctab showed a comparable removal efficiency due to the larger size of the surfactant micelles although the polymer species show a slightly lower flux compared to dtab and a similar flux compared to ctab the overall performance of the polymer species is much better because the carbon leaching into the purified stream is much lower compared to the cmc value of the cationic surfactants for the non optimized experiments the mass concentration for the polymer species 1 g l 1 was 1 8 times higher than for the best cationic surfactant ctab 0 57 g l 1 the bit higher concentration should not be a problem because the polymer species is good recyclable but as nabf4 is formed as a byproduct of the complex formation further investigations are necessary to evaluate the environmental impact the nabf4 amount in the purified stream depends on the polymer concentration and larger amounts of nabf4 might be removed in a follow up desalting process acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the einstein foundation berlin for the financial support 
13998,cationic charged polymer species were synthesized via emulsion polymerization and used as polyelectrolytes in polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration peuf for the removal of the anionic dye methyl orange mo a cellulose membrane with a 30 kda molecular weight cut off mwco was used for the separation process showing almost complete mo removal for a polymer concentration of 1 g l 1 and a

water treatment has become an urgent issue to provide clean water in the future 1 there are several classical water treatment and recycling technologies that include physical mechanical chemical and biochemical treatment e g adsorption filtration sedimentation coagulation flotation etc 2 also new methods have been developed one of these new methods is micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf in meuf surfactant micelles formed from surfactant monomers above the critical micelle concentration cmc selectively bind to dissolved contaminants and are removed together via membrane filtration 3 although the examples for successful contaminant removal are manifold 3 the method has a severe drawback which is related to the surfactant itself during the filtration the surfactant monomers will pass the membranes and can be found in the purified stream therefore a further treatment step e g an active carbon filter acf as shown by bade et al 4 to remove the surfactant as a second pollutant is required in the case of ionic surfactants which are required to remove charged pollutants this is very problematic because ionic surfactants have much higher cmc values e g 2 4 g l 1 for the often applied anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds approaches to reduce the surfactant concentration in the purified stream are ionic surfactants with lower cmc e g ro90 5 6 or the use of mixed micellar solutions 7 a better alternative for contaminant removal is the use of polyelectrolytes that provide the necessary charge for contaminant binding because the cmc problematic can be avoided besides polyelectrolytes have high molecular weights and can be easily removed by membrane filtration this extension of a classical ultrafiltration process is called polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration peuf recently an extensive review was published by huang and feng 8 in peuf the water soluble polyelectrolyte defines the performance of the peuf process one important type of contaminants are dyes and different removal techniques are reviewed by ahmad et al 9 dye removal via meuf is well investigated and almost complete dye removal is obtained using a surfactant with the opposite charge e g sds for methylene blue removal 10 high removal efficiency for cationic dyes 99 is also obtained for anionic polyelectrolytes in peuf 11 15 interestingly literature about anionic dye removal with polyelectrolytes is scarce one published example is methyl orange removal 86 removal efficiency using chitosan 16 for anionic dyes or other anionic contaminants cationic polyelectrolytes are required cationic polyelectrolytes play an important role in water treatment as shown by wilts et al 17 but mostly in flocculation and coagulation different cationic polyelectrolytes e g poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac are commercially available but in this contribution cationic charged co polymer species were synthesized via emulsion polymerization and investigated as polyelectrolyte in peuf based on our earlier experience for the recycling of a negatively charged homogenous catalyst complex using the polymer species 18 we were interested in their performance in peuf for the removal of methyl orange as a model for anionic contaminants in wastewater the mo dye was selected as the model contaminant because a it has an anionic character b it is quite frequently used by researchers as a model compound in decontamination processes and c its concentration in the aqueous solution containing polyelectrolyte or surfactant is easily accessible by uv vis spectroscopy the peuf performance was evaluated and the results were compared to the analogue meuf process using four classical cationic surfactants from the ctab family 2 experimental part

wtw germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the polymer species the utilized polymer species resemble a polymerized micelle with a nonpolar cross linked polystyrene core and a polar polyethylene glycol peg shell this makes them fully suspendable in water they are functionalized with cationic amino groups which leads to poly cationic polymer species the composition of the polymer species is 74 5 mol of styrene 1 5 mol of divinyl benzene dvb 4 mol of peg monomer and 20 mol of the cationic monomer this leads to a concentration of ionic groups per polymer species of 0 92 mmol g 1 and they are expected to be on the surface of the polymer see fig 1 the polymer species has already been applied as a phase transfer agent and catalyst carrier in multiphasic hydroformylation reactions 18 20 24 it could be shown that the polymer species acts a as carrier for catalyst complexes that are negatively charged e g rh tppts 18 the size of the polymer species is around 80 nm in

membrane was selected to combine higher flux and higher removal efficiency using the polymer species the permeate flux is shown in fig 8 as obvious from fig 8 the flux for the different systems is in the same order of magnitude and differs only slightly the flux for the cationic surfactants is in the following order ctab ttab detab dtab interestingly a maximum flux is observed for dtab as the concentration c cmc was kept constant the explanation for the flux dependency is difficult because the cmc values for the surfactants are very different detab has the highest cmc and a higher extend of pore blocking due to the much higher surfactant concentration might be the reason for the lower flux however the cmc of ctab is the lowest and it shows the lowest flux the permeate fluxes for both the best surfactant system and the polymer species are almost equal considering only the flux and mo removal efficiency ctab and polymer species show similar ultrafiltration performance with a slightly higher removal efficiency for mo using the polymer species see fig 7 although the mo removal efficiency with ctab is very high the high cmc is still the major drawback and ctab will be found in the permeate stream after treatment in contrast the polymer species show a very high mo removal efficiency with less carbon leaching into the permeate solution 4 conclusions positively charged polymer species were synthesized and applied in peuf for the removal of methyl orange almost complete mo removal was achieved for a mo concentration up to 50 mg l 1 and a polymer concentration of 1 g l 1 using a 30 kda cellulose membrane at higher mo concentrations the removal efficiency decreases because of electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance the main reason for mo dye removal is the electrostatic interaction between the mo dye and the polymer species that also allows for very efficient separation of dyes with different charges e g mo and mb from four investigated cationic surfactants detab ttab dtab and ctab that strongly differ in their cmc values only dtab and ctab showed a comparable removal efficiency due to the larger size of the surfactant micelles although the polymer species show a slightly lower flux compared to dtab and a similar flux compared to ctab the overall performance of the polymer species is much better because the carbon leaching into the purified stream is much lower compared to the cmc value of the cationic surfactants for the non optimized experiments the mass concentration for the polymer species 1 g l 1 was 1 8 times higher than for the best cationic surfactant ctab 0 57 g l 1 the bit higher concentration should not be a problem because the polymer species is good recyclable but as nabf4 is formed as a byproduct of the complex formation further investigations are necessary to evaluate the environmental impact the nabf4 amount in the purified stream depends on the polymer concentration and larger amounts of nabf4 might be removed in a follow up desalting process acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the einstein foundation berlin for the financial support 
13999,phosphorus is an important and irreplaceable macronutrient for biological processes and is on the list of critical raw materials of the european union accumulation in water bodies requires an extra effort to promote its recovery this study aims to synthesize characterize and test a reliable adsorbent in acidic to neutral conditions several chemical modifications are tested to select the best adsorbent through the screening phase it is possible to conclude that the chemical modification of calcined eggshell with magnesium and iron iii does not improve the adsorption capacity thus the material produced with 2 3 of iron and 1 3 of calcined eggshell reveals the best properties ofeces 0 5 specific surface area of 270 m2 g and performance to proceed with the tests the influence of initial ph and adsorbent dosage is investigated to determine the best operating conditions the adsorbent revealed better performance in acidic conditions ph 6 than in basic medium langmuir freundlich model reveals the best fitting r2 0 989 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g the pseudo first order model describes the adsorption kinetic with constants between 0 0353 and 0 0126 1 min for an initial concentration of 50 and 400 mg p po4 l the adsorbent selected is regenerated with an efficiency of 50 using an alkaline solution in contact with a real effluent the iron oxyhydroxide removes 50 of phosphate this work shows that iron oxyhydroxide with calcined eggshell has the potential as an adsorbent to remove phosphate from wastewaters keywords phosphate recovery adsorption calcined eggshell iron oxyhydroxide real effluent 1 introduction phosphorus p is a key element to fundamental biological processes that involve genetic material dna and rna energy supply atp and structural body support provided by membranes phospholipids phosphate rock is the main source of p used in anthropogenic activities namely for food production for which phosphorus fertilizers are fundamental about 82 of p extracted from phosphate rock is applied in the production of fertilizers while 7 is used to be processed as a food supplement for animals the remaining is employed to complement the demands in diverse industries 1 nowadays with the exponential growth of the global population the exploitation of p has increased excessively to meet the demand for food indeed about 270 mt of phosphate has been mined per year 2 which will lead to a gradual depletion of accessible fossil reserves and promote a more laborious and expensive exploration the european commission included p in the list of critical raw materials since this element is of great importance to the economy and with high supply risk morocco western sahara china south africa jordan and the united states are the regions with the main phosphate rock reserves 3 about 74 of the global reserves of p are in morocco 1 however china is the principal supplier with 54 of the market while morocco and sahara represent only 11 2 human activity leads to changes in the phosphorus cycle which causes accumulation in water bodies p enters the water bodies through different ways leaching of human animal droppings and superficial contaminated waters from agriculture activity losses during phosphate rocks mining and industrial emissions 4 5 around 56 of p losses in the aquatic system are due to erosion and leaching of cultivated land 6 moreover each person excretes 1 1 5 g p day 7 concentrations higher than 2 mg p l can promote excessive algae growth algae bloom in water bodies known as eutrophication 8 this phenomenon can cause the break of the food chain since algae block the gas exchange causing a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content 9 10 phosphates are the most common forms of phosphorus in natural water and wastewater mainly as soluble orthophosphates municipal wastewaters can contain a phosphate concentration of 4 15 mg l 8 11 although these concentrations seem low the municipal effluent flow rate is high a wastewater treatment plant wwtp can receive 200 l cap day with 10 mg l of p 4 besides according to regulation ec nº 1882 2003 of the european parliament and the council of the european union the maximum concentration of p for discharging effluents in natural water bodies is 2 mg l based on a circular economy perspective several investigations aim to uptake p from liquid effluents to prevent environmental issues the most applied technologies to recovery phosphorus are chemical precipitation and biological processes 5 although chemical precipitation is not dependent on microorganisms it has a low recovery potential from aqueous phases 4 furthermore these processes use chemical compounds intensively and produce sludge 12 13 alternatively the adsorption processes have gained interest in p recovery from wastewaters this technology is an efficient selective simple and economical operation involving commonly fast kinetics and the adsorbent can be reused 10 13 14 thus the adsorption process was the method selected in this work it is well known that phosphate ions have an affinity with calcite and iron oxides 5 11 santos et al 14 obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 39 0 mg po4 3 g at ph 8 using calcined eggshell at 700 c ces however calcined eggshell dissolves in acid medium hindering the use in liquid matrices with a ph lower than 7 mezenner and bensmaili 11 studied eggshell modified with iron chloride and concluded that the material had a maximum adsorption capacity of 14 5 mg po4 3 g in contrast xu and gao 15 reported a lower efficiency to remove p also with iron chloride modified eggshell 3 74 mg po4 3 g but the modification process used in this case was slightly different modifying eggshell and calcinated eggshell with magnesium is also promising ahmad et al 16 reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 109 and 133 mg po4 3 g for magnesium modified eggshell and calcinated eggshell respectively iron oxides may achieve better results to remove p by adsorption deliyanni et al 17 reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 183 mg po4 3 g for akaganeite β phase of anhydrous ferric oxyhydroxide feooh where some chloride ions can be included in the structure at ph 7 however the p removal efficiency by iron oxides adsorbents can be boosted in acidic medium 18 indeed ajmal et al 19 noticed that the increase in ph from 6 to 9 leads to a decrease in the adsorption capacity from 7 63 to 4 24 mg po4 3 g for goethite this mineral can reach maximum adsorption of 50 5 mg po4 3 g at ph 7 a mixture of akaganeite and iron hydroxide agglomerates achieved a capacity of 110 mg po4 3 g for an initial concentration of 12 3 mg po4 3 l 20 a combination of iron and calcium carbonate could be of interest for recovering p iron is the most abundant transition metal in nature 21 and is usually linked with other elements to form oxides or hydroxides at least there are 16 iron oxides and oxyhydroxides species where hematite maghemite magnetite goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite are the most common the solubility and the oxidation state of iron are highly dependent on ph on the other hand an interesting source of calcium carbonate is eggshell es which is a ceramic material of biological origin with a crucial role in egg formation this material represents about 11 of the total weight of the egg in the case of chickens and contains approximately 94 of caco3 22 an eggshell can contain 7 000 17 000 pores which increases the surface area as adsorbent 23 the eu produced about 6 mt of eggs in 2017 which represents about 0 7 mt of es since the landfill is the main option to dispose of this byproduct its reuse or recycling is essential based on the good performance reported by the literature es and ces were considered also in this study 14 this study aims to develop characterize and test an efficient and stable adsorbent to remove p from acidic to neutral wastewater to the best of our knowledge the present study addresses for the first time and simultaneously several modification procedures of ces and investigates new combinations of iron oxides and ces moreover the best performing adsorbent is also tested with a real effluent matrix which complements the lack of other studies thus the main proposal is to synthesize an adsorbent to recover p from wastewaters with a material based on a highly abundant element fe on earth and a waste eggshell currently discarded in landfills 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents eggshell es and calcined es at 700 c ces were prepared using the procedure described by santos el al 14 a solution of iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o was utilized to modify es and ces and synthesize iron oxyhydroxide also mgcl2 6h2o was tested as a modifying agent of es and ces potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was used in the preparation of synthetic phosphate solutions which were later utilized in adsorption tests moreover 1 0 m naoh or 1 0 m hcl solutions were employed to control ph samples of real effluent were collected at the exit of an anaerobic digestion reactor operating in mesophilic conditions 35 c in a wwtp located in the central region of portugal the anaerobic digester uses primary and secondary sludge as a substrate 2 2 screening of adsorbent several chemical modifications were evaluated during the screening phase to determine the adsorbent with the best performance es and ces were both modified with 5 mg l of iron and magnesium salts briefly 0 25 g of es or ces were added to 100 ml of a solution with the desired salt concentration the suspension was stirred 80 rpm for 24 h at 25 c 11 16 then the solid material was filtered and dried at 40 c overnight moreover different iron concentrations were analyzed 10 500 mg fe l using the same procedure furthermore an iron synthesized material was prepared according to chitrakar et al 18 while ces was added during synthesis the method for producing akaganeite involves the dropwise addition of 0 1 m naoh into 0 1 m fecl3 solution until ph 10 afterward the suspension was stirred for 1 h ces was mixed with an iron salt solution at the beginning of the naoh addition the produced materials involved fe ces ratios of 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 in a weight dry basis subsequently the precipitate was centrifuged washed with distilled water and dried at 40 c finally it was ground to 0 149 to 0 420 mm table 1 summarizes the nomenclature used hereafter the screening experiments were carried out with a dosage of 10 g l at 25 c under stirring conditions 100 rpm some tests were conducted with different phosphate concentrations and ph to evaluate the adsorbent performance over a wider range of conditions after adsorption the suspension was filtered using a 0 45 μm pore filter and the concentration of p in phosphate form p po4 was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry using a wavelength of 650 nm epa method 365 3 the adsorption capacity and the efficiency of phosphate removal r p po4 was determined through eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e v m c 0 c e 2 r p p o 4 1 c t c 0 100 where q e is the amount of phosphate adsorbed mg g v is the volume of solution l m is the mass of the adsorbent g c0 ce and ct are the phosphate concentration mg l at initial equilibrium and at t time respectively furthermore the total dissolved solids tds at various ph were measured to assess adsorbent stability the ph after adsorption was also recorded since it must be within the effluent discharge limits between 6 and 9 2 3 adsorbent characterization panalytical xpert pro diffractometer cuk α radiation 2theta 10 to 80 range with a monochromator of graphite was used to identify through x ray diffraction xrd the pattern of the crystalline phases of the selected adsorbent then the panalytical highscore plus 4 1 pdf 4 software allowed the identification of the different phases the specific surface area was obtained based on the bet method using a micromeritics germini 2380 the n2 adsorption desorption also allowed to determine the pore volume the morphology and elemental surface composition of the adsorbent before and after contact with a solution with p po4 were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem in a hitachi su 70 microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds bruker quantax 400 detector natural ph was measured in a 1 10 solid liquid suspension the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc was assessed in a suspension of 1 g of the solid sample in 50 ml of 0 1 m nano3 solution 24 then the suspension was stirred for a few minutes to ensure homogeneous conditions afterward seven subsamples were obtained from the original matrix where 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions were added to adjust ph to 2 4 6 7 8 10 and 12 malvern instruments zetasizer nano zs equipment was employed to measure the zeta potential 2 4 batch equilibrium and kinetics experiments the adsorbent dosage effect was studied by keeping constant the initial phosphate concentration at 600 mg p po4 l and varying the adsorbent dosage between 10 and 50 g l multiple initial phosphate concentration 10 800 mg p po4 l with a constant dosage 10 g l was used to determine the adsorption isotherm these assays were performed in duplicate at 25 c ph 6 and 100 rpm for 6 h eq 1 is employed to quantify the phosphate adsorbed langmuir eq 3 freundlich eq 4 and langmuir freundlich eq 5 models were tested to describe the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e n f 5 q e q m l f k l f c e n l f k l f c e n l f

intervals from 30 to 360 min aliquots of liquid were withdrawn to quantify the adsorbed p po4 pseudo first order eq 6 and pseudo second order eq 7 models were applied to describe the kinetics of the adsorption process 6 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 7 1 q e q t 1 q e k 2 t where qt and qe are the quantities adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively mg g t is the time min k1 is the rate constant of

selected adsorbent the effluent was centrifugated and filtered before the characterization and the experimental testing batch experiments were carried out with a dosage of 10 g l at 25 c under stirring conditions 100 rpm chemical oxygen demand cod ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were determined according to the standard methods 27 to analyze the wastewater 2 5 desorption studies after the contact with a solution of 400 mg p po4 l for 6 h the adsorbent was separated by filtration dried and used to perform the desorption assays the amount of phosphate adsorbed was calculated as in the equilibrium studies eq 1 thus 0 08 g of saturated adsorbent was added to 40 ml of the eluent the flasks were closed and stirred 100 rpm in a thermostatic bath for 24 h solutions of 0 1 m 0 5 m and 1 m were tested as solvents afterward the suspension was filtered and the phosphate concentration measured in the supernatant the desorption efficiency η d e s was obtained using the eq 8 8 η d e s c d e s v q e m 100 where c d e s is the phosphate concentration in the liquid of the desorption test mg p po4 l v is the eluent volume l m is the mass of saturated adsorbent g and q e is the phosphate quantity at the end of the adsorption assay saturation conditions mg p po4 g 2 6 statistical analysis a tukey hsd test p 0 05 was performed to detect statistically significant differences between adsorption capacities and removal efficiencies during the screening phase sigmaplot software was used to perform nonlinear regression to experimental data equilibrium and kinetic test the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse values were adopted as criteria to select the best fitting for adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of adsorbent the screening phase involved several materials es esfe5 esmg5 ces cesfe5 and cesmg5 which were tested in a phosphate concentration near the typical values found in a real effluent 10 mg p po4 l es performance improved slightly with the chemical modification fig 1 a however when ces was modified with fe and mg salts the removal efficiency was reduced indeed esfe5 cesfe5 esmg5 and cesmg5 had removal efficiencies of 16 9 67 5 20 3 and 25 3 respectively while es and ces were close to 0 and 100 although a slightly higher removal was observed when comparing the performance of es with esfe5 and with esmg5 the results were statistically similar p 0 05 thus es esfe5 esmg5 and cesmg5 were discarded for further studies due to the low efficiencies achieved subsequently ces was modified with different iron concentrations 10 100 250 and 500 mg l fig 1 b for these materials higher initial phosphate concentration 100 mg l was used to facilitate the discriminations of the different materials fig 1 b shows that the fe content influences the adsorbent performance cesfe10 and cesfe500 were statistically different in terms of adsorption capacity p 0 05 and for the highest fe concentration the adsorption capacity was almost double from 6 4 11 1 mg p po4 g according to the literature despite fe modification may decrease the specific surface area the concentration of active sites for adsorption of anionic species can increase 28 xu and gao 15 reported a modified eggshell with 500 mg fe l had an adsorption capacity of 12 mg p po4 g for an initial concentration of 153 mg p po4 l in good agreement with the results attained in the present study 11 1 mg p po4 g when the ph is set at 6 or 8 the adsorption performance was not significantly changed p 0 05 for example cesfe10 achieved a removal efficiency of 52 5 at both ph regardless of the initial ph 6 or 8 the final ph value of the supernatant was always between 8 and 9 except for ces indeed after ces contacting with the supernatant the ph rises to 12 while the adsorption capacity is 10 9 mg p po4 g in agreement with santos et al 14 as the cesfe500 and ces show similar adsorption capacity chemical modification with fe does not have a competitive advantage in terms of efficiency however the ph variation in the final solution is smaller which is beneficial for application to real effluents thus further studies aim to synthesize a simple efficient and stable material under acidic conditions accordingly iron oxyhydroxide with and without ces are synthesized and evaluated fig 2 a the iron oxyhydroxide revealed the ability for p removal in acidic conditions fulfilling the objective of this work in fact the adsorption capacity increased from 23 9 37 9 mg p po4 g for ph 4 and 8 respectively despite ces being more efficient at ph 8 it dissolves for acidic ph 14 thus the modification of ofe with ces was studied only at ph 8 for comparison purposes with the results obtained with ces the adsorption capacities obtained for ofe ofeces 1 and ofeces 0 5 are statistically similar to each other but different from ofeces 2 the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency of all materials evaluated are summarized in table 2 the supernatant ph after adsorption final ph is a crucial parameter in the carried research because the discharge limits for effluents are between ph 6 and 9 fig 2 b represents the final ph obtained by the iron rich adsorbents tested where bars with the same letter are not significantly different according to tukey s test p 0 05 the results show that ces exceeds the upper limit while ofe ofeces 2 and ofeces 1 tend to ph 9 thus these materials are not considered reliable to proceed with the tests due to its good stability low percentage of dissolved solids less than 4 satisfactory adsorption capacity and final ph within the discharge limits the ofeces 05 was the iron rich adsorbent selected 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent the determination of specific material properties is essential to understand its adsorptive capacity table 3 the natural ph of ofeces 0 5 is near neutrality since this material is mostly composed of iron oxyhydroxide deliyanni et al 17 reported that akaganeite and hybrid surfactant akaganeite are characterized by a natural ph 7 which agrees with the present work the iron oxides have typically a high specific surface area sbet and ofeces 0 5 showed to not be an exception 270 m2 g deliyanni et al and genz et al 17 29 found a specific surface area of 280 and 330 m2 g respectively for similar materials according to iupac classification the observed n2 isotherm fig a 1 supplementary information is similar to type i b this type of isotherm corresponds to solids with a pore size distribution between micropores and narrow mesopores 25 å 30 indeed the pore size distribution fig a 2 supplementary information proves that the adsorbent is composed mostly by mesopores with dimensions near to 20 å narrow mesopores the values obtained for pore volume agree with the literature 21 19 the zeta potential was measured to determine the point of zero charge fig a 3 supplementary information the distribution of superficial charge is related to the type and number of surface functional groups the phzpc of ofeces 0 5 was attained at ph 7 which is consistent with the range reported in the literature 7 5 8 for these materials 19 20 29 the diffraction pattern fig a 4 supplementary information shows the presence of calcite caco3 marked as c in the diffractogram from the calcined eggshell 10 14 31 the ferric oxyhydroxide phase of the material reveals the possibility of an amorphous phase not only due to the noise present in the diffractogram but also due to the presence of a broad hump observed until 22 according to the synthesis procedure akaganeite is expected to be obtained the most intense peaks of akaganeite are at 11 9 and 16 8 which are within the hump zone of the diffractogram however the second more intense peaks were observed at 26 7 and 35 0 32 in good agreement with the results obtained in the present study comparing the pattern observed with the spectra reported by chitrakar et al 18 akaganeite may be the phase present in the synthesized material moreover the color of the ofeces 0 5 is also typical of akaganeite usually amorphous materials are associated with large surface areas which can improve the adsorption performance 33 the surface morphology and chemical analysis of ofeces 0 5 before fig 3 a d and after fig 3e g the phosphorus adsorption were investigated by sem eds the eds mapping in fig 3 b shows that there are particles rich in fe and others in ca indeed the spectrum in fig 3 c showed that iron and oxygen were the main constituents of this particle while fig 3 d collected in another particle revealed that calcium and oxygen are the main elements detected in ofeces 0 5 from the eds spectra can be noticed that sections richer in iron are poorer in calcium demonstrating the adsorbent heterogeneity chlorine was also detected in both spectra since the precursor used in the synthesis was fecl3 6h2o and thus small quantities remained in the material after adsorption fig 3 e shows a good distribution of phosphorus along with iron and calcium rich particles chlorine was no longer identified at the surface of the adsorbent possibly indicating its dissolution into the supernatant during the contact time of the adsorbent tests 3 3 batch equilibrium experiments 3 3 1 influence of initial ph the influence of the initial solution ph was investigated in the range of 4 10 to establish the optimal conditions for the adsorption process fig 4 at an initial concentration of 40 mg p po4 l the ph did not reveal any influence in the adsorption performance however for higher initial concentrations 400 and 800 mg p po4 l the adsorption capacity decreased with the increase of the initial ph when the ph is higher than 7 phzpc the surface area of the adsorbent is negatively charged and the repulsive forces between the surface and the phosphate ions become relevant the same tendency was observed in the literature for other iron oxides 19 20 34 it is important to note that the stability of the material and the final supernatant ph are relevant operating factors to select the optimum initial ph fig a 5 a supplementary information shows an insignificant maximum dissolution of the adsorbent in the tested ph range 4 the low solubility of iron oxides is also highlighted in the literature 35 furthermore regardless of the initial ph the final ph of the supernatant tends to remain in the neutrality fig a 5 b supplementary information since it is intended to be used in acidic to neutral conditions and within the ph discharge limits for wastewaters the initial ph 6 was selected for further studies 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process is shown in fig 5 the results show that the removal efficiency increases from 55 to 97 when the dosage raises from 10 to 50 g l due to the presence of more active sites on the other hand the adsorption capacity varies inversely with the dosage eq 1 as indicated in other studies for diverse adsorbents 11 16 19 36 37 this analysis can be helpful to select the best dosage used in stirred batch conditions according to fig 5 a dosage of 25 g l guarantees a removal efficiency higher than 80 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms the experimental adsorption isotherm of ofeces 0 5 is depicted in fig 6 a as well as the fittings of the models table 4 shows the parameters estimated using nonlinear regressions for each model fig 6 b presents the experimental and theoretical removal efficiencies considering the best equilibrium model langmuir freundlich as a function of initial phosphate concentration although the three models describe satisfactorily the experimental data the langmuir freundlich isotherm is the most suitable based on the r2 and rmse table 4 this model predicts a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g even though the capacity observed experimentally is 38 0 mg g the fitting to the freundlich isotherm shows a n f lower than 1 which means that the isotherm is favorable although the langmuir isotherm has the worst fitting based on r2 and rmse values it predicts a maximum adsorption capacity closer to the experimental value 40 4 mg g and thus this can be a more realistic model for practical applications it is also important to determine the maximum initial phosphate concentration that allows compliance with the maximum contaminant limit mcl of 2 mg p l in the present study considering the mass balance eq 1 the isotherm eq 5 and the parameters in table 4 and a dosage of 10 g l the mcl is attained for initial phosphate concentrations up to 76 7 mg p po4 l fig 6 b reveals that the removal efficiency decreased with the initial phosphate concentration indeed the removal efficiency reduced from 100 to 47 when the initial concentration increased from 50 to 800 mg p po4 l for higher phosphate concentration the active sites are insufficient and the repulsive forces are intensified it is important to highlight that for the concentrations of interest in wwtp where an mcl of 2 mg l equivalent to 6 mg p po4 l is required the removal efficiency is nearly 100 furthermore the theoretical removal efficiency was also calculated considering the parameters estimated for the langmuir freundlich model and the eqs 1 2 and 5 these results showed that the experimental removal efficiencies can be predicted theoretically table 5 summarizes the adsorption capacities obtained in other studies with similar adsorbents to the one developed in this study it is possible to conclude that materials with higher specific areas achieve higher adsorption capacities except for ces furthermore the qm values reported by genz et al and chitrakar et al 29 18 are close to the capacity obtained to ofeces 0 5 3 3 4 kinetics studies adsorption kinetics analysis allows the prediction of the time required for the process to attain equilibrium conditions fig 7 shows the experimental data and the fitting with pseudo first and pseudo second order models the uptake of p po4 for higher concentrations was slower and required at least 4 h for achieving equilibrium in these cases the adsorption rate was lower because of the higher mass resistance due to saturation of the adsorbent surface on the other hand equilibrium was achieved in 45 min when using 50 mg p po4 l table 6 summarizes the estimated parameters for the kinetic models the fitting with the pseudo first order model is the best leading to higher r2 and lower rmse for both concentrations table 6 shows that k1 decreased with phosphate concentration furthermore according to the assumptions of this model the adsorption step controls the process regarding the pseudo order model parameters the initial adsorption rate h0 raise with the p po4 concentration since the drying force increases the adsorption capacities achieved under steady state conditions fig 7 are similar to the equilibrium assays fig 6 with relative errors lower than 4 3 3 5 desorption ofeces 0 5 is a synthesized material with no application after adsorption so it is important to consider the possibility of regeneration due to the unsatisfying performance of the adsorbent at basic conditions solvents with different alkaline strengths were tested however the recovery efficiency is not statistically different p 0 05 for the three solutions of naoh used 0 1 0 5 and 1 m indeed the recovery efficiency of near 50 is achieved these results may be related to the competition between oh and po4 3 ions in the material surface during the desorption phenomenon 19 it is also important to refer that there was no dissolution of the solid during the regeneration assays 3 4 real effluent adsorption assays tests with real effluent were performed to evaluate the interaction between other compounds and phosphate during the adsorption process table 7 summarizes the effluent characteristics and the removal efficiency observed through the removal efficiency results it is possible to conclude that the effluent matrix has a negative influence on the adsorption process reducing from 99 to 51 8 the phosphate uptake is affected by the other anions and organic molecules that constitute the effluent thus the adsorbent decreases the phosphate concentration from 10 to 5 mg p po4 l while in compliance with the legal limit of 6 mg p po4 l a few studies in the literature tested the performance of iron adsorbent in real effluent matrices however jiang et al 38 reported that a synthesized iron mineral was able to remove 99 92 of phosphate in 8 h from an effluent with an initial concentration of 4 6 6 1 mg p po4 l in depth studies with other effluent samples and different loads should be done to evaluate the potential adsorption capacity of the developed material 4 conclusions the screening phase revealed that the adsorbent synthesized with a ratio of 2 1 of iron iii and calcined eggshell had the best performance in acid to neutral media besides the good removal efficiency it is chemically stable and maintains the supernatant ph into the limits for effluent discharge the developed adsorbent ofeces 0 5 presents a large specific surface area 270 m2 g and a natural ph and phzpc near neutrality despite its amorphous nature the xrd pattern allowed the identification of calcite and possible akaganeite as the main phases of the adsorbent langmuir freundlich isothermal correctly describes the equilibrium data with a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g the pseudo first order model describes the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process a 50 efficiency is possible to achieve during the regeneration of the adsorbent regarding the application of this material at an industrial scale the results show that the complex matrix of the effluent can interfere in the adsorption while in compliance with the legal limit of 6 mg p po4 l the removal efficiency in these conditions is about 50 however in depth studies with real effluents must be carried out to assess the potential of the material developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments daniela

13999,phosphorus is an important and irreplaceable macronutrient for biological processes and is on the list of critical raw materials of the european union accumulation in water bodies requires an extra effort to promote its recovery this study aims to synthesize characterize and test a reliable adsorbent in acidic to neutral conditions several chemical modifications are tested to select the best adsorbent through the screening phase it is possible to conclude that the chemical modification of calcined eggshell with magnesium and iron iii does not improve the adsorption capacity thus the material produced with 2 3 of iron and 1 3 of calcined eggshell reveals the best properties ofeces 0 5 specific surface area of 270 m2 g and performance to proceed with the tests the influence of initial ph and adsorbent dosage is investigated to determine the best operating conditions the adsorbent revealed better performance in acidic conditions ph 6 than in basic medium langmuir freundlich model reveals the best fitting r2 0 989 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g the pseudo first order model describes the adsorption kinetic with constants between 0 0353 and 0 0126 1 min for an initial concentration of 50 and 400 mg p po4 l the adsorbent selected is regenerated with an efficiency of 50 using an alkaline solution in contact with a real effluent the iron oxyhydroxide removes 50 of phosphate this work shows that iron oxyhydroxide with calcined eggshell has the potential as an adsorbent to remove phosphate from wastewaters keywords phosphate recovery adsorption calcined eggshell iron oxyhydroxide real effluent 1 introduction phosphorus p is a key element to fundamental biological processes that involve genetic material dna and rna energy supply atp and structural body support provided by membranes phospholipids phosphate rock is the main source of p used in anthropogenic activities namely for food production for which phosphorus fertilizers are fundamental about 82 of p extracted from phosphate rock is applied in the production of fertilizers while 7 is used to be processed as a food supplement for animals the remaining is employed to complement the demands in diverse industries 1 nowadays with the exponential growth of the global population the exploitation of p has increased excessively to meet the demand for food indeed about 270 mt of phosphate has been mined per year 2 which will lead to a gradual depletion of accessible fossil reserves and promote a more laborious and expensive exploration the european commission included p in the list of critical raw materials since this element is of great importance to the economy and with high supply risk morocco western sahara china south africa jordan and the united states are the regions with the main phosphate rock reserves 3 about 74 of the global reserves of p are in morocco 1 however china is the principal supplier with 54 of the market while morocco and sahara represent only 11 2 human activity leads to changes in the phosphorus cycle which causes accumulation in water bodies p enters the water bodies through different ways leaching of human animal droppings and superficial contaminated waters from agriculture activity losses during phosphate rocks mining and industrial emissions 4 5 around 56 of p losses in the aquatic system are due to erosion and leaching of cultivated land 6 moreover each person excretes 1 1 5 g p day 7 concentrations higher than 2 mg p l can promote excessive algae growth algae bloom in water bodies known as eutrophication 8 this phenomenon can cause the break of the food chain since algae block the gas exchange causing a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content 9 10 phosphates are the most common forms of phosphorus in natural water and wastewater mainly as soluble orthophosphates municipal wastewaters can contain a phosphate concentration of 4 15 mg l 8 11 although these concentrations seem low the municipal effluent flow rate is high a wastewater treatment plant wwtp can receive 200 l cap day with 10 mg l of p 4 besides according to regulation ec nº 1882 2003 of the european parliament and the council of the european union the maximum concentration of p for discharging effluents in natural water bodies is 2 mg l based on a circular economy perspective several investigations aim to uptake p from liquid effluents to prevent environmental issues the most applied technologies to recovery phosphorus are chemical precipitation and biological processes 5 although chemical precipitation is not dependent on microorganisms it has a low recovery potential from aqueous phases 4 furthermore these processes use chemical compounds intensively and produce sludge 12 13 alternatively the adsorption processes have gained interest in p recovery from wastewaters this technology is an efficient selective simple and economical operation involving commonly fast kinetics and the adsorbent can be reused 10 13 14 thus the adsorption process was the method selected in this work it is well known that phosphate ions have an affinity with calcite and iron oxides 5 11 santos et al 14 obtained a maximum adsorption capacity of 39 0 mg po4 3 g at ph 8 using calcined eggshell at 700 c ces however calcined eggshell dissolves in acid medium hindering the use in liquid matrices with a ph lower than 7 mezenner and bensmaili 11 studied eggshell modified with iron chloride and concluded that the material had a maximum adsorption capacity of 14 5 mg po4 3 g in contrast xu and gao 15 reported a lower efficiency to remove p also with iron chloride modified eggshell 3 74 mg po4 3 g but the modification process used in this case was slightly different modifying eggshell and calcinated eggshell with magnesium is also promising ahmad et al 16 reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 109 and 133 mg po4 3 g for magnesium modified eggshell and calcinated eggshell respectively iron oxides may achieve better results to remove p by adsorption deliyanni et al 17 reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 183 mg po4 3 g for akaganeite β phase of anhydrous ferric oxyhydroxide feooh where some chloride ions can be included in the structure at ph 7 however the p removal efficiency by iron oxides adsorbents can be boosted in acidic medium 18 indeed ajmal et al 19 noticed that the increase in ph from 6 to 9 leads to a decrease in the adsorption capacity from 7 63 to 4 24 mg po4 3 g for goethite this mineral can reach maximum adsorption of 50 5 mg po4 3 g at ph 7 a mixture of akaganeite and iron hydroxide agglomerates achieved a capacity of 110 mg po4 3 g for an initial concentration of 12 3 mg po4 3 l 20 a combination of iron and calcium carbonate could be of interest for recovering p iron is the most abundant transition metal in nature 21 and is usually linked with other elements to form oxides or hydroxides at least there are 16 iron oxides and oxyhydroxides species where hematite maghemite magnetite goethite akaganeite and lepidocrocite are the most common the solubility and the oxidation state of iron are highly dependent on ph on the other hand an interesting source of calcium carbonate is eggshell es which is a ceramic material of biological origin with a crucial role in egg formation this material represents about 11 of the total weight of the egg in the case of chickens and contains approximately 94 of caco3 22 an eggshell can contain 7 000 17 000 pores which increases the surface area as adsorbent 23 the eu produced about 6 mt of eggs in 2017 which represents about 0 7 mt of es since the landfill is the main option to dispose of this byproduct its reuse or recycling is essential based on the good performance reported by the literature es and ces were considered also in this study 14 this study aims to develop characterize and test an efficient and stable adsorbent to remove p from acidic to neutral wastewater to the best of our knowledge the present study addresses for the first time and simultaneously several modification procedures of ces and investigates new combinations of iron oxides and ces moreover the best performing adsorbent is also tested with a real effluent matrix which complements the lack of other studies thus the main proposal is to synthesize an adsorbent to recover p from wastewaters with a material based on a highly abundant element fe on earth and a waste eggshell currently discarded in landfills 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents eggshell es and calcined es at 700 c ces were prepared using the procedure described by santos el al 14 a solution of iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o was utilized to modify es and ces and synthesize iron oxyhydroxide also mgcl2 6h2o was tested as a modifying agent of es and ces potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was used in the preparation of synthetic phosphate solutions which were later utilized in adsorption tests moreover 1 0 m naoh or 1 0 m hcl solutions were employed to control ph samples of real effluent were collected at the exit of an anaerobic digestion reactor operating in mesophilic conditions 35 c in a wwtp located in the central region of portugal the anaerobic digester uses primary and secondary sludge as a substrate 2 2 screening of adsorbent several chemical modifications were evaluated during the screening phase to determine the adsorbent with the best performance es and ces were both modified with 5 mg l of iron and magnesium salts briefly 0 25 g of es or ces were added to 100 ml of a solution with the desired salt concentration the suspension was stirred 80 rpm for 24 h at 25 c 11 16 then the solid material was filtered and dried at 40 c overnight moreover different iron concentrations were analyzed 10 500 mg fe l using the same procedure furthermore an iron synthesized material was prepared according to chitrakar et al 18 while ces was added during synthesis the method for producing akaganeite involves the dropwise addition of 0 1 m naoh into 0 1 m fecl3 solution until ph 10 afterward the suspension was stirred for 1 h ces was mixed with an iron salt solution at the beginning of the naoh addition the produced materials involved fe ces ratios of 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 and 1 2 in a weight dry basis subsequently the precipitate was centrifuged washed with distilled water and dried at 40 c finally it was ground to 0 149 to 0 420 mm table 1 summarizes the nomenclature used hereafter the screening experiments were carried out with a dosage of 10 g l at 25 c under stirring conditions 100 rpm some tests were conducted with different phosphate concentrations and ph to evaluate the adsorbent performance over a wider range of conditions after adsorption the suspension was filtered using a 0 45 μm pore filter and the concentration of p in phosphate form p po4 was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry using a wavelength of 650 nm epa method 365 3 the adsorption capacity and the efficiency of phosphate removal r p po4 was determined through eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e v m c 0 c e 2 r p p o 4 1 c t c 0 100 where q e is the amount of phosphate adsorbed mg g v is the volume of solution l m is the mass of the adsorbent g c0 ce and ct are the phosphate concentration mg l at initial equilibrium and at t time respectively furthermore the total dissolved solids tds at various ph were measured to assess adsorbent stability the ph after adsorption was also recorded since it must be within the effluent discharge limits between 6 and 9 2 3 adsorbent characterization panalytical xpert pro diffractometer cuk α radiation 2theta 10 to 80 range with a monochromator of graphite was used to identify through x ray diffraction xrd the pattern of the crystalline phases of the selected adsorbent then the panalytical highscore plus 4 1 pdf 4 software allowed the identification of the different phases the specific surface area was obtained based on the bet method using a micromeritics germini 2380 the n2 adsorption desorption also allowed to determine the pore volume the morphology and elemental surface composition of the adsorbent before and after contact with a solution with p po4 were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem in a hitachi su 70 microscope with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds bruker quantax 400 detector natural ph was measured in a 1 10 solid liquid suspension the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc was assessed in a suspension of 1 g of the solid sample in 50 ml of 0 1 m nano3 solution 24 then the suspension was stirred for a few minutes to ensure homogeneous conditions afterward seven subsamples were obtained from the original matrix where 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solutions were added to adjust ph to 2 4 6 7 8 10 and 12 malvern instruments zetasizer nano zs equipment was employed to measure the zeta potential 2 4 batch equilibrium and kinetics experiments the adsorbent dosage effect was studied by keeping constant the initial phosphate concentration at 600 mg p po4 l and varying the adsorbent dosage between 10 and 50 g l multiple initial phosphate concentration 10 800 mg p po4 l with a constant dosage 10 g l was used to determine the adsorption isotherm these assays were performed in duplicate at 25 c ph 6 and 100 rpm for 6 h eq 1 is employed to quantify the phosphate adsorbed langmuir eq 3 freundlich eq 4 and langmuir freundlich eq 5 models were tested to describe the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e n f 5 q e q m l f k l f c e n l f k l f c e n l f

intervals from 30 to 360 min aliquots of liquid were withdrawn to quantify the adsorbed p po4 pseudo first order eq 6 and pseudo second order eq 7 models were applied to describe the kinetics of the adsorption process 6 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 7 1 q e q t 1 q e k 2 t where qt and qe are the quantities adsorbed at time t and at equilibrium respectively mg g t is the time min k1 is the rate constant of

selected adsorbent the effluent was centrifugated and filtered before the characterization and the experimental testing batch experiments were carried out with a dosage of 10 g l at 25 c under stirring conditions 100 rpm chemical oxygen demand cod ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were determined according to the standard methods 27 to analyze the wastewater 2 5 desorption studies after the contact with a solution of 400 mg p po4 l for 6 h the adsorbent was separated by filtration dried and used to perform the desorption assays the amount of phosphate adsorbed was calculated as in the equilibrium studies eq 1 thus 0 08 g of saturated adsorbent was added to 40 ml of the eluent the flasks were closed and stirred 100 rpm in a thermostatic bath for 24 h solutions of 0 1 m 0 5 m and 1 m were tested as solvents afterward the suspension was filtered and the phosphate concentration measured in the supernatant the desorption efficiency η d e s was obtained using the eq 8 8 η d e s c d e s v q e m 100 where c d e s is the phosphate concentration in the liquid of the desorption test mg p po4 l v is the eluent volume l m is the mass of saturated adsorbent g and q e is the phosphate quantity at the end of the adsorption assay saturation conditions mg p po4 g 2 6 statistical analysis a tukey hsd test p 0 05 was performed to detect statistically significant differences between adsorption capacities and removal efficiencies during the screening phase sigmaplot software was used to perform nonlinear regression to experimental data equilibrium and kinetic test the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse values were adopted as criteria to select the best fitting for adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of adsorbent the screening phase involved several materials es esfe5 esmg5 ces cesfe5 and cesmg5 which were tested in a phosphate concentration near the typical values found in a real effluent 10 mg p po4 l es performance improved slightly with the chemical modification fig 1 a however when ces was modified with fe and mg salts the removal efficiency was reduced indeed esfe5 cesfe5 esmg5 and cesmg5 had removal efficiencies of 16 9 67 5 20 3 and 25 3 respectively while es and ces were close to 0 and 100 although a slightly higher removal was observed when comparing the performance of es with esfe5 and with esmg5 the results were statistically similar p 0 05 thus es esfe5 esmg5 and cesmg5 were discarded for further studies due to the low efficiencies achieved subsequently ces was modified with different iron concentrations 10 100 250 and 500 mg l fig 1 b for these materials higher initial phosphate concentration 100 mg l was used to facilitate the discriminations of the different materials fig 1 b shows that the fe content influences the adsorbent performance cesfe10 and cesfe500 were statistically different in terms of adsorption capacity p 0 05 and for the highest fe concentration the adsorption capacity was almost double from 6 4 11 1 mg p po4 g according to the literature despite fe modification may decrease the specific surface area the concentration of active sites for adsorption of anionic species can increase 28 xu and gao 15 reported a modified eggshell with 500 mg fe l had an adsorption capacity of 12 mg p po4 g for an initial concentration of 153 mg p po4 l in good agreement with the results attained in the present study 11 1 mg p po4 g when the ph is set at 6 or 8 the adsorption performance was not significantly changed p 0 05 for example cesfe10 achieved a removal efficiency of 52 5 at both ph regardless of the initial ph 6 or 8 the final ph value of the supernatant was always between 8 and 9 except for ces indeed after ces contacting with the supernatant the ph rises to 12 while the adsorption capacity is 10 9 mg p po4 g in agreement with santos et al 14 as the cesfe500 and ces show similar adsorption capacity chemical modification with fe does not have a competitive advantage in terms of efficiency however the ph variation in the final solution is smaller which is beneficial for application to real effluents thus further studies aim to synthesize a simple efficient and stable material under acidic conditions accordingly iron oxyhydroxide with and without ces are synthesized and evaluated fig 2 a the iron oxyhydroxide revealed the ability for p removal in acidic conditions fulfilling the objective of this work in fact the adsorption capacity increased from 23 9 37 9 mg p po4 g for ph 4 and 8 respectively despite ces being more efficient at ph 8 it dissolves for acidic ph 14 thus the modification of ofe with ces was studied only at ph 8 for comparison purposes with the results obtained with ces the adsorption capacities obtained for ofe ofeces 1 and ofeces 0 5 are statistically similar to each other but different from ofeces 2 the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency of all materials evaluated are summarized in table 2 the supernatant ph after adsorption final ph is a crucial parameter in the carried research because the discharge limits for effluents are between ph 6 and 9 fig 2 b represents the final ph obtained by the iron rich adsorbents tested where bars with the same letter are not significantly different according to tukey s test p 0 05 the results show that ces exceeds the upper limit while ofe ofeces 2 and ofeces 1 tend to ph 9 thus these materials are not considered reliable to proceed with the tests due to its good stability low percentage of dissolved solids less than 4 satisfactory adsorption capacity and final ph within the discharge limits the ofeces 05 was the iron rich adsorbent selected 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent the determination of specific material properties is essential to understand its adsorptive capacity table 3 the natural ph of ofeces 0 5 is near neutrality since this material is mostly composed of iron oxyhydroxide deliyanni et al 17 reported that akaganeite and hybrid surfactant akaganeite are characterized by a natural ph 7 which agrees with the present work the iron oxides have typically a high specific surface area sbet and ofeces 0 5 showed to not be an exception 270 m2 g deliyanni et al and genz et al 17 29 found a specific surface area of 280 and 330 m2 g respectively for similar materials according to iupac classification the observed n2 isotherm fig a 1 supplementary information is similar to type i b this type of isotherm corresponds to solids with a pore size distribution between micropores and narrow mesopores 25 å 30 indeed the pore size distribution fig a 2 supplementary information proves that the adsorbent is composed mostly by mesopores with dimensions near to 20 å narrow mesopores the values obtained for pore volume agree with the literature 21 19 the zeta potential was measured to determine the point of zero charge fig a 3 supplementary information the distribution of superficial charge is related to the type and number of surface functional groups the phzpc of ofeces 0 5 was attained at ph 7 which is consistent with the range reported in the literature 7 5 8 for these materials 19 20 29 the diffraction pattern fig a 4 supplementary information shows the presence of calcite caco3 marked as c in the diffractogram from the calcined eggshell 10 14 31 the ferric oxyhydroxide phase of the material reveals the possibility of an amorphous phase not only due to the noise present in the diffractogram but also due to the presence of a broad hump observed until 22 according to the synthesis procedure akaganeite is expected to be obtained the most intense peaks of akaganeite are at 11 9 and 16 8 which are within the hump zone of the diffractogram however the second more intense peaks were observed at 26 7 and 35 0 32 in good agreement with the results obtained in the present study comparing the pattern observed with the spectra reported by chitrakar et al 18 akaganeite may be the phase present in the synthesized material moreover the color of the ofeces 0 5 is also typical of akaganeite usually amorphous materials are associated with large surface areas which can improve the adsorption performance 33 the surface morphology and chemical analysis of ofeces 0 5 before fig 3 a d and after fig 3e g the phosphorus adsorption were investigated by sem eds the eds mapping in fig 3 b shows that there are particles rich in fe and others in ca indeed the spectrum in fig 3 c showed that iron and oxygen were the main constituents of this particle while fig 3 d collected in another particle revealed that calcium and oxygen are the main elements detected in ofeces 0 5 from the eds spectra can be noticed that sections richer in iron are poorer in calcium demonstrating the adsorbent heterogeneity chlorine was also detected in both spectra since the precursor used in the synthesis was fecl3 6h2o and thus small quantities remained in the material after adsorption fig 3 e shows a good distribution of phosphorus along with iron and calcium rich particles chlorine was no longer identified at the surface of the adsorbent possibly indicating its dissolution into the supernatant during the contact time of the adsorbent tests 3 3 batch equilibrium experiments 3 3 1 influence of initial ph the influence of the initial solution ph was investigated in the range of 4 10 to establish the optimal conditions for the adsorption process fig 4 at an initial concentration of 40 mg p po4 l the ph did not reveal any influence in the adsorption performance however for higher initial concentrations 400 and 800 mg p po4 l the adsorption capacity decreased with the increase of the initial ph when the ph is higher than 7 phzpc the surface area of the adsorbent is negatively charged and the repulsive forces between the surface and the phosphate ions become relevant the same tendency was observed in the literature for other iron oxides 19 20 34 it is important to note that the stability of the material and the final supernatant ph are relevant operating factors to select the optimum initial ph fig a 5 a supplementary information shows an insignificant maximum dissolution of the adsorbent in the tested ph range 4 the low solubility of iron oxides is also highlighted in the literature 35 furthermore regardless of the initial ph the final ph of the supernatant tends to remain in the neutrality fig a 5 b supplementary information since it is intended to be used in acidic to neutral conditions and within the ph discharge limits for wastewaters the initial ph 6 was selected for further studies 3 3 2 effect of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process is shown in fig 5 the results show that the removal efficiency increases from 55 to 97 when the dosage raises from 10 to 50 g l due to the presence of more active sites on the other hand the adsorption capacity varies inversely with the dosage eq 1 as indicated in other studies for diverse adsorbents 11 16 19 36 37 this analysis can be helpful to select the best dosage used in stirred batch conditions according to fig 5 a dosage of 25 g l guarantees a removal efficiency higher than 80 3 3 3 adsorption isotherms the experimental adsorption isotherm of ofeces 0 5 is depicted in fig 6 a as well as the fittings of the models table 4 shows the parameters estimated using nonlinear regressions for each model fig 6 b presents the experimental and theoretical removal efficiencies considering the best equilibrium model langmuir freundlich as a function of initial phosphate concentration although the three models describe satisfactorily the experimental data the langmuir freundlich isotherm is the most suitable based on the r2 and rmse table 4 this model predicts a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g even though the capacity observed experimentally is 38 0 mg g the fitting to the freundlich isotherm shows a n f lower than 1 which means that the isotherm is favorable although the langmuir isotherm has the worst fitting based on r2 and rmse values it predicts a maximum adsorption capacity closer to the experimental value 40 4 mg g and thus this can be a more realistic model for practical applications it is also important to determine the maximum initial phosphate concentration that allows compliance with the maximum contaminant limit mcl of 2 mg p l in the present study considering the mass balance eq 1 the isotherm eq 5 and the parameters in table 4 and a dosage of 10 g l the mcl is attained for initial phosphate concentrations up to 76 7 mg p po4 l fig 6 b reveals that the removal efficiency decreased with the initial phosphate concentration indeed the removal efficiency reduced from 100 to 47 when the initial concentration increased from 50 to 800 mg p po4 l for higher phosphate concentration the active sites are insufficient and the repulsive forces are intensified it is important to highlight that for the concentrations of interest in wwtp where an mcl of 2 mg l equivalent to 6 mg p po4 l is required the removal efficiency is nearly 100 furthermore the theoretical removal efficiency was also calculated considering the parameters estimated for the langmuir freundlich model and the eqs 1 2 and 5 these results showed that the experimental removal efficiencies can be predicted theoretically table 5 summarizes the adsorption capacities obtained in other studies with similar adsorbents to the one developed in this study it is possible to conclude that materials with higher specific areas achieve higher adsorption capacities except for ces furthermore the qm values reported by genz et al and chitrakar et al 29 18 are close to the capacity obtained to ofeces 0 5 3 3 4 kinetics studies adsorption kinetics analysis allows the prediction of the time required for the process to attain equilibrium conditions fig 7 shows the experimental data and the fitting with pseudo first and pseudo second order models the uptake of p po4 for higher concentrations was slower and required at least 4 h for achieving equilibrium in these cases the adsorption rate was lower because of the higher mass resistance due to saturation of the adsorbent surface on the other hand equilibrium was achieved in 45 min when using 50 mg p po4 l table 6 summarizes the estimated parameters for the kinetic models the fitting with the pseudo first order model is the best leading to higher r2 and lower rmse for both concentrations table 6 shows that k1 decreased with phosphate concentration furthermore according to the assumptions of this model the adsorption step controls the process regarding the pseudo order model parameters the initial adsorption rate h0 raise with the p po4 concentration since the drying force increases the adsorption capacities achieved under steady state conditions fig 7 are similar to the equilibrium assays fig 6 with relative errors lower than 4 3 3 5 desorption ofeces 0 5 is a synthesized material with no application after adsorption so it is important to consider the possibility of regeneration due to the unsatisfying performance of the adsorbent at basic conditions solvents with different alkaline strengths were tested however the recovery efficiency is not statistically different p 0 05 for the three solutions of naoh used 0 1 0 5 and 1 m indeed the recovery efficiency of near 50 is achieved these results may be related to the competition between oh and po4 3 ions in the material surface during the desorption phenomenon 19 it is also important to refer that there was no dissolution of the solid during the regeneration assays 3 4 real effluent adsorption assays tests with real effluent were performed to evaluate the interaction between other compounds and phosphate during the adsorption process table 7 summarizes the effluent characteristics and the removal efficiency observed through the removal efficiency results it is possible to conclude that the effluent matrix has a negative influence on the adsorption process reducing from 99 to 51 8 the phosphate uptake is affected by the other anions and organic molecules that constitute the effluent thus the adsorbent decreases the phosphate concentration from 10 to 5 mg p po4 l while in compliance with the legal limit of 6 mg p po4 l a few studies in the literature tested the performance of iron adsorbent in real effluent matrices however jiang et al 38 reported that a synthesized iron mineral was able to remove 99 92 of phosphate in 8 h from an effluent with an initial concentration of 4 6 6 1 mg p po4 l in depth studies with other effluent samples and different loads should be done to evaluate the potential adsorption capacity of the developed material 4 conclusions the screening phase revealed that the adsorbent synthesized with a ratio of 2 1 of iron iii and calcined eggshell had the best performance in acid to neutral media besides the good removal efficiency it is chemically stable and maintains the supernatant ph into the limits for effluent discharge the developed adsorbent ofeces 0 5 presents a large specific surface area 270 m2 g and a natural ph and phzpc near neutrality despite its amorphous nature the xrd pattern allowed the identification of calcite and possible akaganeite as the main phases of the adsorbent langmuir freundlich isothermal correctly describes the equilibrium data with a maximum adsorption capacity of 69 5 mg g the pseudo first order model describes the kinetic behavior of the adsorption process a 50 efficiency is possible to achieve during the regeneration of the adsorbent regarding the application of this material at an industrial scale the results show that the complex matrix of the effluent can interfere in the adsorption while in compliance with the legal limit of 6 mg p po4 l the removal efficiency in these conditions is about 50 however in depth studies with real effluents must be carried out to assess the potential of the material developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments daniela
