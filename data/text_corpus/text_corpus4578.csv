22890,in this paper a theoretical model for vortex induced vibrations vivs of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid subjected to loose constraints is proposed and analyzed the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics are modeled by two distributed van der pol wake oscillators taking into account the coupling between the structure and fluid the full nonlinear partial differential equations of the flexible pipe are derived by using hamilton s principle the nonlinear partial differential equations for the pipe and wake are further discretized by the aid of the galerkin s technique resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations these ordinary differential equations are further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm via varying the internal and cross flow velocities the derived high dimensional reduced order model displays some interesting dynamical behaviors of the coupled system phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams are plotted showing the existence of lock in phenomenon and figure of eight trajectory when the internal fluid velocity is small and below the critical value for flutter instability the oscillation of the pipe is mainly induced by the cross flow for internal flow velocity beyond the critical value for flutter instability interestingly the effect of low cross flow velocity is not pronounced for relatively high cross flow velocity both internal and external fluid flows can significantly contribute to the responses of the pipe this work is expected to be useful for predicting the responses of marine oil conveying pipes under the combined effects of internal and external fluid flows keywords cantilevered pipe conveying fluid loose constraints vortex induced vibrations cross flow internal flow three dimensional model 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon which can be found in many engineering fields including suspended cables for bridges power transmission lines chimneys heat exchanger tubes marine structures such as cables and risers placed within ocean current and so on as a typical type of truly self excited and self sustained oscillations vortex induced vibrations always greatly decrease the fatigue life of structures and even lead to the damage of structures accordingly vortex induced vibrations of various structures were widely concerned and have been extensively investigated by many researchers during the past several decades in recent years indeed a considerable research effort experimental theoretical or and numerical has been undertaken in an attempt to understand the mechanism of vivs of cylindrical structures and to suggest ways of alleviating them see e g bishop and hassan 1964 anderson and szewczyk 1997 feng 1968 yamamoto et al 2004 zhao et al 2013 and meng et al 2017b a comprehensive review on the various aspects of vivs for rigid or flexible cylinders pipes can be found in hong and shah 2018 the interested reader is referred to the excellent review of hong and shah 2018 the experimental study on vivs of structures has a fine pedigree a lot of experimental investigations were conducted to understand the fundamental mechanism of viv phenomena see e g gaster 1969 brika and laneville 1993 balasubramanian et al 1998 zhu et al 2016 song et al 2011 and kang et al 2017 among a vast amount of literature a series of experiments by gaster 1969 and gaster 1971 were focused on the viv of cones subjected to uniform lateral flow a flexible riser model with a large aspect ratio of 1400 was tested by trim et al 2005 it was shown that the in line il fatigue damage is as severe as the cross flow cf fatigue damage and that a riser partially or fully covered with helical strakes can suppress the viv responses perhaps the first experiment study of the vivs of flexible pipes containing internal flowing fluid is due to guo and lou 2008 who carried out the viv experiments of a riser partially immersed in cross flow the effect of internal fluid velocity on the vivs of the riser was investigated the experimental results demonstrated that both il and cf vibrations amplitudes increase while the oscillation frequencies decrease with the increase of internal fluid velocity srinil et al 2013a b performed a two degree of freedom dof viv experimental investigation of circular cylinders with variable natural frequency ratio the circular cylinder was placed in a water towing tank some good qualitative and quantitative agreements between numerical and experimental investigations were found song et al 2016 conducted an experiment of a flexible pipe undergoing viv to acquire hydrodynamic forces and coefficients via strain measurement the distributions of the root mean square rms of non dimensional viv displacements were obtained either in the cf or il direction indeed the aforementioned experiments have established a basis for the study of vortex induced vibrations of slender pipes and also provided a reference for verifying theoretical empirical or numerical models because in the analysis of computational fluid dynamics cfd of a fluid structure interaction system the simulation is or can be very close to reality the vortex induced vibrations of cylinders pipes were also studied via cfd calculations by some researchers for instance meneghini et al 2004 simulated the vivs of a flexible cylinder with the hydrodynamic forces being modeled by discrete vortex method dvm their numerical results agreed well with experiments for oscillating cylinders with mass ratio m 50 8 however for mass ratio m 3 3 the numerical calculations have not detected the maximum oscillating amplitude observed in experiments holmes et al 2006 predicted the viv of risers via the utilization of three dimensional 3 d cfd solutions the numerical results were compared with experiments reported by trim et al 2005 it was found that the dominant modes and rms amplitude predicted using cfd were almost the same as those observed in experiments jung et al 2012 revealed the viv phenomenon of a slender riser through numerical investigations based on the 3d finite difference method fdm the numerical approach based on the fdm was also used by wang et al 2014 to study the distribution of the riser s stress and deformation during its installation operation kamble and chen 2016 employed the finite analytical navier stokes fans technique to evaluate the il and cf fatigue damage of risers with large aspect ratio the results were in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data huang et al 2018 simulated the flow domain with finite volume method fvm and solved the structural responses with finite element method fem then coupled the two parts of solutions in fluent 6 3 the oscillation shape diagrams of the flexible cylinder were compared with the experimental and numerical results published previously although cfd analyses show considerable promise it is important to realize that one of the major disadvantages of the cfd calculations is that the computational time required to obtain a solution is significant especially for extremely slender pipes in ocean engineering besides experimental tests and numerical simulations a considerable amount of empirical theoretical models which attempt to analyze the vortex induced vibrations of cylinders pipes have been proposed according to the discussion in paidoussis et al 2010 there were three main theoretical models for the prediction of viv responses the first type of theoretical models is the forced system models where the external hydrodynamic force is supposed to be only related to time and does not depends on structural motions this simplest type of theoretical models is based on data from measurements of hydrodynamic forces on a stationary cylinder the second type of theoretical models is fluidelastic system models where the hydrodynamic force may be related to the structural displacements velocities and accelerations the third type of theoretical models is the coupled system models in which the hydrodynamic force depends on the variables associated with the wake dynamics and simultaneously the structural motions can affect the evolution of wake in recent years the third type of theoretical models has been widely used to investigate the vortex induced vibrations of rigid or flexible cylinders among various coupled system models the wake oscillator models have attracted much attention as discussed in paidoussis et al 2010 for instance the van der pol wake oscillator coupled with the structural motions for predicting the viv responses was proposed by facchinetti et al 2004 the theoretical results based on the van der pol wake oscillator were compared with previous experimental data it was demonstrated that the van der pol wake oscillator model is useful for predicting the vivs of cylinders with large aspect ratio and at high reynolds numbers using the van der pol wake oscillator suggested in facchinetti et al 2004 dai et al 2013 studied the two dimensional 2 d viv of a simply supported pipe by considering both subcritical and supercritical internal fluid velocities it was demonstrated that the buckled pipe may undergo complex motions including chaotic oscillations with sufficiently high internal fluid velocity based on the aforementioned van der pol wake oscillator model dai et al 2014 further analyzed the 2 d vortex induced vibrations of pinned pinned pipes conveying pulsating fluid flow subjected to external cross flow by using the method of multiple scales they found that the peak vibration amplitudes of the pipe conveying pulsating fluid is larger than that of a pipe conveying uniform fluid based on two similar van der pol wake oscillators in the il and cf directions ge et al 2009 studied the 3 d viv of long slender cylinders without internal fluid flow their work indicated that the structural fatigue damage is related to both cf and il vibrations using ge et al 2009 s van der pol wake oscillators duan et al 2018 further investigated the 3 d viv of simply supported pipes with particular consideration of the effect of internal axial flow computational results showed that complex dynamical responses including 3 d periodic quasi periodic and chaotic vibrations under the lock in condition almost at the same time wang et al 2018a established a 3 d theoretical model for viv prediction of pinned pinned pipes it was particularly shown that the dynamic responses of the pipe may be dramatically affected by the internal fluid flow interestingly it was found that the internal flow effect on the pipe s vivs is small for high cross flow velocities while this effect may be pronounced when the cross flow velocities are relatively low especially in the case of the pipe being buckled due to internal fluid flow despite a lot of valuable studies of the viv of cylinders pipes mentioned above they were mainly concerned with the viv responses of supported pipes either with or without internal fluid flow the literature of 3 d viv responses of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid is very limited very recently meng et al 2017a have initiated to analyze the 2 d viv behaviors of fluid conveying cantilevered pipes however their proposed model for the pipe structure is linear and is not suitable for predicting the possible 3 d large amplitude responses of the pipe this motivates the current work to further establish and analyze the nonlinear viv model of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid in the present study we will investigate the 3 d viv responses of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid with loose constraints placed somewhere along the length of the pipe the nonlinear nonplanar coupled equations of motion of the cantilevered pipe are derived by using hamilton s principle the hydrodynamic forces are modeled by two distributed van der pol wake oscillators these nonlinear equations are then discretized by use of the galerkin s technique with a six mode truncation and are further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm the rich dynamics of the constrained cantilevered pipe subjected to both internal axial flow and external cross flow will be represented in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams 2 the analytical model as we know flexible pipes have been widely used in ocean engineering usually the pipe is supported at some places along the pipe length in some cases the pinned or fixed support may become loose after it has worked a certain time in the present work a horizontal pipe system under consideration is depicted in fig 1 the downstream end of the pipe is assumed to be loosely supported and the loose support is a typical type of circular tube constraints the cantilevered pipe is of length l flexural rigidity ei density ρ p and mass per unit length m axially conveying fluid is of density ρ f and mass per unit length m with axial flow velocity u the cross flow is of density ρ 0 with cross flow velocity u e the pipe is loosely supported somewhere along the pipe length the loose constraints are the type of tube support plate tsp consisting of a plate with a drilled hole for pipe to across in fig 1 x b and y b are the location and free gap of loose constraints respectively the 3 d nonplanar full nonlinear equations of motion for the pipe in the absence of cross flow have been derived by wadham gagnon et al 2007 by means of hamiltonian approaches several assumptions were made in the derivation of the 3 d version of nonlinear equations for the pipe i the internal axial fluid is incompressible ii the nonlinear euler bernoulli beam theory for the pipe is applicable iii the centreline of the pipe is inextensible iv the pipe s axial strain is sufficiently small although its lateral deflections may be large v the impacting force due to the constraints is assumed to be exerted on the pipe s centreline the pipe s lateral displacements are denoted by v s t and w s t along the y and z axes respectively with s being the curvilinear coordinate along the length of the pipe and t the time following the derivation of wadham gagnon et al 2007 and neglecting gravity effects the 3 d version of governing equations for the cantilevered pipe subjected to both cross flow and loose constraints may be written as i in the y direction 1 m m m a v e i v 2 m u v m u 2 v c v

surrounding external fluid c is the damping coefficient of the system f y and f z represent the effects of impacting forces and external hydrodynamic forces imposed on the pipe respectively in the y and z directions the damping coefficient c consists of viscous dissipation in the structure c s and the fluid added damping c f thus 3 c c s c f c s 2 χ m m m a ω r c f ϑ ω s ρ 0 d 2 where ω r is the angular frequency of the pipe χ is the structural damping ratio ϑ is a stall parameter usually estimated using experiment data as discussed in facchinetti et al 2004 and ge et al 2009 the two key parameters in eq 3 will be chosen as χ 0 001 and ϑ 0 8 in eq 3 ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency and d is the pipe s external diameter in addition the added fluid mass m a per unit length is assumed to be independent of time and is given by 4 m a π 4 c a ρ 0 d 2 where c a is the added mass coefficient and is chosen to be 1 for cylindrical structures as reported by munir et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 the external force exerted on the pipe f y and f z can be expressed as 5 f y f y f f y c v w δ s s b f z f z f f z c v w δ s s b in which f y c v w and f z c v w are the restraining forces of the loose constraints along the y and z directions respectively δ s s b is the dirac delta function with s b x b denoting the location of the loose constraints according to mureithi et al 1995 and wang et al 2018b f y c v w and f z c v w can be given by 6 f y c v w v r f r f z c v w w r f r r v 2 w 2 where r presents the total displacement of the pipe centreline deviating from the zero equilibrium position and f r is the total restraining force due to the loose constraints according to paidoussis and semler 1993 and paidoussis et al 1991 f r is given by 7 f r k r 1 2 r y b r y b 3 in which k is the stiffness describing the impacting force y b is the free gap between the pipe and loose constraints the external hydrodynamic force f y f and f z f are induced by the wake dynamics and may be expressed as ge et al 2009 8 f y f f d f d 0 f l u e w t f z f f l f d u e w t in which f d is the vortex induced fluctuating drag force f d 0 is the average drag force and f l is the lift force exerted on the pipe the two drag forces and the lift force are given by ge et al 2009 9 f d 1 2 c d i ρ 0 d u e 2 f d 0 1 2 c d 0 ρ 0 d u e 2 f l 1 2 c l ρ 0 d u e 2 where c d i is a vortex induced drag term depending on time c d 0 is the drag coefficient for a pipe at rest c l is the lift coefficient in the present study c d i and c l will be written as 10 c d i c d 0 i p 2 c l c l 0 q 2 in which p and q are the vortex wake variables in the y and z directions respectively c d 0 i and c l 0 are the corresponding unsteady drag and lift coefficients of a stationary pipe subjected to shedding vortex in this work a set of system parameter values are set as facchinetti et al 2004 c d 0 i 0 1 c d 0 2 c l 0 0 3 as suggested by facchinetti et al 2004 and srinil et al 2013b the two wake variables p il variable and q cf variable are governed by the following two van der pol equations 11 2 q t 2 ε z ω s q 2 1 q t ω s 2 q λ z d 2 w t 2 2 p t 2 2 ε y ω s p 2 1 p t 4 ω s 2 p λ y d 2 v t 2 where ε y ε z λ y and λ z are non dimensional parameters determined by experiment in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the values of the four key parameters of eq 11 are set as wang et al 2018a ε y 0 02 ε z 0 04 λ y 96 and λ z 12 the vortex shedding frequency strouhal frequency is given by 12 ω s 2 π s t u e d where s t is the strouhal number which is dependent on reynolds number it has been demonstrated that 0 2 is a fairly reasonable value of s t for a wide range of reynolds numbers as discussed by gabbai and benaroya 2005 it should be pointed out that the van der pol wake oscillator model is semi empirical and semi analytical since the key parameters of van der pol wake oscillator model are built on basic experimental data some essential characteristics e g self sustained oscillation self limited oscillation amplitude limited lock in range vortex shedding frequency of viv can be recovered by using this phenomenological approach paidoussis et al 2010 some researchers e g violette et al 2007 demonstrated that the results of viv responses of a flexible cylinder based on van der pol equations show a good agreement with those predicted using direct numerical simulations dns particularly violette et al 2007 showed that some essential features predicted by dns such as standing or propagative nature of waves and modal content of the cylinder s response could be recovered using the van der pol wake oscillator model because of the simplicity of van der pol wake oscillator models the main advantage of this phenomenological approach over the dns computations is that it requires only a small computational time a few minutes to an hour of cpu on a pc violette et al 2007 on the other hand undeniably the wake oscillator model ignores some details e g vortex pattern and vortex intensity of the external cross flow this may be the main deficiency of such type of phenomenological approaches eqs 1 2 and 11 can be transformed into

r f r k r 1 2 r η b r η b 3 r η 2 ζ 2 in which r denotes the dimensionless total displacement of the pipe deviating from the zero equilibrium position and η b denotes the dimensionless free gap between the pipe and loose constraints 3 solution method it is seen that the governing equations for the pipe and wake are in partial differential form the galerkin s method will be used to solve eqs 13 16 according to this method the oscillation displacements of the pipe and the wake variables can be given by 18 η ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ η r τ ζ ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ ζ r τ p ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ p r τ q ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ q r τ where φ r ξ is the dimensionless eigenfunctions of a cantilevered beam η r τ and p r τ are the corresponding generalized coordinates in the y direction and ζ r τ and q r τ are the corresponding generalized coordinates in the z direction it should be noted that the series 18 can be truncated at a reasonably large value of r i e r n since the galerkin s method has been widely used for studying the nonlinear vibrations of pipes conveying fluid see e g liu et al 2018 ni et al 2015 paidoussis et al 1989 wang et al 2017 the partial differential equations of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid will be discretized with the aid of galerkin s method without giving any additional details of this method 4 results and discussion in this section the main aim is to investigate the vivs of the cantilevered pipe subjected to loose constraints for that purpose the reduced cross flow velocities are supposed to be varied in the range of 0 u r 100 where u r is defined as u r 2 π u e ω 1 d with ω 1 being the first order natural frequency of the pipe for a given internal fluid velocity dai et al 2013 in this range of reduced cross flow velocities extensive calculations indicate that the dynamic responses of the pipe are only dominated by the lowest several modes of the system thus the nonlinear partial differential equations 13 16 are discretized via the galerkin s method with a six mode truncation the obtained high dimensional reduced order ordinary differential equations will be further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm the numerical results are plotted in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams to show the various dynamical behaviors of the pipe 4 1 validation owing to the lack of viv experiment on restrained cantilevered pipes conveying fluid the validation of the proposed model will be performed using three typical examples the first example for validation analysis of the present analytical model is a constrained cantilevered pipe conveying fluid without external cross flow the pipe is subjected to a cubic spring at a certain place ξ b of the pipe this dynamical problem has been theoretically and numerically studied by paidoussis et al 1989 who assumed that the pipe s motion is limited in a single plane for comparison purpose the geometric nonlinearities appearing in the governing equation of 14 were neglected and all the system parameters were set as those utilized by paidoussis et al 1989 α 0 005 β 0 2 γ 10 ξ b 0 82 and k 3 100 with γ being a gravity parameter and k 3 being the stiffness of the cubic spring support paidoussis et al 1989 both positive and negative initial displacement conditions q 1 0 q 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 were utilized for calculations the bifurcation diagram of the tip displacements with the internal fluid velocity being the variable parameter based on the present analytical model is shown in fig 2 b it is obviously observed that our result agrees well with that reported by paidoussis et al 1989 the second validation example for our analytical model is a simply supported riser without internal axial flow but subjected to an external cross flow the experiment of vivs of this riser model was conducted by song et al 2016 and some numerical simulations were done by yuan et al 2018 for comparison purpose all the system parameters were chosen to be the same as those utilized by song et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 the pipe length l 7 9m the outer diameter d 0 031m the inner diameter d 0 027m the young s modulus e 108 gpa the bending stiffness ei 1476 63nm2 the mass per unit length of the pipe m 1 768 kg m the mass ratio m 2 5 and the pretension t 2943n the distributions of rms displacements for the riser without internal flow but under cross flow u e 1 6 m s are shown in fig 3 in this figure the blue dash line stands for the experimental results reported by song et al 2016 the red dot dash line stands for the present results and the green solid line stands for the numerically predicted results obtained by yuan et al 2018 it is obvious that the present result has an acceptable agreement with the experimental and numerical results the third example to validate the reliability of the present model is a dynamical model of a pinned pinned pipe containing static internal fluid and subjected to cross flow this pipe model has been experimentally examined by trim et al 2005 in order to reproduce the experimental results using the present analytical model and numerical procedure all the physical and geometric parameters of the experimental system are utilized in the calculations these system parameters are given by trim et al 2005 the pipe length l 38m the outer diameter d 0 27m the inner diameter d 0 21m the young s modulus e 210 gpa the density of water ρ e 1000 kg m3 the mass ratio m 1 6 and the top tension t 5000n the distributions of displacement standard deviation along the riser length with a uniform cross flow of u e 0 4 m s are shown in fig 4 it is clearly seen that the dominated modes and vibration amplitudes predicted using the present model agree well with the experimental data given in trim et al 2005 bearing in mind that the applied tension in the experiment of trim et al 2005 approximately ranged from 4000n to 6000n while the tension in our analysis was set to be 5000n the comparison between theory and experiment is encouraging 4 2 basic dynamics of the fluid conveying cantilever in the absence of cross flow for an oscillating structure subjected to cross flow when the vortex shedding frequency approaches the natural frequency of the structure the vortex shedding frequency would deviate from the strouhal s law and synchronize onto the oscillation frequency defined as a lock in state according to facchinetti et al 2004 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 accordingly lock in phenomenon could occur when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid before analyzing the lock in phenomenon and vortex induced vibration of the cantilevered pipe it is instructive to compute the natural frequencies of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid without cross flow the argand diagram of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is shown in fig 5 in which the evolution of the lowest four non dimensional eigen frequencies for the linearized system of the cantilevered pipe with increasing axial flow velocity is plotted in this diagram re ω im ω and im ω re ω may be understood as the oscillation frequency damping and damping ratio respectively it is obvious that the flutter instability occurs at u c r 5 3 in the second mode in the following analysis some geometric and physical parameters of the pipe system are selected as the young s modulus e 210 gpa the length l 140m the outer diameter d 0 26m the inner diameter d 0 22m the density of the pipe ρ p 7850 kg m3 the density of internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 and the density of external fluid ρ o 1020 kg m3 unless otherwise mentioned the key parameters of the impacting force are set as ξ b 0 75 k 5 6 108 η b 2 10 4 in order to later investigate the effect of cross flow on the dynamics of the constrained pipe we will first revisit the dynamical problem of a loosely supported cantilever in the absence of cross flow in the calculations for a pipe without cross flow the initial conditions are set as η 1 0 ζ 1 0 0 01 since the dynamic responses of the pipe in the z and y directions are identical for tsp constraints here we only plot the z direction bifurcation diagrams the displacement amplitudes of the pipe for various u either at the constraint location ξ 0 75 or at the free end ξ 1 will be recorded in the bifurcation diagrams the results are shown in fig 6 it is immediately seen from fig 6 that for a given u beyond the critical flow velocity u cr 5 3 the displacement amplitudes at the free end are generally larger than that at the constraint location in the range of 5 3 u 6 it is found that the pipe is undergoing a periodic motion with both positive and negative amplitudes in the bifurcation diagrams for higher flow velocity e g u 6 2 however the pipe would be buckled onto the constraints thus for a given u yielding either a positive or a negative amplitude 4 3 nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for varied u r and u 0 in this section we consider the nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for u 0 for calculation purpose a set of initial values for the generalized coordinates needs to be given since the cross flow behaves like a disturbance and the pipe would oscillate even if the pipe is initially static in the following calculations the only non zero initial conditions are defined by q 1 0 p 1 0 0 2 the numerical results presented will be focused on the possible dynamical behavior of the constrained cantilevered pipe under the action of cross flow for u 0 the bifurcation diagrams for the il or cf displacements at the tip end of the pipe are plotted in fig 7 in this figure the pipe s responses are plotted in terms of the amplitude displacements as functions of the reduced cross flow velocity u r in both bifurcation diagrams plotted in fig 7 the red circles represent the maximum displacements while the red squares represent the minimum displacements of the pipe for various reduced cross flow velocities the results shown in fig 7 a correspond to the cf responses of the pipe at the free end of the pipe it is found that with increasing u r the maximum amplitudes of cf responses would increase to a relatively large value and thereafter decrease to a relatively small value if u r is increased further the maximum amplitudes of cf responses do not change much at least in the range of 0 u r 100 for a given u r indeed the oscillation shape of the pipe can be linked to a certain dominated mode in the range of 0 u r 100 three possible dominated modes of the cf responses of the pipe have been detected in the ranges of 0 u r 25 25 u r 72 and 72 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively as indicated in fig 7 a the il tip displacements of the pipe however take up an overall rising trend with the increment of u r as can be seen in fig 7 b in the range of 0 u r 100 four possible dominated modes of the il responses of the pipe have been detected the dominated mode of the responses is mostly dependent on the cross flow velocity chosen for calculations in the ranges of 0 u r 12 12 u r 25 25 u r 76 and 76 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively as indicated in fig 7 b to explore the rich dynamics of the pipe some typical results of phase portraits trajectory diagrams and oscillation shape diagrams of the pipe are further plotted in figs 8 12 the results shown in fig 8 a c are for u r 5 and demonstrate that the dynamic response of the pipe corresponds to a non periodic motion the oscillation shapes shown in fig 8 d and e indicate that both cf and il responses are dominated by the first mode of the cantilevered pipe this is easy to understand because the cross flow velocity is relatively small and the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe for such a low cross flow velocity it is seen that both cf and il displacements are smaller than the outside diameter of the pipe the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 16 are given in fig 9 from fig 9 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion it is interesting that the tip end response displays a well known figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 9 c it is also seen from fig 9 d and e that the oscillation shapes of the cf motions are dominated by the first mode of the cantilever while the oscillation shapes of the il motions are mainly dominated by the second mode the five diagrams given in fig 10 are plotted for u r 31 it is immediately seen that the dynamic responses of the pipe are non periodic which show some fundamental difference if compared with those shown in fig 9 in fig 10 d and e it is observed that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively if the cross flow velocity u r is chosen as u r 44 for calculations the corresponding results are summarized in fig 11 from which it is found that the trajectory of the tip end of the pipe displays a non periodic motion from fig 11 a c it seems that the pipe behaves like a quasi periodic motion again it is seen that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion as shown in fig 12 in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively it is also noted that the il displacement could be larger than the outside diameter of the pipe in summary for u 0 three most important features can be found in figs 7 12 one is the fact that the oscillation shapes of the pipe are generally dependent on the cross flow velocity with the increment of cross flow velocity the responses of the pipe may be dominated by a certain mode of the cantilevered pipe either for the cf or il motions the second important feature is that for a given u r the order of dominated mode of the il motions is generally higher than that of the cf motions this is easy understand because the resonant frequency for the il wake variable is larger than that for the cf wake variable as may be seen in eq 11 the third important feature observed from figs 7 12 is that either periodic or non periodic motions are possible in such a dynamical system of the fluid conveying cantilever subjected to cross flow before leaving this section it should be mentioned that the il displacement can be imagined to consist of a mean static part and a perturbation about the mean part the mean part is generated due to the fact that in the il direction the pipe may be bent by the cross flow as discussed in a recent work by leclercq and de langre 2018 in general this mean part of il displacement can increase with increasing cross flow velocity 4 4 nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for varied u r and several typical values of u in section 4 3 the vivs of the pipe system have been analyzed when the internal flow velocity is zero and the reduced cross flow velocity ranges from zero to one hundred it is well known that a cantilevered pipe containing internal axial flow is possible to undergo a flutter instability as explained by paidoussis et al 1991 when the internal flow velocity is below the critical value u cr for flutter instability which corresponds to a subcritical flow the oscillation of the pipe may be damped in the absence of cross flow if the axial flow is in the supercritical regime however the axial flow velocity is beyond the critical value for flutter instability and the oscillation of the pipe may be amplified thus yielding to a limit cycle motion in this section the viv responses for several typical values of u are investigated the values of u may be either subcritical or supercritical the first case to be discussed here is the viv responses of the cantilevered pipe with u 4 in such case the internal flow is below the critical value for flutter instability therefore one may have expected that the internal flow velocity only has slight effect on the viv responses of the pipe the corresponding results are shown in fig 13 for a pipe with cross flow velocity being varied it is found that with increasing u r the maximum amplitudes of cf responses increase to a relatively large value and thereafter decrease to a relatively small value when u r is further increased the maximum amplitudes of cf responses may once again gradually increase in the ranges of 0 u r 16 16 u r 66 and 66 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively as indicated in fig 13 a thus it appears that the bifurcation diagram of fig 13 a is qualitatively similar as that of fig 7 a nevertheless the bifurcation diagrams shown in figs 13 a and fig 7 a have some difference this may be due to the fact that without cross flow the system of a fluid conveying pipe with u 4 has positive damping and different frequency in each mode if compared with that with u 0 fig 13 b shows that with the increment of u r the maximum amplitudes of il responses change from positive to negative values at a certain high cross flow velocity and the negative values gradually increase this new feature is obviously different from that shown in fig 7 b this interesting feature may be related to the restraining force of the loose constraints at ξ b 0 75 in the presence of loose constraints the displacement of the pipe at ξ b 0 75 is limited and hence the pipe may prefer to bend in a second mode shape in the il direction thus yielding negative displacement at the tip end of the pipe moreover in the ranges of 0 u r 10 10 u r 23 23 u r 76 and 76 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively as indicated in fig 13 b in the case of u 4 some typical results of phase portraits trajectory diagrams and oscillation shape diagrams of the pipe are further plotted in figs 14 16 for three different cross flow velocities the results shown in fig 14 a c are for u r 5 and u 4 demonstrating that the pipe undergoes a quasi periodic motion the oscillation shapes shown in fig 14 d and e indicate that both cf and il responses are dominated by the first mode of the cantilevered pipe this is easy to understand because the axial flow velocity is below the critical velocity u cr and the cross flow velocity is relatively small meanwhile the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 31 and u 4 are given in fig 15 from fig 15 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory it is also seen from fig 15 d and e that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 for u 4 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 16 a c in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively as shown in fig 16 d and e the second case to be discussed here is the viv responses of the cantilevered pipe with u 5 in such case the internal flow is slightly lower than the critical value u cr 5 3 for flutter instability fig 17 a shows a similar bifurcation diagram as that of fig 13 a in the ranges of 0 u r 18 18 u r 63 and 63 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively in addition as shown in fig 17 b in the ranges of 0 u r 19 19 u r 34 34 u r 74 and 74 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively the remarkable difference between figs 17 b and fig 13 b is that for a given u r there may be one order of magnitude difference between the displacement amplitudes shown in these two figures demonstrating that the il responses may be significantly affect by the internal flow when the internal flow velocity is in the vicinity of the critical value we next turn our attention to the case of u 5 6 which is slightly higher than the critical value of internal flow velocity in this case the pipe is subjected to flutter instability and a limit cycle motion would occur even the cross flow is absent thus one may have expected that the dynamical behavior of the pipe could display some new features this is true as shown in fig 18 the first interesting dynamical feature of the pipe system with u 5 6 is that either cf or il response of the pipe has a perturbed displacement around the mean displacement position even for sufficiently small cross flow velocities indeed when the cross flow velocity is in the range of 0 u r 6 approximately the oscillation of the pipe is mainly induced by the internal fluid flow and the effect of cross flow is not pronounced another interesting dynamical feature for u 5 6 is related to the amplitude of the il responses shown in fig 18 b it is observed that for large u r the il displacements become much larger if compared with those shown in fig 17 b therefore when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical value the effects of internal flow and cross flow on the dynamical behavior of the pipe may have a competitive mechanism for relatively high cross flow velocities moreover the internal flow could have a promoted effect on the il displacement amplitudes of the pipe as shown in fig 18 a in the ranges of 0 u r 65 and 65 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the second mode and third mode respectively fig 18 b demonstrates that in the ranges of 0 u r 36 36 u r 79 and 79 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is dominated by the second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively some typical dynamical behavior of the pipe for u 5 6 are presented in figs 19 21 the results shown in fig 19 a c are for u r 5 and u 5 6 demonstrating that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion interestingly the oscillation shapes shown in fig 19 d and e indicate that either cf or il responses are associated with the second cantilever mode with a visible component of the first thus the periodic motion shown in fig 19 is mainly related to the internal flow induced flutter rather than the cross flow induced vibrations the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 31 and u 5 6 are given in fig 20 from fig 20 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a non periodic motion the oscillation shapes of both cf and il responses illustrated in fig 20 d and e show that the second cantilever mode becomes more prominent while the first cantilever mode becomes invisible as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 for u 5 6 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 21 a c in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively it is also noted that the il displacement could be much larger than the outside diameter of the pipe finally the case of u 6 is considered the results of bifurcation diagrams are shown in fig 22 it is immediately seen from fig 22 that the overall dynamical behavior of the pipe for u 6 is qualitatively similar as those shown in fig 18 for u 5 6 however the range of cross flow velocities for a given order of dominated mode has changed as shown in fig 22 a in the ranges of 0 u r 77 and 77 u r 100 the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the second mode and third mode respectively in the bifurcation diagram for the il responses of the pipe shown in fig 22 b it is seen that there is a jump at about u r 21 this jump phenomenon may be related to the shift of the cf and il responses when u r 21 the dynamic displacement of the pipe is mainly induced by the internal fluid flow and the cf and il responses have the amplitude at the same magnitude for u r 21 however both cross flow and internal flow greatly contribute to the overall responses of the pipe at about u r 21 the cf response of the pipe becomes small but the il displacement suddenly becomes large thus generating a jump phenomenon in fig 22 b moreover in the ranges of 0 u r 44 44 u r 86 and 86 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is dominated by the second mode third mode and fifth mode respectively as shown in fig 22 b in fig 23 the reduced cross flow velocity is u r 88 and the axial flow velocity is u 6 it is observed that the cf and il responses are dominated by the third mode and fifth mode respectively in this case the vortex shedding frequency is close to the third mode structural natural frequency indeed the il oscillation frequency is nearly twice the structural natural frequency from the phase portrait diagrams and the tip end oscillation trajectory it is noted that the dynamic responses of the constrained pipe conveying fluid are quasi periodic with the feature of figure of eight trajectory 4 5 effect of location of the loose constraints on the nonlinear viv responses of the pipe in all the results of figs 7 23 presented in sections 4 3 and 4 4 three main features can be observed the first one is that for given values of u and u r the oscillation shapes of the pipe in the cf or il direction can be linked to a certain mode of a cantilevered beam the second feature is that the cf and il responses are generally coupled the third feature is that both internal flow and cross flow may contribute to the nonlinear response of the pipe for relatively low internal flow velocity the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the cross flow when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical value the effects of internal flow and cross flow on the dynamic responses of the pipe may have a competitive mechanism provided that the cross flow velocity is not high for relatively high cross flow velocities however the internal flow could have an obvious effect on the il displacement amplitudes of the pipe in our calculations the values of four key parameters ε y ε z λ y and λ z for van der pol wake oscillators are selected to be the same as those utilized in previous studies see e g wang et al 2018a and the effectiveness has been verified in this work by using two calculational examples see figs 3 and 4 it should be also pointed out that the chosen values of geometric and physical parameters of the pipe in our calculations are representative therefore the abovementioned three main features are expected to be of general significance the first feature is about the dominated mode of the pipe s response this feature can be easily understood by looking at the oscillation shapes of the pipe shown in figs 8 12 14 16 19 21 and 23 indeed this feature has also be reported in some previous studies about the viv analysis of pinned pinned cylinders pipes see e g ge et al 2009 dai et al 2013 wang et al 2018a as for the second main feature about the coupling of the cf and il responses of the pipe this can be expected since the cf and il motions are naturally interrelated as the governing equations of 13 and 14 are coupled in all previous calculations the loose constraints are assumed to be located at a specific place of ξ b 0 75 thus one might have questioned the generality of the abovementioned third main feature to further demonstrate the generality of the third feature several typical values of ξ b are chosen for additional calculations and analysis the results are shown in figs 24 and 25 for two typical values of u in fig 24 some results of the tip end responses of the pipe are presented for u 5 0 and four different values of ξ b in the case of u 5 0 the internal fluid velocity is slightly below the critical value it is clearly seen from fig 24 that although the constraint location can affect the displacement amplitudes of the pipe to some extent the overall behaviors of the pipe are similar for various values of ξ b the results of fig 25 show the tip end responses of the pipe with u 5 6 and for four different values of ξ b in the case of u 5 6 the internal fluid velocity is slightly beyond the critical value from the results shown in fig 25 it is observed that the overall behaviors of the pipe are similar for various values of ξ b when the cross flow velocity is small approximately 0 u r 10 in all cases the cf and il responses of the pipe are mainly attributed to the internal flow when the cross flow velocity is successively increased in the range of 10 u r 100 the cross flow has an increasing influence on the cf and il responses of the pipe from fig 25 once again it is seen that the constraint location may affect the tip end response amplitudes of the pipe 5 conclusion in order to investigate the basic mechanism of vivs of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid subjected to loose constraints a new 3 d theoretical prediction model is proposed the pipe is constrained by a tube support plate and subjected to both internal axial flow and external cross flow the full 3 d nonlinear partial differential equations for the pipe dynamics and two distributed van der pol wake oscillators for the wake dynamics are coupled and discretized first by galerkin s method resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations then these ordinary differential equations are further solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm according to the results presented in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams some conclusions can be drawn as follows i when the internal flow velocity is below the critical value for flutter instability the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the external cross flow for given values of u and u r the oscillation shapes in the cf or il direction may be linked to a certain cantilever mode the resonance frequency in the il direction is generally higher than that in the cf direction ii when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical flow velocity for flutter instability the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the internal flow for relatively low cross flow velocities while to both internal and cross flows for high cross flow velocities iii when the velocity of the internal cross flow is varied both periodic and non periodic motions of the pipe are possible iv in the dynamic analysis of fluid conveying pipes subjected to cross flow the cf and il responses of the pipe are generally coupled therefore both cf and il displacements need to be accounted for acknowledgements the financial support of the national natural science

22890,in this paper a theoretical model for vortex induced vibrations vivs of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid subjected to loose constraints is proposed and analyzed the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics are modeled by two distributed van der pol wake oscillators taking into account the coupling between the structure and fluid the full nonlinear partial differential equations of the flexible pipe are derived by using hamilton s principle the nonlinear partial differential equations for the pipe and wake are further discretized by the aid of the galerkin s technique resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations these ordinary differential equations are further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm via varying the internal and cross flow velocities the derived high dimensional reduced order model displays some interesting dynamical behaviors of the coupled system phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams are plotted showing the existence of lock in phenomenon and figure of eight trajectory when the internal fluid velocity is small and below the critical value for flutter instability the oscillation of the pipe is mainly induced by the cross flow for internal flow velocity beyond the critical value for flutter instability interestingly the effect of low cross flow velocity is not pronounced for relatively high cross flow velocity both internal and external fluid flows can significantly contribute to the responses of the pipe this work is expected to be useful for predicting the responses of marine oil conveying pipes under the combined effects of internal and external fluid flows keywords cantilevered pipe conveying fluid loose constraints vortex induced vibrations cross flow internal flow three dimensional model 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon which can be found in many engineering fields including suspended cables for bridges power transmission lines chimneys heat exchanger tubes marine structures such as cables and risers placed within ocean current and so on as a typical type of truly self excited and self sustained oscillations vortex induced vibrations always greatly decrease the fatigue life of structures and even lead to the damage of structures accordingly vortex induced vibrations of various structures were widely concerned and have been extensively investigated by many researchers during the past several decades in recent years indeed a considerable research effort experimental theoretical or and numerical has been undertaken in an attempt to understand the mechanism of vivs of cylindrical structures and to suggest ways of alleviating them see e g bishop and hassan 1964 anderson and szewczyk 1997 feng 1968 yamamoto et al 2004 zhao et al 2013 and meng et al 2017b a comprehensive review on the various aspects of vivs for rigid or flexible cylinders pipes can be found in hong and shah 2018 the interested reader is referred to the excellent review of hong and shah 2018 the experimental study on vivs of structures has a fine pedigree a lot of experimental investigations were conducted to understand the fundamental mechanism of viv phenomena see e g gaster 1969 brika and laneville 1993 balasubramanian et al 1998 zhu et al 2016 song et al 2011 and kang et al 2017 among a vast amount of literature a series of experiments by gaster 1969 and gaster 1971 were focused on the viv of cones subjected to uniform lateral flow a flexible riser model with a large aspect ratio of 1400 was tested by trim et al 2005 it was shown that the in line il fatigue damage is as severe as the cross flow cf fatigue damage and that a riser partially or fully covered with helical strakes can suppress the viv responses perhaps the first experiment study of the vivs of flexible pipes containing internal flowing fluid is due to guo and lou 2008 who carried out the viv experiments of a riser partially immersed in cross flow the effect of internal fluid velocity on the vivs of the riser was investigated the experimental results demonstrated that both il and cf vibrations amplitudes increase while the oscillation frequencies decrease with the increase of internal fluid velocity srinil et al 2013a b performed a two degree of freedom dof viv experimental investigation of circular cylinders with variable natural frequency ratio the circular cylinder was placed in a water towing tank some good qualitative and quantitative agreements between numerical and experimental investigations were found song et al 2016 conducted an experiment of a flexible pipe undergoing viv to acquire hydrodynamic forces and coefficients via strain measurement the distributions of the root mean square rms of non dimensional viv displacements were obtained either in the cf or il direction indeed the aforementioned experiments have established a basis for the study of vortex induced vibrations of slender pipes and also provided a reference for verifying theoretical empirical or numerical models because in the analysis of computational fluid dynamics cfd of a fluid structure interaction system the simulation is or can be very close to reality the vortex induced vibrations of cylinders pipes were also studied via cfd calculations by some researchers for instance meneghini et al 2004 simulated the vivs of a flexible cylinder with the hydrodynamic forces being modeled by discrete vortex method dvm their numerical results agreed well with experiments for oscillating cylinders with mass ratio m 50 8 however for mass ratio m 3 3 the numerical calculations have not detected the maximum oscillating amplitude observed in experiments holmes et al 2006 predicted the viv of risers via the utilization of three dimensional 3 d cfd solutions the numerical results were compared with experiments reported by trim et al 2005 it was found that the dominant modes and rms amplitude predicted using cfd were almost the same as those observed in experiments jung et al 2012 revealed the viv phenomenon of a slender riser through numerical investigations based on the 3d finite difference method fdm the numerical approach based on the fdm was also used by wang et al 2014 to study the distribution of the riser s stress and deformation during its installation operation kamble and chen 2016 employed the finite analytical navier stokes fans technique to evaluate the il and cf fatigue damage of risers with large aspect ratio the results were in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data huang et al 2018 simulated the flow domain with finite volume method fvm and solved the structural responses with finite element method fem then coupled the two parts of solutions in fluent 6 3 the oscillation shape diagrams of the flexible cylinder were compared with the experimental and numerical results published previously although cfd analyses show considerable promise it is important to realize that one of the major disadvantages of the cfd calculations is that the computational time required to obtain a solution is significant especially for extremely slender pipes in ocean engineering besides experimental tests and numerical simulations a considerable amount of empirical theoretical models which attempt to analyze the vortex induced vibrations of cylinders pipes have been proposed according to the discussion in paidoussis et al 2010 there were three main theoretical models for the prediction of viv responses the first type of theoretical models is the forced system models where the external hydrodynamic force is supposed to be only related to time and does not depends on structural motions this simplest type of theoretical models is based on data from measurements of hydrodynamic forces on a stationary cylinder the second type of theoretical models is fluidelastic system models where the hydrodynamic force may be related to the structural displacements velocities and accelerations the third type of theoretical models is the coupled system models in which the hydrodynamic force depends on the variables associated with the wake dynamics and simultaneously the structural motions can affect the evolution of wake in recent years the third type of theoretical models has been widely used to investigate the vortex induced vibrations of rigid or flexible cylinders among various coupled system models the wake oscillator models have attracted much attention as discussed in paidoussis et al 2010 for instance the van der pol wake oscillator coupled with the structural motions for predicting the viv responses was proposed by facchinetti et al 2004 the theoretical results based on the van der pol wake oscillator were compared with previous experimental data it was demonstrated that the van der pol wake oscillator model is useful for predicting the vivs of cylinders with large aspect ratio and at high reynolds numbers using the van der pol wake oscillator suggested in facchinetti et al 2004 dai et al 2013 studied the two dimensional 2 d viv of a simply supported pipe by considering both subcritical and supercritical internal fluid velocities it was demonstrated that the buckled pipe may undergo complex motions including chaotic oscillations with sufficiently high internal fluid velocity based on the aforementioned van der pol wake oscillator model dai et al 2014 further analyzed the 2 d vortex induced vibrations of pinned pinned pipes conveying pulsating fluid flow subjected to external cross flow by using the method of multiple scales they found that the peak vibration amplitudes of the pipe conveying pulsating fluid is larger than that of a pipe conveying uniform fluid based on two similar van der pol wake oscillators in the il and cf directions ge et al 2009 studied the 3 d viv of long slender cylinders without internal fluid flow their work indicated that the structural fatigue damage is related to both cf and il vibrations using ge et al 2009 s van der pol wake oscillators duan et al 2018 further investigated the 3 d viv of simply supported pipes with particular consideration of the effect of internal axial flow computational results showed that complex dynamical responses including 3 d periodic quasi periodic and chaotic vibrations under the lock in condition almost at the same time wang et al 2018a established a 3 d theoretical model for viv prediction of pinned pinned pipes it was particularly shown that the dynamic responses of the pipe may be dramatically affected by the internal fluid flow interestingly it was found that the internal flow effect on the pipe s vivs is small for high cross flow velocities while this effect may be pronounced when the cross flow velocities are relatively low especially in the case of the pipe being buckled due to internal fluid flow despite a lot of valuable studies of the viv of cylinders pipes mentioned above they were mainly concerned with the viv responses of supported pipes either with or without internal fluid flow the literature of 3 d viv responses of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid is very limited very recently meng et al 2017a have initiated to analyze the 2 d viv behaviors of fluid conveying cantilevered pipes however their proposed model for the pipe structure is linear and is not suitable for predicting the possible 3 d large amplitude responses of the pipe this motivates the current work to further establish and analyze the nonlinear viv model of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid in the present study we will investigate the 3 d viv responses of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid with loose constraints placed somewhere along the length of the pipe the nonlinear nonplanar coupled equations of motion of the cantilevered pipe are derived by using hamilton s principle the hydrodynamic forces are modeled by two distributed van der pol wake oscillators these nonlinear equations are then discretized by use of the galerkin s technique with a six mode truncation and are further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm the rich dynamics of the constrained cantilevered pipe subjected to both internal axial flow and external cross flow will be represented in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams 2 the analytical model as we know flexible pipes have been widely used in ocean engineering usually the pipe is supported at some places along the pipe length in some cases the pinned or fixed support may become loose after it has worked a certain time in the present work a horizontal pipe system under consideration is depicted in fig 1 the downstream end of the pipe is assumed to be loosely supported and the loose support is a typical type of circular tube constraints the cantilevered pipe is of length l flexural rigidity ei density ρ p and mass per unit length m axially conveying fluid is of density ρ f and mass per unit length m with axial flow velocity u the cross flow is of density ρ 0 with cross flow velocity u e the pipe is loosely supported somewhere along the pipe length the loose constraints are the type of tube support plate tsp consisting of a plate with a drilled hole for pipe to across in fig 1 x b and y b are the location and free gap of loose constraints respectively the 3 d nonplanar full nonlinear equations of motion for the pipe in the absence of cross flow have been derived by wadham gagnon et al 2007 by means of hamiltonian approaches several assumptions were made in the derivation of the 3 d version of nonlinear equations for the pipe i the internal axial fluid is incompressible ii the nonlinear euler bernoulli beam theory for the pipe is applicable iii the centreline of the pipe is inextensible iv the pipe s axial strain is sufficiently small although its lateral deflections may be large v the impacting force due to the constraints is assumed to be exerted on the pipe s centreline the pipe s lateral displacements are denoted by v s t and w s t along the y and z axes respectively with s being the curvilinear coordinate along the length of the pipe and t the time following the derivation of wadham gagnon et al 2007 and neglecting gravity effects the 3 d version of governing equations for the cantilevered pipe subjected to both cross flow and loose constraints may be written as i in the y direction 1 m m m a v e i v 2 m u v m u 2 v c v

surrounding external fluid c is the damping coefficient of the system f y and f z represent the effects of impacting forces and external hydrodynamic forces imposed on the pipe respectively in the y and z directions the damping coefficient c consists of viscous dissipation in the structure c s and the fluid added damping c f thus 3 c c s c f c s 2 χ m m m a ω r c f ϑ ω s ρ 0 d 2 where ω r is the angular frequency of the pipe χ is the structural damping ratio ϑ is a stall parameter usually estimated using experiment data as discussed in facchinetti et al 2004 and ge et al 2009 the two key parameters in eq 3 will be chosen as χ 0 001 and ϑ 0 8 in eq 3 ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency and d is the pipe s external diameter in addition the added fluid mass m a per unit length is assumed to be independent of time and is given by 4 m a π 4 c a ρ 0 d 2 where c a is the added mass coefficient and is chosen to be 1 for cylindrical structures as reported by munir et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 the external force exerted on the pipe f y and f z can be expressed as 5 f y f y f f y c v w δ s s b f z f z f f z c v w δ s s b in which f y c v w and f z c v w are the restraining forces of the loose constraints along the y and z directions respectively δ s s b is the dirac delta function with s b x b denoting the location of the loose constraints according to mureithi et al 1995 and wang et al 2018b f y c v w and f z c v w can be given by 6 f y c v w v r f r f z c v w w r f r r v 2 w 2 where r presents the total displacement of the pipe centreline deviating from the zero equilibrium position and f r is the total restraining force due to the loose constraints according to paidoussis and semler 1993 and paidoussis et al 1991 f r is given by 7 f r k r 1 2 r y b r y b 3 in which k is the stiffness describing the impacting force y b is the free gap between the pipe and loose constraints the external hydrodynamic force f y f and f z f are induced by the wake dynamics and may be expressed as ge et al 2009 8 f y f f d f d 0 f l u e w t f z f f l f d u e w t in which f d is the vortex induced fluctuating drag force f d 0 is the average drag force and f l is the lift force exerted on the pipe the two drag forces and the lift force are given by ge et al 2009 9 f d 1 2 c d i ρ 0 d u e 2 f d 0 1 2 c d 0 ρ 0 d u e 2 f l 1 2 c l ρ 0 d u e 2 where c d i is a vortex induced drag term depending on time c d 0 is the drag coefficient for a pipe at rest c l is the lift coefficient in the present study c d i and c l will be written as 10 c d i c d 0 i p 2 c l c l 0 q 2 in which p and q are the vortex wake variables in the y and z directions respectively c d 0 i and c l 0 are the corresponding unsteady drag and lift coefficients of a stationary pipe subjected to

where ε y ε z λ y and λ z are non dimensional parameters determined by experiment in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the values of the four key parameters of eq 11 are set as wang et al 2018a ε y 0 02 ε z 0 04 λ y 96 and λ z 12 the vortex shedding frequency strouhal frequency is given by 12 ω s 2 π s t u e d where s t is the strouhal number which is dependent on reynolds number it has been demonstrated that 0 2 is a fairly reasonable value of s t for a wide range of reynolds numbers as discussed by gabbai and benaroya 2005 it should be pointed out that the van der pol wake oscillator model is semi empirical and semi analytical since the key parameters of van der pol wake oscillator model are built on basic experimental data some essential characteristics e g self sustained oscillation self limited oscillation amplitude limited lock in range vortex shedding frequency of viv can be recovered by using this phenomenological approach paidoussis et al 2010 some researchers e g violette et al 2007 demonstrated that the results of viv responses of a flexible cylinder based on van der pol equations show a good agreement with those predicted using direct numerical simulations dns particularly violette et al 2007 showed that some essential features predicted by dns such as standing or propagative nature of waves and modal content of the cylinder s response could be recovered using the van der pol wake oscillator model because of the simplicity of van der pol wake oscillator models the main advantage of this phenomenological approach over the dns computations is that it requires only a small computational time a few minutes to an hour of cpu on a pc violette et al 2007 on the other hand undeniably the wake oscillator model ignores some details e g vortex pattern and vortex intensity of the external cross flow this may be the main deficiency of such type of phenomenological approaches eqs 1 2 and 11 can be transformed into

between the pipe and loose constraints 3 solution method it is seen that the governing equations for the pipe and wake are in partial differential form the galerkin s method will be used to solve eqs 13 16 according to this method the oscillation displacements of the pipe and the wake variables can be given by 18 η ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ η r τ ζ ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ ζ r τ p ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ p r τ q ξ τ r 1 φ r ξ q r τ where φ r ξ is the dimensionless eigenfunctions of a cantilevered beam η r τ and p r τ are the corresponding generalized coordinates in the y direction and ζ r τ and q r τ are the corresponding generalized coordinates in the z direction it should be noted that the series 18 can be truncated at a reasonably large value of r i e r n since the galerkin s method has been widely used for studying the nonlinear vibrations of pipes conveying fluid see e g liu et al 2018 ni et al 2015 paidoussis et al 1989 wang et al 2017 the partial differential equations of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid will be discretized with the aid of galerkin s method without giving any additional details of this method 4 results and discussion in this section the main aim is to investigate the vivs of the cantilevered pipe subjected to loose constraints for that purpose the reduced cross flow velocities are supposed to be varied in the range of 0 u r 100 where u r is defined as u r 2 π u e ω 1 d with ω 1 being the first order natural frequency of the pipe for a given internal fluid velocity dai et al 2013 in this range of reduced cross flow velocities extensive calculations indicate that the dynamic responses of the pipe are only dominated by the lowest several modes of the system thus the nonlinear partial differential equations 13 16 are discretized via the galerkin s method with a six mode truncation the obtained high dimensional reduced order ordinary differential equations will be further numerically solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm the numerical results are plotted in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams to show the various dynamical behaviors of the pipe 4 1 validation owing to the lack of viv experiment on restrained cantilevered pipes conveying fluid the validation of the proposed model will be performed using three typical examples the first example for validation analysis of the present analytical model is a constrained cantilevered pipe conveying fluid without external cross flow the pipe is subjected to a cubic spring at a certain place ξ b of the pipe this dynamical problem has been theoretically and numerically studied by paidoussis et al 1989 who assumed that the pipe s motion is limited in a single plane for comparison purpose the geometric nonlinearities appearing in the governing equation of 14 were neglected and all the system parameters were set as those utilized by paidoussis et al 1989 α 0 005 β 0 2 γ 10 ξ b 0 82 and k 3 100 with γ being a gravity parameter and k 3 being the stiffness of the cubic spring support paidoussis et al 1989 both positive and negative initial displacement conditions q 1 0 q 2 0 0 1 or 0 1 were utilized for calculations the bifurcation diagram of the tip displacements with the internal fluid velocity being the variable parameter based on the present analytical model is shown in fig 2 b it is obviously observed that our result agrees well with that reported by paidoussis et al 1989 the second validation example for our analytical model is a simply supported riser without internal axial flow but subjected to an external cross flow the experiment of vivs of this riser model was conducted by song et al 2016 and some numerical simulations were done by yuan et al 2018 for comparison purpose all the system parameters were chosen to be the same as those utilized by song et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 the pipe length l 7 9m the outer diameter d 0 031m the inner diameter d 0 027m the young s modulus e 108 gpa the bending stiffness ei 1476 63nm2 the mass per unit length of the pipe m 1 768 kg m the mass ratio m 2 5 and the pretension t 2943n the distributions of rms displacements for the riser without internal flow but under cross flow u e 1 6 m s are shown in fig 3 in this figure the blue dash line stands for the experimental results reported by song et al 2016 the red dot dash line stands for the present results and the green solid line stands for the numerically predicted results obtained by yuan et al 2018 it is obvious that the present result has an acceptable agreement with the experimental and numerical results the third example to validate the reliability of the present model is a dynamical model of a pinned pinned pipe containing static internal fluid and subjected to cross flow this pipe model has been experimentally examined by trim et al 2005 in order to reproduce the experimental results using the present analytical model and numerical procedure all the physical and geometric parameters of the experimental system are utilized in the calculations these system parameters are given by trim et al 2005 the pipe length l 38m the outer diameter d 0 27m the inner diameter d 0 21m the young s modulus e 210 gpa the density of water ρ e 1000 kg m3 the mass ratio m 1 6 and the top tension t 5000n the distributions of displacement standard deviation along the riser length with a uniform cross flow of u e 0 4 m s are shown in fig 4 it is clearly seen that the dominated modes and vibration amplitudes predicted using the present model agree well with the experimental data given in trim et al 2005 bearing in mind that the applied tension in the experiment of trim et al 2005 approximately ranged from 4000n to 6000n while the tension in our analysis was set to be 5000n the comparison between theory and experiment is encouraging 4 2 basic dynamics of the fluid conveying cantilever in the absence of cross flow for an oscillating structure subjected to cross flow when the vortex shedding frequency approaches the natural frequency of the structure the vortex shedding frequency would deviate from the strouhal s law and synchronize onto the oscillation frequency defined as a lock in state according to facchinetti et al 2004 and gabbai and benaroya 2005 accordingly lock in phenomenon could occur when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid before analyzing the lock in phenomenon and vortex induced vibration of the cantilevered pipe it is instructive to compute the natural frequencies of the cantilevered pipe conveying fluid without cross flow the argand diagram of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is shown in fig 5 in which the evolution of the lowest four non dimensional eigen frequencies for the linearized system of the cantilevered pipe with increasing axial flow velocity is plotted in this diagram re ω im ω and im ω re ω may be understood as the oscillation frequency damping and damping ratio respectively it is obvious that the flutter instability occurs at u c r 5 3 in the second mode in the following analysis some geometric and physical parameters of the pipe system are selected as the young s modulus e 210 gpa the length l 140m the outer diameter d 0 26m the inner diameter d 0 22m the density of the pipe ρ p 7850 kg m3 the density of internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 and the density of external fluid ρ o 1020 kg m3 unless otherwise mentioned the key parameters of the impacting force are set as ξ b 0 75 k 5 6 108 η b 2 10 4 in order to later investigate the effect of cross flow on the dynamics of the constrained pipe we will first revisit the dynamical problem of a loosely supported cantilever in the absence of cross flow in the calculations for a pipe without cross flow the initial conditions are set as η 1 0 ζ 1 0 0 01 since the dynamic responses of the pipe in the z and y directions are identical for tsp constraints here we only plot the z direction bifurcation diagrams the displacement amplitudes of the pipe for various u either at the constraint location ξ 0 75 or at the free end ξ 1 will be recorded in the bifurcation diagrams the results are shown in fig 6 it is immediately seen from fig 6 that for a given u beyond the critical flow velocity u cr 5 3 the displacement amplitudes at the free end are generally larger than that at the constraint location in the range of 5 3 u 6 it is found that the pipe is undergoing a periodic motion with both positive and negative amplitudes in the bifurcation diagrams for higher flow velocity e g u 6 2 however the pipe would be buckled onto the constraints thus for a given u yielding either a positive or a negative amplitude 4 3 nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for varied u r and u 0 in this section we consider the nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for u 0 for calculation purpose a set of initial values for the generalized coordinates needs to be given since the cross flow behaves like a disturbance and the pipe would oscillate even if the pipe is initially static in the following calculations the only non zero initial conditions are defined by q 1 0 p 1 0 0 2 the numerical results presented will be focused on the possible dynamical behavior of the constrained cantilevered pipe under the action of cross flow for u 0 the bifurcation diagrams for the il or cf displacements at the tip end of the pipe are plotted in fig 7 in this figure the pipe s responses are plotted in terms of the amplitude displacements as functions of the reduced cross flow velocity u r in both bifurcation diagrams plotted in fig 7 the red circles represent the maximum displacements while the red squares represent the minimum displacements of the pipe for various reduced cross flow velocities the results shown in fig 7 a correspond to the cf responses of the pipe at the free end of the pipe it is found that with increasing u r the maximum amplitudes of cf responses would increase to a relatively large value and thereafter decrease to a relatively small value if u r is increased further the maximum amplitudes of cf responses do not change much at least in the range of 0 u r 100 for a given u r indeed the oscillation shape of the pipe can be linked to a certain dominated mode in the range of 0 u r 100 three possible dominated modes of the cf responses of the pipe have been detected in the ranges of 0 u r 25 25 u r 72 and 72 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively as indicated in fig 7 a the il tip displacements of the pipe however take up an overall rising trend with the increment of u r as can be seen in fig 7 b in the range of 0 u r 100 four possible dominated modes of the il responses of the pipe have been detected the dominated mode of the responses is mostly dependent on the cross flow velocity chosen for calculations in the ranges of 0 u r 12 12 u r 25 25 u r 76 and 76 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively as indicated in fig 7 b to explore the rich dynamics of the pipe some typical results of phase portraits trajectory diagrams and oscillation shape diagrams of the pipe are further plotted in figs 8 12 the results shown in fig 8 a c are for u r 5 and demonstrate that the dynamic response of the pipe corresponds to a non periodic motion the oscillation shapes shown in fig 8 d and e indicate that both cf and il responses are dominated by the first mode of the cantilevered pipe this is easy to understand because the cross flow velocity is relatively small and the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe for such a low cross flow velocity it is seen that both cf and il displacements are smaller than the outside diameter of the pipe the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 16 are given in fig 9 from fig 9 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion it is interesting that the tip end response displays a well known figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 9 c it is also seen from fig 9 d and e that the oscillation shapes of the cf motions are dominated by the first mode of the cantilever while the oscillation shapes of the il motions are mainly dominated by the second mode the five diagrams given in fig 10 are plotted for u r 31 it is immediately seen that the dynamic responses of the pipe are non periodic which show some fundamental difference if compared with those shown in fig 9 in fig 10 d and e it is observed that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively if the cross flow velocity u r is chosen as u r 44 for calculations the corresponding results are summarized in fig 11 from which it is found that the trajectory of the tip end of the pipe displays a non periodic motion from fig 11 a c it seems that the pipe behaves like a quasi periodic motion again it is seen that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion as shown in fig 12 in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively it is also noted that the il displacement could be larger than the outside diameter of the pipe in summary for u 0 three most important features can be found in figs 7 12 one is the fact that the oscillation shapes of the pipe are generally dependent on the cross flow velocity with the increment of cross flow velocity the responses of the pipe may be dominated by a certain mode of the cantilevered pipe either for the cf or il motions the second important feature is that for a given u r the order of dominated mode of the il motions is generally higher than that of the cf motions this is easy understand because the resonant frequency for the il wake variable is larger than that for the cf wake variable as may be seen in eq 11 the third important feature observed from figs 7 12 is that either periodic or non periodic motions are possible in such a dynamical system of the fluid conveying cantilever subjected to cross flow before leaving this section it should be mentioned that the il displacement can be imagined to consist of a mean static part and a perturbation about the mean part the mean part is generated due to the fact that in the il direction the pipe may be bent by the cross flow as discussed in a recent work by leclercq and de langre 2018 in general this mean part of il displacement can increase with increasing cross flow velocity 4 4 nonlinear viv responses of the pipe for varied u r and several typical values of u in section 4 3 the vivs of the pipe system have been analyzed when the internal flow velocity is zero and the reduced cross flow velocity ranges from zero to one hundred it is well known that a cantilevered pipe containing internal axial flow is possible to undergo a flutter instability as explained by paidoussis et al 1991 when the internal flow velocity is below the critical value u cr for flutter instability which corresponds to a subcritical flow the oscillation of the pipe may be damped in the absence of cross flow if the axial flow is in the supercritical regime however the axial flow velocity is beyond the critical value for flutter instability and the oscillation of the pipe may be amplified thus yielding to a limit cycle motion in this section the viv responses for several typical values of u are investigated the values of u may be either subcritical or supercritical the first case to be discussed here is the viv responses of the cantilevered pipe with u 4 in such case the internal flow is below the critical value for flutter instability therefore one may have expected that the internal flow velocity only has slight effect on the viv responses of the pipe the corresponding results are shown in fig 13 for a pipe with cross flow velocity being varied it is found that with increasing u r the maximum amplitudes of cf responses increase to a relatively large value and thereafter decrease to a relatively small value when u r is further increased the maximum amplitudes of cf responses may once again gradually increase in the ranges of 0 u r 16 16 u r 66 and 66 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively as indicated in fig 13 a thus it appears that the bifurcation diagram of fig 13 a is qualitatively similar as that of fig 7 a nevertheless the bifurcation diagrams shown in figs 13 a and fig 7 a have some difference this may be due to the fact that without cross flow the system of a fluid conveying pipe with u 4 has positive damping and different frequency in each mode if compared with that with u 0 fig 13 b shows that with the increment of u r the maximum amplitudes of il responses change from positive to negative values at a certain high cross flow velocity and the negative values gradually increase this new feature is obviously different from that shown in fig 7 b this interesting feature may be related to the restraining force of the loose constraints at ξ b 0 75 in the presence of loose constraints the displacement of the pipe at ξ b 0 75 is limited and hence the pipe may prefer to bend in a second mode shape in the il direction thus yielding negative displacement at the tip end of the pipe moreover in the ranges of 0 u r 10 10 u r 23 23 u r 76 and 76 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively as indicated in fig 13 b in the case of u 4 some typical results of phase portraits trajectory diagrams and oscillation shape diagrams of the pipe are further plotted in figs 14 16 for three different cross flow velocities the results shown in fig 14 a c are for u r 5 and u 4 demonstrating that the pipe undergoes a quasi periodic motion the oscillation shapes shown in fig 14 d and e indicate that both cf and il responses are dominated by the first mode of the cantilevered pipe this is easy to understand because the axial flow velocity is below the critical velocity u cr and the cross flow velocity is relatively small meanwhile the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 31 and u 4 are given in fig 15 from fig 15 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory it is also seen from fig 15 d and e that the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the second and third modes respectively as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 for u 4 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 16 a c in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively as shown in fig 16 d and e the second case to be discussed here is the viv responses of the cantilevered pipe with u 5 in such case the internal flow is slightly lower than the critical value u cr 5 3 for flutter instability fig 17 a shows a similar bifurcation diagram as that of fig 13 a in the ranges of 0 u r 18 18 u r 63 and 63 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode and third mode respectively in addition as shown in fig 17 b in the ranges of 0 u r 19 19 u r 34 34 u r 74 and 74 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the first mode second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively the remarkable difference between figs 17 b and fig 13 b is that for a given u r there may be one order of magnitude difference between the displacement amplitudes shown in these two figures demonstrating that the il responses may be significantly affect by the internal flow when the internal flow velocity is in the vicinity of the critical value we next turn our attention to the case of u 5 6 which is slightly higher than the critical value of internal flow velocity in this case the pipe is subjected to flutter instability and a limit cycle motion would occur even the cross flow is absent thus one may have expected that the dynamical behavior of the pipe could display some new features this is true as shown in fig 18 the first interesting dynamical feature of the pipe system with u 5 6 is that either cf or il response of the pipe has a perturbed displacement around the mean displacement position even for sufficiently small cross flow velocities indeed when the cross flow velocity is in the range of 0 u r 6 approximately the oscillation of the pipe is mainly induced by the internal fluid flow and the effect of cross flow is not pronounced another interesting dynamical feature for u 5 6 is related to the amplitude of the il responses shown in fig 18 b it is observed that for large u r the il displacements become much larger if compared with those shown in fig 17 b therefore when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical value the effects of internal flow and cross flow on the dynamical behavior of the pipe may have a competitive mechanism for relatively high cross flow velocities moreover the internal flow could have a promoted effect on the il displacement amplitudes of the pipe as shown in fig 18 a in the ranges of 0 u r 65 and 65 u r 100 approximately the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the second mode and third mode respectively fig 18 b demonstrates that in the ranges of 0 u r 36 36 u r 79 and 79 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is dominated by the second mode third mode and fourth mode respectively some typical dynamical behavior of the pipe for u 5 6 are presented in figs 19 21 the results shown in fig 19 a c are for u r 5 and u 5 6 demonstrating that the pipe undergoes a periodic motion interestingly the oscillation shapes shown in fig 19 d and e indicate that either cf or il responses are associated with the second cantilever mode with a visible component of the first thus the periodic motion shown in fig 19 is mainly related to the internal flow induced flutter rather than the cross flow induced vibrations the dynamic responses of the pipe with u r 31 and u 5 6 are given in fig 20 from fig 20 a c it is seen that the pipe undergoes a non periodic motion the oscillation shapes of both cf and il responses illustrated in fig 20 d and e show that the second cantilever mode becomes more prominent while the first cantilever mode becomes invisible as the cross flow velocity is increased to u r 88 for u 5 6 the pipe undergoes a periodic motion with a figure of eight trajectory as shown in fig 21 a c in this case the cf and il motions of the pipe are mainly dominated by the third and fourth modes respectively it is also noted that the il displacement could be much larger than the outside diameter of the pipe finally the case of u 6 is considered the results of bifurcation diagrams are shown in fig 22 it is immediately seen from fig 22 that the overall dynamical behavior of the pipe for u 6 is qualitatively similar as those shown in fig 18 for u 5 6 however the range of cross flow velocities for a given order of dominated mode has changed as shown in fig 22 a in the ranges of 0 u r 77 and 77 u r 100 the cf response of the pipe is found to be dominated by the second mode and third mode respectively in the bifurcation diagram for the il responses of the pipe shown in fig 22 b it is seen that there is a jump at about u r 21 this jump phenomenon may be related to the shift of the cf and il responses when u r 21 the dynamic displacement of the pipe is mainly induced by the internal fluid flow and the cf and il responses have the amplitude at the same magnitude for u r 21 however both cross flow and internal flow greatly contribute to the overall responses of the pipe at about u r 21 the cf response of the pipe becomes small but the il displacement suddenly becomes large thus generating a jump phenomenon in fig 22 b moreover in the ranges of 0 u r 44 44 u r 86 and 86 u r 100 approximately the il response of the pipe is dominated by the second mode third mode and fifth mode respectively as shown in fig 22 b in fig 23 the reduced cross flow velocity is u r 88 and the axial flow velocity is u 6 it is observed that the cf and il responses are dominated by the third mode and fifth mode respectively in this case the vortex shedding frequency is close to the third mode structural natural frequency indeed the il oscillation frequency is nearly twice the structural natural frequency from the phase portrait diagrams and the tip end oscillation trajectory it is noted that the dynamic responses of the constrained pipe conveying fluid are quasi periodic with the feature of figure of eight trajectory 4 5 effect of location of the loose constraints on the nonlinear viv responses of the pipe in all the results of figs 7 23 presented in sections 4 3 and 4 4 three main features can be observed the first one is that for given values of u and u r the oscillation shapes of the pipe in the cf or il direction can be linked to a certain mode of a cantilevered beam the second feature is that the cf and il responses are generally coupled the third feature is that both internal flow and cross flow may contribute to the nonlinear response of the pipe for relatively low internal flow velocity the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the cross flow when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical value the effects of internal flow and cross flow on the dynamic responses of the pipe may have a competitive mechanism provided that the cross flow velocity is not high for relatively high cross flow velocities however the internal flow could have an obvious effect on the il displacement amplitudes of the pipe in our calculations the values of four key parameters ε y ε z λ y and λ z for van der pol wake oscillators are selected to be the same as those utilized in previous studies see e g wang et al 2018a and the effectiveness has been verified in this work by using two calculational examples see figs 3 and 4 it should be also pointed out that the chosen values of geometric and physical parameters of the pipe in our calculations are representative therefore the abovementioned three main features are expected to be of general significance the first feature is about the dominated mode of the pipe s response this feature can be easily understood by looking at the oscillation shapes of the pipe shown in figs 8 12 14 16 19 21 and 23 indeed this feature has also be reported in some previous studies about the viv analysis of pinned pinned cylinders pipes see e g ge et al 2009 dai et al 2013 wang et al 2018a as for the second main feature about the coupling of the cf and il responses of the pipe this can be expected since the cf and il motions are naturally interrelated as the governing equations of 13 and 14 are coupled in all previous calculations the loose constraints are assumed to be located at a specific place of ξ b 0 75 thus one might have questioned the generality of the abovementioned third main feature to further demonstrate the generality of the third feature several typical values of ξ b are chosen for additional calculations and analysis the results are shown in figs 24 and 25 for two typical values of u in fig 24 some results of the tip end responses of the pipe are presented for u 5 0 and four different values of ξ b in the case of u 5 0 the internal fluid velocity is slightly below the critical value it is clearly seen from fig 24 that although the constraint location can affect the displacement amplitudes of the pipe to some extent the overall behaviors of the pipe are similar for various values of ξ b the results of fig 25 show the tip end responses of the pipe with u 5 6 and for four different values of ξ b in the case of u 5 6 the internal fluid velocity is slightly beyond the critical value from the results shown in fig 25 it is observed that the overall behaviors of the pipe are similar for various values of ξ b when the cross flow velocity is small approximately 0 u r 10 in all cases the cf and il responses of the pipe are mainly attributed to the internal flow when the cross flow velocity is successively increased in the range of 10 u r 100 the cross flow has an increasing influence on the cf and il responses of the pipe from fig 25 once again it is seen that the constraint location may affect the tip end response amplitudes of the pipe 5 conclusion in order to investigate the basic mechanism of vivs of a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid subjected to loose constraints a new 3 d theoretical prediction model is proposed the pipe is constrained by a tube support plate and subjected to both internal axial flow and external cross flow the full 3 d nonlinear partial differential equations for the pipe dynamics and two distributed van der pol wake oscillators for the wake dynamics are coupled and discretized first by galerkin s method resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations then these ordinary differential equations are further solved by using a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm according to the results presented in the form of phase portraits bifurcation diagrams argand diagram and oscillation shape diagrams some conclusions can be drawn as follows i when the internal flow velocity is below the critical value for flutter instability the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the external cross flow for given values of u and u r the oscillation shapes in the cf or il direction may be linked to a certain cantilever mode the resonance frequency in the il direction is generally higher than that in the cf direction ii when the internal flow velocity is beyond the critical flow velocity for flutter instability the response of the pipe is mainly attributed to the internal flow for relatively low cross flow velocities while to both internal and cross flows for high cross flow velocities iii when the velocity of the internal cross flow is varied both periodic and non periodic motions of the pipe are possible iv in the dynamic analysis of fluid conveying pipes subjected to cross flow

22891,we develop the approach to simulate the experiments with surface and underwater vehicles in towing tanks for reynolds numbers re corresponding to sea trials using discrete injection of polymer additives the complete dynamic similarity between full scale and tank tests is possible if both froude number and re are equal for a ship and its model in traditional experiments the first condition

differently re is higher and the skin friction coefficient c f is hence less for sea trials than for towing tanks injection of polymer additives allows decreasing c f on ship model to full scale values providing the complete similarity and reproducing sea trials in that way we report the selected results of such novel approach that in particular include velocity profiles and c f for sea trial towing tank and pipe experiments plane boundary layer and 3d flow around propeller rough and smooth surfaces the data for full scale and tank experiments agree well with each other keywords polymer drag reduction towing tank sea trial dynamic similarity 1 introduction one of the main stage in the design of ships and underwater vehicles is the experiments with their models in towing tanks high speed basins the largest deep water towing tanks are e g the basins of dga hydrodynamics 545 m long naval surface warfare center 904 m long krylov state research centre ksrc 1324 m long the tank experiments respond to the reynolds numbers re 10 6 that are three orders lower the ocean magnitude we develop the approach for modeling of the full scale sea trials in towing tanks to reproduce them for resistance characteristics corresponding re 10 9 and to provide the complete dynamic similarity it is carried out using the toms effect e g lumley 1973 toms 1948 virk 1975 white and mungal 2008

of polymer drag reduction quite differently for simulating of the full scale sea trials in towing tanks it is a novel approach in both application of the toms effect and marine engineering 2 approach to experiments in order to optimize ship design with the required propulsion properties and to estimate its performance in the operating conditions it is important to know the water resistance in full scale sea trials and the parameters of flow around a ship hull in boundary layer and viscous wakes this is what is determined from dynamical experiments in towing tanks in static problems the geometric and weight similarities are enough then such parameters as draft heel and trim for ship and its model are similar i e linear dimensions of the model hull need to be reduced by the same number of times the complete dynamic similarity denotes the similarity of forces and the flows are then homologous for dynamic similarity in the ship model tests it is necessary to match two dimensionless similarity criteria froude fr u 0 g l and reynolds re u 0 l ν numbers where u 0 is the speed of a moving model or a ship l is their length as a characteristic length g is the acceleration of gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity the equality of froude numbers for the ship and its model means that the pictures of wave formation for them are similar the equality of reynolds numbers implies this fact for boundary layers and eddy generation for the actual and model conditions the equivalence is provided for fr but not for re as u 0 and l of the model are smaller than the corresponding characteristics of the ship thus studying of these problems in a towing tanks is traditionally reduced to the methods of partial simulation because of scale effects due to the absence of complete dynamic similarity there is only the equality of froude numbers and the viscous and wave resistances are independently studied the latter is measured in model tests e g rabaud and moisy 2014 and the former is determined using semi empirical theory for re 0 corresponding to full scale experiments the skin friction coefficient is substantially less than for model tests in towing tanks application of polymer additives allows one to decrease this coefficient on ship model to the values corresponding to re 0 this fact can be used to develop the method for simulation of towing tank flows like ones under full scale re 0 i e to reproduce sea trials in terms of these hydrodynamic factors some theoretical aspects of the problem have been considered at the end of the last century orlov et al 1997 the approach is approved on practical applications e g for the oil supertanker crimea elyukhina and khomyakov 2011 zestovsky et al 1998 we now detail the selected results of experimental study that is carried out to establish validity of the velocity defect law to analyse the features for diffusion of polymer additives and of drag reduction in the turbulent boundary layer depending on a location and a way of their injection to obtain an uniform reduction in local shear stress for discrete injection fluid flows in a turbulent boundary layer pipe channel or flat plate with different cases of polymer solution injection are widely studied e g elbing et al 2013 eskin 2017 graham 2004 hou et al 2008 itoh et al 2005 mccomb and rabie 1982 min et al 2003 toonder et al 1995 yang 2009 we analyse and systematise it to predict the sea trial characteristics from these experiments besides surface roughness analogously leads to higher skin friction e g acharya et al 1986 flack and schultz 2014 hoyt 1991 petrie et al 2003 squire et al 2016 unal 2015 in contrast to the action of polymer additives so we can obtain the data for experiments with lower re and control the required parameters by varying these experimental conditions 3 experimental set up we use the special flow channel designed to study diffusion and the towing tank at ksrc we also apply some apparatus created at the ksrc e g the turbulence rheometer and ship models of 5 8 m long and the developed techniques and methods for parameter identification and for study of weakly non newtonian fluids e g elyukhina 2013 2011 kholpanov and elyukhina 2009 in order to measure the velocity profiles the pitot rake 6 tubes with distance of 20 mm between them is used pressure receiver has elliptical shape 0 5 and 2 mm along vertical and horizontal axes respectively the rake is placed on traverse gear that allows moving it with a step of 0 01 mm the error in velocity is got from measurement accuracy for pressure in the pressure receiver 1 sensors of ksrc are used for measurement of skin friction values we apply thermo anemometer equipment with hot film sensors from dantec and sensor to measure tangential forces with floating element from ksrc accuracy 3 the sensors and rakes are calibrated before experiments 3 1 flow channel the flow channel fig 1 operates on an open cycle it includes ten units consisting of measuring plexiglass and intermediate stainless steel sections of 0 17 and 0 35 m long respectively the design provides up to 4 slots to inject polymer solution into the boundary layer centrifugal pump with capacity 5000 m3 h gives flow velocity in the range 5 16 m s in front of the working area there is a converging section with flow contraction 1 9 to straighten the flow a honeycomb arrangement is used at its entrance 3 2 towing tank the deep water tank of ksrc is the longest one in the world its width and depth are 15 m and 7 m respectively this tank is used for towing and self propelled tests of surface ship and submerged models in deep water and near the surface as well as for testing propellers under open water conditions towing carriage moves a ship model of up to 10 m in length at speeds of up to 20 m s experimental conditions provide a reliable regime of turbulent boundary layer flow and a sufficient viscous flow on the vehicle models 2 5 m in our experiments reynolds numbers are up to 3 5 10 7 polymer solutions are ones of polyox wsr 301 with molecular weight of about 3 million g mol these conditions the polyox concentration 100 ppm and the corresponding drag reduction do not have a noticeable effect to form drag the flow around 85 of ship surface is close to gradientless one except nose and stern where it can be also neglected as flow features change quite slow while polymer additives react on time scale 0 001 0 01 s 4 results and discussion the results for sea trial and model experimental tests demonstrate the validity of the suggested approach the parameters are further scaled as follows u u u 0 u u 0 u u τ y 100 y x y y u τ δ u 0 y y δ x x l l is the corresponding length re x and re l are reynolds numbers along the surface e g re x x u δ ν x is the current longitudinal coordinate y is the coordinate orthogonal to the surface u is the streamwise velocity in boundary layer u 0 is u 0 or u δ for pipe flow u τ is the friction velocity defined from u δ u τ 2 c f c f c f is the local skin friction coefficient u δ is the velocity at y δ δ is the boundary layer thickness δ is the displacement thickness dr 100 τ w τ dr τ w is the drag reduction τ dr and τ w are the wall shear stress with and without polymer solution injection respectively 4 1 flow channel flow in input part of the channel fig 1 with velocity gradient differs weakly from one over a flat plate the boundary layer growths along the length and the mean velocity of flow core is slightly increased e g u δ 8 540 m s at x 0 1 6 m from the pipe entrance and u δ 9 255 m s at x 0 4 9 m the pressure gradient d p d x const and there is an increase in velocity along the length in 1 115 times the local friction resistance becomes constant at x d 9 10 where d is the channel diameter the velocity defect law is satisfied fig 2 for the cases with and without dr the velocity profiles coincide with each other including ones for higher y that is important to analyse the flow around propeller i e there is a similarity for the defect law this fact demonstrates that simulating the tangential forces at the wall by means of skin friction reduction we can also simulate the kinematic characteristics of turbulent boundary layer velocity distribution in a turbulent boundary layer can be represented as a power law schultz grunow 1940 the velocity profiles in fig 3 are given for x 0 4 9 m and the powers n in u y 1 n approximating the points 1 and 2 are 7 7 and 11 respectively the last one corresponds to dr 30 and reynolds numbers that are more on the order of magnitude than for turbulent boundary layer without polymer additives schlichting 1955 the power n in velocity distribution can be interpreted as a function of the local skin friction coefficient so using polymer additives we deform the velocity profile to one corresponding to higher re there is an experimentally proved dependence between the kinematic characteristics of a boundary layer shape factor and the friction force at the wall e g rotta et al 1962 the shape factor h δ θ where θ is the momentum thickness characterizes the shape of velocity profile it is seen in fig 4 that for such weak gradient flow the сhange in frictional resistance by means of polymer additives correctly reflects the сhange in velocity profile and the results show a good agreement with the experimental data by hama 1954 henсe polymer additives do not distort these characteristics of turbulent boundary layer and can be used to simulate it in the most of our experiments including ones in the towing tank we use the discrete injection of polymer solution with inlet concentration c 0 but for comparison some experiments are also carried out in the towing tank complitely filled with polymer solution with polyox concentration c for the discrete case the polymer additives diffuse to peripheral region of the boundary layer and the effect of the frictional resistance reduction decreases along the layer in the flow channel the presence of second section with polymer injection gives an acceptable uniformity in dr fig 5 there is a typical jump in values of c f at the place of slot section 5 that is fast vanishing downstream the theoretical curve in fig 5 responds to the dependence for a flat plate schlichting 1955 at re l 3 4 10 9 and it is close to data 2 for polymer injection through two slots and lower reynolds number 4 2 towing tank for tests with ship models it is often enough to place 2 4 slots on the hull depending on the features of its rims and on the location of prominent parts second slot is usually placed at 1 3 of the model length placement of a slot location in the after part at area of positive pressure gradient is not effective the following features does not lead to a significant increase in the measurement inaccuracy possible non uniformity of fluid feed destruction of polymer solutions features of polymer solution jet mixing with the forward fluid flow for the case of complete simulation of ship resistance and viscous flow in the towing tank using polymer additives this error weakly differs from one for pure water and from analysis of reproducibility it is 100 i 1 ℓ c f i ℓ c f c f 1 5 we develop a procedure to make the distribution of local drag reduction close to uniform i e equidistant to one along ship length in pure water by varying location and way of solution input the location of nose slot section is found from the condition for existence of the fully developed turbulent flow i e it is at the turbulator 0 5 1 5 ribs next slots are defined from the developed empirical formulas linking in particular polymer concentration at the wall c w and τ w τ dr dr a log c w b c w c 0 exp α x β where a b and α β are the experimental constants that depend on the polymer and α β on the way of injection too x x λ λ is the normalized longitudinal diffusion parameter that depends on c 0 and polymer consumption in the first approximation the drag reduction for a ship model is estimated as follows let froude numbers be equal for ship and its model and for these conditions we obtain re m for towing tank using the formula for equivalent flat plate c f 0 455 logre 2 58 the value of c f for both cases re m and re 0 and the percentage of change are found as an example we consider a tanker with length l 0 200 m and economic speed u 0 15 knot 7 717 m s then re 0 1 543 10 9 e g ν 10 6 m2 s fr 0 0 174 for complete dynamic simularity of sea trials and towing tanks experiments fr m fr 0 and c f 0 c f m d r for re 0 and re m respectively where c f m d r is the value taking into account dr froude number for tanker model of 8 m long fr m 0 174 i e its speed u m 1 543 m s and re m 1 235 10 7 the coefficients c f 0 1 489 10 3 and c f m 2 905 10 3 i e 100 c f m c f 0 c f m 48 7 where c f is proportional to τ w and the required reduction in frictional resistance is determined the error of this simulating method is less than 5 when measuring the total and skin friction resistances for sea trials in towing tank besides the approach can be used as a relative measurement i e for a given towing tank an injection system etc to carry out some calibration and then to use it for simulation of sea trials 4 2 1 body of rotation the results for the body of rotation with diameter 0 4 m and length 40 m are shown in fig 6 consumption of polymer solution for the case 1 is 1 5 l s for the case 2 through slots 1 2 and 3 are 1 0 4 and 0 5 l s respectively using of the only slot 1 does not provide a uniform reduction in frictional resistance along the model lenght frictional resistance reduction is higher in the fore area of the model and is lower than the required value in the after part this fact makes it difficult to meet the conditions for satisfaction of the velocity defect law that is necessary for modeling the viscous flow on reynolds numbers the injections using three slots usually gives the distribution of friction stresses along the model that is close to uniform one for pure water flow with higher re it allows one to obtain the conditions for simulating of sea trials in towing tanks using discrete injection of polymer solution 4 2 2 underwater vehicle the underwater vehicle of albacore type has the slenderness ratio equal to 7 the towing tank model of 5 8 m long is equipped with two annular slots to inject polymer additives figs 7 and 8 for the local skin friction coefficient on its surface and the total resistance c t including wave one also confirm the fact that the appointed experimental conditions concentration of polyox dr etc allows one to simulate full scale experiments with higher re in towing tanks we use the fact that polymer drag reduction 30 corresponds to the data with re that is higher on the order of magnitude the dependencies of total resistance on reynolds numbers for sea trials and towing tank experiments are close to each other at such dr with increase of re on the order of magnitude fig 7 so choosing the solution concentration and the corresponding drag reduction the accordance between the full scale and model data can be provided triangles 1 and diamonds 2 in fig 8 respond to towing tank experiments at the same reynolds number re 3 3 10 7 but data 1 are for the tests in pure water i e they demonstrate how the actual operating conditions are reproduced in the towing tank for tradition approach without polymer additives it is not in a good agreement with sea trials 3 and data 2 are for experiments with injection of polymer solution and dr 30 there is a good agreement between the results of full scale experiments 3 simulating tests 2 and the theoretical curves calculated for pure water and the corresponding reynolds numbers e g re 3 3 10 8 for the bottom curve 4 2 3 tankers we study the combined action of polymer additives and surface roughness to control the experimental parameters the experiments are carried out for the crimea and prague tanker types figs 9 and 10 for smooth and rough surfaces with and without injection of polyox solution including non uniform unsteady 3d flow around propeller fig 11 roughness gives a converse effect than polymer adititives figs 10 and 11 we simulate the flows at different reynolds numbers by varying the coefficient c f i e by increasing or decreasing it depending on the way to change c f roughness or polymer injection it also allows one to indirectly take into account some operating features by developing the corresponding empirical dependencies e g the added resistance due to actual weather conditions e g kim et al 2017 the model and tanker lengths fig 9 are 5 7 m and 295 m respectively and the boundary layer thickness for these cases are 0 1 m and 3 6 m deadweight tonnage is 150500 the rake of total head pipe to measure velocity profiles and the static pressure pickup are located close to 18th frame on ship s bottom resistance of the ship is found from measurements of propeller thrust and torque by a specific dynamometer integrated into the line of shafting froude similarity criterion is satisfied for water with and without polymer solution in towing tank sea trials are carried out for fr 0 13 0 17 the total resistance c t 3 10 3 data for the model experiments are the following fr 0 08 0 18 c t 4 25 10 3 for pure water and fr 0 16 c t 3 10 3 for injection of the polymer solution with c 6 ppm in the experiments with the model of length of 7 8 m fig 10 its speed is varied from 0 6 m s fr 0 07 re 4 10 6 to 2 1 m s fr 0 24 re 1 4 10 7 for sea trial fr 0 21 the results 1 for smooth surface in pure water and 3 for rough surface in polyox solution are close to each other in the whole interval of the studied froude numbers for both low wave resistance fr 0 175 and fr 0 24 when wave resistance reaches 60 of viscous resistance value note that longitudinal vortices can be formed in the boundary layer for some ship hull lines it also leads to a change in velocity distribution the velocity defect law is not satisfied and the dependencies of u undergo both quantitative and qualitative changes for using of the results at full scale reynolds numbers the measurements in fig 11 are made for a cross section at the ship after part for the operating froude number 0 21 here the coordinate origin is in the center of propeller disk axis y is parallel to the deck z is the vertical coordinate axis oscillatory character of u y is associated with influence of transverse pressure gradients on the flow that is more for higher viscous resistance of the hull or lower re the universality of u y as for the plane boundary layer is absent and the curves u y c t have a different form at the same values of viscous or total resistance in the actual and model conditions smooth and rough surfaces water with and without polymer solution but the velocity distributions in viscous wake are reproduced in the propeller experiments and they have a typical form for the given resistance coefficient so varying both conditions dr and roughness we obtain the coincident results as e g for the following cases the velocity profiles for sea trials at re 1 33 109 and model tests at re 5 3 106 with dr 45 and polyox solution concentration c 6 10 4 fig 9 the total resistance of the ship model with smooth surface in pure water and one with rough surface in polyox solution with c 4 5 10 4 depending on froude number fig 10 the velocity around propeller disc at the same conditions fig 11a and the location of a constant velocity in this flow fig 11b the measurement results are used to develop the foundation for the simulating methods 5 conclusion application of polymer additives allows providing the complete dynamic simularity for sea trials and towing tanks experiments simulating the full scale flows around surface and underwater vehicles under lower reynolds number conditions and simultaneously studying their viscous and wave resistances in tank tests the last one is carried out by means of the controlled change in local skin friction on the model hull using injection of polymer solutions through 2 4 slots the equality of froude numbers and dimensionless shear stresses on the surfaces of model and ship provides similar both viscous and potential flows and relieves the scale effect problem research equipment gives possibility to effectively vary the experimental conditions and to correct the trial methods and programs for reynolds numbers within three orders of magnitude 5 10 6 5 10 9 the developed approach

slot section 5 that is fast vanishing downstream the theoretical curve in fig 5 responds to the dependence for a flat plate schlichting 1955 at re l 3 4 10 9 and it is close to data 2 for polymer injection through two slots and lower reynolds number 4 2 towing tank for tests with ship models it is often enough to place 2 4 slots on the hull depending on the features of its rims and on the location of prominent parts second slot is usually placed at 1 3 of the model length placement of a slot location in the after part at area of positive pressure gradient is not effective the following features does not lead to a significant increase in the measurement inaccuracy possible non uniformity of fluid feed destruction of polymer solutions features of polymer solution jet mixing with the forward fluid flow for the case of complete simulation of ship resistance and viscous flow in the towing tank using polymer additives this error weakly differs from one for pure water and from analysis of reproducibility it is 100 i 1 ℓ c f i ℓ c f c f 1 5 we develop a procedure to make the distribution of local drag reduction close to uniform i e equidistant to one along ship length in

less than 5 when measuring the total and skin friction resistances for sea trials in towing tank besides the approach can be used as a relative measurement i e for a given towing tank an injection system etc to carry out some calibration and then to use it for simulation of sea trials 4 2 1 body of rotation the results for the body of rotation with diameter 0 4 m and length 40 m are shown in fig 6 consumption of polymer solution for the case 1 is 1 5 l s for the case 2 through slots 1 2 and 3 are 1 0 4 and 0 5 l s respectively using of the only slot 1 does not provide a uniform reduction in frictional resistance along the model lenght frictional resistance reduction is higher in the fore area of the model and is lower than the required value in the after part this fact makes it difficult to meet the conditions for satisfaction of the velocity defect law that is necessary for modeling the viscous flow on reynolds numbers the injections using three slots usually gives the distribution of friction stresses along the model that is close to uniform one for pure water flow with higher re it allows one to obtain the conditions for simulating of sea trials in towing tanks using discrete injection of polymer solution 4 2 2 underwater vehicle the underwater vehicle of albacore type has the slenderness ratio equal to 7 the towing tank model of 5 8 m long is equipped with two annular slots to inject polymer additives figs 7 and 8 for the local skin friction coefficient on its surface and the total resistance c t including wave one also confirm the fact that the appointed experimental conditions concentration of polyox dr etc allows one to simulate full scale experiments with higher re in towing tanks we use the fact that polymer drag reduction 30 corresponds to the data with re that is higher on the order of magnitude the dependencies of total resistance on reynolds numbers for sea trials and towing tank experiments are close to each other at such dr with increase of re on the order of magnitude fig 7 so choosing the solution concentration and the corresponding drag reduction the accordance between the full scale and model data can be provided triangles 1 and diamonds 2 in fig 8 respond to towing tank experiments at the same reynolds number re 3 3 10 7 but data 1 are for the tests in pure water i e they demonstrate how the actual operating

wave resistance fr 0 175 and fr 0 24 when wave resistance reaches 60 of viscous resistance value note that longitudinal vortices can be formed in the boundary layer for some ship hull lines it also leads to a change in velocity distribution the velocity defect law is not satisfied and the dependencies of u undergo both quantitative and qualitative changes for using of the results at full scale

22892,an appropriate assessment of the dynamic behavior of a ship s marine propeller shaft is essential to enable the optional power delivery to the propeller and to minimize various vibrations during the rotation as the mechanism of coupled transverse torsional vibrations for the shaft is not fully revealed which seriously affect the stability and reliability of ship s navigation an accurate and applicable numerical model for the coupled vibrations of marine propeller shaft is thus proposed to solve this problem this non linear model with ordinary differential equations is analytical calculated on the basis of high order runge kutta method experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of the proposed model through the comparison with numerical calculation over a range of rotational speeds the impact factors including eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are discussed by comparing the poincare surface of section and the influence

part of marine propulsion system the reliability of the propeller shaft is closely related to the ship s safety during navigation the ship usually subject to waves wind and other exciting forces in different forms resulting in various vibration response simultaneously andersen and jensen 2014 moreover the pulsatility of the main engine the non uniformity of propeller working area and the irregularity of the hull deformation will produce complex exciting on the shaft xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2014a hanninen et al 2014 ji and jiang 2013 excessive vibrations in torsional longitudinal and transverse modes and their coupled forms are undesirable and intensifies the vibration response of the shaft murawski 2004 and the coupled vibrations will stimulate structural vibrations of the engine and its accessories and also increase the noise level of the propulsion system in consequence these performance will lead to fatigue fracture and tribological issues partially on the shaft and even failures for the overall shaft system ultimately the navigation reliability of the ship will be significantly reduced han et al 2015 coupled vibrations including coupled torsional longitudinal and transverse vibrations of the propeller shaft as well as the coupled shaft hull vibrations is an emerging topic in the shipbuilding industry over the past decades zhang et al 2014b yang et al 2014 qu et al 2017 the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the marine propeller shaft is caused by the unbalance which includes the rotation of the propeller the mass of the shaft components the force acting on the bearing and the meshing force of the gears as the structural characteristics of the shaft and the above mentioned unbalance during the rotational process a misalignment may appear between the center of mass and the center of the cross section of the shaft oguamanam 2003 rao et al 2003 shi et al 2010 meanwhile the shaft is not always keep to horizontality with no interference in the actual operation condition the eccentric effect of the shaft can causes the vibration response to be more complicated and intense murawski 2005 in addition to vibration control techniques reducing the bearing and shaft misalignment investigations have mainly focused on the theoretical and practical methods that support the prediction of the shaft vibrations yang et al 2011 lu et al 2013 li et al 2013 therefore the minimization of vibration intensity of the marine propeller shaft has received much attention for the research the previous research focuses on individual vibration without considering the coupled interaction between each direction causing the obtained results much different from the actual measurements in order to investigate the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft investigations are conducted with more complicated models such as multi scale method average method and step by step integration method with the maturity of finite element method and the improvement of computer capability the numerical simulation with computational software has been applied in this filed zou et al 2015 jang et al 2004 wu and yang 1995 yucel and arpaci 2013 meanwhile experiments in laboratory or onboard tests that concerning shaft vibration and control have also been carried out xiang et al 2012 currently there is only a limited amount of research in the public literature focusing on the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of propeller shaft salarieh et al salarieh and ghorashi 2006 hashemi and richard 2000 establishes the coupled transverse torsional model by using the additional mass and discusses the influence of moment of inertia on the coupling effect han et al 2017 studies the dynamical abnormal increment caused by the coupling effect and proposes a protection method to avoid unstable regions as the natural frequency of transverse vibration and torsional vibration is much similar vlase et al 2017 calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the differential equations of the coupled vibrations the theoretical analysis method is thus provided however the disadvantage of abovementioned analytical and numerical analysis is that they are not flexible enough to deal with the coupled vibrations possessing complicated damping coefficient and rotational speeds simultaneously meanwhile the eccentricity of cross section and length diameter ratio of the shaft are not taken into account in previous theoretical model although these models are fundamental to describe the vibration problems they are not sufficient to describe the coupled interaction of transverse and torsional directions additionally these models contain a serious deviation caused by the assumption for the stiffness damping and other mechanical characteristics hence the most suitable method should be able to predict the dynamical performance with above impact factors and be convenient to be applied in numerical calculation in view of this a numerical model is thus proposed in the exploration of coupled transverse torsional vibrations of a ship s marine propeller shaft it is crucial to consider the abovementioned impact factors to develop a practicable tool for predicting the performance of the coupled vibrations and relative experiments with various cases are conducted to validate the proposed numerical model a feasibility study of the poincare surface of section and the transient accelerations due to the variation of rotational speeds are numerical presented based on the proposed model the impact factors including eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations is thus discussed 2 theoretical basis the marine propeller shaft is equivalent to a cantilever beam with fixed end the main engine and free end the propeller which can be modelled as an euler beam as shown in fig 1 in the schematic of the shaft the parameters ρ j l a and e denotes the density the moment of inertia the length the cross sectional area and the young s modulus respectively and the m e and i denotes the mass the eccentricity of cross section and the second axial moment of area the x t y t and θ t are the deformation angle in x transverse y transverse and torsional directions and the external excitation f x f y and m θ are the transverse force and torsional torque on the shaft in respective directions in the schematic of the eccentricity of cross section shown in the right part of fig 1 the x c and y c are the coordinate axis in x transverse and y transverse of the center of the section with the relative coordinate origin is point o c the eccentricity e is the deformation between the point o and o c the ω and α are the rotational speed and angle of the shaft the initial positions for deformation and torsional angle can be presented by the parameters x 0 y 0 and θ 0 the torsional angle is produced during the shaft rotation and the transverse deformation will be caused as the effect of the eccentricity based on the mechanics theory of geometric relationship of the cross section with eccentricity the transverse deformation x c and y c and the torsional angle φ for relative coordinate origin o c are 1 x c x e cos φ y c y e sin φ φ ω t θ where the x y and θ are the transverse deformation in x axis and y axis and the torsional angle for initial coordinate origin o respectively and the t is the time making a first and second order derivation of the transverse deformation regarding the time t the transverse velocity and acceleration can be respectively obtained 2 x c x e φ sin φ y c y e φ cos φ 3 x c x e φ sin φ e φ cos φ y c y e φ cos φ e φ sin φ where the x y and φ are the velocity of relative directions with the x y and φ are the acceleration for initial coordinate origin o the formula for torsional angle in equation 1 can be introduced into the above equations 2 and 3 to replace the φ by θ based on the motion theory for the mass center and the theory of moment caused by the eccentricity the ordinary differential equation of transverse vibration is 4 m x c c x x x 0 k x x x 0 m e θ sin φ m e ω θ 2 cos φ f x m y c c y y y 0 k y y y 0 m g m e θ cos φ m e ω θ 2 sin φ f y where the c x and c y are the damping in x and y directions with the k x and k y are the respective transverse stiffness the parameter m and g are the mass and gravity similarly the transverse response will integrate into the torsional vibration as the influence of eccentricity the equilibrium equation in torsional direction is thus established 5 j m e 2 θ c θ θ θ 0 k θ θ θ 0 m e x sin φ m e g y cos φ m θ where the j is the moment of inertia along the shaft with d denotes the diameter of the shaft the k θ and c θ are the torsional stiffness and damping respectively for the cantilever beam with circular cross section there are the following formula 6 j m d 2 2 2 combining the transverse vibration equation 4 with the torsional vibration equation 5 and assuming the initial transverse deformation x 0 y 0 0 and the torsional angle θ 0 0 the motion equations of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the marine propeller shaft can be expressed as 7 m x c x x k x x m e θ sin ω t m e ω θ 2 cos ω t f x m y c y y k y y m g m e θ cos ω t m e ω θ 2 sin ω t f y j m e 2 θ c θ θ k θ θ m e x sin ω t m e g y cos ω t m θ an interaction between transverse vibration and torsional vibration can be found from above equations the coupled equations can be derived into the matrix form as follows 8 m m e sin ω t m m e cos ω t m e sin ω t m e cos ω t j m e 2 x y θ c x c y c θ x y θ k x k y k θ x y θ m e ω θ 2 cos ω t f x m g m e ω θ 2 sin ω t f y m e g cos ω t m θ the equations show that the eccentricity of cross section is the reason and thus a key point of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations the x and y transverse vibrations are found to be independent of the torsional vibration with the case of e 0 and vice versa based on the theory of material mechanics the transverse and torsional stiffness for the cylindrical section of a cantilever beam can be respectively obtained by the deflection and the rotational angle 9 k x k y 3 e i l 3 k θ g i p l where e and g are the young s modulus and the shear modulus the i and i p are the second axial moment of area and the second polar moment of area with the following expression 10 i π d 4 64 i p π d 4 32 as the damping is related to the rotational speed of the shaft defining the transverse and torsional damping coefficients of the shaft as li and sun 2003 11 c x c y ξ x m ω c θ ξ θ j ω where the ξ x and ξ θ are the transverse and torsional damping coefficients with the value of ξ x 0 05 and ξ θ 0 08 which are considered on the basis of the mechanical properties of actual materials external excitations including transverse forces and torsional torque on the shaft are given by 12 f x f x 0 sin ω t f y f y 0 sin ω t m θ m θ 0 sin ω t these external excitations are the input of coupled vibrations in equation 8 with different amplitude and rotational speeds 3 experimental tests to verify the proposed numerical model vibrations of a ship s marine propeller shaft are experimentally measured the schematic of shaft experimental platform is shown in fig 2 which consists of propeller shaft driven by a frequency conversion motor a decelerator a thrust with support bearings foundations and a base the base is mounted on the foundation with the propeller shaft and bearings fixed on it the shaft system contains two intermediate shafts and a tail shaft with the hydraulic couplings connecting each two shafts the two intermediate shafts are supported by an intermediate bearing while the tail shaft is supported by a water lubricated stern bearing and an oil lubricated front tail bearing the diameter and length of the shaft platform is about 0 15 m and 9 6 m respectively besides it is equipped with lubrication hydraulic loading and state monitoring systems which is shown in fig 2 the maximum rotational speed of the shaft platform is designed to be 550 revolutions per minute rpm in order to minimize the experimental deviation and avoid shaft damage induced by excessive stresses the rotational speed is defined as 100 500 rpm with a step length of 100 rpm torsional detection instrument type b k 2523 and rotational speed sensor type b k mm0024 during the test process the acquisition of torsional vibration signals is achieved by utilizing a laser torsional vibration transducer torque sensor type binsfeld tt10k located near the propeller the data for transverse vibration is acquired with an acceleration sensor tri axial accelerometer sensor type b k 4535 b 001 both the laser detection instrument and the tri axial accelerometer are installed as close as possible to reduce the deviation caused by test position a multichannel signal analyzer signal acquisition type pxie 4499 including servo amplifiers a signal acquisition card and a signal output device is used to collect the data and to obtain the vibration information thus the collection of the transient response in transverse and torsional directions are simultaneously determined in the process of experiment the value of torque is obtained by the stress sensor and signal acquisition fig 2 which are installed on the exciters to monitor and control the magnitude of the torque during the shaft rationing the measured amplitude of the torque m θ and corresponding rotational speed ω during the experiments are listed in table 1 the experiments of coupled vibrations are thus conducted with above platform fig 3 illustrates the experimental transient responses of the coupled vibrations with various rotational speeds the diagrams are not regular sinusoid curves and appear slight burr because of the friction noise and other impact factors while the influence should be ignored to reduce the deviation appeared in the experiment and the transient response can be selected to present the experimental results it can be found that the experimental amplitude of each direction increases gradually with the increasing rotational speeds for the coupled vibrations with rotational speed of 100 rpm the acceleration are 0 12 m s2 0 16 m s2 and 0 43 rad s2 for x transverse y transverse and torsional direction respectively while the accelerations are ranged to 2 14 m s2 2 21 m s2 and 1 83 rad s2 when the rotational speed is 500 rpm the results show that the rotational speeds may enlarge the transient amplitude of coupled transverse torsional vibrations to some extent moreover the variation of transverse vibration is larger than that of torsional vibration in the same range of rotational speeds that means the increment of transverse vibration is 17 8 times while the torsional vibration is 5 1 times it thus indicates that the transverse vibration is more severe than the torsional direction while for the results of the x transverse and y transverse the experimental response remains unchanged in each case of various speeds without the consideration of measurement deviation comparing to the y transverse the acceleration of the x transverse is general slightly smaller with ω 100 rpm similar behavior can be found in the case of other rotational speeds 4 numerical calculation the model parameters used in the numerical calculation are selected to represent the experimental shaft platform that means the experimental shaft platform described previously will be numerical calculated in this section the modelled parameters of the shaft are summarized in table 2 and the theoretical basis of numerical model includes equations 1 12 the torque input and the corresponding rotational speed for the numerical model is defined the same as the experimental setup shown in table 1 the matlab is applied to solve the numerical model with high order runge kutta algorithm to calculate the transient response of the coupled vibrations the eccentricity of cross section is defined as 0 001 which is consistent with the shaft design the initial state of the equation is defined as x y θ t 0 0 and x y θ t 0 0 defining the solving time is 10 s till the calculation tends to be stable in this period and choose the first 5 s to present the numerical results on this basis the numerical calculation of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations are conducted the numerical transient responses for coupled vibrations over a range of rotational speeds are shown in fig 4 the diagrams show much regular sinusoid curves than the experimental results as no impact factors are considered the transient responses including x transverse y transverse and θ torsional directions respectively indicate an enlargement occurred with the increasing rotational speeds as predicted from the experiments the calculation data in x direction changes from 0 12 to 2 66 m s2 increases from 0 12 to 2 67 m s2 in y direction varies from 0 06 to 1 77 rad s2 in torsional direction for the rotational speeds from 100 to 500 rpm the transient responses show that the rotational speeds affect the vibration response with different severity it should be pointed out that the variation in both x and y directions is much obvious than that of the torsional direction which is much similar with the experiments shown in fig 3 it means that the transverse acceleration is more sensitive to speed comparing to the torsional acceleration meanwhile the acceleration of x transverse nearly keep unchanged with the data of the y transverse over a range of rotational speeds and large number of calculation proves the existence of slight dispersion in x and y directions with various speeds while for the absence of impact factors during measurement this dispersion of the numerical calculation is smaller than those of the experiments 5 comparison of experimental and numerical results to validate the numerical results a comparison between the experimental and numerical results will be conducted in this section thus the experimental results in fig 3 and numerical results in fig 4 are summarized in fig 5 it can be concluded that an enlargement of accelerations occurred with increasing rotational speeds for both experimental and numerical results and the accelerations of x transverse are slightly smaller than that of the y transverse moreover the accelerations of x transverse and y transverse of the experiments are slightly smaller than that of the calculation expect for the case of the rotational speed is 200 rpm on the contrary the experimental torsional accelerations are larger than that of the numerical model over a range of rotational speeds that means slight deviation exists between the experimental and numerical accelerations the reason is because that the experiments suffer from of the friction damping and other impact factors in comparison no additional influence factors are considered in the numerical calculation as a result there is deviation of transient responses from the actual values by measurements to investigate the deviation a relative deviation e r r o r i for each group of numerical and experimental values is thus defined the average error of a set of five rotational speeds can be written as 13 e r r o r i i 1 5 a e x p i a n u m i a e x p i where the a e x p i and a n u m i are the experimental and numerical results of the coupled vibrations the i denotes the five different rotational speeds it can be concluded that the relative deviation after comparison are 13 5 and 18 4 for x transverse and y transverse which is slightly smaller than the torsional deviation considering the assumed damping coefficient in the numerical model and the impact factors during the experimental measurement moreover the numerical accelerations are obtained from the velocity derivation which are obtained from displacement derivation in addition the shaft experimental platform is consist of three shafts but is considered as one entire shaft in the numerical model the difference including operation status acquisition method and structural characteristics will obviously lead to an enlargement for the average deviation as the confidence level of the numerical accelerations are much high with the deviations are under 20 the deviations should be accepted and the numerical model can be applied for the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft 6 discussion as the numerical model is proved to be suitable and applicable for the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft the theoretical basis indicates that the coupled vibrations are caused by the eccentricity of cross section the numerical calculation focusing on various eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are thus conducted with the proposed numerical model on this basis the vibration behavior with various model parameters are obtained and the numerical results are thus compared thus the influence of above impact factors on the coupled vibrations is investigated and determined the numerical results include poincare surface and transient response the poincare surface is to describe the axis orbit of the cross section during shaft rotation the purpose of the transient response is to predict the ultimate rotational angle and longitudinal displacement thus the dynamical responses for three specific cases regarding eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are respectively compared in this section meanwhile both the results demonstrate a slight difference between the x and y directions therefore the results of the y transverse is excluded from the investigation on the impact factors only the results of x transverse will be selected to represent both directions 6 1 effect of eccentricity of cross section the theoretical basis indicates that the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft are caused by the eccentricity of the cross section the coupled response is thus closely related to the eccentricity therefore defining the eccentricity ratio is ε e e here the e is an assumed eccentricity which the value is ε 1 0 for the initial parameters of the aforementioned numerical model therefore the influence of eccentricity ratio ε 0 5 and ε 2 0 are investigated in the numerical model a more suitable and accurate range for the eccentricity is formed for the coupled vibrations fig 6 is the comparison for the poincare surface of section of various eccentricity ratio with the rotational speed of 100 rpm it shows closed curves and indicates quasi period motions for the coupled vibrations the shape of the poincare surface is not a regular circular which proves the influence of the coupling effect the transverse poincare surface indicates an obvious variation over a range of eccentricity while the torsional response nearly keep the same with different eccentricities moreover the variation of the torsional response is basically doubled as the eccentricity ratio increased from 0 5 to 1 0 and then to 2 0 thus it can be seen that the increase for poincare surface of the coupled vibrations is multiplied as the variation of the eccentricity of cross section the comparison of the transient accelerations of the coupled vibrations with various rotational speeds are shown in fig 7 it can be found from fig 7 a that the variation of the transverse response is basically doubled as the eccentricity ratio increased for all rotational speeds which is predicted as the poincare surface while for the torsional response the coupled acceleration of various eccentricity changes slightly for each case of rotational speeds that means the eccentricity introduces a minimal effect on the torsional response of the coupled vibrations therefore it can be concluded that the eccentricity of the cross section has significant influence on the transient amplitudes of the coupled vibrations especially on the transverse response and a linear relationship between the eccentricity and the transverse acceleration can be obtained with the impact factor of linear eccentricity ratio as this case the eccentricity should be considered in the incipient design process for the shaft 6 2 effect of damping coefficients the damping coefficients defined in equation 11 is based on empirical formula and experimental measurement as the damping is indispensable during the shaft rotation and there is no detailed explanation to determine the value of damping coefficients the comparison of various coefficients based on the numerical calculation has been an effective technique for the definition defining the transverse damping ratio is μ ξ x ξ x and torsional damping ratio is ν ξ θ ξ θ with the initial damping ratio are μ 1 0 and ν 1 0 the parameters ξ x and ξ θ are the assumed transverse and torsional damping coefficients thus the ratio values of μ 10 0 and ν 10 0 are thus defined for the transverse and torsional damping coefficient respectively thus various coefficients is investigated by comparison and discussion for determining the damping influence on coupled vibrations for the case of transverse and torsional damping coefficient ratio the poincare surface of section with 100 rpm is shown in fig 8 the shape of both curves trend to be ellipses as the effect of the coupled interaction which is similar with fig 6 it can be found that the transverse damping decreases the transverse axis orbit based on the comparison between the case of μ 10 0 ν 1 0 and the case of μ 1 0 ν 1 0 shown in fig 8 a while it shows that the transverse axis orbit seems unaffected by the torsional damping from the case of μ 1 0 ν 1 0 and the case of μ 1 0 ν 10 0 in fig 8 a for the torsional poincare surface in fig 8 b the periodic motion with both kinds of damping are nearly steady statement according to the discretization of different cases it can be found that the damping affect the torsional poincare surface of the coupled vibrations much slightly fig 9 is the comparison of the transient amplitudes for the coupled vibrations with various damping coefficient ratios in the transverse response of fig 8 a the effect of transverse damping is more obvious as the red line shows which is consistent with the previous poincare surface and this disparity continues increasing as the rotational speeds increase while it is noticed from the blue and black line in fig 8 a that the transverse response seems unaffected by the torsional damping as the coupled accelerations in fig 8 b decrease with both kinds of damping coefficient ratio increases it indicates that the both kinds of damping slightly effect the torsional response over a range of rotational speeds therefore it can be concluded that both the transverse and torsional damping affect the transient amplitude for the coupled vibrations especially the transverse damping on this basis these damping effect should not be ignored before the designing of the shaft 6 3 effect of length diameter ratio as the structural dimension of the shaft is important for the vibration characteristic and control algorithms the influence of dimension parameters on the coupled vibrations is thus discussed defining the length ratio is η l l and the diameter ratio is λ d d with the length diameter ratio can be expressed by λ η the parameter l and d are the assumed length and ratio regarding the initial l and d the initial value of the dimension parameters in the aforementioned numerical model is η λ 1 0 it can be achieved to investigate the influence of length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations by changing the values of coefficient η and λ respectively the numerical results of various length diameter ratio can be thus obtained for comparison the comparison for the poincare surface of section of various length ratio with 100 rpm is shown in fig 10 as the influence of coupled interaction the shape of the poincare surface is much close to an ellipse the poincare surface in fig 10 a indicates the transverse axis orbit is nearly steady statement with obvious discreteness in each case of periodic motions for increasing shaft length while the torsional poincare surface in fig 10 b shows the effect on the motion regularity is more obvious and the disparity between two adjacent cases is more striking the linear variation of the torsional axis orbit is about the multiple of the length ratio the results in fig 11 is the comparison of the coupled results for case of diameter ratio λ 1 0 with the length ratio increases from 0 5 to 2 0 it can be found that the transverse acceleration changes slightly while the torsional results appears serious variation with increasing length ratio specifically the transverse acceleration decreases gradually with the length ratio increases from 0 5 to 1 0 and then to 2 0 the variation between the case of η 0 5 and η 1 0 is much obvious than that of η 1 0 and η 2 0 however fig 11 b indicates the torsional acceleration increases in multiplier with the increasing length ratio over a range of rotational speeds and the value of the multiplier is the ratio of the shaft length which keeps the same as fig 10 b therefore it can be concluded that the length ratio of the shaft has significant influence on the coupled vibrations and the effect on torsional response is more serious than that of the transverse direction similarly fig 12 is the poincare surface of section of various diameter ratio with 100 rpm the motion of axis orbit trends to be oblate circular because of the coupling influence as previously showed the poincare surface of fig 12 a shows the transverse behavior with diameter ratio of 0 5 and 1 0 is much close which is smaller than the case of λ 2 0 the axis orbit indicates obvious discreteness for every periodic motions as the diameter increases while the torsional motion in fig 12 b indicates a great variation for increasing diameter ratio the torsional axis orbit with the case of λ 2 0 is much larger than the case of λ 1 0 and then that of 0 5 and this increase for each case of diameter ratio is greater than multiplied relationship it proves that the diameter ratio affect the torsional poincare surface of the coupled vibrations seriously the results in fig 13 shows the comparison of the coupled vibrations for the length ratio is η 1 0 with the diameter ratio increases from λ 0 5 to λ 2 0 it can be seen that the transverse amplitude changes slightly with various diameter ratio while the variation of the torsional acceleration is obvious comparing to that of the transverse amplitude and this variation suffers severe increase which is much larger than multiple relationship with the increasing rotational speeds that means the diameter ratio affects the torsional acceleration of coupled vibration significantly the same conclusion can be found for the influence of length ratio in general the transverse acceleration of the coupled vibrations nearly keep unchanged as the length diameter ratio changed while the variation of the torsional acceleration for all the combination of different η and λ is much obvious it can be seen that the length diameter ratio has significant effect on the coupled transverse torsional vibrations and should be designed more appropriate in the consideration of shaft design 7 conclusions in this paper a numerical model for coupled transverse and torsional vibrations considering the external excitation and rotational speeds are proposed relative experiments are conducted to validate the model through a comparison of average deviation on this basis the vibration response including poincare surface and transient amplitude for x transverse y transverse and θ torsional directions are numerically calculated the axis orbits and minimal acceleration of the coupled vibrations are respectively obtained the influence of eccentricity of cross section damping coefficients and length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations are investigated in detail a more suitable range of material properties and structural dimensions for the coupled vibrations of the shaft is presented the numerical model is validated with the experimental transient results over a range of rotational speeds 100 500 rpm proving the accuracy of the proposed model applied in this paper the numerical accelerations of x transverse are nearly unchanged with that of the y transverse which is more severe than those of the torsional directions as the coupling interaction caused by the eccentricity it is therefore vital to not only consider the response along an individual direction but also to minimize the influence effect in other directions the investigation on the influence of eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are conducted based on the proposed model it is concluded that the eccentricity of the cross section has significant influence on the coupled vibrations especially on the transverse response moreover both kinds of damping affect the coupled vibrations with the effect of transverse damping is more obvious in addition the length diameter ratio affect the torsional response of coupled vibrations more seriously according to the comparison and discussion a more suitable estimation method considering the eccentricity damping and structural dimension is thus proposed for marine engineers and designers as its ability of evaluating the coupling property in future work the mass and moment inertia of the propeller which is working in the water and unsteady will be considered for the coupled vibrations of the marine propeller shaft acknowledgement this

22892,an appropriate assessment of the dynamic behavior of a ship s marine propeller shaft is essential to enable the optional power delivery to the propeller and to minimize various vibrations during

part of marine propulsion system the reliability of the propeller shaft is closely related to the ship s safety during navigation the ship usually subject to waves wind and other exciting forces in different forms resulting in various vibration response simultaneously andersen and jensen 2014 moreover the pulsatility of the main engine the non uniformity of propeller working area and the irregularity of the hull deformation will produce complex exciting on the shaft xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2014a hanninen et al 2014 ji and jiang 2013 excessive vibrations in torsional longitudinal and transverse modes and their coupled forms are undesirable and intensifies the vibration response of the shaft murawski 2004 and the coupled vibrations will stimulate structural vibrations of the engine and its accessories and also increase the noise level of the propulsion system in consequence these performance will lead to fatigue fracture and tribological issues partially on the shaft and even failures for the overall shaft system ultimately the navigation reliability of the ship will be significantly reduced han et al 2015 coupled vibrations including coupled torsional longitudinal and transverse vibrations of the propeller shaft as well as the coupled shaft hull vibrations is an emerging topic in the shipbuilding industry over the past decades zhang et al 2014b yang et al 2014 qu et al 2017 the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the marine propeller shaft is caused by the unbalance which includes the rotation of the propeller the mass of the shaft components the force acting on the bearing and the meshing force of the gears as the structural characteristics of the shaft and the above mentioned unbalance during the rotational process a misalignment may appear between the center of mass and the center of the cross section of the shaft oguamanam 2003 rao et al 2003 shi et al 2010 meanwhile the shaft is not always keep to horizontality with no interference in the actual operation condition the eccentric effect of the shaft can causes the vibration response to be more complicated and intense murawski 2005 in addition to vibration control techniques reducing the bearing and shaft misalignment investigations have mainly focused on the theoretical and practical methods that support the prediction of the shaft vibrations yang et al 2011 lu et al 2013 li et al 2013 therefore the minimization of vibration intensity of the marine propeller shaft has received much attention for the research the previous research focuses on individual vibration without considering the coupled interaction between each direction causing the obtained results much different from the actual measurements in order to investigate the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft investigations are conducted with more complicated models such as multi scale method average method and step by step integration method with the maturity of finite element method and the improvement of computer capability the numerical simulation with computational software has been applied in this filed zou et al 2015 jang et al 2004 wu and yang 1995 yucel and arpaci 2013 meanwhile experiments in laboratory or onboard tests that concerning shaft vibration and control have also been carried out xiang et al 2012 currently there is only a limited amount of research in the public literature focusing on the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of propeller shaft salarieh et al salarieh and ghorashi 2006 hashemi and richard 2000 establishes the coupled transverse torsional model by using the additional mass and discusses the influence of moment of inertia on the coupling effect han et al 2017 studies the dynamical abnormal increment caused by the coupling effect and proposes a protection method to avoid unstable regions as the natural frequency of transverse vibration and torsional vibration is much similar vlase et al 2017 calculates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the differential equations of the coupled vibrations the theoretical analysis method is thus provided however the disadvantage of abovementioned analytical and numerical analysis is that they are not flexible enough to deal with the coupled vibrations possessing complicated damping coefficient and rotational speeds simultaneously meanwhile the eccentricity of cross section and length diameter ratio of the shaft are not taken into account in previous theoretical model although these models are fundamental to describe the vibration problems they are not sufficient to describe the coupled interaction of transverse and torsional directions additionally these models contain a serious deviation caused by the assumption for the stiffness damping and other mechanical characteristics hence the most suitable method should be able to predict the dynamical performance with above impact factors and be convenient to be applied in numerical calculation in view of this a numerical model is thus proposed in the exploration of coupled transverse torsional vibrations of a ship s marine propeller shaft it is crucial to consider the abovementioned impact factors to develop a practicable tool for predicting the performance of the coupled vibrations and relative experiments with various cases are conducted to validate the proposed numerical model a feasibility study of the poincare surface of section and the transient accelerations due to the variation of rotational speeds are numerical presented based on the proposed model the impact factors including eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations is thus discussed 2 theoretical basis the marine propeller shaft is equivalent to a cantilever beam with fixed end the main engine and free end the propeller which can be modelled as an euler beam as shown in fig 1 in the schematic of the shaft the parameters ρ j l a and e denotes the density the moment of inertia the length the cross sectional area and the young s modulus respectively and the m e and i denotes the mass the eccentricity of cross section and the second axial moment of area the x t y t and θ t are the deformation angle in x transverse y transverse and torsional directions and the external excitation f x f y and m θ are the transverse force and torsional torque on the shaft in respective directions in the schematic of the eccentricity of cross section shown in the right part of fig 1 the x c and y c are the coordinate axis in x transverse and y transverse of the center of the section with the relative coordinate origin is point o c the eccentricity e is the deformation between the point o and o c the ω and α are the rotational speed and angle of the shaft the initial positions for deformation and torsional angle can be presented by the parameters x 0 y 0 and θ 0 the torsional angle is produced during the shaft rotation and the transverse deformation will be caused as the effect of the eccentricity based on the mechanics theory of geometric relationship of the cross section with eccentricity the transverse deformation x c and y c and the torsional angle φ for relative coordinate origin o c are 1 x c x e cos φ y c y e sin φ φ ω t θ where the x y and θ are the transverse deformation in x axis and y axis and the torsional angle for initial coordinate origin o respectively and the t is the time making a first and second order derivation of the transverse deformation regarding the time t the transverse velocity and acceleration can be respectively obtained 2 x c x e φ sin φ y c y e φ cos φ 3 x c x e φ sin φ e φ cos φ y c y e φ cos φ e φ sin φ where the x y and φ are the velocity of relative directions with the x y and φ are the acceleration for initial coordinate origin o the formula for torsional angle in equation 1 can be introduced into the above equations 2 and 3 to replace the φ by θ based on the motion theory for the mass center and the theory of moment caused by the eccentricity the ordinary differential equation of transverse vibration is 4 m x c c x x x 0 k x x x 0 m e θ sin φ m e ω θ 2 cos φ f x m y c c y y y 0 k y y y 0 m g m e θ cos φ m e ω θ 2 sin φ f y where the c x and c y are the damping in x and y directions with the k x and k y are the respective transverse stiffness the parameter m and g are the mass and gravity similarly the transverse response will integrate into the torsional vibration as the influence of eccentricity the equilibrium equation in torsional direction is thus established 5 j m e 2 θ c θ θ θ 0 k θ θ θ 0 m e x sin φ m e g y cos φ m θ where the j is the moment of inertia along the shaft with d denotes the diameter of the shaft the k θ and c θ are the torsional stiffness and damping respectively for the cantilever beam with circular cross section there are the following formula 6 j m d 2 2 2 combining the transverse vibration equation 4 with the torsional vibration equation 5 and assuming the initial transverse deformation x 0 y 0 0 and the torsional angle θ 0 0 the motion equations of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the marine propeller shaft can be expressed as 7 m x c x x k x x m e θ sin ω t m e ω θ 2 cos ω t f x m y c y y k y y m g m e θ cos ω t m e ω θ 2 sin ω t f y j m e 2 θ c θ θ k θ θ m e x sin ω t m e g y cos ω t m θ an interaction between transverse vibration and torsional vibration can be found from above equations the coupled equations can be derived into the matrix form as follows 8 m m e sin ω t m m e cos ω t m e sin ω t m e cos ω t j m e 2 x y θ c x c y c θ x y θ k x k y k θ x y θ m e ω θ 2 cos ω t f x m g m e ω θ 2 sin ω t f y m e g cos ω t m θ the equations show that the eccentricity of cross section is the reason and thus a key point of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations the x and y transverse vibrations are found to be independent of the torsional vibration with the case of e 0 and vice versa based on the theory of material mechanics the transverse and torsional stiffness for the cylindrical section of a cantilever beam can be respectively obtained by the deflection and the rotational angle 9 k x k y 3 e i l 3 k θ g i p l where e and g are the young s modulus and the shear modulus the i and i p are the second axial moment of area and the second polar moment of area with the following expression 10 i π d 4 64 i p π d 4 32 as the damping is related to the rotational speed of the shaft defining the transverse and torsional damping coefficients of the shaft as li and sun 2003 11 c x c y ξ x m ω c θ ξ θ j ω where the ξ x and ξ θ are the transverse and torsional damping coefficients with the value of ξ x 0 05 and ξ θ 0 08 which are considered on the basis of the mechanical properties of actual materials external excitations including transverse forces and torsional torque on the shaft are given by 12 f x f x 0 sin ω t f y f y 0 sin ω t m θ m θ 0 sin ω t these external excitations are the input of coupled vibrations in equation 8 with different amplitude and rotational speeds 3 experimental tests to verify the proposed numerical model vibrations of a ship s marine propeller shaft are experimentally measured the schematic of shaft experimental platform is shown in fig 2 which consists of propeller shaft driven by a frequency conversion motor a decelerator a thrust with support bearings foundations and a base the base is mounted on the foundation with the propeller shaft and bearings fixed on it the shaft system contains two intermediate shafts and a tail shaft with the hydraulic couplings connecting each two shafts the two intermediate shafts are supported by an intermediate bearing while the tail shaft is supported by a water lubricated stern bearing and an oil lubricated front tail bearing the diameter and length of the shaft platform is about 0 15 m and 9 6 m respectively besides it is equipped with lubrication hydraulic loading and state monitoring systems which is shown in fig 2 the maximum rotational speed of the shaft platform is designed to be 550 revolutions per minute rpm in order to minimize the experimental deviation and avoid shaft damage induced by excessive stresses the rotational speed is defined as 100 500 rpm with a step length of 100 rpm torsional detection instrument type b k 2523 and rotational speed sensor type b k mm0024 during the test process the acquisition of torsional vibration signals is achieved by utilizing a laser torsional vibration transducer torque sensor type binsfeld tt10k located near the propeller the data for transverse vibration is acquired with an acceleration sensor tri axial accelerometer sensor type b k 4535 b 001 both the laser detection instrument and the tri axial accelerometer are installed as close as possible to reduce the deviation caused by test position a multichannel signal analyzer signal acquisition type pxie 4499 including servo amplifiers a signal acquisition card and a signal output device is used to collect the data and to obtain the vibration information thus the collection of the transient response in transverse and torsional directions are simultaneously determined in the process of experiment the value of torque is obtained by the stress sensor and signal acquisition fig 2 which are installed on the exciters to monitor and control the magnitude of the torque during the shaft rationing the measured amplitude of the torque m θ and corresponding rotational speed ω during the experiments are listed in table 1 the experiments of coupled vibrations are thus conducted with above platform fig 3 illustrates the experimental transient responses of the coupled vibrations with various rotational speeds the diagrams are not regular sinusoid curves and appear slight burr because of the friction noise and other impact factors while the influence should be ignored to reduce the deviation appeared in the experiment and the transient response can be selected to present the experimental results it can be found that the experimental amplitude of each direction increases gradually with the increasing rotational speeds for the coupled vibrations with rotational speed of 100 rpm the acceleration are 0 12 m s2 0 16 m s2 and 0 43 rad s2 for x transverse y transverse and torsional direction respectively while the accelerations are ranged to 2 14 m s2 2 21 m s2 and 1 83 rad s2 when the rotational speed is 500 rpm the results show that the rotational speeds may enlarge the transient amplitude of coupled transverse torsional vibrations to some extent moreover the variation of transverse vibration is larger than that of torsional vibration in the same range of rotational speeds that means the increment of transverse vibration is 17 8 times while the torsional vibration is 5 1 times it thus indicates that the transverse vibration is more severe than the torsional direction while for the results of the x transverse and y transverse the experimental response remains unchanged in each case of various speeds without the consideration of measurement deviation comparing to the y transverse the acceleration of the x transverse is general slightly smaller with ω 100 rpm similar behavior can be found in the case of other rotational speeds 4 numerical calculation the model parameters used in the numerical calculation are selected to represent the experimental shaft platform that means the experimental shaft platform described previously will be numerical calculated in this section the modelled parameters of the shaft are summarized in table 2 and the theoretical basis of numerical model includes equations 1 12 the torque input and the corresponding rotational speed for the numerical model is defined the same as the experimental setup shown in table 1 the matlab is applied to solve the numerical model with high order runge kutta algorithm to calculate the transient response of the coupled vibrations the eccentricity of cross section is defined as 0 001 which is consistent with the shaft design the initial state of the equation is defined as x y θ t 0 0 and x y θ t 0 0 defining the solving time is 10 s till the calculation tends to be stable in this period and choose the first 5 s to present the numerical results on this basis the numerical calculation of the coupled transverse torsional vibrations are conducted the numerical transient responses for coupled vibrations over a range of rotational speeds are shown in fig 4 the diagrams show much regular sinusoid curves than the experimental results as no impact factors are considered the transient responses including x transverse y transverse and θ torsional directions respectively indicate an enlargement occurred with the increasing rotational speeds as predicted from the experiments the calculation data in x direction changes from 0 12 to 2 66 m s2 increases from 0 12 to 2 67 m s2 in y direction varies from 0 06 to 1 77 rad s2 in torsional direction for the rotational speeds from 100 to 500 rpm the transient responses show that the rotational speeds affect the vibration response with different severity it should be pointed out that the variation in both x and y directions is much obvious than that of the torsional direction which is much similar with the experiments shown in fig 3 it means that the transverse acceleration is more sensitive to speed comparing to the torsional acceleration meanwhile the acceleration of x transverse nearly keep unchanged with the data of the y transverse over a range of rotational speeds and large number of calculation proves the existence of slight dispersion in x and y directions with various speeds while for the absence of impact factors during measurement this dispersion of the numerical calculation is smaller than those of the experiments 5 comparison of experimental and numerical results to validate the numerical results a comparison between the experimental and numerical results will be conducted in this section thus the experimental results in fig 3 and numerical results in fig 4 are summarized in fig 5 it can be concluded that an enlargement of accelerations occurred with increasing rotational speeds for both experimental and numerical results and the accelerations of x transverse are slightly smaller than that of the y transverse moreover the accelerations of x transverse and y transverse of the experiments are slightly smaller than that of the calculation expect for the case of the rotational speed is 200 rpm on the contrary the experimental torsional accelerations are larger than that of the numerical model over a range of rotational speeds that means slight deviation exists between the experimental and numerical accelerations the reason is because that the experiments suffer from of the friction damping and other impact factors in comparison no additional influence factors are considered in the numerical calculation as a result there is deviation of transient responses from the actual values by measurements to investigate the deviation a relative deviation e r r o r i for each group of numerical and experimental values is thus defined the average error of a set of five rotational speeds can be written as 13 e r r o r i i 1 5 a e x p i a n u m i a e x p i where the a e x p i and a n u m i are the experimental and numerical results of the coupled vibrations the i denotes the five different rotational speeds it can be concluded that the relative deviation after comparison are 13 5 and 18 4 for x transverse and y transverse which is slightly smaller than the torsional deviation considering the assumed damping coefficient in the numerical model and the impact factors during the experimental measurement moreover the numerical accelerations are obtained from the velocity derivation which are obtained from displacement derivation in addition the shaft experimental platform is consist of three shafts but is considered as one entire shaft in the numerical model the difference including operation status acquisition method and structural characteristics will obviously lead to an enlargement for the average deviation as the confidence level of the numerical accelerations are much high with the deviations are under 20 the deviations should be accepted and the numerical model can be applied for the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft 6 discussion as the numerical model is proved to be suitable and applicable for the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft the theoretical basis indicates that the coupled vibrations are caused by the eccentricity of cross section the numerical calculation focusing on various eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are thus conducted with the proposed numerical model on this basis the vibration behavior with various model parameters are obtained and the numerical results are thus compared thus the influence of above impact factors on the coupled vibrations is investigated and determined the numerical results include poincare surface and transient response the poincare surface is to describe the axis orbit of the cross section during shaft rotation the purpose of the transient response is to predict the ultimate rotational angle and longitudinal displacement thus the dynamical responses for three specific cases regarding eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are respectively compared in this section meanwhile both the results demonstrate a slight difference between the x and y directions therefore the results of the y transverse is excluded from the investigation on the impact factors only the results of x transverse will be selected to represent both directions 6 1 effect of eccentricity of cross section the theoretical basis indicates that the coupled transverse torsional vibrations of the shaft are caused by the eccentricity of the cross section the coupled response is thus closely related to the eccentricity therefore defining the eccentricity ratio is ε e e here the e is an assumed eccentricity which the value is ε 1 0 for the initial parameters of the aforementioned numerical model therefore the influence of eccentricity ratio ε 0 5 and ε 2 0 are investigated in the numerical model a more suitable and accurate range for the eccentricity is formed for the coupled vibrations fig 6 is the comparison for the poincare surface of section of various eccentricity ratio with the rotational speed of 100 rpm it shows closed curves and indicates quasi period motions for the coupled vibrations the shape of the poincare surface is not a regular circular which proves the influence of the coupling effect the transverse poincare surface indicates an obvious variation over a range of eccentricity while the torsional response nearly keep the same with different eccentricities moreover the variation of the torsional response is basically doubled as the eccentricity ratio increased from 0 5 to 1 0 and then to 2 0 thus it can be seen that the increase for poincare surface of the coupled vibrations is multiplied as the variation of the eccentricity of cross section the comparison of the transient accelerations of the coupled vibrations with various rotational speeds are shown in fig 7 it can be found from fig 7 a that the variation of the transverse response is basically doubled as the eccentricity ratio increased for all rotational speeds which is predicted as the poincare surface while for the torsional response the coupled acceleration of various eccentricity changes slightly for each case of rotational speeds that means the eccentricity introduces a minimal effect on the torsional response of the coupled vibrations therefore it can be concluded that the eccentricity of the cross section has significant influence on the transient amplitudes of the coupled vibrations especially on the transverse response and a linear relationship between the eccentricity and the transverse acceleration can be obtained with the impact factor of linear eccentricity ratio as this case the eccentricity should be considered in the incipient design process for the shaft 6 2 effect of damping coefficients the damping coefficients defined in equation 11 is based on empirical formula and experimental measurement as the damping is indispensable during the shaft rotation and there is no detailed explanation to determine the value of damping coefficients the comparison of various coefficients based on the numerical calculation has been an effective technique for the definition defining the transverse damping ratio is μ ξ x ξ x and torsional damping ratio is ν ξ θ ξ θ with the initial damping ratio are μ 1 0 and ν 1 0 the parameters ξ x and ξ θ are the assumed transverse and torsional damping coefficients thus the ratio values of μ 10 0 and ν 10 0 are thus defined for the transverse and torsional damping coefficient respectively thus various coefficients is investigated by comparison and discussion for determining the damping influence on coupled vibrations for the case of transverse and torsional damping coefficient ratio the poincare surface of section with 100 rpm is shown in fig 8 the shape of both curves trend to be ellipses as the effect of the coupled interaction which is similar with fig 6 it can be found that the transverse damping decreases the transverse axis orbit based on the comparison between the case of μ 10 0 ν 1 0 and the case of μ 1 0 ν 1 0 shown in fig 8 a while it shows that the transverse axis orbit seems unaffected by the torsional damping from the case of μ 1 0 ν 1 0 and the case of μ 1 0 ν 10 0 in fig 8 a for the torsional poincare surface in fig 8 b the periodic motion with both kinds of damping are nearly steady statement according to the discretization of different cases it can be found that the damping affect the torsional poincare surface of the coupled vibrations much slightly fig 9 is the comparison of the transient amplitudes for the coupled vibrations with various damping coefficient ratios in the transverse response of fig 8 a the effect of transverse damping is more obvious as the red line shows which is consistent with the previous poincare surface and this disparity continues increasing as the rotational speeds increase while it is noticed from the blue and black line in fig 8 a that the transverse response seems unaffected by the torsional damping as the coupled accelerations in fig 8 b decrease with both kinds of damping coefficient ratio increases it indicates that the both kinds of damping slightly effect the torsional response over a range of rotational speeds therefore it can be concluded that both the transverse and torsional damping affect the transient amplitude for the coupled vibrations especially the transverse damping on this basis these damping effect should not be ignored before the designing of the shaft 6 3 effect of length diameter ratio as the structural dimension of the shaft is important for the vibration characteristic and control algorithms the influence of dimension parameters on the coupled vibrations is thus discussed defining the length ratio is η l l and the diameter ratio is λ d d with the length diameter ratio can be expressed by λ η the parameter l and d are the assumed length and ratio regarding the initial l and d the initial value of the dimension parameters in the aforementioned numerical model is η λ 1 0 it can be achieved to investigate the influence of length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations by changing the values of coefficient η and λ respectively the numerical results of various length diameter ratio can be thus obtained for comparison the comparison for the poincare surface of section of various length ratio with 100 rpm is shown in fig 10 as the influence of coupled interaction the shape of the poincare surface is much close to an ellipse the poincare surface in fig 10 a indicates the transverse axis orbit is nearly steady statement with obvious discreteness in each case of periodic motions for increasing shaft length while the torsional poincare surface in fig 10 b shows the effect on the motion regularity is more obvious and the disparity between two adjacent cases is more striking the linear variation of the torsional axis orbit is about the multiple of the length ratio the results in fig 11 is the comparison of the coupled results for case of diameter ratio λ 1 0 with the length ratio increases from 0 5 to 2 0 it can be found that the transverse acceleration changes slightly while the torsional results appears serious variation with increasing length ratio specifically the transverse acceleration decreases gradually with the length ratio increases from 0 5 to 1 0 and then to 2 0 the variation between the case of η 0 5 and η 1 0 is much obvious than that of η 1 0 and η 2 0 however fig 11 b indicates the torsional acceleration increases in multiplier with the increasing length ratio over a range of rotational speeds and the value of the multiplier is the ratio of the shaft length which keeps the same as fig 10 b therefore it can be concluded that the length ratio of the shaft has significant influence on the coupled vibrations and the effect on torsional response is more serious than that of the transverse direction similarly fig 12 is the poincare surface of section of various diameter ratio with 100 rpm the motion of axis orbit trends to be oblate circular because of the coupling influence as previously showed the poincare surface of fig 12 a shows the transverse behavior with diameter ratio of 0 5 and 1 0 is much close which is smaller than the case of λ 2 0 the axis orbit indicates obvious discreteness for every periodic motions as the diameter increases while the torsional motion in fig 12 b indicates a great variation for increasing diameter ratio the torsional axis orbit with the case of λ 2 0 is much larger than the case of λ 1 0 and then that of 0 5 and this increase for each case of diameter ratio is greater than multiplied relationship it proves that the diameter ratio affect the torsional poincare surface of the coupled vibrations seriously the results in fig 13 shows the comparison of the coupled vibrations for the length ratio is η 1 0 with the diameter ratio increases from λ 0 5 to λ 2 0 it can be seen that the transverse amplitude changes slightly with various diameter ratio while the variation of the torsional acceleration is obvious comparing to that of the transverse amplitude and this variation suffers severe increase which is much larger than multiple relationship with the increasing rotational speeds that means the diameter ratio affects the torsional acceleration of coupled vibration significantly the same conclusion can be found for the influence of length ratio in general the transverse acceleration of the coupled vibrations nearly keep unchanged as the length diameter ratio changed while the variation of the torsional acceleration for all the combination of different η and λ is much obvious it can be seen that the length diameter ratio has significant effect on the coupled transverse torsional vibrations and should be designed more appropriate in the consideration of shaft design 7 conclusions in this paper a numerical model for coupled transverse and torsional vibrations considering the external excitation and rotational speeds are proposed relative experiments are conducted to validate the model through a comparison of average deviation on this basis the vibration response including poincare surface and transient amplitude for x transverse y transverse and θ torsional directions are numerically calculated the axis orbits and minimal acceleration of the coupled vibrations are respectively obtained the influence of eccentricity of cross section damping coefficients and length diameter ratio on the coupled vibrations are investigated in detail a more suitable range of material properties and structural dimensions for the coupled vibrations of the shaft is presented the numerical model is validated with the experimental transient results over a range of rotational speeds 100 500 rpm proving the accuracy of the proposed model applied in this paper the numerical accelerations of x transverse are nearly unchanged with that of the y transverse which is more severe than those of the torsional directions as the coupling interaction caused by the eccentricity it is therefore vital to not only consider the response along an individual direction but also to minimize the influence effect in other directions the investigation on the influence of eccentricity of cross section damping coefficient and length diameter ratio are conducted based on the proposed model it is concluded that the eccentricity of the cross section has significant influence on the coupled vibrations especially on the transverse response moreover both kinds of damping affect the coupled vibrations with the effect of transverse damping is more obvious in addition the length diameter ratio affect the torsional response of coupled vibrations more seriously according to the comparison and discussion a more suitable estimation method considering the eccentricity damping and structural dimension is thus proposed for marine engineers and designers as its ability of evaluating the coupling property in future work the mass and moment inertia of the propeller which is working in the water and unsteady will be considered for the coupled vibrations of the marine propeller shaft acknowledgement this

oscillatory displacement of the hull surface due to wave induced motions 1 introduction ocean going ships are subject to wave induced added resistance in severe sea states the wave added resistances may even account for a considerable part of total ship resistance accurate prediction of wave added resistance is helpful in the ship design stage not only to select the ships engine propulsion system but also to determine the economic service speed under different sea conditions moreover to improve the energy efficiency of ships and to reduce carbon emissions it became mandatory for all new ships built after january 1st 2013 to comply with the energy efficiency design index eedi issued by of the international maritime organization an accurate prediction of wave added resistance is of great importance to correctly estimate this index conventional methods to predict wave added resistance comprise model tests numerical calculations and empirical methods the results of model tests are considered reliable however physical tests are costly and therefore the number of test runs has to be limited meanwhile the accurate measurement of the added resistance in short waves is challenging due to the sensitivity of the experimental setup and the uncertainties in the measured data hizir et al 2019 several model test researches published their results for example journée 1992 provided the added resistance for four different types of wigley hulls sadat hosseini et al 2013 conducted model tests for the kvlcc2 tanker under surge free and fixed conditions kashiwagi 2013 made a comparison between the values of the added resistance by the direct measurement using a dynamometer and by the unsteady wave analysis method valanto and hong 2015 reported the measured wave added resistance for a cruise ship at different wave encounter angles sprenger et al 2017 presented model test data for the kvlcc2 tanker and the dtc containership lee et al 2017 experimentally investigated the added resistance of the kvlcc2 hull forms with different bow shapes numerical prediction of the wave added resistance is typically carried out based on potential flow theory when the velocity potential and the wave induced ship motions are determined there are generally two methods to compute wave added resistance namely the near field method and the far field method the near field method computes added resistance by averaging the second order terms of the integrated wave pressure on the wetted hull havelock 1942 conducted pioneering work by considering the undisturbed pressure of the incident wave integrated over the wetted part of the oscillating ship s hull faltinsen et al 1980 established a more accurate near field pressure integration approach the far field method was introduced by maruo 1960 he formulated the drift forces by applying the momentum theorem on a control surface which is far away from the floating body newman 1967 extended maruo s theory and given analytical equations for the drifting forces and moments on a slender ship another extension of maruo s method is developed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 who obtained added wave resistance by equalizing the energy of radiation waves with the work done by average added resistance in an encounter period in the above classical contributions the velocity potentials are computed based on strip theory or semi analytical solutions recently however numerical studies of wave added resistance based on three dimensional potential solutions have become popular joncquez 2009 used a time domain rankine panel method to obtain the linearized potential and computed the wave added resistance using the near field and far field method also using a time domain rankine panel method kim and kim 2011 calculated wave added resistance of several kinds of ships and discussed the added resistance in irregular waves liu et al 2011 utilized a three dimensional panel method employing different kinds of green functions to solve the boundary value problem they then computed the wave added resistance using maruo s far field approach söding et al 2014 computed the wave added resistance via a frequency domain rankine panel method that accounts for the dynamic squat of the ship and the effects of the nonlinear steady flow caused by the ship s forward speed hong et al 2016 calculated the wave added resistance of a wigley hull and the s 175 containership based on a three dimensional translating and pulsating source panel method rapid development of computational techniques in recent years led to the increasing application of cfd tools for numerical studies of wave added resistance el moctar et al 2017 ozdemir and barlas 2017 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 presented results of wave added resistance by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations yang et al 2015 carried out added resistance calculations using a cartesian grid method based euler equation solver besides several studies comparing results from cfd and potential theory calculations have been conducted for instance by seo et al 2013 lyu and el moctar 2017 and kim et al 2017 compared to potential flow methods cfd approaches in principle provide a more accurate description of the physical phenomena however predicting wave added resistance based on cfd is still considered to be in the stage of academic research rather than engineering practice on one hand these computations require large computational resources and long cpu times on the other hand the setup of the computations in cfd tools takes skill i e only an experienced user is able to obtain reliable results by analyzing the results of the shopera international benchmark study of numerical methods for the prediction of time average wave induced steady forces shigunov et al 2018 demonstrated the 3d panel methods performed well in the added resistance predictions for most of the cases rans methods shown their potential but frequently delivered erratic results for potential flow and cfd approaches predicting the added resistance in short waves is a challenging problem potential theory methods may not be able to estimate added resistance accurately in short waves this is due to the omission of viscous effects and the inadequate consideration of the associated nonlinearity the major obstacle of cfd approaches is that fine grids are needed to resolve short wave patterns accurately which increases significantly the computational time to improve the prediction of the added resistance in short wave cases semi empirical corrections are usually employed in conjunction with numerical results yang et al 2018 and riesner and el moctar 2018 documented their latest correction schemes liu and papanikolaou 2016a proposed a practical semi empirical formula which can evaluated the added resistance for the ships heading in long or short waves it should be mentioned that most of the existing numerical studies on wave added resistance focus on the cases of the ship in head waves however several experimental studies eg valanto and hong 2015 sprenger et al 2017 showed that the wave encountering angles have also effects on added resistance in recent years some numerical research dedicated to predict the added resistance for the ship in oblique waves were also reported for example liu and papanikolaou 2016b extended the far field method to predict the added resistance of ships in oblique waves zhan and kuang 2018 conducted numerical simulation of added resistance in head and oblique waves using the cfd tool openfoam nevertheless prediction of the wave added resistance in head wave is still considered essential for investigating the ship s performance in waves we developed computer code based on a time domain rankine panel method and carried out numerical computations of wave added resistance basically we used a numerical method similar to the those of joncquez 2009 and kim and kim 2011 however we introduced particular numerical approaches not addressed previously our numerical results showed that these approaches were important to accurately predict wave added resistance we conducted our added resistance computations for a wigley hull the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker in head waves we tested the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization and compared the computed added resistance in short and long waves against available experimental measurements and existing numerical results moreover we investigated the separate contributions of added resistance due to radiation and diffraction and compared our predictions to the existing cfd results 2 mathematical background 2 1 boundary value problem let us consider a ship travelling in regular waves at constant forward speed u u 0 0 0 the water depth is assumed to be infinite and the hull is assumed rigid a mean body fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz see fig 1 is used to describe the

velocity potential φ i x t is the incident wave potential ζ i x y t is the incident wave elevation φ x t and ζ x y t denote the disturbed velocity potential and the related wave elevation respectively the basis potential is assumed to be the main component of order of o 1 while the other parts are an order of magnitude smaller than φ 0 x and of order of o ε here ε is of the order of magnitude of a l where a and l are the wave amplitude and the length of the ship it is assumed that ε is much smaller than 1 we consider linear incoming waves for the infinite water depth the incident wave potential

water and ω e is the wave encounter frequency defined as 8 ω e ω 0 u 0 ω 0 2 g cos χ there are two commonly used linearization schemes namely the double body db linearization and neumann kelvin nk linearization using the double body potential and the uniform incident flow potential respectively as basis potential for the double body linearization scheme the basis potential is further divided as follows 9 φ 0 u 0 x φ here φ is determined by the following boundary conditions 10 φ n u n on s φ z 0 on z 0 where s is the mean wetted hull surface applying taylor expansions for the wave elevation about the clam water plane and the small wave induced motions about the mean wetted hull surface and neglecting terms of order higher than o ε we obtain the linearized bvp for φ x t as follows 11 t u

called m terms newman 1979 which can be evaluated using the basis flow 13 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ m 4 m 5 m 6 n x u φ the linearization of the neumann kelvin bvp is similar to 11 except that the potential φ is simply set to zero correspondingly the m terms are simplified as m 1 m 2 m 3 0 m 4 m 5 m 6 n u 2 2 first order wave forces and wave induced ship motions once the disturbed potential is determined

simultaneously using m 1 m 2 and m 3 respectively 3 3 temporal integration of the equations of motion at each time step after solving the boundary value problem and computing the resulting generalized first order force vector f j the equation of ship motions 15 is reduced to a set of second order ordinary differential equations odes with constant coefficients these equations are rearranged as

odes using a fourth order runge kutta scheme to obtain starting values 3 4 numerical approaches three additional numerical approaches are used and they significantly influence the wave added resistance prediction 3 4 1 the water line integral as the wetted hull surface is discretized by plane quadrilateral panels the water line of the ship is discretized by line segments correspondingly the integrand of the water line integral 17 is calculated at the midpoint of each segment and the integral over the segment is computed using the rectangle rule because the water line is the intersection of the hull surface and free surface the wave elevations caused by the disturbed potential may be determined using the free surface data or the hull surface data for the former wave elevations at the water line are computed using coefficients ζ j t for the latter the wave elevations are estimated by substituting the disturbed potential on the edge of the hull into the linearized kinematic free surface boundary condition i e the second equation of 11 a comparison between the results of different methods is provided in section 5 3 of this paper 3 4 2 the boundary end condition as shown in fig 2 the b spline basis function spans over three panels to complete the spline representation 21 an additional strip of artificial panels must be included at each side of a panel sheet a problem associated with these artificial panels is that the number of unknowns or equivalently the number of collocation equations exceeds the number of grid panels this problem is solved by imposing some boundary end conditions at each edge and corner of the panel sheet although specifying the boundary end conditions is a purely numerical issue we found that different choices of the end conditions yielded significantly different second order wave forces details will be discussed in section 5 4 of this paper 3 4 3 the second order derivative of the disturbed potential the last term of 17 contains second order derivations of the disturbed potential in practice we tried to differentiate the b spline basis twice to compute the second derivations but the results contained obvious numerical errors and the miscomputed second derivatives decrease the precision of the added resistance computation significantly to solve this problem we simply set the second derivatives of the disturbed potential zero it is certain that neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential also causes error however numerical results demonstrated this error is much smaller than the one introduced by the miscomputed second derivatives details are provided in section 5 5 4 test cases based on the above we developed a computer code and performed numerical tests for the wigley i hull journée 1992 the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker the wigley i hull and s 175 containership are slender ships whereas the kvlcc2 tanker is a blunt hull the purpose of these computations was to validate the developed code for the added resistance predictions of different kinds of ships figs 3 5 show lines of the wigley i hull the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker respectively and table 1 lists their principal particulars 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical setup fig 6 illustrates the typical panel arrangements of the investigated ships in each figure the upper graph shows the panels idealizing half of the free surface and half of the hull the zoomed in lower graphs the panels idealizing one half of the hulls for each ship grid convergence checks were conducted before starting systemic computations numerical results show that a computational domain on the free surface extending 1 5l in the y direction 0 5l upstream and 1 2l downstream was enough to obtain convergence depending on hull shape and wave length the number of panels idealizing each half hull ranged from 300 to 600 typical computational domain consists less than 3000 panels all the calculations are carried out on a personal computer with intel i5 7300 2 5 ghz processor for each encounter frequency we performed the simulation of ten encounter periods with common time step size of δ t 0 02 s the computational time for each encounter frequency is less than 30 min to validate our numerical procedure we first employed the double body db linearization for the wigley hull then we tested the db and the neumann kelvin nk linearization for the s 175 container ship and the kvlcc2 tanker to demonstrate effects of different linearization schemes to simplify the problem the first order surge motion of the ships was assumed fixed 5 2 convergence study for the wigley i hull for the wigley i hull we conducted convergence studies for the ship in regular head waves of wave length to ship length ratio λ l 1 0 advancing at constant forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 2 convergence was tested for temporal and spatial discretizations and for computational domain sizes of the free surface fig 7 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force obtained on the three different grids see table 2 with a common time step size of δ t 0 02 s as seen the force history obtained on the coarsest grid a differs slightly from the forces histories obtained on the medium grid b and fine grid c whereas the forces histories obtained on the medium grid b and fine grid c nearly coincide with each other fig 8 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force obtained on the medium grid b using three different time steps of δt 0 010s 0 015s and 0 020s the favorable agreement of the resulting time histories demonstrated adequate temporal convergence fig 9 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force again obtained on the medium grid b but of different sized free surface domains see table 3 the favorable agreement of the resulting time histories demonstrated that on the medium grid b the size of the free surface domain b was adequately large to ensure convergence we chose grid fineness and computational domain size according to the above convergence study in short waves of λ l 0 5 we conducted a further check after each simulation to insure mesh independence of the predicted added resistance small spikes characterized the force histories plotted in figs 7 9 these spikes were caused by the application of a numerical filter the purpose of this filter firstly introduced by nakos et al 1993 was to remove small waves induced by numerical errors here we decided to filter the free surface elevations after every 20 time steps although applying the filter had little effect on the resulting added resistance this was necessary to ensure numerical stability of our time domain simulations 5 3 methods to compute the water line integral to accurately compute the water line integral the wave elevation had to be correctly estimated as mentioned above the wave elevation caused by the disturbed potential may be determined using either free surface data or hull data we compared wave the elevation and the water line integral based on these two data sets and again we selected the wigley i hull advancing in head waves of λ l 1 0 at fn 0 2 fig 10 shows four graphs of comparative wave elevations corresponding to times t 7 00s 7 25s 7 50s and 7 75s computed using the hull data and the free surface data the time differences between each of these graphs generally equaled one quarter wave encounter period the abscissa in these graphs identifies the normalized x coordinate at the hull s waterline the ordinate the normalized wave elevation ζ w l a caused by the disturbed potential as seen discrepancies between the two sets of wave elevation wer not remarkable fig 11 plots the comparative water line integral obtained using the hull data and free surface data the resulting values were almost identical we chose the free surface data to compute the water line integral for our subsequent computations numerical results demonstrated that this provided stable results for all subsequent test cases 5 4 effect of the boundary end condition on the wave added resistance for the wigley i hull fig 12 plots computed time histories of heave and pitch motions for the wigley i hull in waves of λ l 1 1 at fn 0 2 the steady part of the computed motions was represented as follows 32 ξ i ξ i cos ω e t ε i i 3 5 where indices i 3 and 5 refer to heave and pitch respectively the resulting amplitudes ξ i and phase angles ε i represent the response amplitude operator rao and the phase lag between incident wave and wave induced motion respectively for the wigley i hull in regular head waves with normalized amplitude of a l 0 01 fig 13 plots time histories of our computed longitudinal first and second order wave forces the upper graph a directly compares these two force components over the normalized time region of 0 t g l 1 2 35 as seen the second order wave force oscillated at twice the frequency of the first order force to display the mean second order wave force the lower graph b plots expanded time histories of these two force components over the smaller normalized time region of 25 5 t g l 1 2 31 0 the mean value of this second order wave force was considered the wave added resistance we carried out numerical computations in the region of incident wave length ratios of 0 5 λ l 2 0 at two forward speeds corresponding to fn 0 2 and 0 3 fig 14 plots the resulting heave and pitch raos and their phase angles and fig 15 the associated wave added resistance to illustrate effects of boundary end conditions ec we included in figs 14 and 15 numerical results based on two kinds of end condition the first kind is referred to as the zero end condition zero ec where the unknowns on the artificial panels are simply set to zero the second kind is the so called natural end condition natural ec where the second derivatives of the spline are zero at each edge and corner of the panel sheet symbol exp in figs 14 and 15 denotes experimental measurements of journée 1992 symbols natural ec and zero ec our numerical predictions based on the natural and the zero end condition respectively from fig 14 we see that the motion raos and their phase angles based on the two kinds of end conditions differ only modestly from each other and that they compared favorably to experimental measurements for the wave added resistance however remarkable discrepancies were noticed between results based on different end conditions as seen in fig 15 wave added resistance based on of the natural ec end condition correlated relatively well to experimental data but the agreement between results based on the zero ec end condition and the experimental measurements was poor fig 16 plots computed partial derivatives of the disturbed potential against the ship s normalized length coordinate x l for the wigley i hull advancing in regular head waves of λ l 1 25 at fn 0 2 these derivatives referred to the top row of the collocation points on the hull at time t 5 5s as seen the zero ec produces an obvious jump of the derivative for the collocation points located near the stern x l 0 5 this jump is inconsistent with the physical phenomenon because the wave added resistance is so sensitive to the derivatives of the potential at stern and bow the local miscomputations of the derivatives will result in remarkable numerical errors of the final result after also testing other end condition we decided to adopt the natural ec end condition for our subsequent computations 5 5 the second derivative of the disturbed potential fig 17 plots our computed second derivatives of the disturbed potential dp here based on the natural ec end condition against the ship s normalized length coordinate x l these derivatives are still referred to the top row of the collocation points on the hull at time t 5 5s by comparing figs 16 and 17 it could be found the first derivatives show smooth variation along the x direction while the second derivative show obvious oscillation considering the wigley hull is simple and of small curvature we think the computed second derivatives may contain remarkable numerical errors and cannot reflect the physics phenomena correctly fig 18 plots our computed values of added resistance raw obtained by considering and neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential the experimentally measured values of journée 1992 marked exp are also included in fig 18 symbol dp is the abbreviation of disturbed potential as seen neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential led to a more favorable agreement to experimental measurements the erroneous second derivatives yielded underestimated peak values of added resistance particularly for fn 0 3 this was because the second derivative was multiplied by ship speed in the equation of the second order wave forces and this higher ship speed acted as an error amplifier thus the second derivatives could not be reliably computed by differentiating the b spline basis function for our subsequent computations therefore we decided to set the second derivatives of the disturbed potential to zero 5 6 wave added resistance for the s 175 containership we selected the s 175 container ship for our second computational example we considered the ship in regular head waves of lengths 0 5 λ l 2 0 at the three forward speeds of fn 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 fig 19 plots our predictions together with comparative experimental measurements of fujii and takahashi 1975 and numerical results of kim and kim 2011 symbol exp marks the experiment data symbols rpm db and rpm nk the predictions of kim and kim 2011 and symbols db and nk our predictions based on the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization respectively our predictions based on the double body linearization present db correlated more favorably to experimental measurements than our predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization present nk for all three ship speeds in resonant wave lengths of 1 0 λ l 1 3 our predicted added resistances based on the double body linearization present db were close to experimental measurements for fn 0 25 and fn 0 3 differences between our computed peak values based on the db linearization and the experimental data were modest most likely these relatively small discrepancies occurred by neglecting the nonlinearity of the physical problem at fn 0 2 and 0 25 our peak values based on the nk linearization exceeded those based on the db linearization however the associated shift of the resonant wave lengths probably caused the agreement between the results based on the nk linearization and the experimental data to be less favorable for fn 0 3 our predicted peak value based on the nk linearization was underestimated although the shift of the resonant wavelength remained 5 7 motions and wave added resistance for the kvlcc2 tanker to validate our developed method for a ship in relatively short waves we evaluated wave added resistance of the kvlcc2 tanker in regular incident waves of lengths 0 3 λ l 2 0 at a forward speed of fn 0 142 fig 20 plots heave and pitch raos and fig 21 the associated wave added resistance both against wave length to ship length ratio λ l symbol exp denotes experimental measurements of riesner and el moctar 2018 and lee et al 2017 symbol gl rankine numerical predictions obtained using software gl rankine symbol cfd numerical cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 and symbols present db and present nk our predictions based on the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization respectively fig 20 left shows that our heave predictions based on the double body linearization present db correlated favorably to experimental measurements our predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization present nk are close to the predictions obtained using software gl rankine however the peak of the present nk predictions was overestimated by about 20 compared to the experimental measurements fig 20 right shows that all pitch predictions generally correlated favorably to each other but they deviated from measurements in longer waves wave added resistance in fig 21 shows that our predictions based on the double body linearization present db generally captured the variation of the wave added resistance in the region of 0 9 λ l 2 0 although the peak value was slightly lower than experimental measurements and the cfd result it is seen that differences between predictions based on the db linearization and the nk linearization were significant this discrepancy was partly due to the overestimated wave induced heave motion based on the nk linearization shown in fig 20 however the relatively inaccurate prediction of the wave elevation at the ship s waterline probably had a greater effect the blunt hull of the kvlcc2 tanker disturbed the velocities induced by the double body flow to a considerable extent at the ship bow and stern and the nk linearization neglected these velocities thereby decreasing the accuracy of local wave height predictions such errors were further increased because the water line integral of the second order wave forces depended on wave height squared in moderate and short waves λ l 0 8 our predictions based on the double body linearization present db agreed less favorably to experimental data considering that viscous effects were significant when computing wave added resistance in short waves we corrected these computations according to the method of riesner and el moctar 2018 as follows 33 r v i s c r a w 1 f v i s c ω where r v i s c is added resistance that accounts for also the viscous effects and f v i s c ω is the correction coefficient expressed as follows 34 f v i s c 0 4 c b 1 67 e 5 8 λ l fig 22 plots the corrected wave added resistance against wave length to ship length ratio λ l again symbol exp denotes experimental measurements of riesner and el moctar 2018 and lee et al 2017 symbol gl rankine numerical predictions obtained using software gl rankine symbol cfd numerical cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 and symbols present db our predictions based on the double body linearization as seen our corrected added resistances still deviated considerably from experimental measurements we attributed these discrepancies to the following aspects in short waves wave reflection at the ship s bow was relatively strong as our method relied on a purely linear approach it was difficult to capture such a phenomenon refining the panels near the ship bow could have led to more accurate predictions however numerical tests showed that a high density panel discretization produced large numerical errors causing the solution to diverge a cfd approach seems necessary to improve the evaluation of wave added resistance in short waves fig 19 shows that wave induced motions were relatively small in short waves λ l 0 8 hence cfd computations without considering the ship s motion should suffice to provide accurate results 5 8 interaction of radiation and diffraction in contrast to traditional methods our method did not require separating the disturbed potential into a radiation and a diffraction potential however it was still meaningful to examine the effects of ship motions and wave diffraction on wave added resistance to this end we performed three separate computations for the kvlcc2 tanker and compared our results to those of sigmund and el moctar 2018 first we computed total added resistance in waves second we determined added resistance of the fixed ship advancing at constant forward speed in head waves diffraction third we obtained added resistance of the moving ship advancing in calm water by prescribing the computed motions obtained in the first step radiation fig 23 plots our computed results against wave length to ship length ratio λ l comprising total wave added resistance our separately computed added resistances due to radiation and diffraction and the corresponding cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 symbols present total present radiation and present diffraction denote our predictions of total radiation induced and diffraction induced added resistance respectively and symbols cfd total cfd radiation and cfd diffraction stand for the corresponding predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 as seen added resistance due to diffraction depended only moderately on wave length while added resistance due to radiation varied with increasing wave length in short waves λ l 0 8 the radiation part of added resistance was nearly zero in long waves λ l 1 0 it became significant as expected the peak value of the radiation part of added resistance occurred at about λ l 1 4 that is in wave lengths that generally correspond to the resonant wavelength of heave and pitch motions our predictions differed from cfd results especially for the diffraction part of added resistance this was likely due to the fact that our method neglected nonlinear viscous effects nevertheless our predictions and the comparable cfd results showed similar trends indicating that the sum of radiation and diffraction forces was equal to total resistance only in short waves in long waves the interaction between radiation and diffraction had a large effect on the total resistance and therefore should not be neglected 6 conclusions to predict wave added resistance for ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves we developed a computer code based on a time domain rankine panel method the quadratic b spline basis function represented the unknowns on the discretized flow filed boundaries and an euler scheme approximated the temporal derivative for the free surface conditions after solving the velocity potential and the wave induced motions at each time step we computed the second order wave forces using a near field pressure integration we considered the mean value of the longitudinal directional second order wave force as the wave added resistance employing the b spline required specifying spline end condition we conducted numerical computations and found that various spline end conditions led to significant difference of added resistance predictions we finally decided to use the natural spline end condition moreover although the b spline basis functions could be differentiated twice numerical results showed that the computed second derivatives were prone to large numerical errors we neglected the second derivatives of the disturbed potential in our added resistance computations computations for the s 175 containership and the kvlcc 2 tanker demonstrated that in long waves our predictions based on the double body linearization agreed satisfactorily to comparative experimental measurements whereas in shorter waves our results differed somewhat from experimental data this was due to the effects of viscosity and nonlinearities which were more pronounced in short waves as our method neglected these effects we employed an empirical correction formula to account for viscous effects and thus to ensure the accuracy of our predictions we tested two well known linearization schemes namely the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization and found that predictions based on the former scheme consistently yielded more favorable results compared to experimental measurements than results based on the neumann kelvin linearization particularly for the kvlcc2 tanker with its blunt hull predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization showed remarkable discrepancies against predictions based on the double body linearization and also against comparative experimental measurements finally for the kvlcc2 tanker we separately computed wave added resistance due to radiation and diffraction comparing our predictions to available cfd simulations revealed that in long waves the interaction between radiation and diffraction should not be neglected because it had a large influence on total resistance in short waves the diffraction part dominated total added resistance because these short waves induced nearly no ship motions acknowledgements this study was supported by

oscillatory displacement of the hull surface due to wave induced motions 1 introduction ocean going ships are subject to wave induced added resistance in severe sea states the wave added resistances may even account for a considerable part of total ship resistance accurate prediction of wave added resistance is helpful in the ship design stage not only to select the ships engine propulsion system but also to determine the economic service speed under different sea conditions moreover to improve the energy efficiency of ships and to reduce carbon emissions it became mandatory for all new ships built after january 1st 2013 to comply with the energy efficiency design index eedi issued by of the international maritime organization an accurate prediction of wave added resistance is of great importance to correctly estimate this index conventional methods to predict wave added resistance comprise model tests numerical calculations and empirical methods the results of model tests are considered reliable however physical tests are costly and therefore the number of test runs has to be limited meanwhile the accurate measurement of the added resistance in short waves is challenging due to the sensitivity of the experimental setup and the uncertainties in the measured data hizir et al 2019 several model test researches published their results for example journée 1992 provided the added resistance for four different types of wigley hulls sadat hosseini et al 2013 conducted model tests for the kvlcc2 tanker under surge free and fixed conditions kashiwagi 2013 made a comparison between the values of the added resistance by the direct measurement using a dynamometer and by the unsteady wave analysis method valanto and hong 2015 reported the measured wave added resistance for a cruise ship at different wave encounter angles sprenger et al 2017 presented model test data for the kvlcc2 tanker and the dtc containership lee et al 2017 experimentally investigated the added resistance of the kvlcc2 hull forms with different bow shapes numerical prediction of the wave added resistance is typically carried out based on potential flow theory when the velocity potential and the wave induced ship motions are determined there are generally two methods to compute wave added resistance namely the near field method and the far field method the near field method computes added resistance by averaging the second order terms of the integrated wave pressure on the wetted hull havelock 1942 conducted pioneering work by considering the undisturbed pressure of the incident wave integrated over the wetted part of the oscillating ship s hull faltinsen et al 1980 established a more accurate near field pressure integration approach the far field method was introduced by maruo 1960 he formulated the drift forces by applying the momentum theorem on a control surface which is far away from the floating body newman 1967 extended maruo s theory and given analytical equations for the drifting forces and moments on a slender ship another extension of maruo s method is developed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 who obtained added wave resistance by equalizing the energy of radiation waves with the work done by average added resistance in an encounter period in the above classical contributions the velocity potentials are computed based on strip theory or semi analytical solutions recently however numerical studies of wave added resistance based on three dimensional potential solutions have become popular joncquez 2009 used a time domain rankine panel method to obtain the linearized potential and computed the wave added resistance using the near field and far field method also using a time domain rankine panel method kim and kim 2011 calculated wave added resistance of several kinds of ships and discussed the added resistance in irregular waves liu et al 2011 utilized a three dimensional panel method employing different kinds of green functions to solve the boundary value problem they then computed the wave added resistance using maruo s far field approach söding et al 2014 computed the wave added resistance via a frequency domain rankine panel method that accounts for the dynamic squat of the ship and the effects of the nonlinear steady flow caused by the ship s forward speed hong et al 2016 calculated the wave added resistance of a wigley hull and the s 175 containership based on a three dimensional translating and pulsating source panel method rapid development of computational techniques in recent years led to the increasing application of cfd tools for numerical studies of wave added resistance el moctar et al 2017 ozdemir and barlas 2017 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 presented results of wave added resistance by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations yang et al 2015 carried out added resistance calculations using a cartesian grid method based euler equation solver besides several studies comparing results from cfd and potential theory calculations have been conducted for instance by seo et al 2013 lyu and el moctar 2017 and kim et al 2017 compared to potential flow methods cfd approaches in principle provide a more accurate description of the physical phenomena however predicting wave added resistance based on cfd is still considered to be in the stage of academic research rather than engineering practice on one hand these computations require large computational resources and long cpu times on the other hand the setup of the computations in cfd tools takes skill i e only an experienced user is able to obtain reliable results by analyzing the results of the shopera international benchmark study of numerical methods for the prediction of time average wave induced steady forces shigunov et al 2018 demonstrated the 3d panel methods performed well in the added resistance predictions for most of the cases rans methods shown their potential but frequently delivered erratic results for potential flow and cfd approaches predicting the added resistance in short waves is a challenging problem potential theory methods may not be able to estimate added resistance accurately in short waves this is due to the omission of viscous effects and the inadequate consideration of the associated nonlinearity the major obstacle of cfd approaches is that fine grids are needed to resolve short wave patterns accurately which increases significantly the computational time to improve the prediction of the added resistance in short wave cases semi empirical corrections are usually employed in conjunction with numerical results yang et al 2018 and riesner and el moctar 2018 documented their latest correction schemes liu and papanikolaou 2016a proposed a practical semi empirical formula which can evaluated the added resistance for the ships heading in long or short waves it should be mentioned that most of the existing numerical studies on wave added resistance focus on the cases of the ship in head waves however several experimental studies eg valanto and hong 2015 sprenger et al 2017 showed that the wave encountering angles have also effects on added resistance in recent years some numerical research dedicated to predict the added resistance for the ship in oblique waves were also reported for example liu and papanikolaou 2016b extended the far field method to predict the added resistance of ships in oblique waves zhan and kuang 2018 conducted numerical simulation of added resistance in head and oblique waves using the cfd tool openfoam nevertheless prediction of the wave added resistance in head wave is still considered essential for investigating the ship s performance in waves we developed computer code based on a time domain rankine panel method and carried out numerical computations of wave added resistance basically we used a numerical method similar to the those of joncquez 2009 and kim and kim 2011 however we introduced particular numerical approaches not addressed previously our numerical results showed that these approaches were important to accurately predict wave added resistance we conducted our added resistance computations for a wigley hull the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker in head waves we tested the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization and compared the computed added resistance in short and long waves against available experimental measurements and existing numerical results moreover we investigated the separate contributions of added resistance due to radiation and diffraction and compared our predictions to the existing cfd results 2 mathematical background 2 1 boundary value problem let us consider a ship travelling in regular waves at constant forward speed u u 0 0 0 the water depth is assumed to be infinite and the hull is assumed rigid a mean body fixed right handed coordinate system o xyz see fig 1 is used to describe the boundary value problem the positive x axis points towards the bow the positive z axis upward the xy plane coincides with the calm water level and the origin is located amidships the translatory

velocity potential φ i x t is the incident wave potential ζ i x y t is the incident wave elevation φ x t and ζ x y t denote the disturbed velocity potential and the related wave elevation respectively the basis potential is assumed to be the main component of order of o 1 while the other parts are an order of magnitude smaller than φ 0 x and of order of o ε here ε is of the order of magnitude of a l where a and l are the wave amplitude and the length of the ship it is assumed that ε is much smaller than 1 we consider linear incoming waves for the infinite water depth the incident wave potential

linearization using the double body potential and the uniform incident flow potential respectively as basis potential for the double body linearization scheme the basis potential is further divided as follows 9 φ 0 u 0 x φ here φ is determined by the following boundary conditions 10 φ n u n on s φ z 0 on z 0 where s is the mean wetted hull surface applying taylor expansions for the wave elevation about the clam water plane and the small wave induced motions about the mean wetted hull surface and neglecting terms of order higher than o ε we obtain the linearized bvp for φ x t as follows 11 t u

odes using a fourth order runge kutta scheme to obtain starting values 3 4 numerical approaches three additional numerical approaches are used and they significantly influence the wave added resistance prediction 3 4 1 the water line integral as the wetted hull surface is discretized by plane quadrilateral panels the water line of the ship is discretized by line segments correspondingly the integrand of the water line integral 17 is calculated at the midpoint of each segment and the integral over the segment is computed using the rectangle rule because the water line is the intersection of the hull surface and free surface the wave elevations caused by the disturbed potential may be determined using the free surface data or the hull surface data for the former wave elevations at the water line are computed using coefficients ζ j t for the latter the wave elevations are estimated by substituting the disturbed potential on the edge of the hull into the linearized kinematic free surface boundary condition i e the second equation of 11 a comparison between the results of different methods is provided in section 5 3 of this paper 3 4 2 the boundary end condition as shown in fig 2 the b spline basis function spans over three panels to complete the spline representation 21 an additional strip of artificial panels must be included at each side of a panel sheet a problem associated with these artificial panels is that the number of unknowns or equivalently the number of collocation equations exceeds the number of grid panels this problem is solved by imposing some boundary end conditions at each edge and corner of the panel sheet although specifying the boundary end conditions is a purely numerical issue we found that different choices of the end conditions yielded significantly different second order wave forces details will be discussed in section 5 4 of this paper 3 4 3 the second order derivative of the disturbed potential the last term of 17 contains second order derivations of the disturbed potential in practice we tried to differentiate the b spline basis twice to compute the second derivations but the results contained obvious numerical errors and the miscomputed second derivatives decrease the precision of the added resistance computation significantly to solve this problem we simply set the second derivatives of the disturbed potential zero it is certain that neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential also causes error however numerical results demonstrated this error is much smaller than the one introduced by the miscomputed second derivatives details are provided in section 5 5 4 test cases based on the above we developed a computer code and performed numerical tests for the wigley i hull journée 1992 the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker the wigley i hull and s 175 containership are slender ships whereas the kvlcc2 tanker is a blunt hull the purpose of these computations was to validate the developed code for the added resistance predictions of different kinds of ships figs 3 5 show lines of the wigley i hull the s 175 containership and the kvlcc2 tanker respectively and table 1 lists their principal particulars 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical setup fig 6 illustrates the typical panel arrangements of the investigated ships in each figure the upper graph shows the panels idealizing half of the free surface and half of the hull the zoomed in lower graphs the panels idealizing one half of the hulls for each ship grid convergence checks were conducted before starting systemic computations numerical results show that a computational domain on the free surface extending 1 5l in the y direction 0 5l upstream and 1 2l downstream was enough to obtain convergence depending on hull shape and wave length the number of panels idealizing each half hull ranged from 300 to 600 typical computational domain consists less than 3000 panels all the calculations are carried out on a personal computer with intel i5 7300 2 5 ghz processor for each encounter frequency we performed the simulation of ten encounter periods with common time step size of δ t 0 02 s the computational time for each encounter frequency is less than 30 min to validate our numerical procedure we first employed the double body db linearization for the wigley hull then we tested the db and the neumann kelvin nk linearization for the s 175 container ship and the kvlcc2 tanker to demonstrate effects of different linearization schemes to simplify the problem the first order surge motion of the ships was assumed fixed 5 2 convergence study for the wigley i hull for the wigley i hull we conducted convergence studies for the ship in regular head waves of wave length to ship length ratio λ l 1 0 advancing at constant forward speed corresponding to a froude number of fn 0 2 convergence was tested for temporal and spatial discretizations and for computational domain sizes of the free surface fig 7 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force obtained on the three different grids see table 2 with a common time step size of δ t 0 02 s as seen the force history obtained on the coarsest grid a differs slightly from the forces histories obtained on the medium grid b and fine grid c whereas the forces histories obtained on the medium grid b and fine grid c nearly coincide with each other fig 8 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force obtained on the medium grid b using three different time steps of δt 0 010s 0 015s and 0 020s the favorable agreement of the resulting time histories demonstrated adequate temporal convergence fig 9 plots the resulting time histories of computed second order longitudinal force again obtained on the medium grid b but of different sized free surface domains see table 3 the favorable agreement of the resulting time histories demonstrated that on the medium grid b the size of the free surface domain b was adequately large to ensure convergence we chose grid fineness and computational domain size according to the above convergence study in short waves of λ l 0 5 we conducted a further check after each simulation to insure mesh independence of the predicted added resistance small spikes characterized the force histories plotted in figs 7 9 these spikes were caused by the application of a numerical filter the purpose of this filter firstly introduced by nakos et al 1993 was to remove small waves induced by numerical errors here we decided to filter the free surface elevations after every 20 time steps although applying the filter had little effect on the resulting added resistance this was necessary to ensure numerical stability of our time domain simulations 5 3 methods to compute the water line integral to accurately compute the water line integral the wave elevation had to be correctly estimated as mentioned above the wave elevation caused by the disturbed potential may be determined using either free surface data or hull data we compared wave the elevation and the water line integral based on these two data sets and again we selected the wigley i hull advancing in head waves of λ l 1 0 at fn 0 2 fig 10 shows four graphs of comparative wave elevations corresponding to times t 7 00s 7 25s 7 50s and 7 75s computed using the hull data and the free surface data the time differences between each of these graphs generally equaled one quarter wave encounter period the abscissa in these graphs identifies the normalized x coordinate at the hull s waterline the ordinate the normalized wave elevation ζ w l a caused by the disturbed potential as seen discrepancies between the two sets of wave elevation wer not remarkable fig 11 plots the comparative water line integral obtained using the hull data and free surface data the resulting values were almost identical we chose the free surface data to compute the water line integral for our subsequent computations numerical results demonstrated that this provided stable results for all subsequent test cases 5 4 effect of the boundary end condition on the wave added resistance for the wigley i hull fig 12 plots computed time histories of heave and pitch motions for the wigley i hull in waves of λ l 1 1 at fn 0 2 the steady part of the computed motions was represented as follows 32 ξ i ξ i cos ω e t ε i i 3 5 where indices i 3 and 5 refer to heave and pitch respectively the resulting amplitudes ξ i and phase angles ε i represent the response amplitude operator rao and the phase lag between incident wave and wave induced motion respectively for the wigley i hull in regular head waves with normalized amplitude of a l 0 01 fig 13 plots time histories of our computed longitudinal first and second order wave forces the upper graph a directly compares these two force components over the normalized time region of 0 t g l 1 2 35 as seen the second order wave force oscillated at twice the frequency of the first order force to display the mean second order wave force the lower graph b plots expanded time histories of these two force components over the smaller normalized time region of 25 5 t g l 1 2 31 0 the mean value of this second order wave force was considered the wave added resistance we carried out numerical computations in the region of incident wave length ratios of 0 5 λ l 2 0 at two forward speeds corresponding to fn 0 2 and 0 3 fig 14 plots the resulting heave and pitch raos and their phase angles and fig 15 the associated wave added resistance to illustrate effects of boundary end conditions ec we included in figs 14 and 15 numerical results based on two kinds of end condition the first kind is referred to as the zero end condition zero ec where the unknowns on the artificial panels are simply set to zero the second kind is the so called natural end condition natural ec where the second derivatives of the spline are zero at each edge and corner of the panel sheet symbol exp in figs 14 and 15 denotes experimental measurements of journée 1992 symbols natural ec and zero ec our numerical predictions based on the natural and the zero end condition respectively from fig 14 we see that the motion raos and their phase angles based on the two kinds of end conditions differ only modestly from each other and that they compared favorably to experimental measurements for the wave added resistance however remarkable discrepancies were noticed between results based on different end conditions as seen in fig 15 wave added resistance based on of the natural ec end condition correlated relatively well to experimental data but the agreement between results based on the zero ec end condition and the experimental measurements was poor fig 16 plots computed partial derivatives of the disturbed potential against the ship s normalized length coordinate x l for the wigley i hull advancing in regular head waves of λ l 1 25 at fn 0 2 these derivatives referred to the top row of the collocation points on the hull at time t 5 5s as seen the zero ec produces an obvious jump of the derivative for the collocation points located near the stern x l 0 5 this jump is inconsistent with the physical phenomenon because the wave added resistance is so sensitive to the derivatives of the potential at stern and bow the local miscomputations of the derivatives will result in remarkable numerical errors of the final result after also testing other end condition we decided to adopt the natural ec end condition for our subsequent computations 5 5 the second derivative of the disturbed potential fig 17 plots our computed second derivatives of the disturbed potential dp here based on the natural ec end condition against the ship s normalized length coordinate x l these derivatives are still referred to the top row of the collocation points on the hull at time t 5 5s by comparing figs 16 and 17 it could be found the first derivatives show smooth variation along the x direction while the second derivative show obvious oscillation considering the wigley hull is simple and of small curvature we think the computed second derivatives may contain remarkable numerical errors and cannot reflect the physics phenomena correctly fig 18 plots our computed values of added resistance raw obtained by considering and neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential the experimentally measured values of journée 1992 marked exp are also included in fig 18 symbol dp is the abbreviation of disturbed potential as seen neglecting the second derivatives of the disturbed potential led to a more favorable agreement to experimental measurements the erroneous second derivatives yielded underestimated peak values of added resistance particularly for fn 0 3 this was because the second derivative was multiplied by ship speed in the equation of the second order wave forces and this higher ship speed acted as an error amplifier thus the second derivatives could not be reliably computed by differentiating the b spline basis function for our subsequent computations therefore we decided to set the second derivatives of the disturbed potential to zero 5 6 wave added resistance for the s 175 containership we selected the s 175 container ship for our second computational example we considered the ship in regular head waves of lengths 0 5 λ l 2 0 at the three forward speeds of fn 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 fig 19 plots our predictions together with comparative experimental measurements of fujii and takahashi 1975 and numerical results of kim and kim 2011 symbol exp marks the experiment data symbols rpm db and rpm nk the predictions of kim and kim 2011 and symbols db and nk our predictions based on the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization respectively our predictions based on the double body linearization present db correlated more favorably to experimental measurements than our predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization present nk for all three ship speeds in resonant wave lengths of 1 0 λ l 1 3 our predicted added resistances based on the double body linearization present db were close to experimental measurements for fn 0 25 and fn 0 3 differences between our computed peak values based on the db linearization and the experimental data were modest most likely these relatively small discrepancies occurred by neglecting the nonlinearity of the physical problem at fn 0 2 and 0 25 our peak values based on the nk linearization exceeded those based on the db linearization however the associated shift of the resonant wave lengths probably caused the agreement between the results based on the nk linearization and the experimental data to be less favorable for fn 0 3 our predicted peak value based on the nk linearization was underestimated although the shift of the resonant wavelength remained 5 7 motions and wave added resistance for the kvlcc2 tanker to validate our developed method for a ship in relatively short waves we evaluated wave added resistance of the kvlcc2 tanker in regular incident waves of lengths 0 3 λ l 2 0 at a forward speed of fn 0 142 fig 20 plots heave and pitch raos and fig 21 the associated wave added resistance both against wave length to ship length ratio λ l symbol exp denotes experimental measurements of riesner and el moctar 2018 and lee et al 2017 symbol gl rankine numerical predictions obtained using software gl rankine symbol cfd numerical cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 and symbols present db and present nk our predictions based on the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization respectively fig 20 left shows that our heave predictions based on the double body linearization present db correlated favorably to experimental measurements our predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization present nk are close to the predictions obtained using software gl rankine however the peak of the present nk predictions was overestimated by about 20 compared to the experimental measurements fig 20 right shows that all pitch predictions generally correlated favorably to each other but they deviated from measurements in longer waves wave added resistance in fig 21 shows that our predictions based on the double body linearization present db generally captured the variation of the wave added resistance in the region of 0 9 λ l 2 0 although the peak value was slightly lower than experimental measurements and the cfd result it is seen that differences between predictions based on the db linearization and the nk linearization were significant this discrepancy was partly due to the overestimated wave induced heave motion based on the nk linearization shown in fig 20 however the relatively inaccurate prediction of the wave elevation at the ship s waterline probably had a greater effect the blunt hull of the kvlcc2 tanker disturbed the velocities induced by the double body flow to a considerable extent at the ship bow and stern and the nk linearization neglected these velocities thereby decreasing the accuracy of local wave height predictions such errors were further increased because the water line integral of the second order wave forces depended on wave height squared in moderate and short waves λ l 0 8 our predictions based on the double body linearization present db agreed less favorably to experimental data considering that viscous effects were significant when computing wave added resistance in short waves we corrected these computations according to the method of riesner and el moctar 2018 as follows 33 r v i s c r a w 1 f v i s c ω where r v i s c is added resistance that accounts for also the viscous effects and f v i s c ω is the correction coefficient expressed as follows 34 f v i s c 0 4 c b 1 67 e 5 8 λ l fig 22 plots the corrected wave added resistance against wave length to ship length ratio λ l again symbol exp denotes experimental measurements of riesner and el moctar 2018 and lee et al 2017 symbol gl rankine numerical predictions obtained using software gl rankine symbol cfd numerical cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 and symbols present db our predictions based on the double body linearization as seen our corrected added resistances still deviated considerably from experimental measurements we attributed these discrepancies to the following aspects in short waves wave reflection at the ship s bow was relatively strong as our method relied on a purely linear approach it was difficult to capture such a phenomenon refining the panels near the ship bow could have led to more accurate predictions however numerical tests showed that a high density panel discretization produced large numerical errors causing the solution to diverge a cfd approach seems necessary to improve the evaluation of wave added resistance in short waves fig 19 shows that wave induced motions were relatively small in short waves λ l 0 8 hence cfd computations without considering the ship s motion should suffice to provide accurate results 5 8 interaction of radiation and diffraction in contrast to traditional methods our method did not require separating the disturbed potential into a radiation and a diffraction potential however it was still meaningful to examine the effects of ship motions and wave diffraction on wave added resistance to this end we performed three separate computations for the kvlcc2 tanker and compared our results to those of sigmund and el moctar 2018 first we computed total added resistance in waves second we determined added resistance of the fixed ship advancing at constant forward speed in head waves diffraction third we obtained added resistance of the moving ship advancing in calm water by prescribing the computed motions obtained in the first step radiation fig 23 plots our computed results against wave length to ship length ratio λ l comprising total wave added resistance our separately computed added resistances due to radiation and diffraction and the corresponding cfd predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 symbols present total present radiation and present diffraction denote our predictions of total radiation induced and diffraction induced added resistance respectively and symbols cfd total cfd radiation and cfd diffraction stand for the corresponding predictions of sigmund and el moctar 2018 as seen added resistance due to diffraction depended only moderately on wave length while added resistance due to radiation varied with increasing wave length in short waves λ l 0 8 the radiation part of added resistance was nearly zero in long waves λ l 1 0 it became significant as expected the peak value of the radiation part of added resistance occurred at about λ l 1 4 that is in wave lengths that generally correspond to the resonant wavelength of heave and pitch motions our predictions differed from cfd results especially for the diffraction part of added resistance this was likely due to the fact that our method neglected nonlinear viscous effects nevertheless our predictions and the comparable cfd results showed similar trends indicating that the sum of radiation and diffraction forces was equal to total resistance only in short waves in long waves the interaction between radiation and diffraction had a large effect on the total resistance and therefore should not be neglected 6 conclusions to predict wave added resistance for ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves we developed a computer code based on a time domain rankine panel method the quadratic b spline basis function represented the unknowns on the discretized flow filed boundaries and an euler scheme approximated the temporal derivative for the free surface conditions after solving the velocity potential and the wave induced motions at each time step we computed the second order wave forces using a near field pressure integration we considered the mean value of the longitudinal directional second order wave force as the wave added resistance employing the b spline required specifying spline end condition we conducted numerical computations and found that various spline end conditions led to significant difference of added resistance predictions we finally decided to use the natural spline end condition moreover although the b spline basis functions could be differentiated twice numerical results showed that the computed second derivatives were prone to large numerical errors we neglected the second derivatives of the disturbed potential in our added resistance computations computations for the s 175 containership and the kvlcc 2 tanker demonstrated that in long waves our predictions based on the double body linearization agreed satisfactorily to comparative experimental measurements whereas in shorter waves our results differed somewhat from experimental data this was due to the effects of viscosity and nonlinearities which were more pronounced in short waves as our method neglected these effects we employed an empirical correction formula to account for viscous effects and thus to ensure the accuracy of our predictions we tested two well known linearization schemes namely the double body linearization and the neumann kelvin linearization and found that predictions based on the former scheme consistently yielded more favorable results compared to experimental measurements than results based on the neumann kelvin linearization particularly for the kvlcc2 tanker with its blunt hull predictions based on the neumann kelvin linearization showed remarkable discrepancies against predictions based on the double body linearization and also against comparative experimental measurements finally for the kvlcc2 tanker we separately computed wave added resistance due to radiation and diffraction comparing our predictions to available cfd simulations revealed that in long waves the interaction between radiation and diffraction should not be neglected because it had a large influence on total resistance in short waves the diffraction part dominated total added resistance because these short waves induced nearly no ship motions acknowledgements this study was supported by

22894,to ensure that a work class remotely operated vehicle rov has the ability to complete trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties this paper proposes a double loop sliding mode controller dsmc that replaces the conventional switching term with a novel switching term the inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term for conventional sliding mode controller csmc and the simulation proves that this function can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the csmc to further reduce the occurrence of chattering this paper proposes applying the dsmc to work class rov trajectory tracking the singular perturbation theory and the variable change speed concept illustrate how to divide the cascaded system into two subsystems the inner loop control system velocity loop and outer loop control system position loop the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven simulation results compare the expected performances of the proposed dsmc with the performance of the csmc and fuzzy smc in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise the dsmc errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero the chattering of the dsmc is also obviously reduced compared with that of the csmc keywords remotely operated vehicle rov trajectory tracking double loop sliding mode control switching term 1 introduction according to their operation methods underwater robots can be classified into autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs auvs can complete automatic trajectory tracking and path following so they are often used to complete tasks such as ocean observations and hydrological information collection however auvs cannot communicate with the land in real time so it is difficult to complete complex underwater operations with these underwater robots work class rovs are generally equipped with manipulators which can perform underwater heavy duty operations moreover rovs have umbilical cables connected to mother ships which enable real time communication therefore work class rovs have been widely used in deep sea exploration pipeline maintenance and deep sea mining efforts most of the rovs are manually operated especially when working in the deep sea two operators are required to cooperatively control one rov one person is responsible for controlling the body movement and the other person controls the manipulators rov control accuracy and efficiency are completely determined by the operators experience and the operating cost is very high zhao and yuh 2005 therefore improving the automatic control capability of rovs is currently a hot issue schjølberg and utne 2015 due to the complexity of the marine environment rovs are often disturbed by the undercurrent of the seabed moreover the unit weight of the rov umbilical cable is relatively large when an rov is operated at a large depth the umbilical cable will greatly interfere with the rov movement the vu et al 2017 at the same time rov dynamics are highly coupled and nonlinear the irregular shape of rovs makes it difficult to accurately describe rov hydrodynamic characteristics and create model uncertainties the above problems all lead to considerable difficulties in rov automatic control since the umbilical has a significant influence on rov dynamics many scholars have used methods to model the underwater dynamic responses of umbilicals to describe their effects on rovs these modelling methods include finite element methods o a eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 2018 finite difference methods burgess 1992 catenary equations li et al 2018 and the lump mass spring model mai et al 2017 in fang et al 2007 the force between the umbilical and the rov was treated as a two end boundary value problem and then they solved this problem by using a multi step shooting method in the present paper the conclusion of li et al 2018 is adopted to describe the effect of umbilical cable strength on rovs because the model proposed by li has been verified experimentally and the model object of li s paper was a work class rov with a similar size and weight the chosen object of the present paper due to the difficulty of describing the umbilical cable s effect on the rov some simplifying assumptions about the dynamic response of the umbilical can be made and many researchers such as huo et al 2018 and wang et al 2015 have used a simplified umbilical model moreover some small observation rovs ignore the effects of the umbilical in addition to the interference force of the umbilical the ocean current force and the model uncertainties pose challenges to rov automatic control to solve these problems many advanced control methods can be applied to rov control such as adaptive control antonelli et al 2003 hoang and kreuzer 2007 maalouf et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 sliding mode control bessa et al 2010 elmokadem et al 2016 garcí a valdovinos et al 2009 guo et al 2003 m kim et al 2015 soylu et al 2008 fuzzy logic control chen et al 2016 huo et al 2018 khodayari and balochian 2015 backstepping control do 2015 raygosa barahona et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zhu and gu 2011 and neural network control chu et al 2017 gao et al 2015 kim and kim 2014 sliding mode control smc is characterized by a simple form strong robustness tolerance of model uncertainty and transient stability qiao et al 2017 however sliding mode control has the problem of chattering phenomena the sliding surface function contains a switching term which is a discontinuous feedback component it is in charge of compensating for deviations from the desired dynamics however it not only acts as the source of the robustness of the smc law but also acts on the system in a bang bang manner thus creating chatter in the actuators and causing the system state to oscillate intensely across the sliding manifold slotine and li 1991 for rov control the chattering phenomenon causes high frequency changes in the speed of the thrusters which leads to high energy consumption increased friction and thruster damage work class rovs are generally equipped with hydraulically propelled thrusters which cannot meet excessive frequency speed changes therefore the actual control effect of the csmc is not ideal many advanced methods have been used to solve the chattering problem of csmcs bessa et al 2010 adopted a smc strategy that was enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm for uncertainty and disturbance compensation the control scheme was employed for the dynamic positioning of the rov and the results showed that the incorporation of an adaptive fuzzy algorithm within the boundary layer resulted in a better trade off between tracking performance and chattering soylu et al 2008 proposed a chattering free method for rov systems that uses an adaptive term in place of the conventional discontinuous switching term this adaptive term continuously compensates for unknown system dynamics without a priori knowledge of the upper bounds in addition the parameterization of both a regressor matrix and unknown parameter vector are not required for the adaptive term in csmcs the discontinuous switching term is the main reason for chattering thus terminal smc tsmc which uses continuous functions instead of discontinuous functions as the switching term has become a method for solving the chattering problem furthermore non singular terminal smc ntsmc has been proposed and has the advantage of not only avoiding the singularity problem caused by the tsmc but also eliminating the chattering problem elmokadem et al 2017 patre et al 2018 qiao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b however these aforementioned methods use complex controllers and require many parameters to be set which makes implementing these methods too difficult in practice to reduce the chattering phenomena of csmc to achieve control accuracy and to improve the response time of the controller we first proposed a novel switching function that replaces the signum function with an inverse tangent function second a double loop sliding mode controller dsmc was proposed for work class rovs to achieve precise trajectory tracking performance with the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties the double loop control structure has been widely used in electronic throttle valve control li et al 2015 uuv control qiao and zhang 2018b and uav control bertrand et al 2011 to date few researchers have employed double loop control for work class rovs in this paper according to singular perturbation theory and the state variable speed concept mehra et al 1979 the cascade system is divided into two parts fast time varying systems and slow time varying systems for the rov we design the double loop controller as two parts an outer loop controller velocity loop which is the slow time varying system and an inner loop controller position loop which is the fast time varying system the outer loop controller is utilized to achieve accurate positioning and attitude tracking this controller creates a virtual control input for the inner loop which is considered the reference velocity the inner loop controller is designed to let the rov s actual velocity accurately track the reference velocity in this way external disturbances and system uncertainties are eliminated in the inner loop which can guarantee that the rov will achieve a precise trajectory tracking performance and improve the response time of the controller in this paper double loop sliding mode control is compared with the conventional sliding mode control and fuzzy sliding mode control fsmc simulations of two types of trajectory tracking paths are performed on the haima rov to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed double loop controller the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 a novel inverse tangent switching term function is proposed to replace the commonly used signum function the continuity of this function can reduce the chattering phenomenon of csmc 2 singular perturbation theory is used to categorize the rov state as a fast time varying and slow time varying system at a given time scale this contribution laid a theoretical foundation for the dsmc proposal 3 based on lyapunov analysis the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven the comparative studies with the csmc and fsmc are carried out on the haima rov simulation studies of two types of trajectory tracking are carried out to illustrate the superior performance of the dsmc 2 problem formulation 2 1 rov kinematics haima the typical work class rov shown in fig 1 is equipped with eight thrusters and can complete 3d spatial movement two coordinate frames namely the inertial frame and body fixed frame are usually defined to describe the motion of rovs the state variable with respect to the body fixed frame are represented by v v v 1 t v 2 t v 1 t u v w t represents the linear velocity and v 2 t p q r t represents the angular velocity the state variable with respect to the inertial frame are denoted by η η η 1 t η 2 t η 1 t x y z t η 2 t ϕ θ ψ t η 1 t represents the position of the rov in the inertial frame and η 2 t represents the orientations by using a jacobian transformation matrix j ϕ θ ψ η the relationship between the derivatives of the inertial coordinate η and the linear and angular velocities in the body fixed frame v can be expressed as 1 η j ϕ θ ψ η v j ϕ θ ψ η stands for the jacobian transformation matrix and can be defined as 2 j ϕ θ ψ η j 1 ϕ θ ψ η 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 2 ϕ θ η j 1 ϕ θ ψ η and j 2 ϕ θ η are defined as 3 j 1 ϕ θ ψ η c ψ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ

t tan since work class rovs have very large masses and volumes and a strong recovery torque for buoyancy rovs can be considered to have the ability to self balance in the xz plane and the yz plane consequently the assumption that ϕ θ 0 is satisfied therefore the rov six degree freedom equation 1 can be reduced to a four degree freedom equation as follows 4 η j ψ η v expressing this equation as a matrix we can obtain the following expression 5 x y z ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 u v w r 2 2 rov dynamics the shape of a general work class rov can basically be considered a rectangular parallelepiped with three symmetrical faces the rov has a low speed generally less than 1 m s therefore the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov can be simplified the dynamic equation of a rov in the body fixed frame can be expressed by the following equation 6 m v c v v d v v g η τ t τ d where m r4 4 is the mass matrix which includes rigid mass and added mass c v r4 4 is the coriolis and centripetal force matrix d v r4 4 is the damping terms matrix and g η r4 4 is the restoring force matrix in general the work class rov is designed so that gravity equal to buoyancy i e g η 0 is satisfied τ t r4 is the control force and moment vector τ d r4 is the vector that contains the external disturbance forces and torques the mass matrix m m rb m a where m rb is the mass matrix of the rigid body and m a is the added mass matrix 7 m r b m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 i z 8 m a x u 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0 z w 0 0 0 0 n r where m represents the mass of the rov and iz represents the rov moment of inertia about the z axis x u y v z w and n r represent the corresponding added mass and additional inertia thus m can be simply expressed as soylu et al 2008 chu et al 2017 9 m d i a g m x u m y v m z w i z n r considering that the rov has a very low speed and a shape that consists of three symmetry planes the rov coriolis and centripetal force coefficient can be simplified as follows 10 c v 0 0 0 m y v v 0 0 0 m x u u 0 0 0 0 m y v v m x u u 0 0 due to the structure and design features of the rov its higher order damping can be neglected only the first order and second order damping coefficients need to be considered therefore the following equation is expressed as 11 d v d i a g x u x u u u y v y v v v z w z w w w n r n r r r the above hydrodynamic parameters are generally obtained with experiments but it is difficult to guarantee parameter accuracy due to the complexity of real sea conditions therefore the parameters remain uncertain thus m c v d v in 6 can be written as the sum of the nominal dynamics m 0 c 0 v and d 0 v and dynamic uncertainties δm δc v and δd v i e m m 0 δ m c v c 0 v δ c v d v d 0 v δ d v then the dynamic equation can be rewritten as the following form 12 m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d where τ d is the sum of the external disturbance τ d and system uncertainty τ u which are defined as 13 τ d τ d τ u τ d δ m v δ c v v δ d v v the forces and moments produced in each degree of freedom are defined as the input vector τ t f u f v f w m r t the relationship between the input vector τ t and the force of eight thrusters can be calculated by the following thrust distribution matrix 14 τ t b u where u r8 is the vector collecting the forces produced by the eight thrusters the specific form of b r4 8 which is the thrust distribution matrix is presented in appendix b a work class rov is generally equipped with hydraulic propulsion thrusters due to the special characteristics of the hydraulic thrusters the saturation limits and rate limits of the thrusts should be considered in general a saturation function block and a first order inertial element can be used to simulate thruster characteristics huo et al 2018 in this paper the thrust limit of the four horizontal thrusters is 355 kg to 296 kgf 3481 4n to 2902 8n and the thrust limit of the four vertical thrusters is 198 kgf to 176 kgf 1941 7n to 1726 0n the first order inertial element is expressed as 15 τ t 25 τ t 25 u 3 controller design according to the previous description by combining 4 and 12 the kinematics and dynamics equation of the rov can be expressed as fossen 1994 16 m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d η j ψ η v to compare the abilities of the controllers to guarantee a satisfactory tracking performance with external disturbances and model uncertainties this section presents two control methods the csmc and the dsmc both methods have been shown to be asymptotically stable with lyapunov s law the dynamics expressed by 16 possess the following assumption which are used in the subsequent control law development and closed loop stability analysis assumption 1 all model uncertainties i e δ m δ c v a n d δ d v are bounded and external disturbances are also bounded hence the assumption that τ d in expression 16 is bounded and has a certainty bounder can be proposed elements in τ d match the condition that for i 1 2 3

with respect to time we have 17 v j ψ 1 η η j ψ η v substituting 17 into 16 we have 18 η j ψ η v j ψ η m 0 1 c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d according to previous studies slotine and li 1991 utkin 2003 the conventional sliding mode control is well known for its robustness to model uncertainties and external disturbances by defining η e as the error between the desired position η d and the current position η the tracking error can be denoted as η e η d η the conventional sliding surface is thus defined as 19 s λ η e η e where s r4 λ diag λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 and λ i is a positive constant for all i 1 4 the standard sliding mode control law is in the form soylu et al 2008 20 τ t τ eq τ sw where τeq and τsw represent the equivalent control law and switching control law respectively in general the equivalent control law is continuous and involves model information the main purpose of this law is to drive the controlled object to realize the desired dynamics however due to external disturbances and model uncertainties an auxiliary switching term is utilized to offset the difference between the desired and real dynamics in csmc the switching term is defined as a discontinuous feedback component with a general form of τsw k sign s k is a positive definite diagonal gain matrix and the value of k is higher than the upper bound of the interference which has the effect of eliminating the effects of external disturbances and model uncertainties the use of a nonlinear discontinuous signum function makes the switching term act in the bang bang manner which is not only the source of the robustness of the control law but also creates the chattering phenomenon to preserve the switching characteristics of the signum function while eliminating the adverse effects caused by its discontinuity many substitution functions have been utilized to act as the switching term such as the saturation function slotine and li 1991 and hyperbolic tangent function kim et al 2015 in this paper we apply the inverse tangent function as the switching term 21 τ sw 2 π arctan s θ where arctan s θ arctan s 1 θ 1 arctan s 2 θ 2 arctan s 3 θ 3 s 4 θ 4 t θ i i 1 2 3 4 denotes the thickness of the boundary layer which is positively defined the model based equivalent control law component can be derived by assuming that the motion is constrained to the sliding manifold by substituting 18

theorem 1 consider the nonlinear dynamical system described by eq 16 with assumption 1 the stability of the closed loop control system can be guaranteed with the control law expressed as eq 24 proof defining the lyapunov function candidate 25 v 1 2 s t s taking the derivative of 25 and substituting 22 into 25 the following results can be obtained 26 v s t s s t d 2 π arctan s v θ j ψ η m 0 1 τ d

lemma popov 1974 slotine and li 1991 since v is lower bounded v 0 v is negative semi definite v 0 and v 1 0 can be expressed as t therefore η e 0 η e 0 can be expressed as t thus the system is of global asymptotic stability 3 2 double loop sliding mode control 3 2 1 analysis of state parameters based on singular perturbation theory fully expanding the formulas described by 16 yields 8 total state parameters as described in the following formula 27 x cos ψ u sin ψ v y sin ψ u cos ψ v z w ψ r m v x u u m v y v v r x u x u u u u τ t 1 τ d 1 m v y v v m v x u u r y v y v v v v τ t 2 τ d 2 m

system in the singularly perturbed form is not easy in this paper the concept of state variable speed proposed by mehra et al 1979 is adopted to determine the multi time scale structure so that decomposition of the full mode 27 can be analysed the state equation 27 can be expressed as x f x τ where x represents the state variables and τ represents the control input vector due to the limitations of objective physical conditions and design requirements such as the maximum allowable submersible speed and the motion range limitation caused by the cable the state variables x i i 1 2 n have certain upper and lower limits i e x i min x i x i max the speed of the state variables is represented by s i which can be defined as follows 28 s i x i δ x i f i x τ x i max x i min the above definition can be used to calculate the speed of state variables and effectively separate the variables at the time scale we consider the reference value x of the state of the region of interest which can satisfy 29 s i 1 δ x i max f i x τ hence the speed of the state variables can be calculated the result is shown in the following table from the above table the state variables can be divided into two groups according to the speed of the state variables the position and attitude state vector η x y z ψ t is the slow time varying state vector and the linear and angular speed vector v u v w r t is the fast time varying state vector 3 2 2 double loop sliding mode controller design the state variables are divided into slow time varying variables and fast time varying variables on a time scale the fast time varying variables vector v includes linear and angular velocity in the body fixed frame the slow time varying variables vector η includes position and yaw angle in the inertial frame therefore the control process can be divided into two steps the internal and external parts as depicted in fig 2 the whole control program involves two loops the outer loop is designed to achieve precise position and attitude through the information of the desired position and feedback current position then a virtual control input v r is generated by the out loop controller as a reference velocity considering the error between the virtual control input v r and the actual speed vector v the inner loop controller produces the ideal thrusts for each degree of freedom to realize the accurate tracking of the reference velocity the advantage of this method is that external disturbances and model uncertainties are eliminated by the inner loop controller so more accurate tracking of the position and attitude can be achieved with the outer loop controller compared with the csmc this method is considered an effective way to remove the chattering phenomenon and guarantee tracking accuracy in this paper a typical double loop control is proposed both the inner and outer loop controllers are used for integral sliding mode control according to the classification of state parameters in the previous section we named the inner loop as the speed loop and the outer loop the position loop for clarity 3 3 outer loop position loop controller design if η e is defined as the error between the desired position η d and current position η the tracking error can be denoted as η e η d η if the outer loop position loop sliding mode variable s p r4 is designed as an integral sliding mode form 30 s p η e k p 0 t η e d t where k p represents positive definite diagonal matrices k p diag k p1 k p2 k p3 k p4 choosing an appropriate gain matrix k p can make the tracking error finally stable on an ideal sliding surface the derivation of 30 can be obtained as 31 s p η e k p η e the purpose of designing the outer loop controller is to generate a virtual control input for the inner loop controller let the virtual control input be defined as the reference velocity v r the error between the reference velocity v r and true velocity v is v e substituting v e v r v in 4 we have 32 η j ψ η v r v r v j ψ η v r j ψ η v e according to 31 and 32 we can derive 33 s p η e k p η e η d η k p η e η d j ψ η v r j ψ η v e k p η e we design the virtual control input reference velocity v r as 34 v r j ψ 1 η η d k p η e j ψ 1 η ρ 1 s p where ρ 1 is positive theorem 2 if the chosen virtual control input 34 is applied the defined outer loop sliding mode function 30 will converge to the equilibrium point with the condition that v e 0 proof define the lyapunov function candidate as 35 v 1 1 2 s p t s p taking the derivative of 35 the results are 36 v 1 s p t s p s p t η d j ψ η v r j ψ η v e k p η e s p t η d j ψ η j ψ 1 η η d k p η e j ψ 1 η ρ 1 s p j ψ η v e k p η e ρ 1 s p 2 s p t j ψ η v e from 36 it can be deduced that if v e converges to zero v 1 0 is established therefore the designed virtual control input 34 can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the outer loop sliding manifold s p and the desired trajectory tracking in the next step the inner loop controller is designed such that v e satisfies the condition of converging to zero which will ultimately make the entire system tend to be stable 3 4 inner loop velocity loop controller design the ability of actual velocity v to track the virtual velocity v r determines the preciseness of position tracking so the inner loop controller is designed to guarantee that v e converges to zero considering the interference generated by the external disturbances and model uncertainties as mentioned above by defining v e as the error between the reference velocity v r and actual velocity v the tracking error can be denoted as v e v r v we also design the inner loop velocity loop sliding mode variable s v r4 as an integral sliding mode form 37 s v v e k v 0 t v e d t where k v represents positive definite diagonal matrices k v diag k v1 k v2 k v3 k v4 as mentioned before the inner loop control law is also in the following form 38 τ t τ eq τ sw where τeq and τsw respectively symbolize the equivalent control law and switching control law in this paper we apply the inverse tangent function as the switching term 39 τ sw ρ 2 π arctan s v θ where arctan s v θ arctan s v 1 θ 1 arctan s v 2 θ 2 arctan s v 3 θ 3 arctan s v 4 θ 4 t θi i 1 2 3 4 denotes the thickness of the boundary layer which is positively defined according to 12 and 37 we can derive 40 s v v e k v v e v c m 0 1 c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d k v v e the inner loop controller is designed as follows 41 τ t c 0 v v d 0 v v m 0 v r k v v e ρ 2 π arctan s v θ theorem 3 if ρ satisfies the condition that ρ max τ d the inner loop system is at global asymptotic stability proof bringing equation 41 into equation 40 42 s v m 0 1 ρ 2 π arctan s v θ τ d consider the following lyapunov candidate 43 v 2 1 2 s v t m 0 s v find the derivative of 43 and consider equation 42 44 v 2 s v t m 0 s v s v t ρ 2 π arctan s v θ τ d ρ i 1 4 s v s v t τ d considering theorem 3 if ρ max τ d is satisfied we can conclude that v 2 0 according to the lyapunov stability analysis the inner loop system is at global asymptotic stability with t to ensure that both the inner and outer loops satisfy the stability at the same time we can take the value of k v k p this value can ensure that the inner loop converges faster than the outer loop thus ensuring that both the inner and outer loop systems satisfy the lyapunov stability analysis 4 numerical simulations in this section the numerical simulation method is used to compare the performance of different switching terms and two types of controllers the rov model considered in the simulations is the haima rov and its hydrodynamic parameters are shown in appendix a the umbilical cable interference force model proposed by li et al 2018 is adopted because the rov and umbilical cable in li s paper have a similar in size and weight as those in this paper and his interference force model has been experimentally verified the cable parameters are shown in appendix a without a loss of generality the uncertainty of the model is represented by a sinusoidal function similar to the functions of wang et al 2016 and shojaei and arefi 2015 in summary the umbilical cable interference forces and torques τ d and model uncertainties τ u can be expressed as follows τ d f x 942 3 0429 x 0 1314 y 2 0 225 z 2 28 4706 z f y 8 2134 y f z 450 0 0684 x 2 4 7493 x 0 1125 y 2 0 693 z 2 33 2529 z m ψ f x f y f z 0 1 where x y and z represent the position of the rov in the inertial frame τ u τ d x 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d y 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d z 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d r 100 s i n 0 2 t measurement noise will cause reduction of the tracking precision and vibration in the control input so in order to make the simulation results closer to the experiment the measurement noise of the sensors must be considered a white noise with variance of 10 6 is added to the feedback positions to simulate the measurement noise the navigation of the rov is generally close to the bottom of the sea due to the complex geographical environment of the seabed with the uneven terrain the simulation path selects the scene with undulations on the seabed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed switching term and control schemes more comprehensively two typical rov operations are simulated one has a 3 d dubins desired trajectory tracking case and the other has an integrated trajectory which includes the common settings of the rov such as fixed height fixed depth and fixed heading angle 4 1 dubins desired trajectory tracking the simulation path is a rov dive in a straight line for 20 s followed by a set height of 3 m along the irregular slope of the sea to carry out a predefined comb shape cruise the desired trajectory in the inertial frame is described as follows x d t 0 m 0 t 20 s 0 2 t 20 m 20 t 40 s sin 0 05 π t 40 4 m 40 t 60 s 0 2 t 60 4 m 60 t 80 s sin 0 05 π t 80 80 t 100 s 0 2 t 100 m 100 t 120 s y d t 1 m 0 t 20 s 1 m 20 t 40 s cos 0 05 π t 40 2 m 40 t 60

40 t 60 s π r a d 60 t 80 s π 0 05 π t 80 r a d 80 t 100 s 0 r a d 100 t 120 s the initial conditions of the rov are set as x 0 0 2 m y 0 1 4 m z 0 0 m ψ 0 0 1 rad u 0 v 0 w 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s to illustrate the suppression effect of the designed switching term including the effect of the inverse tangent function τ sw 2 π arctan s θ on the chattering the effect of the term is compared with that of several existing switching functions such as the signum function τ sw sgn s θ the saturation function τ sw s a t s θ and the hyperbolic tangent function τ sw tanh s θ where θ denotes the thickness of the boundary layer to eliminate the influence of other parameters the control parameters of expression 24 are fixed as d 1000 c 1 for all the switching terms the thickness of boundary layer θ 0 01 i the simulation results are shown in figs 3 5 fig 3 shows the trajectory tracking comparison of the csmc with four types of switching terms and dsmc the switching term of the double loop sliding mode control is the proposed inverse tangent function it can be concluded from fig 3 that all five methods achieved the established goals the errors in every direction in the inertial coordinate system are presented in fig 4 it can be clearly seen from the figure that the error is significantly higher for the conventional sliding mode control using the signum function than for that using other switching terms the heading angle error under this type of switching term becomes very large after 40 s indicating that the parameters selected in the above analysis cannot guarantee the convergence of the case since the rov is over driven the error in the heading angle does not cause a large deviation in the tracking path for the consistency of the simulation the control parameters are not set separately when the signum function is used as the switching term to satisfy the convergence condition the mean errors and root mean square errors rmse for five cases are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the control effect of inverse tangent function is equivalent to the effect of when the saturation function or the hyperbolic tangent function is used as the switching term in addition the errors of the double loop sliding mode control are similar to that of the conventional sliding mode control and the computational time of dsmc is slightly higher than that of csmc the thrust of each propeller in the rov in the five cases are shown in fig 5 thrusts 1 4 represent the thrust generated by the horizontal thrusters and thrusts 5 8 represent the thrust generated by the vertical thrusters it can be clearly seen from the figure that the conventional sliding mode control using the signum function as the switching term has a strong chattering effect especially after 40 s and the violent chattering output of the thrusters fails to make the rov move according to the predetermined heading angle the chattering phenomenon is significantly reduced when the other three switching terms are used at 40 s 60 s 80 s and 100 s the chattering phenomenon is intensified which is why the dubins desired trajectory is not smooth at the above instants this shows that the proposed inverse tangent switching term is superior to the signum function in terms of chattering suppression capability and has an equivalent chattering suppression as the other two functions however it can be concluded from fig 5 that even with the novel switching term the csmc still has an obvious chattering phenomenon one of the major causes is that the stream function s presented in 22 is a linear combination of the error terms of position and velocity when s approaches zero the position and velocity errors must also approach zero simultaneously meanwhile the switching term of the controller τ t is related to s when the sliding mode surface oscillates at a high frequency near zero the output of the controller also exhibits the chattering phenomenon in fact the change speeds of the position error and velocity error are different therefore it is difficult to ensure that the sliding surface s approaches zero rapidly this makes the chattering phenomenon of csmc difficult to eliminate from the simulation results it can be clearly concluded that when the inverse tangent function instead of the signum function is used as the switching term the phenomenon of chattering is significantly reduced and is equivalent to the term produced when the saturation function and hyperbolic tangent function are used in addition it can be clearly seen from fig 5 that the dsmc can significantly suppress the chattering phenomenon the output chattering of 8 thrusters is obviously reduced under the dsmc method the comparison of the mean value of the amplitude changes the differences between the peak and the adjacent valley of dsmc and csmc with inverse tangent as switching term are shown in table 3 it can be concluded that the dsmc method can reduce the chattering by 65 1 69 1 the simulation path is as follows the rov dives in a straight line for 40 s then follows a set height of 3 m along the irregular slope of the sea to carry out a fixed yaw angle cruise this desired path contains common operating conditions for rov operations such as a fixed depth fixed height and fixed yaw angle the desired trajectory in the inertial frame is described as follows x d t 0 m 0 t 40 s 2 10 t 40 m 40 t 250 s y d t 0 m 0 t 40 s 2 10 t 40 m 40 t 250 s z d t 0 3 t m 0 t 40 s 8 5 sin 0 1 π x 4 cos 0 1 π y m 40 t 250 s ψ d t 0 1 t r a d 0 t 5 π 2 s π 4 r a d 5 π 2 t 250 s the initial conditions of the rov are set as x 0 0 m y 0 0 m z 0 0 m ψ 0 0 rad u 0 v 0 w 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s since the effectiveness of the inverse tangent function as a switching term of the csmc was explained in the previous discussion the comparison between the csmc using the novel switching term and the dsmc is directly considered in this simulation meanwhile another chattering suppression fuzzy sliding mode method proposed by chen 1999 is also compared in this simulation fig 6 illustrates that all control methods enable the rov to complete the automatic navigation of a given path the control accuracy of the csmc and dsmc shown in fig 7 are higher than that of the fsmc especially the heading angle error the mean error and root mean square errors rmse for three cases are summarized in table 4 it can be concluded that the fuzzy sliding mode controller has the worst performance because the linguistic expression of the fuzzy controller makes it difficult to guarantee the stability and robustness and it is hard to define the proper fuzzy control rules and membership functions the complicated calculation process also caused double computational time than that of sliding mode control meanwhile it is also shown that the dsmc method has the best control accuracy and stability and its computational time only slightly increased than that of csmc in terms of chattering suppression the dsmc has a more obvious advantage fig 8 demonstrates that the chattering of the rov s eight thrusters is significantly reduced with the dsmc the comparison of the mean value of the amplitude changes the differences between the peak and the adjacent valley of dsmc and csmc are shown in table 5 it can be concluded that the dsmc method can reduce the chattering by 74 8 86 8 the simulation again verifies that the dsmc is an effective way to solve the problem of chattering generated by sliding mode control 5 conclusions to improve the automatic control performance of work class rovs and ensure that these rovs have the ability to complete automatic trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties this paper proposes a dsmc method that replaces the conventional switching term with a novel switching term the switching terms contained in the csmc are signum functions with discontinuities that cause chattering in the actuator the papers by slotine and li 1991 and kim et al 2015 propose the use of the saturation function and the hyperbolic tangent function to replace the sign function a method that has achieved good results in chattering suppression in this paper the inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term and the simulation proves that this method can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the csmc with an effect comparable to that of the saturation function and the hyperbolic tangent function however even in this case the csmc method using the novel switching term still has chattering to further reduce the occurrence of chattering this paper proposes applying the dsmc method to rov trajectory tracking by using the singular perturbation theory the control system is divided into a fast time varying subsystem and a slow time varying subsystem according to the state variable speed the cascaded system namely the inner loop control system velocity loop and outer loop control system position loop is designed with an integral sliding mode the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven the proposed inverse tangent function is still used as the switching term in the dsmc compared with the csmc the proposed control schemes exhibit two superiorities i e reducing the overshoot without losing the control precision and significantly enhancing chattering suppression simulation results compared the expected performances of the proposed dsmc with those of the csmc and fsmc in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise the dsmc error in all directions of the inertial coordinate system converge to a small neighbourhood of zero dsmc chattering is also reduced by 65 1 86 8 compared with csmc chattering in the dsmc mode the work class

22894,to ensure that a work class remotely operated vehicle rov has the ability to complete trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties this paper proposes a double loop sliding mode controller dsmc that replaces the conventional switching term with a novel switching term the inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term for conventional sliding mode controller csmc and the simulation proves that this function can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the csmc to further reduce the occurrence of chattering this paper proposes applying the dsmc to work class rov trajectory tracking the singular perturbation theory and the variable change speed concept illustrate how to divide the cascaded system into two subsystems the inner loop control system velocity loop and outer loop control system position loop the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven simulation results compare the expected performances of the proposed dsmc with the performance of the csmc and fuzzy smc in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise the dsmc errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero the chattering of the dsmc is also obviously reduced compared with that of the csmc keywords remotely operated vehicle rov trajectory tracking double loop sliding mode control switching term 1 introduction according to their operation methods underwater robots can be classified into autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs auvs can complete automatic trajectory tracking and path following so they are often used to complete tasks such as ocean observations and hydrological information collection however auvs cannot communicate with the land in real time so it is difficult to complete complex underwater operations with these underwater robots work class rovs are generally equipped with manipulators which can perform underwater heavy duty operations moreover rovs have umbilical cables connected to mother ships which enable real time communication therefore work class rovs have been widely used in deep sea exploration pipeline maintenance and deep sea mining efforts most of the rovs are manually operated especially when working in the deep sea two operators are required to cooperatively control one rov one person is responsible for controlling the body movement and the other person controls the manipulators rov control accuracy and efficiency are completely determined by the operators experience and the operating cost is very high zhao and yuh 2005 therefore improving the automatic control capability of rovs is currently a hot issue schjølberg and utne 2015 due to the complexity of the marine environment rovs are often disturbed by the undercurrent of the seabed moreover the unit weight of the rov umbilical cable is relatively large when an rov is operated at a large depth the umbilical cable will greatly interfere with the rov movement the vu et al 2017 at the same time rov dynamics are highly coupled and nonlinear the irregular shape of rovs makes it difficult to accurately describe rov hydrodynamic characteristics and create model uncertainties the above problems all lead to considerable difficulties in rov automatic control since the umbilical has a significant influence on rov dynamics many scholars have used methods to model the underwater dynamic responses of umbilicals to describe their effects on rovs these modelling methods include finite element methods o a eidsvik and schjølberg 2016 2018 finite difference methods burgess 1992 catenary equations li et al 2018 and the lump mass spring model mai et al 2017 in fang et al 2007 the force between the umbilical and the rov was treated as a two end boundary value problem and then they solved this problem by using a multi step shooting method in the present paper the conclusion of li et al 2018 is adopted to describe the effect of umbilical cable strength on rovs because the model proposed by li has been verified experimentally and the model object of li s paper was a work class rov with a similar size and weight the chosen object of the present paper due to the difficulty of describing the umbilical cable s effect on the rov some simplifying assumptions about the dynamic response of the umbilical can be made and many researchers such as huo et al 2018 and wang et al 2015 have used a simplified umbilical model moreover some small observation rovs ignore the effects of the umbilical in addition to the interference force of the umbilical the ocean current force and the model uncertainties pose challenges to rov automatic control to solve these problems many advanced control methods can be applied to rov control such as adaptive control antonelli et al 2003 hoang and kreuzer 2007 maalouf et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 sliding mode control bessa et al 2010 elmokadem et al 2016 garcí a valdovinos et al 2009 guo et al 2003 m kim et al 2015 soylu et al 2008 fuzzy logic control chen et al 2016 huo et al 2018 khodayari and balochian 2015 backstepping control do 2015 raygosa barahona et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zhu and gu 2011 and neural network control chu et al 2017 gao et al 2015 kim and kim 2014 sliding mode control smc is characterized by a simple form strong robustness tolerance of model uncertainty and transient stability qiao et al 2017 however sliding mode control has the problem of chattering phenomena the sliding surface function contains a switching term which is a discontinuous feedback component it is in charge of compensating for deviations from the desired dynamics however it not only acts as the source of the robustness of the smc law but also acts on the system in a bang bang manner thus creating chatter in the actuators and causing the system state to oscillate intensely across the sliding manifold slotine and li 1991 for rov control the chattering phenomenon causes high frequency changes in the speed of the thrusters which leads to high energy consumption increased friction and thruster damage work class rovs are generally equipped with hydraulically propelled thrusters which cannot meet excessive frequency speed changes therefore the actual control effect of the csmc is not ideal many advanced methods have been used to solve the chattering problem of csmcs bessa et al 2010 adopted a smc strategy that was enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm for uncertainty and disturbance compensation the control scheme was employed for the dynamic positioning of the rov and the results showed that the incorporation of an adaptive fuzzy algorithm within the boundary layer resulted in a better trade off between tracking performance and chattering soylu et al 2008 proposed a chattering free method for rov systems that uses an adaptive term in place of the conventional discontinuous switching term this adaptive term continuously compensates for unknown system dynamics without a priori knowledge of the upper bounds in addition the parameterization of both a regressor matrix and unknown parameter vector are not required for the adaptive term in csmcs the discontinuous switching term is the main reason for chattering thus terminal smc tsmc which uses continuous functions instead of discontinuous functions as the switching term has become a method for solving the chattering problem furthermore non singular terminal smc ntsmc has been proposed and has the advantage of not only avoiding the singularity problem caused by the tsmc but also eliminating the chattering problem elmokadem et al 2017 patre et al 2018 qiao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b however these aforementioned methods use complex controllers and require many parameters to be set which makes implementing these methods too difficult in practice to reduce the chattering phenomena of csmc to achieve control accuracy and to improve the response time of the controller we first proposed a novel switching function that replaces the signum function with an inverse tangent function second a double loop sliding mode controller dsmc was proposed for work class rovs to achieve precise trajectory tracking performance with the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties the double loop control structure has been widely used in electronic throttle valve control li et al 2015 uuv control qiao and zhang 2018b and uav control bertrand et al 2011 to date few researchers have employed double loop control for work class rovs in this paper according to singular perturbation theory and the state variable speed concept mehra et al 1979 the cascade system is divided into two parts fast time varying systems and slow time varying systems for the rov we design the double loop controller as two parts an outer loop controller velocity loop which is the slow time varying system and an inner loop controller position loop which is the fast time varying system the outer loop controller is utilized to achieve accurate positioning and attitude tracking this controller creates a virtual control input for the inner loop which is considered the reference velocity the inner loop controller is designed to let the rov s actual velocity accurately track the reference velocity in this way external disturbances and system uncertainties are eliminated in the inner loop which can guarantee that the rov will achieve a precise trajectory tracking performance and improve the response time of the controller in this paper double loop sliding mode control is compared with the conventional sliding mode control and fuzzy sliding mode control fsmc simulations of two types of trajectory tracking paths are performed on the haima rov to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed double loop controller the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 a novel inverse tangent switching term function is proposed to replace the commonly used signum function the continuity of this function can reduce the chattering phenomenon of csmc 2 singular perturbation theory is used to categorize the rov state as a fast time varying and slow time varying system at a given time scale this contribution laid a theoretical foundation for the dsmc proposal 3 based on lyapunov analysis the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven the comparative studies with the csmc and fsmc are carried out on the haima rov simulation studies of two types of trajectory tracking are carried out to illustrate the superior performance of the dsmc 2 problem formulation 2 1 rov kinematics haima the typical work class rov shown in fig 1 is equipped with eight thrusters and can complete 3d spatial movement two coordinate frames namely the inertial frame and body fixed frame are usually defined to describe the motion of rovs the state variable with respect to the body fixed frame are represented by v v v 1 t v 2 t v 1 t u v w t represents the linear velocity and v 2 t p q r t represents the angular velocity the state variable with respect to the inertial frame are denoted by η η η 1 t η 2 t η 1 t x y z t η 2 t ϕ θ ψ t η 1 t represents the position of the rov in the inertial frame and η 2 t represents the orientations by using a jacobian transformation matrix j ϕ θ ψ η the relationship between the derivatives of the inertial coordinate η and the linear and angular velocities in the body fixed frame v can be expressed as 1 η j ϕ θ ψ η v j ϕ θ ψ η stands for the jacobian transformation matrix and can be defined as 2 j ϕ θ ψ η j 1 ϕ θ ψ η 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 2 ϕ θ η j 1 ϕ θ ψ η and j 2 ϕ θ η are defined as 3 j 1 ϕ θ ψ η c ψ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ

t tan since work class rovs have very large masses and volumes and a strong recovery torque for buoyancy rovs can be considered to have the ability to self balance in the xz plane and the yz plane consequently the assumption that ϕ θ 0 is satisfied therefore the rov six degree freedom equation 1 can be reduced to a four degree freedom equation as follows 4 η j ψ η v expressing this equation as a matrix we can obtain the following expression 5 x y z ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 u v w r 2 2 rov dynamics the shape of a general work class rov can basically be considered a rectangular parallelepiped with three symmetrical faces the rov has a low speed generally less than 1 m s therefore the hydrodynamic parameters of the rov can be simplified the dynamic equation of a rov in the body fixed frame can be expressed by the following equation 6 m v c v v d v v g η τ t τ d where m r4 4 is the mass matrix which includes rigid mass and added mass c v r4 4 is the coriolis and centripetal force matrix d v r4 4 is the damping terms matrix and g η r4 4 is the restoring force matrix in general the work class rov is designed so that gravity equal to buoyancy i e g η 0 is satisfied τ t r4 is the control force and moment vector τ d r4 is the vector that contains the external disturbance forces and torques the mass matrix m m rb m a where m rb is the mass matrix of the rigid body and m a is the added mass matrix 7 m r b m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 i z 8 m a x u 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0 z w 0 0 0 0 n r where m represents the mass of the rov and iz represents the rov moment of inertia about the z axis x u y v z w and n r represent the corresponding added mass and additional inertia thus m can be simply expressed as soylu et al 2008 chu et al 2017 9 m d i a g m x u m y v m z w i z n r considering that the rov has a very low speed and a shape that consists of three symmetry planes the rov coriolis and centripetal force coefficient can be simplified as follows 10 c v 0 0 0 m y v v 0 0 0 m x u u 0 0 0 0 m y v v m x u u 0 0 due to the structure and design features of the rov its higher order damping can be neglected only the first order and second order damping coefficients need to be considered therefore the following equation is expressed as 11 d v d i a g x u x u u u y v y v v v z w z w w w n r n r r r the above hydrodynamic parameters are generally obtained with experiments but it is difficult to guarantee parameter accuracy due to the complexity of real sea conditions therefore the parameters remain uncertain thus m c v d v in 6 can be written as the sum of the nominal dynamics m 0 c 0 v and d 0 v and dynamic uncertainties δm δc v and δd v i e m m 0 δ m c v c 0 v δ c v d v d 0 v δ d v then the dynamic equation can be rewritten as the following form 12 m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d where τ d is the sum of the external disturbance τ d and system uncertainty τ u which are defined as 13 τ d τ d τ u τ d δ m v δ c v v δ d v v the forces and moments produced in each degree of freedom are defined as the input vector τ t f u f v f w m r t the relationship between the input vector τ t and the force of eight thrusters can be calculated by the following thrust distribution matrix 14 τ t b u where u r8 is the vector collecting the forces produced by the eight thrusters the specific form of b r4 8 which is the thrust distribution matrix is presented in appendix b a work class rov is generally equipped with hydraulic propulsion thrusters due to the special characteristics of the hydraulic thrusters the saturation limits and rate limits of the thrusts should be considered in general a saturation function block and a first order inertial element can be used to simulate thruster characteristics huo et al 2018 in this paper the thrust limit of the four horizontal thrusters is 355 kg to 296 kgf 3481 4n to 2902 8n and the thrust limit of the four vertical thrusters is 198 kgf to 176 kgf 1941 7n to 1726 0n the first order inertial element is expressed as 15 τ t 25 τ t 25 u 3 controller design according to the previous description by combining 4 and 12 the kinematics and dynamics equation of the rov can be expressed as fossen 1994 16 m 0 v c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d η j ψ η v to compare the abilities of the controllers to guarantee a satisfactory tracking performance with external disturbances and model uncertainties this section presents two control methods the csmc and the dsmc both methods have been shown to be asymptotically stable with lyapunov s law the dynamics expressed by 16 possess the following assumption which are used in the subsequent control law development and closed loop stability analysis assumption 1 all model uncertainties i e δ m δ c v a n d δ d v are bounded and external disturbances are also bounded hence the assumption that τ d in expression 16 is bounded and has a certainty bounder can be proposed elements in τ d match the condition that for i 1 2 3 and 4 τ d i ξ 3 1 conventional sliding mode controller before we design the controller we first derive the second derivatives of η on both sides of 4 by multiplying j ψ 1 η and taking the derivative with respect to time we have 17 v j ψ 1 η η j ψ η v substituting 17 into 16 we have 18 η j ψ η v j ψ η m 0 1 c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d according to previous studies slotine and li 1991 utkin 2003 the conventional sliding mode control is well known for its robustness to model uncertainties and external disturbances by defining η e as the error between the desired position η d and the current position η the tracking error can be denoted as η e η d η the conventional sliding surface is thus defined as 19 s λ η e η e where s r4 λ diag λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ 4 and λ i is a positive constant for all i 1 4 the standard sliding mode control law is in the form soylu et al 2008 20 τ t τ eq τ sw where τeq and τsw represent the equivalent control law and switching control law respectively in general the equivalent control law is continuous and involves model information the main purpose of this law is to drive the controlled object to realize the desired dynamics however due to external disturbances and model uncertainties an auxiliary switching term is utilized to offset the difference between the desired and real dynamics in csmc the switching term is defined as a discontinuous feedback component with a general form of τsw k sign s k is a positive definite diagonal gain matrix and the value of k is higher than the upper bound of the interference which has the effect of eliminating the effects of external disturbances and model uncertainties the use of a nonlinear discontinuous signum function makes the switching term act in the bang bang manner which is not only the source of the robustness of the control law but also creates the chattering phenomenon to preserve the switching characteristics of the signum function while eliminating the adverse effects caused by its discontinuity many substitution functions have been utilized to act as the switching term such as the saturation function slotine and li 1991 and hyperbolic tangent function kim et al 2015 in this paper we apply the inverse tangent function as the switching term 21 τ sw 2 π arctan s θ where arctan s θ arctan s 1 θ 1 arctan s 2 θ 2 arctan s 3 θ 3 s 4 θ 4 t θ i i 1 2 3 4 denotes the thickness of the boundary layer which is positively defined the model based equivalent control law component can be derived by assuming that the motion is constrained to the sliding manifold by substituting 18 into the derivation of 19 the following can be obtained 22 s λ η e η e λ η e η d η λ η e η d j ψ η v j ψ η m 0 1 c 0 v v d 0 v v τ t τ d let the equivalent control law be 23 τ eq c 0 v v d 0 v v j ψ η

theorem 1 consider the nonlinear dynamical system described by eq 16 with assumption 1 the stability of the closed loop control system can be guaranteed with the control law expressed as eq 24 proof defining the lyapunov function candidate 25 v 1 2 s t s taking the derivative of 25 and substituting 22 into 25 the following results can be obtained 26 v s t s s t d 2 π arctan s v θ j ψ η m 0 1 τ d s t d s t j ψ η m 0 1 τ d considering assumption 1 to be satisfied it can be inferred that j ψ η m 0 1 τ d d is established when a proper d is chosen then we can guarantee that v 0 with barbalat s lemma popov 1974 slotine and li 1991 since v is lower bounded v 0 v is negative semi definite v 0 and v 1 0 can be expressed as t therefore η e 0 η e 0 can be expressed as t thus the system is of global asymptotic stability 3 2 double loop sliding mode control 3 2 1 analysis of state parameters based on singular perturbation theory fully expanding the formulas described by 16 yields 8 total state parameters as described in the following formula 27 x cos ψ u sin ψ v y sin ψ u cos ψ v z w ψ r m v x u u m v y v v r x u x u u u u τ t 1 τ d 1 m v y v v m v x u u r y v y v v v v τ t 2 τ d 2 m

system in the singularly perturbed form is not easy in this paper the concept of state variable speed proposed by mehra et al 1979 is adopted to determine the multi time scale structure so that decomposition of the full mode 27 can be analysed the state equation 27 can be expressed as x f x τ where x represents the state variables and τ represents the control input vector due to the limitations of objective physical conditions and design requirements such as the maximum allowable submersible speed and the motion range limitation caused by the cable the state variables x i i 1 2 n have certain upper and lower limits i e x i min x i x i max the speed of the state variables is represented by s i which can be defined as follows 28 s i x i δ x i f i x τ x i max x i min the above definition can be used to calculate the speed of state variables and effectively separate the variables at the time scale we consider the reference value x of the state of the region of interest which can satisfy 29 s i 1 δ x i max f i x τ hence the speed of the state variables can be calculated the result is shown in the following table from the above table the state variables can be divided into two groups according to the speed of the state variables the position and attitude state vector η x y z ψ t is the slow time varying state vector and the linear and angular speed vector v u v w r t is the fast time varying state vector 3 2 2 double loop sliding mode controller design the state variables are divided into slow time varying variables and fast time varying variables on a time scale the fast time varying variables vector v includes linear and angular velocity in the body fixed frame the slow time varying variables vector η includes position and yaw angle in the inertial frame therefore the control process can be divided into two steps the internal and external parts as depicted in fig 2 the whole control program involves two loops the outer loop is designed to achieve precise position and attitude through the information of the desired position and feedback current position then a virtual control input v r is generated by the out loop controller as a reference velocity considering the error between the virtual control input v r and the actual speed vector v the inner loop controller produces the ideal thrusts for each degree of freedom to realize the accurate tracking of the reference velocity the advantage of this method is that external disturbances and model uncertainties are eliminated by the inner loop controller so more accurate tracking of the position and attitude can be achieved with the outer loop controller compared with the csmc this method is considered an effective way to remove the chattering phenomenon and guarantee tracking accuracy in this paper a typical double loop control is proposed both the inner and outer loop controllers are used for integral sliding mode control according to the classification of state parameters in the previous section we named the inner loop as the speed loop and the outer loop the position loop for clarity 3 3 outer loop position loop controller design if η e is defined as the error between the desired position η d and current position η the tracking error can be denoted as η e η d η if the outer loop position loop sliding mode variable s p r4 is designed as an integral sliding mode form 30 s p η e k p 0 t η e d t where k p represents positive definite diagonal matrices k p diag k p1 k p2 k p3 k p4 choosing an appropriate gain matrix k p can make the tracking error finally stable on an ideal sliding surface the derivation of 30 can be obtained as 31 s p η e k p η e the purpose of designing the outer loop controller is to generate a virtual control input for the inner loop controller let the virtual control input be defined as the reference velocity v r the error between the reference velocity v r and true velocity v is v e substituting v e v r v in 4 we have 32 η j ψ η v r v r v j ψ η v r j ψ η v e according to 31 and 32 we can derive 33 s p η e k p η e η d η k p η e η d j ψ η v r j ψ η v e k p η e we design the virtual control input reference velocity v r as 34 v r j ψ 1 η η d k p η e j ψ 1 η ρ 1 s p where ρ 1 is positive theorem 2 if the chosen virtual control input 34 is applied the defined outer loop sliding mode function 30 will converge to the equilibrium point with the condition that v e 0 proof define the lyapunov function candidate as 35 v 1 1 2 s p t s p taking the derivative of 35 the results are 36 v 1 s p t s p s p t η d j ψ η v r j ψ η v e k p η e s p t η d j ψ η j ψ 1 η η d k p η e j ψ 1 η ρ 1 s p j ψ η v e k p η e ρ 1 s p 2 s p t j ψ η v e from 36 it can be deduced that if v e converges to zero v 1 0 is established therefore the designed virtual control input 34 can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the outer loop sliding manifold s p and the desired trajectory tracking in the next step the inner loop controller is designed such that v e satisfies the condition of converging to zero which will ultimately make the entire system tend to be stable 3 4 inner loop velocity loop controller design the ability of actual velocity v to track the virtual velocity v r determines the preciseness of position tracking so the inner loop controller is designed to guarantee that v e converges to zero considering the interference generated by the external disturbances and model uncertainties as mentioned above by defining v e as the error between the reference velocity v r and actual velocity v the tracking error can be denoted as v e v r v we also design the inner loop velocity loop sliding mode variable s v r4 as an integral sliding mode form 37 s v v e k v 0 t v e d t where k v represents positive definite diagonal matrices k v diag k v1 k v2 k v3 k v4 as mentioned before the inner loop control law is also in the following form 38 τ t τ eq τ sw where τeq and τsw respectively symbolize the equivalent control law and switching control law in this paper we apply the inverse tangent function as the switching term 39 τ sw ρ 2 π arctan s v θ where arctan s v θ arctan s v 1 θ 1 arctan s v 2 θ 2 arctan s v 3 θ 3 arctan s v 4 θ 4 t θi i 1 2 3 4 denotes the thickness of the boundary layer which is positively defined according to 12 and 37 we can derive 40 s v v e k v v e v c m 0 1 c 0 v v

system is at global asymptotic stability proof bringing equation 41 into equation 40 42 s v m 0 1 ρ 2 π arctan s v θ τ d consider the following lyapunov candidate 43 v 2 1 2 s v t m 0 s v find the derivative of 43 and consider equation 42 44 v 2 s v t m 0 s v s v t ρ 2 π arctan s v θ τ d ρ i 1 4 s v s v t τ d considering theorem 3 if ρ max τ d is satisfied we can conclude that v 2 0 according to the lyapunov stability analysis the inner loop system is at global asymptotic stability with t to ensure that both the inner and outer loops satisfy the stability at the same time we can take the value of k v k p this value can ensure that the inner loop converges faster than the outer loop thus ensuring that both the inner and outer loop systems satisfy the lyapunov stability analysis 4 numerical simulations in this section the numerical simulation method is used to compare the performance of different switching terms and two types of controllers the rov model considered in the simulations is the haima rov and its hydrodynamic parameters are shown in appendix a the umbilical cable interference force model proposed by li et al 2018 is adopted because the rov and umbilical cable in li s paper have a similar in size and weight as those in this paper and his interference force model has been experimentally verified the cable parameters are shown in appendix a without a loss of generality the uncertainty of the model is represented by a sinusoidal function similar to the functions of wang et al 2016 and shojaei and arefi 2015 in summary the umbilical cable interference forces and torques τ d and model uncertainties τ u can be expressed as follows τ d f x 942 3 0429 x 0 1314 y 2 0 225 z 2 28 4706 z f y 8 2134 y f z 450 0 0684 x 2 4 7493 x 0 1125 y 2 0 693 z 2 33 2529 z m ψ f x f y f z 0 1 where x y and z represent the position of the rov in the inertial frame τ u τ d x 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d y 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d z 100 s i n 0 2 t τ d r 100 s i n 0 2 t measurement noise will cause reduction of the tracking precision and vibration in the control input so in order to make the simulation results closer to the experiment the measurement noise of the sensors must be considered a white noise with variance of 10 6 is added to the feedback positions to simulate the measurement noise the navigation of the rov is generally close to the bottom of the sea due to the complex geographical environment of the seabed with the uneven terrain the simulation path selects the scene with undulations on the seabed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed switching term and control schemes more comprehensively two typical rov operations are simulated one has a 3 d dubins desired trajectory tracking case and the other has an integrated trajectory which includes the common settings of the rov such as fixed height fixed depth and fixed heading angle 4 1 dubins desired trajectory tracking the simulation path is a rov dive in a straight line for 20 s followed by a set height of 3 m along the irregular slope of the sea to carry out a predefined comb shape cruise the desired trajectory in the inertial frame is described as follows x d t 0 m 0 t 20 s 0 2 t 20 m 20 t 40 s sin 0 05 π t 40 4 m 40 t 60 s 0 2 t 60 4 m 60 t 80 s sin 0 05 π t 80 80 t 100 s 0 2 t 100 m 100 t 120 s y d t 1 m 0 t 20 s 1 m 20 t 40 s cos 0 05 π t 40 2 m 40 t 60

40 t 60 s π r a d 60 t 80 s π 0 05 π t 80 r a d 80 t 100 s 0 r a d 100 t 120 s the initial conditions of the rov are set as x 0 0 2 m y 0 1 4 m z 0 0 m ψ 0 0 1 rad u 0 v 0 w 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s to illustrate the suppression effect of the designed switching term including the effect of the inverse tangent function τ sw 2 π arctan s θ on the chattering the effect of the term is compared with that of several existing switching functions such as the signum function τ sw sgn s θ the saturation function τ sw s a t s θ and the hyperbolic tangent function τ sw tanh s θ where θ denotes the thickness of the boundary layer to eliminate the influence of other parameters the control parameters of expression 24 are fixed as d 1000 c 1 for all the switching terms the thickness of boundary layer θ 0 01 i the simulation results are shown in figs 3 5 fig 3 shows the trajectory tracking comparison of the csmc with four types of switching terms and dsmc the switching term of the double loop sliding mode control is the proposed inverse tangent function it can be concluded from fig 3 that all five methods achieved the established goals the errors in every direction in the inertial coordinate system are presented in fig 4 it can be clearly seen from the figure that the error is significantly higher for the conventional sliding mode control using the signum function than for that using other switching terms the heading angle error under this type of switching term becomes very large after 40 s indicating that the parameters selected in the above analysis cannot guarantee the convergence of the case since the rov is over driven the error in the heading angle does not cause a large deviation in the tracking path for the consistency of the simulation the control parameters are not set separately when the signum function is used as the switching term to satisfy the convergence condition the mean errors and root mean square errors rmse for five cases are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the control effect of inverse tangent function is equivalent to the effect of when the saturation function or the hyperbolic tangent function is used as the switching term in addition the errors of the double loop sliding mode control are similar to that of the conventional sliding mode control and the computational time of dsmc is slightly higher than that of csmc the thrust of each propeller in the rov in the five cases are shown in fig 5 thrusts 1 4 represent the thrust generated by the horizontal thrusters and thrusts 5 8 represent the thrust generated by the vertical thrusters it can be clearly seen from the figure that the conventional sliding mode control using the signum function as the switching term has a strong chattering effect especially after 40 s and the violent chattering output of the thrusters fails to make the rov move according to the predetermined heading angle the chattering phenomenon is significantly reduced when the other three switching terms are used at 40 s 60 s 80 s and 100 s the chattering phenomenon is intensified which is why the dubins desired trajectory is not smooth at the above instants this shows that the proposed inverse tangent switching term is superior to the signum function in terms of chattering suppression capability and has an equivalent chattering suppression as the other two functions however it can be concluded from fig 5 that even with the novel switching term the csmc still has an obvious chattering phenomenon one of the major causes is that the stream function s presented in 22 is a linear combination of the error terms of position and velocity when s approaches zero the position and velocity errors must also approach zero simultaneously meanwhile the switching term of the controller τ t is related to s when the sliding mode surface oscillates at a high frequency near zero the output of the controller also exhibits the chattering phenomenon in fact the change speeds of the position error and velocity error are different therefore it is difficult to ensure that the sliding surface s approaches zero rapidly this makes the chattering phenomenon of csmc difficult to eliminate from the simulation results it can be clearly concluded that when the inverse tangent function instead of the signum function is used as the switching term the phenomenon of chattering is significantly reduced and is equivalent to the term produced when the saturation function and hyperbolic tangent function are used in addition it can be clearly seen from fig 5 that the dsmc can significantly suppress the chattering phenomenon the output chattering of 8 thrusters is obviously reduced under the dsmc method the comparison of the mean value of the amplitude changes the differences between the peak and the adjacent valley of dsmc and csmc with inverse tangent as switching term are shown in table 3 it can be concluded that the dsmc method can reduce the chattering by 65 1 69 1 the simulation path is as follows the rov dives in a straight line for 40 s then follows a set height of 3 m along the irregular slope of the sea to carry out a fixed yaw angle cruise this desired path contains common operating conditions for rov operations such as a fixed depth fixed height and fixed yaw angle the desired trajectory in the inertial frame is described as follows x d t 0 m 0 t 40 s 2 10 t 40 m 40 t 250 s y d t 0 m 0 t 40 s 2 10 t 40 m 40 t 250 s z d t 0 3 t m 0 t 40 s 8 5 sin 0 1 π x 4 cos 0 1 π y m 40 t 250 s ψ d t 0 1 t r a d 0 t 5 π 2 s π 4 r a d 5 π 2 t 250 s the initial conditions of the rov are set as x 0 0 m y 0 0 m z 0 0 m ψ 0 0 rad u 0 v 0 w 0 0 m s r 0 0 rad s since the effectiveness of the inverse tangent function as a switching term of the csmc was explained in the previous discussion the comparison between the csmc using the novel switching term and the dsmc is directly considered in this simulation meanwhile another chattering suppression fuzzy sliding mode method proposed by chen 1999 is also compared in this simulation fig 6 illustrates that all control methods enable the rov to complete the automatic navigation of a given path the control accuracy of the csmc and dsmc shown in fig 7 are higher than that of the fsmc especially the heading angle error the mean error and root mean square errors rmse for three cases are summarized in table 4 it can be concluded that the fuzzy sliding mode controller has the worst performance because the linguistic expression of the fuzzy controller makes it difficult to guarantee the stability and robustness and it is hard to define the proper fuzzy control rules and membership functions the complicated calculation process also caused double computational time than that of sliding mode control meanwhile it is also shown that the dsmc method has the best control accuracy and stability and its computational time only slightly increased than that of csmc in terms of chattering suppression the dsmc has a more obvious advantage fig 8 demonstrates that the chattering of the rov s eight thrusters is significantly reduced with the dsmc the comparison of the mean value of the amplitude changes the differences between the peak and the adjacent valley of dsmc and csmc are shown in table 5 it can be concluded that the dsmc method can reduce the chattering by 74 8 86 8 the simulation again verifies that the dsmc is an effective way to solve the problem of chattering generated by sliding mode control 5 conclusions to improve the automatic control performance of work class rovs and ensure that these rovs have the ability to complete automatic trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties this paper proposes a dsmc method that replaces the conventional switching term with a novel switching term the switching terms contained in the csmc are signum functions with discontinuities that cause chattering in the actuator the papers by slotine and li 1991 and kim et al 2015 propose the use of the saturation function and the hyperbolic tangent function to replace the sign function a method that has achieved good results in chattering suppression in this paper the inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term and the simulation proves that this method can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the csmc with an effect comparable to that of the saturation function and the hyperbolic tangent function however even in this case the csmc method using the novel switching term still has chattering to further reduce the occurrence of chattering this paper proposes applying the dsmc method to rov trajectory tracking by using the singular perturbation theory the control system is divided into a fast time varying subsystem and a slow time varying subsystem according to the state variable speed the cascaded system namely the inner loop control system velocity loop and outer loop control system position loop is designed with an integral sliding mode the stability of the full closed loop cascaded system is proven the proposed inverse tangent function is still used as the switching term in the dsmc compared with the csmc the proposed control schemes exhibit two superiorities i e reducing the overshoot without losing the control precision and significantly enhancing chattering suppression simulation results compared the expected performances of the proposed dsmc with those of the csmc and fsmc in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise the dsmc error in all directions of the inertial coordinate system converge to a small neighbourhood of zero dsmc chattering is also reduced by 65 1 86 8 compared with csmc chattering in the dsmc mode the work class rov performs the trajectory tracking task effectively and the chattering suppression of the thrusters is greatly improved acknowledgements this work is partly supported by the national science and
