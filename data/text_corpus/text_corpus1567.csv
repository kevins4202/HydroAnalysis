7835,study region two hyper arid regions atbara and kassala stations in sudan study focus the study aims to evaluate the potential of the d vine copula based quantile regression dvqr model for estimating daily eto during 2000 2015 based on various input structures further the dvqr model was compared with multivariate linear quantile regression mlqr bayesians model averaging quantile regression bmaqr empirical models emms and classical machine learning cml besides the cml models including random forest rf support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and m5 model tree m5tree were employed new hydrological insights for the region the original emms showed poor performance which improved after calibration techniques the dvqr mlqr and bmaqr models showed better performance than the calibrated emms however the dvqr model exhibited the highest accuracy than the mlqr and bmaqr models over two study sites the m5tree svm and xgboost models perfumed better than elm and rf models at both study sites the dvqr and xgboost models showed equivalent performance r2 nse and wia 0 99 mae and rmse 0 2 to the m5tree and svm models but they had significantly more accuracy than the calibrated emms mlqr bmaqr elm and rf models in two hyper arid regions overall the high dimensional dvqr model is recommended as a promising alternative technique for estimating daily eto in hyper arid climate conditions around the world graphical abstract ga1 keywords reference evapotranspiration empirical models quantile regression machine learning sudan hyper arid region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the capacity of vegetation and soil to evaporate during a specific period is known as evapotranspiration et which is strongly linked to meteorological variables soil moisture vegetation characteristics and other soil and atmospheric elements shiri 2013 tao and zhang 2011 wu 2020 yang et al 2015 the et plays a crucial role in determining the amount of water needed for agriculture hydrological processes evaluating agronomic systems etc chen et al 2020 also it is vital to accurately et estimation in order to develop irrigation strategies to maximize water resource efficiency ferreira et al 2019 et could be directly measured using experimental techniques such as eddy covariance devices lysimeters and bowen ratio energy balance feng et al 2017b zhang 2013 however these technologies are complex expensive and not practical in many areas pereira et al 2015 furthermore determining the et of each separate plant is a challenging task therefore reference evapotranspiration eto yang et al 2015 can be estimated before being converted to the et of a target plant by using a crop coefficient the eto is defined as the evaporation of the hypothetical grass with a constant altitude of 0 12 m a uniform surface resistance of 70 sm 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 accurate estimation of eto is critical for determining crop water requirements water budget optimizing irrigation scheduling and crop productivity developing computational models for et estimates which often rely on eto is a reliable alternative for overcoming this gap the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm model which was proposed in 1998 has been commonly utilized as the standard method for eto estimate in various parts around the world allen et al 1998 however the fao 56 pm model requires a wide range of meteorological data to be calculated including maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and net radiation fan et al 2016 which severely limits its global applicability generally the eto can be estimated using several empirical models emms which can be divided into five categories based on different inputs including pan evaporation temperature mass transfer and combining of meteorological parameters zhang et al 2018 based on various climatic condition and available datasets these emms can have different performances in different regions for instance mehdizadeh et al 2017a computed eto based on four types of emms including temperature mass transfer radiation and meteorological parameters across iran and concluded that the meteorological parameters based equations have the best performance due to a combination of most important parameters zhang et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of 31 emms for the eto estimation in the humid region of iran and demonstrated that two newly developed models based on solar radiation can be performed better than other emms muniandy et al 2016 used field observations in a humid region of malaysia to assess the capability of 26 emms they resulted that the penman model which is based on mass transfer offered the most accurate eto estimation some other researchers focused on calibrating the emms based on local climate conditions which showed poor performance in other regions the temperature based model hargreaves equation was calibrated in a humid region over china and was found to have a better estimation of eto compared to the original form of the hargreaves samani model feng et al 2017b furthermore mehdizadeh et al 2021 calibrated four emms including hargeraves samani romanenko priestley taylor and valiantzas over the climate zone in iran and demonstrated that the calibrated version of emms has better performance than the original version of emms therefore the calibration step for emms is essential to improve their capabilities in estimating eto with high accuracy recently the bayesians model averaging bma was applied in different water resource studies such as merging multiple satellite rainfall yumnam et al 2022 the probability distribution of crop yields ramsey 2020 hydrological post processing tyralis et al 2019a water level forecasting baran et al 2019 and runoff prediction huang et al 2019b they showed that the bmaqr has a high potential and excellent performance in the prediction stage from different input variables with lower uncertinity moreover copula emphasized the benefits of dependence mechanisms and margins individually in the modeling process increasing flexibility in selecting arbitrary distributions and copula families while remaining insensitive to outliers to these factors can increase the performance of a regression based model luciano et al 2008 a great effort has been successfully applied by different investigations of the bivariate copula hao and aghakouchak 2013 verhoest 2015 and high dimensional vine copula in hydrology liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the d vine copula dvqr and multiple linear mlqr based on quantile regression were applied to develop robustness of soil moisture retrieval based on satellite data and they reported that the dvqr model is an effective tool to model the dependent structure of nonlinear relationship among variables nguyen et al 2021 also wu et al 2022 demonstrated the dvqr model can predict agricultural drought accurately from different remote sensing data over china in this study we proposed to use the dvqr model for daily eto estimation for the frist time and compared it to the bmaqr model as considered benchmark of uncertainty as well as the mlqr model considered in this comparison therefore measuring the capabilities and effectiveness of these models in modeling a nonlinear phenomenon e g eto will improve agricultural water management with the rapidly developing of soft computing techniques and artificial intelligence concepts over the last few years the eto prediction using meteorological data has been regarded as a regression issue that can be tackled by many classical machine learning cml models kalteh 2016 dou and yang 2018b cml models are frequently utilized by researchers due to their simplicity in hyperparameter settings and the benefits of improved accuracy and robustness abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2016 guan 2020 patil and deka 2016 in recent decades the use of soft computing techniques for hydrological modeling has been successfully considered by various types of machine learning algorithms seifi et al 2020 ehteram et al 2022 mohammadi et al 2022 several studies have shown the capabilities of cml models to estimate the eto over the world such as support vector machine svm artificial neural network ann multilayer perceptron mlp generalized regression neural network grnn extreme gradient boosting xgboost m5 model tree m5tree random forest rf adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and extreme learning machine elm abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2017b mehdizadeh et al 2017a dou and yang 2018b 2018a riahi madvar and seifi 2018 unes et al 2020 ehteram et al 2022 the elm model was employed to estimate the monthly eto from meteorological data at two stations in serbia and compared to the different empirical equations which showed high accuracy than emms gocic et al 2016 fan et al 2018 estimated eto using svm elm and four tree based ensemble approaches in various climatic regions of china they discovered that xgboost models showed the best performance in order to measure the capabilities of cml approaches in estimating the eto in northwest china yu 2020 used ann svr and elm models they found that svr and elm achieved high accuracies in another study by bellido jimenez et al 2021 the eto was estimated using various cml models including mlp grnn elm svm rf and xgboost models in southern spain they reported that elm had the best performance among all applied soft computing techniques furthermore dong et al 2022 calculated the daily eto from 100 stations during 1961 2019 over china using elm convolutional neural network cnn and multiple adaptive regression splines mars they found that elm performed well in temperate monsoon zone tmz and temperate continental zone tcz overall the accuracy of cml models in eto estimation varies from region to region due to climate variability therefore the accurate estimate of eto has high benefits in advanced applications of hydrological processes and agricultural water management to predict the eto underframe of different input variables and also to reduce the uncertainty of the eto prediction via different quantile levels therefore the current study aims to compare the capabilities of different approaches including empirical models emms quantile regression qr and classical machine learning cml for estimating daily eto from meteorological variables based on different combinations during 2000 2015 over the hyper aired region in sudan then for this aim i the dvqr model was used for eto estimation for the first time and compared to mlqr and bmaqr models to evaluate the capabilities in modeling nonlinear relationships among the variables ii empirical models were used for eto estimation including the fao 56 pm model as a benchmark model iii the classical machine learning models were also used for eto estimation to compare with qr and emms model in two hyper arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the present study used two hyper aired regions in sudan as case studies located in the northeast of africa between 8 24 n and 21 39 e sudan is surrounded by chad central africa south sudan ethiopia eritrea and egypt fig 1 shows the sudan topography elevation nile river and location of meteorological stations the elevation ranged 29 2997 m according to digital elevation model dem data which was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution 90 m the general topography in sudan is a flat plain with some highest in the east west and south parts which are known as red sea hills jebel marra and nuba mountains respectively the nile river is known as the largest river in the world consisting of three main tributaries blue nile white nile and atbara river which contribute to 58 28 and 14 of the annual flow of the nile measured near the sudanese egyptian border at aswan basheer et al 2019 2 2 meteorological data used the daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax sunshine duration ssh wind speed at a height of 2 m u2 and mean relative humidity rh were obtained from the sudan national meteorological department snmd during 2000 2015 for two meteorological stations atbara and kassala across the hyper arid regions sudan other meteorological variables such as net radiation rn and saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea were calculated using the proposed approach by allen et al 1998 the quality of training and testing data was assessed by various statistical approaches such as minimum xmin maximum xmax mean xmean standard deviation xstd and coefficient of variation xcv which are presented in table 1 the rh notably has high xstd values with 9 77 and 13 16 during the training period and 8 36 and 11 93 during the testing period for atbara and kassala stations respectively also es ea and u2 indicate lower xstd values less than 2 0 however t tmax and rn are remarkable with lower xcv during the training and testing periods at both study sites 2 3 empirical models in this investigation two different types of empirical models including mass transfer based and temperature based were used to calculate the eto time series at atbara and kassala stations the fao 56 pm model is suggested as the only standard approach for defining and computing eto allen et al 1998 hence eto values calculated by the fao 56 pm model were chosen as such targets to calibrate and validate empirical models qr and cml models which are realistic and widely recognized by many prior studies muniandy et al 2016 feng et al 2017b three empirical models including hargreaves samani temperature based brockamp and tarbert mass transfer based were selected and used in the current study and their used equations are presented in table 2 2 4 quantile regression qr models quantile regression qr is a mathematical approach for estimating and inferring conditional quantile functions in this view the literature research suggests that the bmaqr model is more capable and efficiently to predict the target by considering the uncertainty of input variables bazrafshan 2022 hern et al 2011 in this present study different types of qr approaches such as d vine copula dvqr multivariate linear mlqr and bayesian model averaging bmaqr are considered to measure and comparing their capabilities and uncertinty in estimation daily eto over two hyper arid regions the description of employed approaches is provided as follows 2 4 1 d vine copula based quantile regression dvqr copulas are mathematical processes that merge numerous univariate margin distributions into one multivariate distribution function all of which have homogeneous distributions on the interval 0 1 sklar 1959 nelsen 2007 in order to describe the dependency across two variables throughout many hydrological investigations a bivariate copula was used whereas only a few numbers of investigations tackled the problems in higher dimensionality pair copula construction pcc also known as vine copula aas et al 2009 is a powerful and flexible tool for modeling higher dimensionality dependence structures that is based on decomposing conditionality bivariate copula density within every single product conventional vine copulas have been classified into two types canonical c vine and drawable vine copulas d vine the first catch all mutual dependences relating to the same element in contrast to the latter which specifies mutual dependence structure one by one time the main objective of the present study is to predict the conditional quantile q of predictor variables y eto at a particular quantile level α 0 1 for provided variables x 1 x n i e meteorological variables the inverse of a condition distributions equation as follows provided to successfully achieve this aim kraus and czado 2017 1 q α x 1 x n f y x 1 x n 1 α x 1 x n by considering v f y y and u j f j x j according to sklar s mathematical and the probability integral transform sklar 1959 eq 1 could be adjusted as 2 f y x 1 x n 1 α x 1 x n f y 1 c v u 1 u n 1 α u 1 u n the d vine copula was chosen in this study due to its flexibility to predict the daily eto from several combinations of meteorological variables tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh whereas six high dimensional models were built 4d 5d 6d 7d 8d 9d the dvqr model includes several families such as all parametric nonparametric elliptical archimedean bb itau twopar and onepar each family has a different formula to calculate the bivariate variable from multivariate variables in this study we selected all copula acs family frank clayton gumbel t t11 bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 joe and gaussian to model dependence structure between meteorological variables and daily eto the d vine copula concept in a hierarchical way was employed to model dependent and independent variables and fig 2 is represented the 5d d vine for the first meteorological combinations due to the concept of indirectly incorporating a variable selection process by the original d vine copula algorithm the dvqr is not only a capable technique for modeling nonlinear dependency structure between the variables but also dvqr can be used to choose parsimonious models because additionally this algorithm is can resolve the common problems associated with regression such as collinearity transformations and the inclusion and exclusions of covariates 2 4 2 multivariate linear based quantile regression mlqr a linear technique for parameterization of qr was proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 whereas koenker 2005 provided a more thorough discussion of the technique the approach uses procedures like linear regression to calculate the various quantile values of dependent variables based on predictive variables the key distinction between qr and linear regression is whether minimization takes conditional quantiles into account while linear regression takes the conditional mean of dependent variables into account a simple description of mlqr has been that it trains a linear model and then divides the data such that 100 q upon the values are below the estimated values of the trained model the mlqr has been applied as a frequency analysis in hydrology and water resources management studies franco villoria et al 2019 kaleris and langousis 2017 dogulu 2015 tyralis et al 2019b 2 4 3 bayesian model averaging based quantile regression bmaqr the bmaqr model works based on bayes hypothesis and generates a more reliable prediction according to probabilistic ability and products weights duan et al 2007 this process does not consider the uncertainty during the model selection stage which typically results in too optimistic outcomes the bmaqr has thus been used in various research such as eto estimation hernandez et al 2011 and streamflow simulations jiang et al 2012 based on the expectation maximization technique from a bayesian model predictor uncertainty can be addressed by considering every scenario and making judgments in addition prior distributions on uncertain variables must be generalized to a collection of models with shared parameter space various models mi out of the same parameterized family can be chosen to write as follows formulae for a specified set of independent factors x meteorological variables and y eto being the dependent response 3 f y x i 1 p y m i x p m i x the conditional probability of each model can be expressed as 4 p m i x p x m i p m i i p x m i p m i where 5 p x m i p x θ i m i p θ i m i d θ i several quantile values ranging from 0 to 1 have been used to reduce the uncertainty of qr models for dvqr and bmaqr the meadian quantiles values were selected which have given accurate predictions while for mlqr the q 0 5 quantile indicates high accuracy 2 5 machine learning models 2 5 1 extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2006b introduced elm feedforward neural network generally elm is divided into three layers input hidden and output layers nevertheless unlike to classical neural networks elm offers a much faster training speed and superior generalization ability huang et al 2006a gocic et al 2016 wu et al 2021 furthermore elm provides input weights at random and calculates output weights mathematically khosravi et al 2018 this differs from typical ann which requires more human involvement especially when determining optimal variables yaseen et al 2019 the elm model has been widely applied in hydrology and meteorology studies such as streamflow prediction rainfall runoff modeling eto estimation solar radiation modeling and dew point temperature prediction dong 2020 feng et al 2016 sanikhani 2018 taormina and chau 2015 2 5 2 random forest rf rf techniques are a recently proposed and widely used ensemble technique that may generate models for classifier and regress issues cutler et al 2007 this method employs several trees for estimation and during the application of the rf as a classifier the tree predictors randomly give the numerical number to labels moreover in the current study the rf model was employed as a regression tool while the inputs meteorological variables were implemented assembly at each node for creating a tree according to hosseinzadeh et al 2012 the rf approach only needs two user defined variables the number of variables utilized at every node and number of trees several studies used the rf model to estimate eto from meteorological variables such as feng et al 2017a and huang et al 2019a 2 5 3 support vector machine svm the svm model was introduced by vapnik 1998 as a supervised machine learning technique for pattern recognition and data science issues and also the svm has been extensively used for regression issues in the disciplines of agricultural production hydrology climatology and environmental research ferreira et al 2019 ghorbani 2017 generally this model utilizes non linear functions to select the most appropriate separating hyperplane to reduce errors during the training process wen 2015 in this case the input variables are often non linear and linearly associated with the outputs since they are mapped toward a large scale feature space kernel functions like the linear polynomial and radial basis functions have been used to transform input data into a high dimensional feature set in this study the radial basis kernel was employed as the most suitable kernel function based on the result of previous studies mehdizadeh et al 2017a 2 5 4 m5 model tree m5tree the m5tree model was proposed by quinlan 1992 for the first time which was later modified and rebuilt by wang and witten 1997 the m5tree model incorporates linear regression equations at the terminal nodes to establish a relationship between input and output variables the m5tree model scans all feasible splits and selects the one that optimizes the predicted error reduction typically there are two steps for implementing the m5tree model i the original data is separated into subgroups to construct a decision tree regarding the standard deviation upon the feature values and the predicted decrease in errors ii the overgrowth tree is reduced while the linear regression equation takes control of these sub trees 2 5 5 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost model was suggested by chen et al 2016 for the first time as the k classification and regression trees cart approach for gradient boosting machines gbms implementation the xgboost model is based on the concept of boost whereas aggregates all of a group of poor learners predictions in order to create a strength learner using additive training techniques in addition the xgboost model seeks to both avoid over fitting and reduce computational expenses this is achieved by condensing the optimization techniques to get the best computing efficiency while combining of the prediction and normalization elements additionally simultaneous computations are automatically carried out for functionalities in the xgboost model throughout the training recently a few studies employed the xgboost model in hydrological modeling research fan et al 2018 2 5 6 models construction three different categories of models were applied in the current study for eto estimation including emms qr and cml approaches emms model was calibrated by regression relationship between the eto equation as a dependent variable and meteorological variables as independent variables and qr and cml approaches were trained based on each model s learning algorithms and their specific criteria in all three applied models fao 56 was considered as the target variable and other meteorological variables were added as input for emms qr and cml models parameter settings for cml qr and dvqr6 models are listed in tables 11 14 in the appendix section the flowchart workflow of the cml qr and emm models was provided in fig 3 2 6 scenario definition for reference evapotranspiration estimation in this study six combinations of meteorological variables listed in table 3 as running scenarios were proposed to evaluate the influence of individual meteorological variables on eto prediction and the capability of emms qr and cml models in estimating daily eto across the hyper arid regions these combinations are 1 temperature based tmin tmax t 2 tmin tmax t and ssh 3 tmin tmax t ssh and u2 4 tmin tmax t ssh u2 and rn 5 tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn and es ea while the last combination includes all meteorological variables 6 tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh all applied models were trained using data from 2000 to 2011 and tested using data from 2012 to 2015 2 7 statistical metrics the capability and performance of cml qr and emms models for estimating daily eto from different meteorological data were evaluated against fao56 derived estimates using many statistical metrics wu 2020 the selected metrics include coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott s index of agreement wia mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse 6 r 2 i 1 m o i o i s i s i i 1 m o i o i 2 i 1 m s i s i 2 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 m o i s i 2 i 1 m o i o i 2 8 w i a 1 i 1 m o i s i 2 i 1 m s i o i o i o i 2 9 m a e i m i 1 m o i s i 10 r m s e 1 m i 1 m o i s i 2 where o i daily eto calculated based on the fao 56 pm model s i daily eto estimated for various models cml qr and emms o i and s i the average of eto and was calculated from fao 56 pm and other models cml qr and emms respectively the m represents the total number of days during the study period the r2 is a statistical metric that measures the relationship and agreement of calculated o i and estimated s i daily eto where the excellent value is 1 and indicates a positive correlation the quantified difference between both the calculated o i and estimated s i daily eto is measured by the nse with a target value of 1 by using the criteria suggested by moriasi 2007 predictive performance nse is split into five classes very good 0 75 nse 1 0 good 0 65 nse 0 75 satisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 acceptable 0 40 nse 0 50 and unsatisfactory nse 0 40 in order to standardize the measurement of each model s error willmott 1981 introduced wia which ranges from 0 to 1 wia represents the percentage of the mean square error to potential error the optimal match is represented by an agreement value of 1 and a total lack of agreement is represented by 0 while mae and rmse measure the amount of error associated with estimated models and their values range from 0 to and the perfect value is 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of empirical models emms three emms models such as hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert were used to estimate daily eto at the atbara and kassala stations as shown in table 2 the errors of original and calibrated emms at the atbara and kassala stations are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively all the emms have shown poor performance in estimating daily eto according to the nse value which indicates that it is unsatisfactory also the wia ranged from 0 07 to 0 337 across two stations in the training and testing period tables 4 and 5 show that the original hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert models could not estimate daily eto at the atbara and kassala stations additionally the calibration technique substantially increased the effectiveness of eto estimation using emms compared to their original forms as shown by the statistical metrics produced for the calibrated emms in tables 4 and 5 at the atbara and kassala stations among the calibrated emms the tarbert model exhibited the most accurate mass transfer model to estimate daily eto indicated in all statistical metrics r2 0 883 nse 0 624 wia 0 935 mae 1 17 mm day 1 and rmse 1 40 mm day 1 for atbara station and r2 0 910 nse 0 614 wia 0 934 mae 1 04 mm day 1 and rmse 1 26 mm day 1 for kassala station the calibrated hargreaves samani model showed lower performance than other calibrated emms across the atbara and kassala stations generally due to the locally calibrated original emms our results confirmed that the calibration technique could substantially increase the performance and potential of original emms ahmadi 2021 mehdizadeh et al 2021 mehdizadeh et al 2017b the calibrated forms of emms used in this study are presented in table 6 also fig 4 shows the boxplot distribution of daily eto estimated by original and calibrated emms compared to the fao 56 pm model as shown in fig 4 a and b the original forms of emms were smaller than the standard model distribution fao 56 pm across the atbara and kassala stations on the other hand the distributions of calibrated emms c and d were matched with the fao 56 pm model for the atbara and kassala stations respectively 3 2 3 2 comparison of quantile regression models the qr has recently been applied in hydrology studies based on different approaches the current study employed three qr models dvqr mlqr and bmaqr to estimate daily eto from multiple meteorological variables the statistical metrics include rmse mae wia nse and r2 of daily eto estimated with three qr models compared against the fao 56 pm model and they are presented in tables 7 and 8 for the atbara and kassala stations respectively the first and second temperature based combination and ssh input showed poor performance estimating daily eto with dvqr mlqr and bmaqr during the training and testing period at both study sites overall it can observe that increasing the number of meteorological variables as models input can improve the performance of all qr models in addition the performances throughout the training and testing periods were improved considerably due to the wind speed u2 added to the third combination i e the dvqr3 mlqr3 and bmaqr3 models this result supported the findings of previous studies traore and guven 2012 citakoglu et al 2014 mehdizadeh et al 2021 while applying wind speed alone may exhibit poor performance in eto estimation taking this parameter into account including other meteorological characteristics can enhance the eto estimation performance the boxplots of daily eto estimation using dvqr mlqr bmaqr and fao 56 p m models at the two study sites are shown in fig 5 in comparison the boxplot distribution of daily eto values by the dvqr model was remarkably close to those estimated by fao 56 p m model compared with the boxplot distribution of daily eto values estimated by mlqr and bmaqr models across all combinations in addition the last combination of all meteorological variables as represented by dvqr6 mlqr6 and bmaqr6 perfumed better than other combinations in terms of the testing period the rmse values ranged from 1 74 mm day 1 to 0 22 mm day 1 for the dvqr model and there were the same ranges of mlqr and bmaqr models from 1 77 mm day 1 to 0 38 mm day 1 at the atbara station the mae values were ranged from 1 40 mm day 1 to 0 16 mm day 1 for dvqr model and from 1 43 mm day 1 to 0 28 mm day 1 for mlqr model while from 1 44 mm day 1 to 0 29 mm day 1 for bmaqr model at the atbara station the r2 values range from 0 427 to 0 990 for the dvqr model and from 0 418 to 0 973 for the mlqr and bmaqr models at the atbara station in addition the ranks of qr modes at the kassala station for estimating estimate daily eto during the training and testing period were dvqr bmaqr and mlqr generally as can be seen in tables 7 and 8 the dvqr model showed the highest accuracy indicated with all the statistical metrics during the training and testing period followed by mlqr and bmaqr moreover the dvqr with complete all the meteorological variables tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh which represent dvqr6 showed high accuracy in estimating the daily eto indicates with r2 0 990 nse 0 990 wia 0 998 mae 0 16 mm day 1 and rmse 0 22 mm day 1 for the atbara station and r2 0 978 nse 0 977 wia 0 994 mae 0 21 mm day 1 and rmse 0 31 mm day 1 for the kassala station there is a light difference between the performance of mlqr6 and bmaqr models in estimating daily eto in which the mlqr6 model showed better performance than the bmaqr6 model in the atbara station on the contrary the bmaqr model indicated better performance than the mlqr model at the kassala station compared with other qr models the dvqr model generally showed high capabilities and potential in estimating daily eto from different meteorological variables over the hyper arid regions relative speaking the high capability of dvqr model is not related to the quantile value but also the type of selected family to model the dependency structure among the input variables in general our finding consistent with some researches niemierko et al 2019 nguyen huy et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021 ni and li 2021 wu et al 2022 they reported that when the conditioned element is situated in the center of the distribution the linear quantile regression is appropriate however it is unsuitable for calculating conditional quantiles dispersed outside of the center range on the other hand vine copula models offer the possibility of predicting strong nonlinear conditionally quantiles at the tails 3 3 comparison of classical machine learning models cml this study used the most common cml models including rf elm svm xgboost and m5tree to estimate the daily eto in the hyper arid regions six scenarios were developed based on different combinations of meteorological variables as presented in table 3 the results of these models during the training and testing periods of the atbara and kassala stations are presented in tables 9 and 10 respectively similarly all the models were employed based on various combinations of meteorological data and they offered a varying level of accuracy for both study sites as shown in tables 9 and 10 moreover rf6 elm6 svm6 xgboost6 and m5tree6 were employed using all the meteorological variables and they offered the highest accuracies in estimating daily eto during training and testing periods at both study sites during the training period the rf1 rf2 rf3 and rf4 models indicated the highest accuracies r2 nse and wia and lower error mae and rmse while the last two combinations of the m5tree model performed well than other models at both study sites these reported results are in a direction with previous studies findings feng et al 2017a fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019a which demonstrated that the rf model could detect high accuracy in calculating daily eto during the training period regarding the testing period the m5tree svm and xgboost models perfumed better than other models at both study sites on the contrary the first combinations tmin tmax and t and second combinations tmin tmax t and ssh were indicated with an unsatisfactory estimation of daily eto based on values of nse and criteria of moriasi 2007 the ranks of models estimating daily eto with high accuracy as m5tree svm xgboost elm and rf at study sites the rmse values characterized as 0 06 0 14 0 19 0 27 and 0 35 mm day 1 during testing period at the atbara station while the mae values were 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 mm day 1 for m5tree6 svm6 xgboost6 elm6 and rf6 respectively furthermore the r2 values characterized as 0 999 0 996 0 994 0 987 and 0 981 while the wia characterized as 1 00 0 999 0 999 0 997 and 0 994 for m5tree6 svm6 xgboost6 elm6 and rf6 respectively comparable to the atbara station the cml models utilized all meteorological variables and offered excellent prediction accuracy during the training and testing periods at the kassala station the statistical metrics in tables 9 and 10 indicated that the rf model had a large error mae and rmse during the testing period compared to other models at both study sites on the other hand the xgboost model indicated higher accuracy than elm and rf whereas xgboost ranked after svm and m5tree at both study sites the estimation of daily eto by the elm and rf models were less accurate than the xgboost model at atbara station which indicated with r2 wia nse mae and rmse values ranging 0 400 0 987 0 780 0 997 0 370 0 986 1 44 0 20 mm day 1 1 81 0 27 mm day 1 for elm model and 0 366 0 981 0 764 0 994 0 329 0 976 1 49 0 25 mm day 1 and 1 87 0 35 mm day 1 for rf model respectively overall the xgboost model provided a more reliable estimation of daily eto than rf and elm models across atbara and kassala stations in addition the boxplots of daily eto estimates by various cml and fao 56 p m models at the atbara and kassala stations are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively interestingly the results in figs 6 and 7 highlighted that the boxplots of daily eto fluctuated and the models employed became more efficient and reliable when more meteorological variables were added consistent with statistical metrics in tables 9 and 10 the findings are generally consistent with the previous investigation droogers and allen 2002 mehdizadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2019a which concluded that adding more meteorological variables as input can generally increase the model s capability to estimate the daily eto accurately nevertheless according to those studies the contribution of each meteorological variable to estimate daily eto varied depending on the climate condition generally the performance of cml models varied from region to region due to climate conditions and characteristics of meteorological variables the m5tree and svm models provided the most comparable eto distribution and agreement with the fao 56 pm model at both studied sites unes et al 2020 revealed that the m5tree and svm models could estimate daily eto reliably additionally the svm and m5tree models are most robust and capable of estimating monthly eto than the rf model in uttar pradesh and the uttarakhand states india rai et al 2022 also the svm model yielded better performance in estimating eto than other standard cml models fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019a chen et al 2020 the xgboost model indicated a high capability to estimate daily eto than elm and rf models in the hyper arid regions in addition fan et al 2018 revealed that the xgboost model is more capable and efficient than the rf model in estimating daily eto over china the result of the present study indicates that the xgboost model had the best performance in the estimation of daily eto than the rf model which is in the same direction as some previous studies ferreira and da cunha 2020 agrawal et al 2022 ferreira et al 2022 the results of the current study indicated that the cml models could estimate accurate daily eto in the hyper arid regions according to the statistical metrics the ranks of cml models are as follows m5tree svm xgboost elm and rf at both study sites 3 4 comparison of the capability of emms qr and cml models based on the findings of this research the original emms models including temperature based hargreaves samani and mass transfer based brockamp and tarbert indicated poor performances in estimating daily eto while the calibration techniques improved the accuracy of emms the calibrated hargeraves samani model is based on temperature tmin tmax and t and showed lower performance than other emms at both study sites the first combination of cml models including elm1 svm1 xgboost1 and m5tree1 indicated the best performance than calibrated hargeraves samani model at the kassala station during the testing period on the contrary the svm1 showed a similar performance to calibrated hargeraves samani model while other models indicated lower performances at the atbara station during the testing period additionally the calibrated trabert model exhibited the highest performance compared to calibrated brockamp and hargreaves samani models at both study sites using the qr and cml models by inputting full meteorological variables showed better performance than calibrated emms at both study sites figs 8 and 9 presented the scatter plot of the best performance models of emms qr and xgboost models vs fao 56 pm model during the training and testing periods at the atbara and kassala stations respectively the xgboost6 model shows the highest correlation with the fao 56 pm model followed by dvqr6 and calibrated tarbert model during the training and testing periods at both study sites in terms of atbara station mae and rmse values characterized as 0 15 and 0 19 mm day 1 for xgboost6 model 0 16 and 0 22 mm day 1 for dvqr6 model and 1 17 and 1 40 mm day 1 for calibrated trabert model respectively moreover r2 values during testing period were 0 994 0 990 and 0 883 wia values were 0 999 0 998 and 0 935 while nse values were 0 994 0 990 and 0 624 for xgboost6 dvqr6 and calibrated trabert model respectively as for kassala station mae and rmse values characterized as 0 12 and 0 16 mm day 1 for xgboost6 model 0 21 and 0 31 mm day 1 for dvqr6 model and 1 04 and 1 26 mm day 1 for calibrated trabert model respectively moreover r2 values during testing period were 0 994 0 978 and 0 910 wia values were 0 999 0 994 and 0 934 while nse values were 0 994 0 977 and 0 614 for xgboost6 dvqr6 and calibrated trabert model respectively the above result reflects that the xgboost6 and dvqr6 models have excellent performances and calibrated tarbert model has a satisfactory performance based on the classification of nse indicators at both study sites in general the result of this study is in the same direction as some other studies gocic et al 2016 muniandy et al 2016 feng et al 2017b mehdizadeh et al 2017b 2021 zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2019a which they demonstrated that the cml models are more capable than emms to provide an accurate estimation of daily eto across various climate zones cml models are frequently used to estimate eto because they are more reliable than emms however once new data is added the instability of cml models can yield much lower estimation accuracy while emms are relatively stable by nature hassan et al 2017 in addition the findings showed that the qr models are more capable and efficient in estimating daily eto in hyper arid regions figs 10 and 11 presented performances of emms qr and cml models based on the taylor diagram of 10 of minimum and maximum daily eto during the whole period 2000 2015 at the atbara and kassala stations respectively the tarbert and brockamp models performed better than the hargreaves samani model in extremum 10 of minimum and maximum daily eto at both study sites the dvqr model indicated the best performance of mlqr and bmaqr models based on 10 of minimum daily eto at both study sites moreover m5tree xgboost and svm models are located near to computed point fao 56 pm according to 10 of maximum daily eto at both study sites generally the results of the present study demonstrated that the cml and qr models are more capable of estimating daily eto accurately than emms in hyper arid regions also the qr models showed their effectiveness and robust tool in modelling nonlinear relationships among the variables this study showed the benefits in using the dvqr model with high dimensional 8d to estimate daily eto and indicated with equivalent performance with xgboost model in two hyper arid regions in general the comprehensive comprasion showed potential of using high dimensional vine copula based quantile approach against the cml models in daily eto estimation fig 12 depicts marginal effect plots based on the fitted quantiles for the best results of the d vine model by dvqr6 in both studied stations the marginal effect of dvqr6 is its eto estimated impact on the quantile estimator taking into account all meteorological variables fig 12 also shows the marginal effects of the covariates pertaining to the dvqr6 model to which a smoothed line has been added at quantile values 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the marginal effect was computed using eq 1 by considering all conditional quantiles that have been fitted and smoothed over eto estimation via dvqr6 tmean and rh showed a symmetry behavior in both hyper arid regions while es ea u2 and tmax proved the same behavior in both regions which shows the impact of es ea u2 and tmax on the quantile estimator was the same in both stations rn and ssh indicate smooth impacts on the quantile estimator for eto estimation in kassala station the density of ssh occurred around xk 10 in both stations while ssh had different impacts on the quantile estimator in both studied stations the contour plot of the best d vine structure is depicted in fig 13 which depicts the relationship between meteorological variables probability integral transformations on a normalized scale in the kassala and atbara stations some pair copulas e g the second row from bottom the first column from left in kassala and the second row the seventh column in atbara exhibit strong tail dependence or a skewed form of the contours which cannot be captured by using elliptical copulas such as gaussians or t copulas fig 13 demonstrates that the selection of pair copula families adequately describes the observed dependence structure in the data in fig 13 the first column corresponds to normalized contour plots for meteorological variables and et where one can see concentric circles as contour plots increased when each meteorological variable was added which indicates the independence of corresponding pair copulas can be increased by adding metrological variables this outcome confirms the results of eto estimation in both hyper arid regions which shows in the top row and the first column existing all metrological variables that the d vine copula based and machine learning based model can work better than the other defined structures in addition fig 13 displays several skewed contour plots for rows 1 2 3 and 4 which implies the dependence of meteorological variables in the corresponding pair copulas 4 conclusions this study compared the performance of the dvqr model with two qr models bmaq and mlqr original and calibrated emms hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert and cml rf elm svm and xgboost models to estimate daily eto during 2000 2015 over two hyper arid regions in sudan the main conclusions are as follows 1 original emms showed poor performance in two study sites while the calibration techniques improved the estimation of daily eto and reduced the error 2 according to the significance analysis from all models wind speed u2 and saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea are the two most essential and effective variables that influence the estimation of daily eto variation in two studied regions 3 the three qr models exhibit the highest accuracy and perfumed better than original and calibrated emms over two study sites among the qr models the dvqr model exhibits the highest capability to estimate daily eto than bmaqr and mlqr models 4 in terms of cml the xgboost model showed an equivalent ability and accuracy to the m5tree and svm models but it had significantly more capability than the elm and rf models 5 the dvqr model showed comparable performances to the corresponding xgboost model in terms of estimation of daily eto across all combinations of meteorological variables over two hyper arid regions this study adds to our understanding of how to estimate daily eto using meteorological variables and multiple methodologies in hyper arid regions nonetheless the methods have a number of limitations first the short research period may not be long enough to completely capture the data features e g seasonal trends of significant variables affecting the estimating skills of the computation and vine copula techniques second the limited number of weather stations and type of climate conditions in the study regions also can be another limitation of the current study furthermore only one vine family utilized in this research to develop the dvqr model may not completely reflect the complicated dependence relationships between variables inside the actual world in summary the xgboost and dvqr models were found to be more stable and accurate than the comparable rf and elm models in terms of estimation accuracy and reliability as a result the relatively high dimensional dvqr model is strongly suggested as a viable alternative technique for estimating daily eto in hyper arid regions with all combinations of meteorological variables the uncertainty analysis of applied models has an important role in comparing the performance of each model and determining the reliability of eto estimation therefore future potential researchers can consider this issue to have an uncertainty analysis on qr models for eto estimation in addition more research is needed to examine the effectiveness of the high dimensional vine copula model at multiple time scales hourly or monthly and in various climates

7835,study region two hyper arid regions atbara and kassala stations in sudan study focus the study aims to evaluate the potential of the d vine copula based quantile regression dvqr model for estimating daily eto during 2000 2015 based on various input structures further the dvqr model was compared with multivariate linear quantile regression mlqr bayesians model averaging quantile regression bmaqr empirical models emms and classical machine learning cml besides the cml models including random forest rf support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and m5 model tree m5tree were employed new hydrological insights for the region the original emms showed poor performance which improved after calibration techniques the dvqr mlqr and bmaqr models showed better performance than the calibrated emms however the dvqr model exhibited the highest accuracy than the mlqr and bmaqr models over two study sites the m5tree svm and xgboost models perfumed better than elm and rf models at both study sites the dvqr and xgboost models showed equivalent performance r2 nse and wia 0 99 mae and rmse 0 2 to the m5tree and svm models but they had significantly more accuracy than the calibrated emms mlqr bmaqr elm and rf models in two hyper arid regions overall the high dimensional dvqr model is recommended as a promising alternative technique for estimating daily eto in hyper arid climate conditions around the world graphical abstract ga1 keywords reference evapotranspiration empirical models quantile regression machine learning sudan hyper arid region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the capacity of vegetation and soil to evaporate during a specific period is known as evapotranspiration et which is strongly linked to meteorological variables soil moisture vegetation characteristics and other soil and atmospheric elements shiri 2013 tao and zhang 2011 wu 2020 yang et al 2015 the et plays a crucial role in determining the amount of water needed for agriculture hydrological processes evaluating agronomic systems etc chen et al 2020 also it is vital to accurately et estimation in order to develop irrigation strategies to maximize water resource efficiency ferreira et al 2019 et could be directly measured using experimental techniques such as eddy covariance devices lysimeters and bowen ratio energy balance feng et al 2017b zhang 2013 however these technologies are complex expensive and not practical in many areas pereira et al 2015 furthermore determining the et of each separate plant is a challenging task therefore reference evapotranspiration eto yang et al 2015 can be estimated before being converted to the et of a target plant by using a crop coefficient the eto is defined as the evaporation of the hypothetical grass with a constant altitude of 0 12 m a uniform surface resistance of 70 sm 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 accurate estimation of eto is critical for determining crop water requirements water budget optimizing irrigation scheduling and crop productivity developing computational models for et estimates which often rely on eto is a reliable alternative for overcoming this gap the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm model which was proposed in 1998 has been commonly utilized as the standard method for eto estimate in various parts around the world allen et al 1998 however the fao 56 pm model requires a wide range of meteorological data to be calculated including maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and net radiation fan et al 2016 which severely limits its global applicability generally the eto can be estimated using several empirical models emms which can be divided into five categories based on different inputs including pan evaporation temperature mass transfer and combining of meteorological parameters zhang et al 2018 based on various climatic condition and available datasets these emms can have different performances in different regions for instance mehdizadeh et al 2017a computed eto based on four types of emms including temperature mass transfer radiation and meteorological parameters across iran and concluded that the meteorological parameters based equations have the best performance due to a combination of most important parameters zhang et al 2018 evaluated the effectiveness of 31 emms for the eto estimation in the humid region of iran and demonstrated that two newly developed models based on solar radiation can be performed better than other emms muniandy et al 2016 used field observations in a humid region of malaysia to assess the capability of 26 emms they resulted that the penman model which is based on mass transfer offered the most accurate eto estimation some other researchers focused on calibrating the emms based on local climate conditions which showed poor performance in other regions the temperature based model hargreaves equation was calibrated in a humid region over china and was found to have a better estimation of eto compared to the original form of the hargreaves samani model feng et al 2017b furthermore mehdizadeh et al 2021 calibrated four emms including hargeraves samani romanenko priestley taylor and valiantzas over the climate zone in iran and demonstrated that the calibrated version of emms has better performance than the original version of emms therefore the calibration step for emms is essential to improve their capabilities in estimating eto with high accuracy recently the bayesians model averaging bma was applied in different water resource studies such as merging multiple satellite rainfall yumnam et al 2022 the probability distribution of crop yields ramsey 2020 hydrological post processing tyralis et al 2019a water level forecasting baran et al 2019 and runoff prediction huang et al 2019b they showed that the bmaqr has a high potential and excellent performance in the prediction stage from different input variables with lower uncertinity moreover copula emphasized the benefits of dependence mechanisms and margins individually in the modeling process increasing flexibility in selecting arbitrary distributions and copula families while remaining insensitive to outliers to these factors can increase the performance of a regression based model luciano et al 2008 a great effort has been successfully applied by different investigations of the bivariate copula hao and aghakouchak 2013 verhoest 2015 and high dimensional vine copula in hydrology liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the d vine copula dvqr and multiple linear mlqr based on quantile regression were applied to develop robustness of soil moisture retrieval based on satellite data and they reported that the dvqr model is an effective tool to model the dependent structure of nonlinear relationship among variables nguyen et al 2021 also wu et al 2022 demonstrated the dvqr model can predict agricultural drought accurately from different remote sensing data over china in this study we proposed to use the dvqr model for daily eto estimation for the frist time and compared it to the bmaqr model as considered benchmark of uncertainty as well as the mlqr model considered in this comparison therefore measuring the capabilities and effectiveness of these models in modeling a nonlinear phenomenon e g eto will improve agricultural water management with the rapidly developing of soft computing techniques and artificial intelligence concepts over the last few years the eto prediction using meteorological data has been regarded as a regression issue that can be tackled by many classical machine learning cml models kalteh 2016 dou and yang 2018b cml models are frequently utilized by researchers due to their simplicity in hyperparameter settings and the benefits of improved accuracy and robustness abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2016 guan 2020 patil and deka 2016 in recent decades the use of soft computing techniques for hydrological modeling has been successfully considered by various types of machine learning algorithms seifi et al 2020 ehteram et al 2022 mohammadi et al 2022 several studies have shown the capabilities of cml models to estimate the eto over the world such as support vector machine svm artificial neural network ann multilayer perceptron mlp generalized regression neural network grnn extreme gradient boosting xgboost m5 model tree m5tree random forest rf adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and extreme learning machine elm abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2017b mehdizadeh et al 2017a dou and yang 2018b 2018a riahi madvar and seifi 2018 unes et al 2020 ehteram et al 2022 the elm model was employed to estimate the monthly eto from meteorological data at two stations in serbia and compared to the different empirical equations which showed high accuracy than emms gocic et al 2016 fan et al 2018 estimated eto using svm elm and four tree based ensemble approaches in various climatic regions of china they discovered that xgboost models showed the best performance in order to measure the capabilities of cml approaches in estimating the eto in northwest china yu 2020 used ann svr and elm models they found that svr and elm achieved high accuracies in another study by bellido jimenez et al 2021 the eto was estimated using various cml models including mlp grnn elm svm rf and xgboost models in southern spain they reported that elm had the best performance among all applied soft computing techniques furthermore dong et al 2022 calculated the daily eto from 100 stations during 1961 2019 over china using elm convolutional neural network cnn and multiple adaptive regression splines mars they found that elm performed well in temperate monsoon zone tmz and temperate continental zone tcz overall the accuracy of cml models in eto estimation varies from region to region due to climate variability therefore the accurate estimate of eto has high benefits in advanced applications of hydrological processes and agricultural water management to predict the eto underframe of different input variables and also to reduce the uncertainty of the eto prediction via different quantile levels therefore the current study aims to compare the capabilities of different approaches including empirical models emms quantile regression qr and classical machine learning cml for estimating daily eto from meteorological variables based on different combinations during 2000 2015 over the hyper aired region in sudan then for this aim i the dvqr model was used for eto estimation for the first time and compared to mlqr and bmaqr models to evaluate the capabilities in modeling nonlinear relationships among the variables ii empirical models were used for eto estimation including the fao 56 pm model as a benchmark model iii the classical machine learning models were also used for eto estimation to compare with qr and emms model in two hyper arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the present study used two hyper aired regions in sudan as case studies located in the northeast of africa between 8 24 n and 21 39 e sudan is surrounded by chad central africa south sudan ethiopia eritrea and egypt fig 1 shows the sudan topography elevation nile river and location of meteorological stations the elevation ranged 29 2997 m according to digital elevation model dem data which was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a spatial resolution 90 m the general topography in sudan is a flat plain with some highest in the east west and south parts which are known as red sea hills jebel marra and nuba mountains respectively the nile river is known as the largest river in the world consisting of three main tributaries blue nile white nile and atbara river which contribute to 58 28 and 14 of the annual flow of the nile measured near the sudanese egyptian border at aswan basheer et al 2019 2 2 meteorological data used the daily meteorological data including minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax sunshine duration ssh wind speed at a height of 2 m u2 and mean relative humidity rh were obtained from the sudan national meteorological department snmd during 2000 2015 for two meteorological stations atbara and kassala across the hyper arid regions sudan other meteorological variables such as net radiation rn and saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea were calculated using the proposed approach by allen et al 1998 the quality of training and testing data was assessed by various statistical approaches such as minimum xmin maximum xmax mean xmean standard deviation xstd and coefficient of variation xcv which are presented in table 1 the rh notably has high xstd values with 9 77 and 13 16 during the training period and 8 36 and 11 93 during the testing period for atbara and kassala stations respectively also es ea and u2 indicate lower xstd values less than 2 0 however t tmax and rn are remarkable with lower xcv during the training and testing periods at both study sites 2 3 empirical models in this investigation two different types of empirical models including mass transfer based and temperature based were used to calculate the eto time series at atbara and kassala stations the fao 56 pm model is suggested as the only standard approach for defining and computing eto allen et al 1998 hence eto values calculated by the fao 56 pm model were chosen as such targets to calibrate and validate empirical models qr and cml models which are realistic and widely recognized by many prior studies muniandy et al 2016 feng et al 2017b three empirical models including hargreaves samani temperature based brockamp and tarbert mass transfer based were selected and used in the current study and their used equations are presented in table 2 2 4 quantile regression qr models quantile regression qr is a mathematical approach for estimating and inferring conditional quantile functions in this view the literature research suggests that the bmaqr model is more capable and efficiently to predict the target by considering the uncertainty of input variables bazrafshan 2022 hern et al 2011 in this present study different types of qr approaches such as d vine copula dvqr multivariate linear mlqr and bayesian model averaging bmaqr are considered to measure and comparing their capabilities and uncertinty in estimation daily eto over two hyper arid regions the description of employed approaches is provided as follows 2 4 1 d vine copula based quantile regression dvqr copulas are mathematical processes that merge numerous univariate margin distributions into one multivariate distribution function all of which have homogeneous distributions on the interval 0 1 sklar 1959 nelsen 2007 in order to describe the dependency across two variables throughout many hydrological investigations a bivariate copula was used whereas only a few numbers of investigations tackled the problems in higher dimensionality pair copula construction pcc also known as vine copula aas et al 2009 is a powerful and flexible tool for modeling higher dimensionality dependence structures that is based on decomposing conditionality bivariate copula density within every single product conventional vine copulas have been classified into two types canonical c vine and drawable vine copulas d vine the first catch all mutual dependences relating to the same element in contrast to the latter which specifies mutual dependence structure one by one time the main objective of the present study is to predict the conditional quantile q of predictor variables y eto at a particular quantile level α 0 1 for provided variables x 1 x n i e meteorological variables the inverse of a condition distributions equation as follows provided to successfully achieve this aim kraus and czado 2017 1 q α x 1 x n f y x 1 x n 1 α x 1 x n by considering v f y y and u j f j x j according to sklar s mathematical and the probability integral transform sklar 1959 eq 1 could be adjusted as 2 f y x 1 x n 1 α x 1 x n f y 1 c v u 1 u n 1 α u 1 u n the d vine copula was chosen in this study due to its flexibility to predict the daily eto from several combinations of meteorological variables tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh whereas six high dimensional models were built 4d 5d 6d 7d 8d 9d the dvqr model includes several families such as all parametric nonparametric elliptical archimedean bb itau twopar and onepar each family has a different formula to calculate the bivariate variable from multivariate variables in this study we selected all copula acs family frank clayton gumbel t t11 bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 joe and gaussian to model dependence structure between meteorological variables and daily eto the d vine copula concept in a hierarchical way was employed to model dependent and independent variables and fig 2 is represented the 5d d vine for the first meteorological combinations due to the concept of indirectly incorporating a variable selection process by the original d vine copula algorithm the dvqr is not only a capable technique for modeling nonlinear dependency structure between the variables but also dvqr can be used to choose parsimonious models because additionally this algorithm is can resolve the common problems associated with regression such as collinearity transformations and the inclusion and exclusions of covariates 2 4 2 multivariate linear based quantile regression mlqr a linear technique for parameterization of qr was proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 whereas koenker 2005 provided a more thorough discussion of the technique the approach uses procedures like linear regression to calculate the various quantile values of dependent variables based on predictive variables the key distinction between qr and linear regression is whether minimization takes conditional quantiles into account while linear regression takes the conditional mean of dependent variables into account a simple description of mlqr has been that it trains a linear model and then divides the data such that 100 q upon the values are below the estimated values of the trained model the mlqr has been applied as a frequency analysis in hydrology and water resources management studies franco villoria et al 2019 kaleris and langousis 2017 dogulu 2015 tyralis et al 2019b 2 4 3 bayesian model averaging based quantile regression bmaqr the bmaqr model works based on bayes hypothesis and generates a more reliable prediction according to probabilistic ability and products weights duan et al 2007 this process does not consider the uncertainty during the model selection stage which typically results in too optimistic outcomes the bmaqr has thus been used in various research such as eto estimation hernandez et al 2011 and streamflow simulations jiang et al 2012 based on the expectation maximization technique from a bayesian model predictor uncertainty can be addressed by considering every scenario and making judgments in addition prior distributions on uncertain variables must be generalized to a collection of models with shared parameter space various models mi out of the same parameterized family can be chosen to write as follows formulae for a specified set of independent factors x meteorological variables and y eto being the dependent response 3 f y x i 1 p y m i x p m i x the conditional probability of each model can be expressed as 4 p m i x p x m i p m i i p x m i p m i where 5 p x m i p x θ i m i p θ i m i d θ i several quantile values ranging from 0 to 1 have been used to reduce the uncertainty of qr models for dvqr and bmaqr the meadian quantiles values were selected which have given accurate predictions while for mlqr the q 0 5 quantile indicates high accuracy 2 5 machine learning models 2 5 1 extreme learning machine elm huang et al 2006b introduced elm feedforward neural network generally elm is divided into three layers input hidden and output layers nevertheless unlike to classical neural networks elm offers a much faster training speed and superior generalization ability huang et al 2006a gocic et al 2016 wu et al 2021 furthermore elm provides input weights at random and calculates output weights mathematically khosravi et al 2018 this differs from typical ann which requires more human involvement especially when determining optimal variables yaseen et al 2019 the elm model has been widely applied in hydrology and meteorology studies such as streamflow prediction rainfall runoff modeling eto estimation solar radiation modeling and dew point temperature prediction dong 2020 feng et al 2016 sanikhani 2018 taormina and chau 2015 2 5 2 random forest rf rf techniques are a recently proposed and widely used ensemble technique that may generate models for classifier and regress issues cutler et al 2007 this method employs several trees for estimation and during the application of the rf as a classifier the tree predictors randomly give the numerical number to labels moreover in the current study the rf model was employed as a regression tool while the inputs meteorological variables were implemented assembly at each node for creating a tree according to hosseinzadeh et al 2012 the rf approach only needs two user defined variables the number of variables utilized at every node and number of trees several studies used the rf model to estimate eto from meteorological variables such as feng et al 2017a and huang et al 2019a 2 5 3 support vector machine svm the svm model was introduced by vapnik 1998 as a supervised machine learning technique for pattern recognition and data science issues and also the svm has been extensively used for regression issues in the disciplines of agricultural production hydrology climatology and environmental research ferreira et al 2019 ghorbani 2017 generally this model utilizes non linear functions to select the most appropriate separating hyperplane to reduce errors during the training process wen 2015 in this case the input variables are often non linear and linearly associated with the outputs since they are mapped toward a large scale feature space kernel functions like the linear polynomial and radial basis functions have been used to transform input data into a high dimensional feature set in this study the radial basis kernel was employed as the most suitable kernel function based on the result of previous studies mehdizadeh et al 2017a 2 5 4 m5 model tree m5tree the m5tree model was proposed by quinlan 1992 for the first time which was later modified and rebuilt by wang and witten 1997 the m5tree model incorporates linear regression equations at the terminal nodes to establish a relationship between input and output variables the m5tree model scans all feasible splits and selects the one that optimizes the predicted error reduction typically there are two steps for implementing the m5tree model i the original data is separated into subgroups to construct a decision tree regarding the standard deviation upon the feature values and the predicted decrease in errors ii the overgrowth tree is reduced while the linear regression equation takes control of these sub trees 2 5 5 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost model was suggested by chen et al 2016 for the first time as the k classification and regression trees cart approach for gradient boosting machines gbms implementation the xgboost model is based on the concept of boost whereas aggregates all of a group of poor learners predictions in order to create a strength learner using additive training techniques in addition the xgboost model seeks to both avoid over fitting and reduce computational expenses this is achieved by condensing the optimization techniques to get the best computing efficiency while combining of the prediction and normalization elements additionally simultaneous computations are automatically carried out for functionalities in the xgboost model throughout the training recently a few studies employed the xgboost model in hydrological modeling research fan et al 2018 2 5 6 models construction three different categories of models were applied in the current study for eto estimation including emms qr and cml approaches emms model was calibrated by regression relationship between the eto equation as a dependent variable and meteorological variables as independent variables and qr and cml approaches were trained based on each model s learning algorithms and their specific criteria in all three applied models fao 56 was considered as the target variable and other meteorological variables were added as input for emms qr and cml models parameter settings for cml qr and dvqr6 models are listed in tables 11 14 in the appendix section the flowchart workflow of the cml qr and emm models was provided in fig 3 2 6 scenario definition for reference evapotranspiration estimation in this study six combinations of meteorological variables listed in table 3 as running scenarios were proposed to evaluate the influence of individual meteorological variables on eto prediction and the capability of emms qr and cml models in estimating daily eto across the hyper arid regions these combinations are 1 temperature based tmin tmax t 2 tmin tmax t and ssh 3 tmin tmax t ssh and u2 4 tmin tmax t ssh u2 and rn 5 tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn and es ea while the last combination includes all meteorological variables 6 tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh all applied models were trained using data from 2000 to 2011 and tested using data from 2012 to 2015 2 7 statistical metrics the capability and performance of cml qr and emms models for estimating daily eto from different meteorological data were evaluated against fao56 derived estimates using many statistical metrics wu 2020 the selected metrics include coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse willmott s index of agreement wia mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse 6 r 2 i 1 m o i o i s i s i i 1 m o i o i 2 i 1 m s i s i 2 2 7

model s i daily eto estimated for various models cml qr and emms o i and s i the average of eto and was calculated from fao 56 pm and other models cml qr and emms respectively the m represents the total number of days during the study period the r2 is a statistical metric that measures the relationship and agreement of calculated o i and estimated s i daily eto where the excellent value is 1 and indicates a positive correlation the quantified difference between both the calculated o i and estimated s i daily eto is measured by the nse with a target value of 1 by using the criteria suggested by moriasi 2007 predictive performance nse is split into five classes very good 0 75 nse 1 0 good 0 65 nse 0 75 satisfactory 0 50 nse 0 65 acceptable 0 40 nse 0 50 and unsatisfactory nse 0 40 in order to standardize the measurement of each model s error willmott 1981 introduced wia which ranges from 0 to 1 wia represents the percentage of the mean square error to potential error the optimal match is represented by an agreement value of 1 and a total lack of agreement is represented by 0 while mae and rmse measure the amount of error associated with estimated models and their values range from 0 to and the perfect value is 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of empirical models emms three emms models such as hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert were used to estimate daily eto at the atbara and kassala stations as shown in table 2 the errors of original and calibrated emms at the atbara and kassala stations are presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively all the emms have shown poor performance in estimating daily eto according to the nse value which indicates that it is unsatisfactory also the wia ranged from 0 07 to 0 337 across two stations in the training and testing period tables 4 and 5 show that the original hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert models could not estimate daily eto at the atbara and kassala stations additionally the calibration technique substantially increased the effectiveness of eto estimation using emms compared to their original forms as shown by the statistical metrics produced for the calibrated emms in tables 4 and 5 at the atbara and kassala stations among the calibrated emms the tarbert model exhibited the most accurate mass transfer model to estimate daily eto indicated in all statistical metrics r2 0 883 nse 0 624 wia 0 935 mae 1 17 mm day 1 and rmse 1 40 mm day 1 for atbara station and r2 0 910 nse 0 614 wia 0 934 mae 1 04 mm day 1 and rmse 1 26 mm day 1 for kassala station the calibrated hargreaves samani model showed lower performance than other calibrated emms across the atbara and kassala stations generally due to the locally calibrated original emms our results confirmed that the calibration technique could substantially increase the performance and potential of original emms ahmadi 2021 mehdizadeh et al 2021 mehdizadeh et al 2017b the calibrated forms of emms used in this study are presented in table 6 also fig 4 shows the boxplot distribution of daily eto estimated by original and calibrated emms compared to the fao 56 pm model as shown in fig 4 a and b the original forms of emms were smaller than the standard model distribution fao 56 pm across the atbara and kassala stations on the other hand the distributions of calibrated emms c and d were matched with the fao 56 pm model for the atbara and kassala stations respectively 3 2 3 2 comparison of quantile regression models the qr has recently been applied in hydrology studies based on different approaches the current study employed three qr models dvqr mlqr and bmaqr to estimate daily eto from multiple meteorological variables the statistical metrics include rmse mae wia nse and r2 of daily eto estimated with three qr models compared against the fao 56 pm model and they are presented in tables 7 and 8 for the atbara and kassala stations respectively the first and second temperature based combination and ssh input showed poor performance estimating daily eto with dvqr mlqr and bmaqr during the training and testing period at both study sites overall it can observe that increasing the number of meteorological variables as models input can improve the performance of all qr models in addition the performances throughout the training and testing periods were improved considerably due to the wind speed u2 added to the third combination i e the dvqr3 mlqr3 and bmaqr3 models this result supported the findings of previous studies traore and guven 2012 citakoglu et al 2014 mehdizadeh et al 2021 while applying wind speed alone may exhibit poor performance in eto estimation taking this parameter into account including other meteorological characteristics can enhance the eto estimation performance the boxplots of daily eto estimation using dvqr mlqr bmaqr and fao 56 p m models at the two study sites are shown in fig 5 in comparison the boxplot distribution of daily eto values by the dvqr model was remarkably close to those estimated by fao 56 p m model compared with the boxplot distribution of daily eto values estimated by mlqr and bmaqr models across all combinations in addition the last combination of all meteorological variables as represented by dvqr6 mlqr6 and bmaqr6 perfumed better than other combinations in terms of the testing period the rmse values ranged from 1 74 mm day 1 to 0 22 mm day 1 for the dvqr model and there were the same ranges of mlqr and bmaqr models from 1 77 mm day 1 to 0 38 mm day 1 at the atbara station the mae values were ranged from 1 40 mm day 1 to 0 16 mm day 1 for dvqr model and from 1 43 mm day 1 to 0 28 mm day 1 for mlqr model while from 1 44 mm day 1 to 0 29 mm day 1 for bmaqr model at the atbara station the r2 values range from 0 427 to 0 990 for the dvqr model and from 0 418 to 0 973 for the mlqr and bmaqr models at the atbara station in addition the ranks of qr modes at the kassala station for estimating estimate daily eto during the training and testing period were dvqr bmaqr and mlqr generally as can be seen in tables 7 and 8 the dvqr model showed the highest accuracy indicated with all the statistical metrics during the training and testing period followed by mlqr and bmaqr moreover the dvqr with complete all the meteorological variables tmin tmax t ssh u2 rn es ea and rh which represent dvqr6 showed high accuracy in estimating the daily eto indicates with r2 0 990 nse 0 990 wia 0 998 mae 0 16 mm day 1 and rmse 0 22 mm day 1 for the atbara station and r2 0 978 nse 0 977 wia 0 994 mae 0 21 mm day 1 and rmse 0 31 mm day 1 for the kassala station there is a light difference between the performance of mlqr6 and bmaqr models in estimating daily eto in which the mlqr6 model showed better performance than the bmaqr6 model in the atbara station on the contrary the bmaqr model indicated better performance than the mlqr model at the kassala station compared with other qr models the dvqr model generally showed high capabilities and potential in estimating daily eto from different meteorological variables over the hyper arid regions relative speaking the high capability of dvqr model is not related to the quantile value but also the type of selected family to model the dependency structure among the input variables in general our finding consistent with some researches niemierko et al 2019 nguyen huy et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021 ni and li 2021 wu et al 2022 they reported that when the conditioned element is situated in the center of the distribution the linear quantile regression is appropriate however it is unsuitable for calculating conditional quantiles dispersed outside of the center range on the other hand vine copula models offer the possibility of predicting strong nonlinear conditionally quantiles at the tails 3 3 comparison of classical machine learning models cml this study used the most common cml models including rf elm svm xgboost and m5tree to estimate the daily eto in the hyper arid regions six scenarios were developed based on different combinations of meteorological variables as presented in table 3 the results of these models during the training and testing periods of the atbara and kassala stations are presented in tables 9 and 10 respectively similarly all the models were employed based on various combinations of meteorological data and they offered a varying level of accuracy for both study sites as shown in tables 9 and 10 moreover rf6 elm6 svm6 xgboost6 and m5tree6 were employed using all the meteorological variables and they offered the highest accuracies in estimating daily eto during training and testing periods at both study sites during the training period the rf1 rf2 rf3 and rf4 models indicated the highest accuracies r2 nse and wia and lower error mae and rmse while the last two combinations of the m5tree model performed well than other models at both study sites these reported results are in a direction with previous studies findings feng et al 2017a fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019a which demonstrated that the rf model could detect high accuracy in calculating daily eto during the training period regarding the testing period the m5tree svm and xgboost models perfumed better than other models at both study sites on the contrary the first combinations tmin tmax and t and second combinations tmin tmax t and ssh were indicated with an unsatisfactory estimation of daily eto based on values of nse and criteria of moriasi 2007 the ranks of models estimating daily eto with high accuracy as m5tree svm xgboost elm and rf at study sites the rmse values characterized as 0 06 0 14 0 19 0 27 and 0 35 mm day 1 during testing period at the atbara station while the mae values were 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 mm day 1 for m5tree6 svm6 xgboost6 elm6 and rf6 respectively furthermore the r2 values characterized as 0 999 0 996 0 994 0 987 and 0 981 while the wia characterized as 1 00 0 999 0 999 0 997 and 0 994 for m5tree6 svm6 xgboost6 elm6 and rf6 respectively comparable to the atbara station the cml models utilized all meteorological variables and offered excellent prediction accuracy during the training and testing periods at the kassala station the statistical metrics in tables 9 and 10 indicated that the rf model had a large error mae and rmse during the testing period compared to other models at both study sites on the other hand the xgboost model indicated higher accuracy than elm and rf whereas xgboost ranked after svm and m5tree at both study sites the estimation of daily eto by the elm and rf models were less accurate than the xgboost model at atbara station which indicated with r2 wia nse mae and rmse values ranging 0 400 0 987 0 780 0 997 0 370 0 986 1 44 0 20 mm day 1 1 81 0 27 mm day 1 for elm model and 0 366 0 981 0 764 0 994 0 329 0 976 1 49 0 25 mm day 1 and 1 87 0 35 mm day 1 for rf model respectively overall the xgboost model provided a more reliable estimation of daily eto than rf and elm models across atbara and kassala stations in addition the boxplots of daily eto estimates by various cml and fao 56 p m models at the atbara and kassala stations are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively interestingly the results in figs 6 and 7 highlighted that the boxplots of daily eto fluctuated and the models employed became more efficient and reliable when more meteorological variables were added consistent with statistical metrics in tables 9 and 10 the findings are generally consistent with the previous investigation droogers and allen 2002 mehdizadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2019a which concluded that adding more meteorological variables as input can generally increase the model s capability to estimate the daily eto accurately nevertheless according to those studies the contribution of each meteorological variable to estimate daily eto varied depending on the climate condition generally the performance of cml models varied from region to region due to climate conditions and characteristics of meteorological variables the m5tree and svm models provided the most comparable eto distribution and agreement with the fao 56 pm model at both studied sites unes et al 2020 revealed that the m5tree and svm models could estimate daily eto reliably additionally the svm and m5tree models are most robust and capable of estimating monthly eto than the rf model in uttar pradesh and the uttarakhand states india rai et al 2022 also the svm model yielded better performance in estimating eto than other standard cml models fan et al 2018 huang et al 2019a chen et al 2020 the xgboost model indicated a high capability to estimate daily eto than elm and rf models in the hyper arid regions in addition fan et al 2018 revealed that the xgboost model is more capable and efficient than the rf model in estimating daily eto over china the result of the present study indicates that the xgboost model had the best performance in the estimation of daily eto than the rf model which is in the same direction as some previous studies ferreira and da cunha 2020 agrawal et al 2022 ferreira et al 2022 the results of the current study indicated that the cml models could estimate accurate daily eto in the hyper arid regions according to the statistical metrics the ranks of cml models are as follows m5tree svm xgboost elm and rf at both study sites 3 4 comparison of the capability of emms qr and cml models based on the findings of this research the original emms models including temperature based hargreaves samani and mass transfer based brockamp and tarbert indicated poor performances in estimating daily eto while the calibration techniques improved the accuracy of emms the calibrated hargeraves samani model is based on temperature tmin tmax and t and showed lower performance than other emms at both study sites the first combination of cml models including elm1 svm1 xgboost1 and m5tree1 indicated the best performance than calibrated hargeraves samani model at the kassala station during the testing period on the contrary the svm1 showed a similar performance to calibrated hargeraves samani model while other models indicated lower performances at the atbara station during the testing period additionally the calibrated trabert model exhibited the highest performance compared to calibrated brockamp and hargreaves samani models at both study sites using the qr and cml models by inputting full meteorological variables showed better performance than calibrated emms at both study sites figs 8 and 9 presented the scatter plot of the best performance models of emms qr and xgboost models vs fao 56 pm model during the training and testing periods at the atbara and kassala stations respectively the xgboost6 model shows the highest correlation with the fao 56 pm model followed by dvqr6 and calibrated tarbert model during the training and testing periods at both study sites in terms of atbara station mae and rmse values characterized as 0 15 and 0 19 mm day 1 for xgboost6 model 0 16 and 0 22 mm day 1 for dvqr6 model and 1 17 and 1 40 mm day 1 for calibrated trabert model respectively moreover r2 values during testing period were 0 994 0 990 and 0 883 wia values were 0 999 0 998 and 0 935 while nse values were 0 994 0 990 and 0 624 for xgboost6 dvqr6 and calibrated trabert model respectively as for kassala station mae and rmse values characterized as 0 12 and 0 16 mm day 1 for xgboost6 model 0 21 and 0 31 mm day 1 for dvqr6 model and 1 04 and 1 26 mm day 1 for calibrated trabert model respectively moreover r2 values during testing period were 0 994 0 978 and 0 910 wia values were 0 999 0 994 and 0 934 while nse values were 0 994 0 977 and 0 614 for xgboost6 dvqr6 and calibrated trabert model respectively the above result reflects that the xgboost6 and dvqr6 models have excellent performances and calibrated tarbert model has a satisfactory performance based on the classification of nse indicators at both study sites in general the result of this study is in the same direction as some other studies gocic et al 2016 muniandy et al 2016 feng et al 2017b mehdizadeh et al 2017b 2021 zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2019a which they demonstrated that the cml models are more capable than emms to provide an accurate estimation of daily eto across various climate zones cml models are frequently used to estimate eto because they are more reliable than emms however once new data is added the instability of cml models can yield much lower estimation accuracy while emms are relatively stable by nature hassan et al 2017 in addition the findings showed that the qr models are more capable and efficient in estimating daily eto in hyper arid regions figs 10 and 11 presented performances of emms qr and cml models based on the taylor diagram of 10 of minimum and maximum daily eto during the whole period 2000 2015 at the atbara and kassala stations respectively the tarbert and brockamp models performed better than the hargreaves samani model in extremum 10 of minimum and maximum daily eto at both study sites the dvqr model indicated the best performance of mlqr and bmaqr models based on 10 of minimum daily eto at both study sites moreover m5tree xgboost and svm models are located near to computed point fao 56 pm according to 10 of maximum daily eto at both study sites generally the results of the present study demonstrated that the cml and qr models are more capable of estimating daily eto accurately than emms in hyper arid regions also the qr models showed their effectiveness and robust tool in modelling nonlinear relationships among the variables this study showed the benefits in using the dvqr model with high dimensional 8d to estimate daily eto and indicated with equivalent performance with xgboost model in two hyper arid regions in general the comprehensive comprasion showed potential of using high dimensional vine copula based quantile approach against the cml models in daily eto estimation fig 12 depicts marginal effect plots based on the fitted quantiles for the best results of the d vine model by dvqr6 in both studied stations the marginal effect of dvqr6 is its eto estimated impact on the quantile estimator taking into account all meteorological variables fig 12 also shows the marginal effects of the covariates pertaining to the dvqr6 model to which a smoothed line has been added at quantile values 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 the marginal effect was computed using eq 1 by considering all conditional quantiles that have been fitted and smoothed over eto estimation via dvqr6 tmean and rh showed a symmetry behavior in both hyper arid regions while es ea u2 and tmax proved the same behavior in both regions which shows the impact of es ea u2 and tmax on the quantile estimator was the same in both stations rn and ssh indicate smooth impacts on the quantile estimator for eto estimation in kassala station the density of ssh occurred around xk 10 in both stations while ssh had different impacts on the quantile estimator in both studied stations the contour plot of the best d vine structure is depicted in fig 13 which depicts the relationship between meteorological variables probability integral transformations on a normalized scale in the kassala and atbara stations some pair copulas e g the second row from bottom the first column from left in kassala and the second row the seventh column in atbara exhibit strong tail dependence or a skewed form of the contours which cannot be captured by using elliptical copulas such as gaussians or t copulas fig 13 demonstrates that the selection of pair copula families adequately describes the observed dependence structure in the data in fig 13 the first column corresponds to normalized contour plots for meteorological variables and et where one can see concentric circles as contour plots increased when each meteorological variable was added which indicates the independence of corresponding pair copulas can be increased by adding metrological variables this outcome confirms the results of eto estimation in both hyper arid regions which shows in the top row and the first column existing all metrological variables that the d vine copula based and machine learning based model can work better than the other defined structures in addition fig 13 displays several skewed contour plots for rows 1 2 3 and 4 which implies the dependence of meteorological variables in the corresponding pair copulas 4 conclusions this study compared the performance of the dvqr model with two qr models bmaq and mlqr original and calibrated emms hargreaves samani brockamp and tarbert and cml rf elm svm and xgboost models to estimate daily eto during 2000 2015 over two hyper arid regions in sudan the main conclusions are as follows 1 original emms showed poor performance in two study sites while the calibration techniques improved the estimation of daily eto and reduced the error 2 according to the significance analysis from all models wind speed u2 and saturation vapor pressure deficit es ea are the two most essential and effective variables that influence the estimation of daily eto variation in two studied regions 3 the three qr models exhibit the highest accuracy and perfumed better than original and calibrated emms over two study sites among the qr models the dvqr model exhibits the highest capability to estimate daily eto than bmaqr and mlqr models 4 in terms of cml the xgboost model showed an equivalent ability and accuracy to the m5tree and svm models but it had significantly more capability than the elm and rf models 5 the dvqr model showed comparable performances to the corresponding xgboost model in terms of estimation of daily eto across all combinations of meteorological variables over two hyper arid regions this study adds to our understanding of how to estimate daily eto using meteorological variables and multiple methodologies in hyper arid regions nonetheless the methods have a number of limitations first the short research period may not be long enough to completely capture the data features e g seasonal trends of significant variables affecting the estimating skills of the computation and vine copula techniques second the limited number of weather stations and type of climate conditions in the study regions also can be another limitation of the current study furthermore only one vine family utilized in this research to develop the dvqr model may not completely reflect the complicated dependence relationships between variables inside the actual world in summary the xgboost and dvqr models were found to be more stable and accurate than the comparable rf and elm models in terms of estimation accuracy and reliability as a result the relatively high dimensional dvqr model is strongly suggested as a viable alternative technique for estimating daily eto in hyper arid regions with all combinations of meteorological variables the uncertainty analysis of applied models has an important role in comparing the performance of each model and determining the reliability of eto estimation therefore future potential researchers can consider this issue to have an uncertainty analysis on qr models for eto estimation in addition more research is needed to examine the effectiveness of the high dimensional vine copula model at multiple time scales hourly or monthly and in various climates

7836,study region the study region comprises an intermittent stream named upper andarax within a semi arid watershed in se spain andarax river basin characterised by uneven topography and its striking hydraulic heritage study focus high flow extreme events are becoming more common and less exceptional leading to devastating losses with very high associated economical costs this paper presents the development of a predictive bayesian causal model bcm for high flow extreme hydrological events assessment accounting for extreme events characterisation and sub modelling base flow consideration and previous soil moisture influence it comprises three main phases that are 1 data preparation 2 extreme events characterisation and analysis and 3 bcm predictive modelling this study could be a decision making tool for flood risk management in the andarax river basin new hydrological insights for the region results suggest a complex and dynamic non linear rainfall runoff relationship in the upper andarax watershed whereas there is a strong similarity in the temporal distributions of flow discharges being in general symmetric as a result of symmetric hyetographs the statistical dependency showed that the basin response depends much more on the rainfall intensity rather than on the soil antecedent moisture conditions the simulated bcms demonstrated that all events types may lead to

miteco 2022 with a predicted annual cost of 0 87 billion euros between 2004 and 2033 zazo et al 2018 the mediterranean part is regularly affected by flash floods as a consequence of heavy rainfall and the flood risk due to climate change and also non climatic factors is expected to increase in most mediterranean basins cramer et al 2018 one of the effective measures to mitigate floods negative impacts is early warning and forecasting systems ewfss based on hydrological models hydrological models have a significant contribution to modern flood forecasting due to their capacity to simulate the hydrological processes based on physical rules and empirical formulas they are classified into two groups conceptually or physically based models and data driven models bafitlhile and li 2019 over the past two decades data driven approaches based on artificial intelligence ai have gained a drastically increasing interest from hydrologists terzi and ergin 2014 due to their significant contribution to improve the prediction accuracy they are proficient in building mathematical linear or non linear causal relationships between historical input and output variables without directly considering the underlying physics of the investigated process kumar et al 2016 overcoming the process driven models weaknesses ai based data driven approaches can be classified into deterministic and stochastic in recent decades stochastic model based approaches have emerged in the development of hydrological models as a result of advances in computer science molina et al 2020 these models are fundamentally different from the deterministic ones in how they deal with the uncertainty inherent in any hydrological process farmer and vogel 2016 this distinctive feature makes them suitable for hydrological modelling some relevant examples are autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima models multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and causal reasoning cr based methods zazo et al 2020 in this sense cr approach which is based on probabilistic graphical models and bayes theorem molina et al 2020 as an ai technique is a powerful stochastic approach and is especially relevant to this research for the following reasons 1 it uses raw data zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 2 it does not require a priori knowledge of the process nourani et al 2011 3 it doesn t require a large amount of data to perform well zhang and bivens 2007 4 it is able to define sophisticated relationships in complex natural systems molina et al 2013 5 it is a powerful tool for discovering causal structures in raw statistical data spirtes 2010 additionally as shown by some studies zazo 2017 the potential for using causality to deal with temporal river behaviour has recently begun to be explored using cr in arid and semi arid areas the demand for flood forecasting is rapidly increasing so that it is becoming a severe issue in water science since flood forecasting is entirely different from that of humid areas kan et al 2017 hydrological modelling of semi arid and arid basins is challenging due to the specific characteristics of these basins spatio temporal variability of runoff that sub basins bring about resulting in a highly complicated rainfall runoff relationship and lapses in storage excess runoff generation mechanisms wang et al 2010 furthermore in arid and semi arid areas few models are considered adequate due to the difficulty in effectively modelling rainfall runoff events hao et al 2018 streamflow is ephemeral under these conditions as there are few runoff events per annum thus generally no hydrological response at the basin outlet hydrological research is inadequate in semi arid and arid zones due to insufficient hydrological and meteorological data semi arid and arid zones experience flash floods where rainfall intensity is usually very high and rainfall duration is low ragettli et al 2017 manifested by high peaks and rapid flows and considerable human and economic losses bafitlhile and li 2019 recently there has been increasing interest in applying the bayesian approach to extreme value problems yang et al 2016 on the other hand ephemeral streams which are more extended than expected that carry a significant risk of flooding while they historically have been underestimated due to their intermittent flow and the lack of knowledge about their hydrogeomorphology currently european legislation recognises their associated risk and supports research into them adapting the scale and methodology to their characteristics camarasa belmonte 2021 the province of almería in spain presents extraordinary climatological geomorphological and hydrological characteristics the aridity together with the torrential rains and with the orography makes the wadis ephemeral rivers suddenly flooded with water which can cause very large personal and economic damages garcía 2019 almería is established next to its port and the andarax river the proximity of the river caused the city to suffer severe flooding produced by the overflow of the andarax river engendering damage in neighbourhoods close to the riverbed and in cultivated areas among the greatest historical floods we can mention those of september 1829 september 1830 october 1871 october 1879 september 1888 september 1891 and october 1973 cedex 2008 as an illustration the greatest climatological tragedy occurred on september 11 1891 a spectacular storm that discharged 158 mm in three hours turned most of the streets of almeria into ravines dying dragged by the muddy waters 10 people the recorded rainfall values their violence and distribution runoff and solid transport made the event the most catastrophic of the 19th century in the andarax river basin in the 20th century the most important flood event in terms of damage is the one of 1970 carrying cars to the sea as a consequence of the force of the flow flood events occurred in the last two decades such as that of september 2012 and others are the subject of this study for more details on the list of historical floods in the andarax river basin since the year 1500 and on the description of these events references such as brembilla 2016 garcía 2019 molina 1987 can be consulted in this sense this research study is aimed to contribute towards the characterisation and prediction of the magnitude of extreme flood events in the semi arid upper andarax watershed to estimate their associated uncertainty and to quantify the impact of their causal factors based on a bayesian causal modelling bcm approach and accounting for 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration 3 previous soil moisture influence for that this paper is structured as follows case study the main mathematical approaches and the general research methodology are provided in the materials and methods section the results and discussions of this study are detailed in the results and discussion section finally a section of conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the upper andarax watershed according to the nomenclature of the european union water framework directive ec 2000 is part of the andarax river basin which is located in the south western area of the province of almeria and which belongs to the andalusian mediterranean basins the upper andarax is characterised by uneven topography and its striking hydraulic heritage its land occupation is restricted by topography with agriculture occupying 14 of the territory cabello et al 2015 the upper andarax stream has a length of approximately 40 km and the watershed has an area of about 500 km² with a concentration time ct of 10 1 h according to the legal requirement in spain it is located between the coordinates 36 58 n 2 35 w and 37 10 n 2 54 w the stream crosses the narrow andarax valley south of the sierra nevada and north of the sierra de gador heading east and joins the nacimiento river at the height of the town of terque from where it is known as the almería river according to the traditional toponymy in the upper basin of andarax river materials of metamorphic origin micaschists and phyllites outcrop in sierra nevada carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite in sierra de gádor together with conglomerates sandy loams and alluvial deposits that outcrop in the central zone of the valley navarro martinez et al 2018 the study area has some characteristics of a typical semiarid climate including mild temperatures in the winter and long dry and warm summers precipitation tends to occur in the form of convective storm systems with up to 70 of the annual precipitation taking place over 25 of the rainy days the hydrology is conditioned by the special rainfall regime which as a mediterranean river is distinguished by rain and snow and has a swift hydrologic response maldonado et al 2022 2 2 methodology this paper s methodology is inspired from the hydropredict extreme tool molina et al 2022 based on bayesian causal modelling bcm a technique within artificial intelligence ai including the following new considerations 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration 3 previous soil moisture influence and applied to an ephemeral river within a semi arid basin fig 1 shows the basic flowchart of the proposed method it comprises three main phases i data preparation ii extreme events characterisation and analysis and iii bcm predictive modelling a detailed description of each step is provided below 2 2 1 data preparation 2 2 1 1 data collection the study is based on original hourly data recorded by the saih hidrosur automatic hydrological information system network these are level m runoff m3 s and rainfall mm data from one hydrometric station andarax y nacimiento terque code number 090r03 and one meteorological station ohanes code number 091p01 distributed as shown in the fig 2 the analysed period comprises 24 years and half ranging from june 1997 to december 2021 other types of data such as digital elevation model dem available in 5 m x 5 m spatial resolution and high spatial resolution satellite images 0 25 m x 0 25 m downloaded from the cnig website https centrodedescargas cnig es were used 2 2 1 2 data preprocessing few erroneous data were observed notably in the series of flow discharge by having the water level data the rating curve was drawn to correct these errors a much more hydrological and more reliable method the water level data as well as their corresponding flow discharge data presents some drifts and wrong measurements for a total intermittent period of more or less three years due to the sensitivity of the sensors especially following potential flooding events so they have been excluded from the whole dataset to avoid high uncertainties thereafter the basic information of the observatories and the dataset statistics after being pre processed are show in table 1 rainfall station ohanes receives an annual average of 295 mm corresponding to approximately 1 13 mm3 of average annual inflow the mean flow discharge at the outlet is 0 16 m3 s and an average of 131 days per year exhibit zero flow while for about 347 days per year the flow does not exceed 0 1 m3 s the two coefficients skewness and kurtosis in table 1 are used to examine the data distribution practically both data variables have very large values of these coefficients and therefore do not have a normal distribution regarding the annual rainfall distribution the majority of rainfall about 40 falls in autumn while the minority about 10 falls in summer the rest is shared between winter and spring with little superiority for winter the annual rainfall seasonality over the past 24 years is shown in fig 3 a linear correlation coefficient has been calculated to measure the statistical relationship between rainfall p mm and flow discharge q m3 s data series the obtained value is very close to zero which reflects the non linear rainfall flow relationship 2 2 1 3 extreme events identification extreme events are defined as values of the event above a certain value called threshold a well chosen threshold helps to identify the extreme levels several methods have been used to determine threshold to analyse and model extreme events murage et al 2019 such as the annual discharge maxima and the peaks over threshold pot bačová mitková and onderka 2010 in our context the idea adopted is that the threshold of these events is the downstream bankfull flow in other words the maximum amount of discharge that the stream channel after the confluence with nacimiento river can carry without overflowing for this purpose the hydraulic method of calculating the flow through the manning strickler equation was used for that the longitudinal profile and eleven cross sections between the confluence of the andarax river with the nacimiento river and its confluence with another intermittent affluent called rambla de gérgal have been realised to obtain the physical parameters of the flow section using the dem after prospecting the land use of the riverbanks using satellite images their corresponding calculated bankfull flow discharge manning coefficient is supposed to be very high garcía 2019 ortiz 2014 it was taken as 0 35 ranges between 4 and 18 m3 s with an average of 9 m3 s the minimum bankfull flow 4 m3 s as the threshold causing flooding sayama et al 2020 was chosen for extremes identification so the events that their peaks individually or in addition to those recorded at the outlet of the nacimiento river exceed the chosen threshold were selected to apply the rest of the methodology as a result six simple events and two complex events were identified complex events were then divided into independent sub events to get a total of 12 separate events all the events have occurred between autumn and the beginning of winter according to the hydrological year this method was adopted to help us in sampling a sufficient number of extremal high flow events 2 2 2 extreme events characterisation and analysis 2 2 2 1 extremes characteristics subsequently to extremes identification the characteristics of each event such as duration maximum intensity average intensity total rainfall peak discharge and response time were analysed the study of the characteristics of extreme events is crucial to on the one hand a distinguish them from events that are unable to generate or that generate insignificant and low flow discharges on the other hand b to elicit the causal factor variables of the basin response 2 2 2 2 temporal rainfall distribution temporal rainfall distribution is important for runoff understanding and modelling a convenient and established method for characterising rainfall hyetographs is the use of non dimensional huff curves yin et al 2016 the huff curve is a dimensionless cumulative hyetograph initially developed by huff 1967 to characterise the rainfall temporal distributions in an area where traditionally the storm events are first classified into four quartiles then a quartile curve is developed at a certain probability and finally a series of huff curves are developed at different probabilities within each quartile pan et al 2019 the use of huff curves was extended later to rainfall hyetograph simulation to feed rainfall runoff models azli and rao 2010 huff curves are also used to analyse the influence of temporal rainfall distribution and rainfall duration on the discharge values distribution bezak 2018 moreover temporal rainfall distribution can be compared to other areas and used with other characteristics to investigate the feasibility of extrapolating rainfall runoff models details about the huff curves construction procedure can be found in yin et al 2016 rainfall events identified from the previous phase are the basic data used in the development of dimensionless hyetographs and huff curves however bonta and shahalam 2003 showed that the smaller the number of storms the more visually rough or jagged huff curves are and that a minimum of about 110 140 storm samples is required to derive a stable huff curves for that first based on the rainfall duration events were divided into the following four quartiles 6 h type i 6 12 hours type ii 12 18 hours type iii and 18 24 hours type iv next for each event type or quartile dimensionless cumulative rainfall curve was built then based on the latter a general point developed huff curves were generated for all quartiles due to the small number of events sampled huﬀ curves were derived for the following probability levels 2 5 10 30 50 70 90 95 and 98 2 2 2 3 causality assumptions and statistical dependency the study of the basin response generally involves three types of features chevallier 1983 1 morphological and topographical basin characteristics 2 rainstorm characteristics and 3 soil moisture status the first parameters practically do not vary so the basin response is more likely dependent on rainfall intensity and soil moisture for that this part is aimed to assess the flow rainfall dependence strengthen and the role of antecedent conditions in basin response soil moisture plays a significant role in determining the probability of flooding in a given area elsaadani et al 2021 the previous soil moisture represents the relative wetness before the rainfall flow event and can have a significant impact on basin response due to the absence of soil moisture data antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall before the start of the event was used to express the soil moisture in order to achieve the aforementioned objective the chi square statistical test of independence was performed between flow discharge and rainfall and previous soil moisture and certain association coefficients such as pearson s phi contingency coefficient and cramer s v were calculated the contingency coefficient and cramer s v values have a maximum limit of 1 while for pearson s phi it corresponds to the minimum of the roots of r 1 and c 1 r and c refer to number of rows and columns respectively it is equal to 3 317 and 4 359 for rainfall flow and previous soil moisture flow respectively but before that and to make the assumed causal variables rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions in parallel with their corresponding hydrological response response time rt has been derived from the hyetograph hydrograph hydrological method as the time between the two corresponding peaks and then removed from the time series 2 2 3 bcm predictive modelling the data series obtained from previous phase will feed the causal model through bayesian networks bns bn is a probabilistic graphical model pgm consisting on a set of random variables organised in a directed acyclic graph dag which is formed by parent and child nodes and arcs connecting them to each other scutari 2016 and based on bayes theorem to express the conditional probability distribution of an event given the occurrence of another event provided that these two events are interdependent stated as the eq 1 bayes price and null 1763 1 p a b p b a p a p b p b 0 where a and b are two events and p a b is a conditional probability called the posterior probability of a given b p b a also a conditional probability called the posterior probability of b given a p a and p b are the prior probabilities of a and b respectively 2 2 3 1 learning bayesian network learning includes two aspects structure learning and parameter learning structure learning refers to learning the structure of the dag from data and it can be achieved by two major approaches score based and constraint based causal learning parviainen and kaski 2017 nevertheless in the simplest case the bayesian structure can be specified by an expert if the relationship between child nodes and parent nodes is known in this study the flow discharge is influenced by the rainfall event i e rainfall intensity and the antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall so the bayesian structure is known parameter learning refers to learning the distribution or the conditional probability tables cpt of a bn from data once the bayesian topological structure is defined there are different parameter learning algorithms such as expectation maximisation gradient descent and monte carlo methods reed and mengshoel 2014 in this study expectation maximisation em algorithm was adopted to conduct the parameter learning and to perform the maximum likelihood bayes network to understand how the algorithm works references such as korb and nicholson 2004 russell and norvig 2009 can be consulted the bn model was trained using both complete and partial datasets 2 2 3 2 inference the flow discharge bcm was simulated by inferring prior knowledge on the observation rainfall intensity and antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall of the upstream meteorological station 2 2 3 3 evaluation evaluation is an important aspect in building our bcm to evaluate the model quantitative performance three types of evaluation methods are to be discussed evidence sensitivity analysis data based evaluation and scenario analysis 2 2 3 4 evidence sensitivity analysis it is intended to examine the sensitivity of results considering variations in evidence kjærulff and madsen 2008 and helps to identify which inputs most affect the output richards et al 2013 it is commonly performed in a probabilistic way using two statistic quantitative measures variance reduction vr and mutual information mi i e entropy reduction marcot 2012 expressed in percentage vr measures the precision of the estimates resulting from a given simulation botev and ridder 2017 and ranges from 0 to 100 where higher percentage means a higher effect mi is defined as the expected reduction in entropy uncertainty it reports the expected degree to which the joint probability of two variables x and y from what it would be if they were independent korb and nicholson 2004 if mi is equal to zero x and y are mutually independent pearl 1988 the reader may refer to norsys 2005 to understand their mathematical expressions 2 2 3 5 data based evaluation the data were also used to evaluate the general bcm for that 10 events including ev1 ev2 ev3 ev4 s2 ev4 s3 ev5 ev6 s1 ev6 s2 ev7 ev8 have been used to train the model and 2 events including ev4 s1 and ev6 s3 have been used to test the model another new interesting event that was recorded the 26 03 2022 at 04 00 with a duration of 10 h whose characteristics are as follows maximum rainfall intensity 6 0 mm h average rainfall intensity 3 4 mm h total accumulated rainfall 33 6 mm peak flow 3 5 m3 s and a lag time of 6 h has been used together with the two previous events to test the model to get an approximate training testing split ratio of 80 20 to evaluate the classification success and the degree of adjustment of the bcm in comparison with the test cases error rate and three scoring rules namely logarithmic loss quadratic loss brier score and spherical payoff han et al 2019 were utilised logarithmic loss quantifies the classifier s accuracy by penalising misclassification and ranges from zero to infinity with zero indicating the best goodness of fit quadratic loss is the square of the difference between the predicted and the actual probability vectors and ranges between 0 and 2 where zero corresponds to the best execution values of spherical payoff vary between 0 and 1 with 1 being the best model performance rong et al 2020 this reference could be consulted for their corresponding equations 2 2 3 6 scenario analysis scenario analysis is a parametric sensitivity analysis that looks at how changes in model parameters cpts would affect query results it is a kind of model state simulation by inferring causal effects from observational data and to judge whether the resulting probabilities are reasonable and logical through expert and experiential knowledge 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall runoff extreme events characterisation and temporal rainfall distribution the characteristics of the previously identified events namely date of occurrence duration maximal intensity imax average intensity iavg total rainfall pt peak discharge peak q response time and antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall pr24 are resumed in table 2 their maximal intensity ranges from a minimum of 1 1 mm h to a maximum of 22 2 mm h and their corresponding peak discharges from 1 1 to 26 1 m3 s some of them are characterised by a short duration but with a high rainfall intensity while others last a long time and accumulate a large amount of precipitation others present a short duration a moderate rainfall intensity and consequently a moderate amount of rainfall but are preceded by other rainfall events in this case the soil is sufficiently completely or partially wet so that the event in question can generate runoff at the outlet of the watershed the amplitude of which depends on the total accumulated rainfall based on these characteristics it can be concluded that the high flow hydrological events tend to occur when the soil is previously saturated but also when rainfall is most extreme this shows the complex and dynamic rainfall runoff relationship of the upper andarax watershed table 3 shows the division of rainfall events into four quartiles according to rainfall duration and their average characteristics many previous studies have reported that rain quartile i is the most frequent compared to other quartiles back 2011 huff 1990 perica et al 2013 our result showed that the rainfall station has the largest number of rainstorms in 2nd quartile followed by the 1st quartile as it was found for peninsular malaysia in azli and rao 2010 this is mainly due to the definition of events where in all the aforementioned studies the data analysis focused on defining a criterion for rainfall events separation whereas this study focused on flooding hydrological events identification for rainfall events definition in addition this might be partly due to differences in rainfall characteristics for different climate locations out of the total 12 rainstorms 3 4 are in quartile i and quartile ii corresponding to an average response time of 4 3 h which testifies that the study area is distinguished by a swift hydrological response maldonado et al 2022 as it is mentioned in section 2 1 only one rain event has been recorded in quartile iii and two events in quartile iv however they exhibit the highest average peak discharges due to their long duration and total amount of rainfall the cumulative hyetographs were calculated and then non dimensionalised by dividing the values on the axis by the duration of the storm and the values of the ordinates by the total rainfall depth an example of each first second third and fourth quartile average dimensionless cumulative hyetographs is shown in fig 4 their analysis reveals that first second and fourth quartiles are close to each other especially the second and the fourth ones which behave almost like a diagonal however it seems that the third quartile dimensionless cumulative hyetograph has greater difference than the others it is represented by only one exceptional rainfall event ev8 that in reality behaves like events type ii since approximately 97 5 of the total rainfall occur in the first 12 h of the event only 2 4 mm negligible rainfall fall in the last 4 h in addition it behaves as a diagonal in the first 60 of the event duration even like the fourth rain quartile it can be concluded consequently that the upper andarax represented by ohanes rainfall station is generally characterised by a symmetric temporal rainfall distribution hyetograph in this case the effect of duration on the shape of the cumulative dimensionless hyetographs is negligible which is consistent with yin et al s results for the central and eastern parts of china yin et al 2016 the corresponding dimensionless hydrographs are shown in fig 5 there is a strong similarity in the temporal distributions of flow discharges being in general symmetric as a result of a symmetric hyetographs however there is a small difference in the hydrographs shape due to temporal rainfall distribution that affect hydrograph peak values and rainfall duration this leads to a different time to peak values and other hydrograph characteristics such as a duration of rising and falling parts of the hydrograph besides rainfall events type ii relatively correspond to a platykurtic curve since they exhibit the lowest average peak discharge compared to other event types a weibull function has been adjusted to the dimensionless cumulative rainfall curves to calculate the non exceedance probability 2 5 10 30 50 70 90 95 and 98 that is how the curves that relate cumulative rainfall in and rainfall duration in with the probability fig 6 are obtained each curve represents a dimensionless hyetograph associated with a probability and therefore with a return period which can be considered equal to the inverse of the exceedance probability in the present study as the huff curves are developed by using data from individual station they are called as point developed huff curves the idea or the possibility of generating a general point developed huff curves including all quartiles due to the small number of events can be supported by the obtained results regarding the symmetric temporal distributions of rainfall and flow discharges based on the design requirements which impose a certain return period it will be possible to choose the design curve corresponding to the probability of the hyetograph and to simulate its corresponding hydrological response in general it corresponds to 50 in this study the 50 probability which is equivalent to a two year return period correspond to an almost symmetrical temporal rainfall distribution within these circumstances the first 50 of the rainfall depth occur in the first 50 of the rainfall duration and the second 50 in the second 50 of rainfall duration 3 2 statistical dependency rt corresponding to each event or sub event is mentioned in table 2 it ranges from 1 to 15 h with an average of 5 7 h it should be noted that the prediction of the response time is not the subject of this study however further studies can rely on the same methodology to develop in parallel a bcm for rt prediction alternatively it can be taken as the total average or the average for each type of rainfall event table 3 or even through cluster or principal component analyses based on the different extreme events characteristics the results of the chi square statistical test of independence show a calculated p value 0 0001 well below the significance level of 0 05 this reveals the existence of a statistically significant association and dependence di leo and sardanelli 2020 between rainfall intensity and flow discharge and between previous soil moisture represented by antecedent cumulative rainfall and flow discharge the calculated association coefficients are summarised in table 4 according to the association coefficients limits the results clearly mark the association between the variables in question however some differences in the interpretation of these coefficients are found in the literature for instance regarding the cramer s v the rainfall flow and previous soil moisture flow associations can be interpreted as strong and moderate respectively according to lee 2016 whereas according to akoglu 2018 both are interpreted as very strong associations anyway the flow is clearly more dependent on the rainfall intensity than on the previous soil moisture the higher the coefficients values the more the variables are interdependent 3 3 bayesian causal modelling based on the previous rigorous characterisation it was decided to build four sub models corresponding to each type of rainfall events and a general model including all events 3 3 1 learning training and simulation learning was done automatically using netica 6 09 application software norsys 2005 rainfall and flow discharge data were divided into a certain number of intervals since netica does not support the introduction of continuous variables the number of intervals was first maximised fig 7 to test the predictive capacity of the models then it was adjusted due to the scarce and limited dataset and consequently the inability of the models to simulate all possible scenarios the results of the simulated more complex general model fig 7 show that the average probable flow discharge value is 2 3 m3 s the simulation results of the four sub models based on the training data are shown in fig 8 3 3 2 evaluation 3 3 2 1 evidence sensitivity analysis an evidence sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the sub models and the general model using variance reduction vr and mutual information mi this was done to estimate the impact of a change in the state of the causal or parent node rainfall and pr24 rainfall intensity and antecedent soil conditions at ohanes rainfall station on the state of the query node flow discharge flow discharge at the andarax hydrometric station table 5 summarises the evidence sensitivity analysis results of flow discharge node using variance reduction and mutual information as shown in the results and not surprisingly variance reduction and mutual information are equal to 100 for the flow discharge which is the target variable among the parent nodes in general modelling flow discharge is most sensitive to rainfall and less sensitive to pr24 in terms of vr the influence of rainfall intensity on vr decreases with the increase of rainfall duration sub model i to sub model iv while the impact of pr24 increases this is justified by the fact that flow discharge values are largely caused by rainfall intensity for short duration rainfall events while for longer duration rainfall events they are caused by cumulative rainfall and soil saturation as shown in the characterisation phase table 3 where events type i present the highest average maximal intensity while the longer events type iii and iv present the highest cumulative rainfall however precedent conditions have a significant impact on reducing uncertainty mi sometimes even greater than that of rainfall intensity sub model i ii and iv this happens because the flows in the recession curve and the base flows that follow it even if the rainfall event has ended can coincide with high values of cumulative rainfall admittedly this increasing cumulative rainfall does not influence the decrease in flow values but it does increase the belief that large cumulative rainfall values generally coincide with low recession curve flows or its following base flows for that it is recommended for further studies when sufficient records and data are available to predict separately the rising and the falling curves of the hydrograph molina et al 2022 3 3 2 2 data based evaluation about 390 h were used to train the general model while 110 hours data were used for its validation validation results showed that 25 cases were erroneously classified which represent an error rate of 22 7 if a reduced number of long intervals is chosen the error rate must be markedly low or even zero despite this the accuracy rate is highly satisfactory the logarithmic loss quadratic loss and spherical payoff statistics also show a fairly good fit on the one hand the logarithmic loss and the quadratic loss exhibit relatively low values 0 84 and 0 30 respectively while the spherical payoff has a value 0 8 close to one according to previous studies that used the same scoring rules through netica software to evaluate bayesian predictive models the obtained values indicate a remarkable model performance han et al 2019 and fully prove its excellent predictability dlamini 2010 rong et al 2020 3 3 2 3 scenario analysis this is the second type of sensitivity analysis where researchers previously used to employ only one or the other of these methods in any one study pollino et al 2007 it was seen by data exploration that rainfall goes with runoff for all the three first sub models i ii and iii additionally evidence sensitivity analysis showed that the impact of cumulative rainfall indicating initial and previous soil state on the vr of the flow discharge is very low compared to that of the rainfall intensity for that pr24 has been excluded and the number of intervals has been reduced and adjusted to the available dataset on the other hand for type iv events the impact of pr 24 on the vr of the flow discharge compared to that of rainfall is almost half also it has been verified through the dataset that when low rainfall intensities coincide with relatively high flows this can only be explained by the influence of the antecedent soil conditions in this case the pr24 was maintained and the number of intervals was adjusted fig 8 the number of intervals despite reduced it is useful and sufficient to prevent the flooding risk knowing the downstream bankfull flow netica provides an easy way to test a scenario allowing the user to input evidence into a node by setting a specific distribution to a node the effect of the scenario can then be examined by its influence on other nodes by probability propagation figs 8a and 8b show the simulation results of the four sub models in average and maximum peak scenarios respectively all sub models present a logical and reasonable behaviour with respect to a maximum peak scenario this has also been verified and noticed for all other model states and scenarios both simulated scenarios demonstrate that quartiles iii and iv rainfall events even less frequent exhibit the highest average and maximum peak discharges in presence of extreme rainfall conditions that can exceed greatly the minimum bankfull flow of the upper andarax river hence causing floods and possible associated economic damages quartiles i and ii flash floods events are more frequent but less dangerous at least at local scale but that may contribute with other tributaries to the downstream overflowing of the andarax river and the flooding of the city of almeria since all the identified extreme events have been associated with real floods recorded in the city of almeria and studied in depth by garcía 2019 with respect to previous studies the majority that used bayesian predictive models for flood forecasting was dedicated to only predict the flood peak discharges in regions with abundant data for the full flooding hydrographs prediction despite the hydropredict extreme one study made by boutkhamouine et al 2020 was found it consists on runoff runoff modelling to estimate the discharge at the outlet of the salat river basin france based on the discharge from the upstream gauging stations and in which the authors had to deal with the time of flow transfer instead of the response time without any previous hydrological characterisation without considering the base flow and without events distinction the model showed good performances estimating the river flow as mentioned by the authors this method constitutes an essential and less explored domain and this is the starting point of a brand new research line on the hydrological extremes prediction 4 conclusions with the objective of predicting extreme high flow events in the upper andarax watershed in se spain estimating their associated uncertainty and assessing the impact of their causal factors an event based bayesian causal modelling bcm approach was adopted based on three main phases including 1 data preparation 2 extremes characterisation and analysis 3 predictive bayesian causal modelling and accounting for 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration and 3 previous soil moisture influence as a result twelve rainfall runoff events were selected their characterisation revealed the complex and dynamic non linear rainfall flow relationship in the semi arid upper andarax watershed where high flow hydrological events tend to occur when rainfall is most extreme but also when the soil is previously saturated this may be due to the spatio temporal variability of precipitation within the watershed or even to the associated meteorological conditions that it is recommended to identify characterise and model them in a probabilistic way it was also found that the selected events and divided into four quartiles are generally characterised by a symmetric rainfall distribution conducing to a symmetric basin response the statistical dependency between variables showed that the basin response is more dependent on the rainfall intensity than on the soil moisture represented by the antecedent cumulative rainfall and that the latter has a significant effect on the quartile iv extreme events and may be very useful to reduce the uncertainty on the predicted value of the flow the bcm predictive models have shown a great ability to understand and to model this complex relationship even with limited and scarce dataset and model complexity regarding the high number of states and shorter intervals furthermore the predictive models present a reasonable and logical behaviour with respect to peak values but also for all model states and scenarios finally the simulated sub models demonstrated that the most hazardous events are those of quartiles iii and iv whereas all events types may contribute to river overflowing and flooding beyond the watershed geographical limits this study could be a decision making tool for flood risk management in the andarax river basin further researches could be conducted to investigate the possibility of using satellite based soil moisture data instead of precipitation for the analysis of soil moisture status which may improve the results to investigate the possibility to extrapolate the results on ungauged river basins in se spain constrained by similar physiographic characteristics and climatic conditions to estimate the futuristic flood magnitude based on the projection of future pluvial flooding events under climate data

contribution to improve the prediction accuracy they are proficient in building mathematical linear or non linear causal relationships between historical input and output variables without directly considering the underlying physics of the investigated process kumar et al 2016 overcoming the process driven models weaknesses ai based data driven approaches can be classified into deterministic and stochastic in recent decades stochastic model based approaches have emerged in the development of hydrological models as a result of advances in computer science molina et al 2020 these models are fundamentally different from the deterministic ones in how they deal with the uncertainty inherent in any hydrological process farmer and vogel 2016 this distinctive feature makes them suitable for hydrological modelling some relevant examples are autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima models multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and causal reasoning cr based methods zazo et al 2020 in this sense cr approach which is based on probabilistic graphical models and bayes theorem molina et al 2020 as an ai technique is a powerful stochastic approach and is especially relevant to this research for the following reasons 1 it uses raw data zounemat kermani and teshnehlab 2008 2 it does not require a priori knowledge of the process nourani et al 2011 3 it doesn t require a large amount of data to perform well zhang and bivens 2007 4 it is able to define sophisticated relationships in complex natural systems molina et al 2013 5 it is a powerful tool for discovering causal structures in raw statistical data spirtes 2010 additionally as shown by some studies zazo 2017 the potential for using causality to deal with temporal river behaviour has recently begun to be explored using cr in arid and semi arid areas the demand for flood forecasting is rapidly increasing so that it is becoming a severe issue in water science since flood forecasting is entirely different from that of humid areas kan et al 2017 hydrological modelling of semi arid and arid basins is challenging due to the specific characteristics of these basins spatio temporal variability of runoff that sub basins bring about resulting in a highly complicated rainfall runoff relationship and lapses in storage excess runoff generation mechanisms wang et al 2010 furthermore in arid and semi arid areas few models are considered adequate due to the difficulty in effectively modelling rainfall runoff events hao et al 2018 streamflow is ephemeral under these conditions as there are few runoff events per annum thus generally no hydrological response at the basin outlet hydrological research is inadequate in semi arid and arid zones due to insufficient hydrological and meteorological data semi arid and arid zones experience flash floods where rainfall intensity is usually very high and rainfall duration is low ragettli et al 2017 manifested by high peaks and rapid flows and considerable human and economic losses bafitlhile and li 2019 recently there has been increasing interest in applying the bayesian approach to extreme value problems yang et al 2016 on the other hand ephemeral streams which are more extended than expected that carry a significant risk of flooding while they historically have been underestimated due to their intermittent flow and the lack of knowledge about their hydrogeomorphology currently european legislation recognises their associated risk and supports research into them adapting the scale and methodology to their characteristics camarasa belmonte 2021 the province of almería in spain presents extraordinary climatological geomorphological and hydrological characteristics the aridity together with the torrential rains and with the orography makes the wadis ephemeral rivers suddenly flooded with water which can cause very large personal and economic damages garcía 2019 almería is established next to its port and the andarax river the proximity of the river caused the city to suffer severe flooding produced by the overflow of the andarax river engendering damage in neighbourhoods close to the riverbed and in cultivated areas among the greatest historical floods we can mention those of september 1829 september 1830 october 1871 october 1879 september 1888 september 1891 and october 1973 cedex 2008 as an illustration the greatest climatological tragedy occurred on september 11 1891 a spectacular storm that discharged 158 mm in three hours turned most of the streets of almeria into ravines dying dragged by the muddy waters 10 people the recorded rainfall values their violence and distribution runoff and solid transport made the event the most catastrophic of the 19th century in the andarax river basin in the 20th century the most important flood event in terms of damage is the one of 1970 carrying cars to the sea as a consequence of the force of the flow flood events occurred in the last two decades such as that of september 2012 and others are the subject of this study for more details on the list of historical floods in the andarax river basin since the year 1500 and on the description of these events references such as brembilla 2016 garcía 2019 molina 1987 can be consulted in this sense this research study is aimed to contribute towards the characterisation and prediction of the magnitude of extreme flood events in the semi arid upper andarax watershed to estimate their associated uncertainty and to quantify the impact of their causal factors based on a bayesian causal modelling bcm approach and accounting for 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration 3 previous soil moisture influence for that this paper is structured as follows case study the main mathematical approaches and the general research methodology are provided in the materials and methods section the results and discussions of this study are detailed in the results and discussion section finally a section of conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the upper andarax watershed according to the nomenclature of the european union water framework directive ec 2000 is part of the andarax river basin which is located in the south western area of the province of almeria and which belongs to the andalusian mediterranean basins the upper andarax is characterised by uneven topography and its striking hydraulic heritage its land occupation is restricted by topography with agriculture occupying 14 of the territory cabello et al 2015 the upper andarax stream has a length of approximately 40 km and the watershed has an area of about 500 km² with a concentration time ct of 10 1 h according to the legal requirement in spain it is located between the coordinates 36 58 n 2 35 w and 37 10 n 2 54 w the stream crosses the narrow andarax valley south of the sierra nevada and north of the sierra de gador heading east and joins the nacimiento river at the height of the town of terque from where it is known as the almería river according to the traditional toponymy in the upper basin of andarax river materials of metamorphic origin micaschists and phyllites outcrop in sierra nevada carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite in sierra de gádor together with conglomerates sandy loams and alluvial deposits that outcrop in the central zone of the valley navarro martinez et al 2018 the study area has some characteristics of a typical semiarid climate including mild temperatures in the winter and long dry and warm summers precipitation tends to occur in the form of convective storm systems with up to 70 of the annual precipitation taking place over 25 of the rainy days the hydrology is conditioned by the special rainfall regime which as a mediterranean river is distinguished by rain and snow and has a swift hydrologic response maldonado et al 2022 2 2 methodology this paper s methodology is inspired from the hydropredict extreme tool molina et al 2022 based on bayesian causal modelling bcm a technique within artificial intelligence ai including the following new considerations 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration 3 previous soil moisture influence and applied to an ephemeral river within a semi arid basin fig 1 shows the basic flowchart of the proposed method it comprises three main phases i data preparation ii extreme events characterisation and analysis and iii bcm predictive modelling a detailed description of each step is provided below 2 2 1 data preparation 2 2 1 1 data collection the study is based on original hourly data recorded by the saih hidrosur automatic hydrological information system network these are level m runoff m3 s and rainfall mm data from one hydrometric station andarax y nacimiento terque code number 090r03 and one meteorological station ohanes code number 091p01 distributed as shown in the fig 2 the analysed period comprises 24 years and half ranging from june 1997 to december 2021 other types of data such as digital elevation model dem available in 5 m x 5 m spatial resolution and high spatial resolution satellite images 0 25 m x 0 25 m downloaded from the cnig website https centrodedescargas cnig es were used 2 2 1 2 data preprocessing few erroneous data were observed notably in the series of flow discharge by having the water level data the rating curve was drawn to correct these errors a much more hydrological and more reliable method the water level data as well as their corresponding flow discharge data presents some drifts and wrong measurements for a total intermittent period of more or less three years due to the sensitivity of the sensors especially following potential flooding events so they have been excluded from the whole dataset to avoid high uncertainties thereafter the basic information of the observatories and the dataset statistics after being pre processed are show in table 1 rainfall station ohanes receives an annual average of 295 mm corresponding to approximately 1 13 mm3 of average annual inflow the mean flow discharge at the outlet is 0 16 m3 s and an average of 131 days per year exhibit zero flow while for about 347 days per year the flow does not exceed 0 1 m3 s the two coefficients skewness and kurtosis in table 1 are used to examine the data distribution practically both data variables have very large values of these coefficients and therefore do not have a normal distribution regarding the annual rainfall distribution the majority of rainfall about 40 falls in autumn while the minority about 10 falls in summer the rest is shared between winter and spring with little superiority for winter the annual rainfall seasonality over the past 24 years is shown in fig 3 a linear correlation coefficient has been calculated to measure the statistical relationship between rainfall p mm and flow discharge q m3 s data series the obtained value is very close to zero which reflects the non linear rainfall flow relationship 2 2 1 3 extreme events identification extreme events are defined as values of the event above a certain value called threshold a well chosen threshold helps to identify the extreme levels several methods have been used to determine threshold to analyse and model extreme events murage et al 2019 such as the annual discharge maxima and the peaks over threshold pot bačová mitková and onderka 2010 in our context the idea adopted is that the threshold of these events is the downstream bankfull flow in other words the maximum amount of discharge that the stream channel after the confluence with nacimiento river can carry without overflowing for this purpose the hydraulic method of calculating the flow through the manning strickler equation was used for that the longitudinal profile and eleven cross sections between the confluence of the andarax river with the nacimiento river and its confluence with another intermittent affluent called rambla de gérgal have been realised to obtain the physical parameters of the flow section using the dem after prospecting the land use of the riverbanks using satellite images their corresponding calculated bankfull flow discharge manning coefficient is supposed to be very high garcía 2019 ortiz 2014 it was taken as 0 35 ranges between 4 and 18 m3 s with an average of 9 m3 s the minimum bankfull flow 4 m3 s as the threshold causing flooding sayama et al 2020 was chosen for extremes identification so the events that their peaks individually or in addition to those recorded at the outlet of the nacimiento river exceed the chosen threshold were selected to apply the rest of the methodology as a result six simple events and two complex events were identified complex events were then divided into independent sub events to get a total of 12 separate events all the events have occurred between autumn and the beginning of winter according to the hydrological year this method was adopted to help us in sampling a sufficient number of extremal high flow events 2 2 2 extreme events characterisation and analysis 2 2 2 1 extremes characteristics subsequently to extremes identification the characteristics of each event such as duration maximum intensity average intensity total rainfall peak discharge and response time were analysed the study of the characteristics of extreme events is crucial to on the one hand a distinguish them from events that are unable to generate or that generate insignificant and low flow discharges on the other hand b to elicit the causal factor variables of the basin response 2 2 2 2 temporal rainfall distribution temporal rainfall distribution is important for runoff understanding and modelling a convenient and established method for characterising rainfall hyetographs is the use of non dimensional huff curves yin et al 2016 the huff curve is a dimensionless cumulative hyetograph initially developed by huff 1967 to characterise the rainfall temporal distributions in an area where traditionally the storm events are first classified into four quartiles then a quartile curve is developed at a certain probability and finally a series of huff curves are developed at different probabilities within each quartile pan et al 2019 the use of huff curves was extended later to rainfall hyetograph simulation to feed rainfall runoff models azli and rao 2010 huff curves are also used to analyse the influence of temporal rainfall distribution and rainfall duration on the discharge values distribution bezak 2018 moreover temporal rainfall distribution can be compared to other areas and used with other characteristics to investigate the feasibility of extrapolating rainfall runoff models details about the huff curves construction procedure can be found in yin et al 2016 rainfall events identified from the previous phase are the basic data used in the development of dimensionless hyetographs and huff curves however bonta and shahalam 2003 showed that the smaller the number of storms the more visually rough or jagged huff curves are and that a minimum of about 110 140 storm samples is required to derive a stable huff curves for that first based on the rainfall duration events were divided into the following four quartiles 6 h type i 6 12 hours type ii 12 18 hours type iii and 18 24 hours type iv next for each event type or quartile dimensionless cumulative rainfall curve was built then based on the latter a general point developed huff curves were generated for all quartiles due to the small number of events sampled huﬀ curves were derived for the following probability levels 2 5 10 30 50 70 90 95 and 98 2 2 2 3 causality assumptions and statistical dependency the study of the basin response generally involves three types of features chevallier 1983 1 morphological and topographical basin characteristics 2 rainstorm characteristics and 3 soil moisture status the first parameters practically do not vary so the basin response is more likely dependent on rainfall intensity and soil moisture for that this part is aimed to assess the flow rainfall dependence strengthen and the role of antecedent conditions in basin response soil moisture plays a significant role in determining the probability of flooding in a given area elsaadani et al 2021 the previous soil moisture represents the relative wetness before the rainfall flow event and can have a significant impact on basin response due to the absence of soil moisture data antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall before the start of the event was used to express the soil moisture in order to achieve the aforementioned objective the chi square statistical test of independence was performed between flow discharge and rainfall and previous soil moisture and certain association coefficients such as pearson s phi contingency coefficient and cramer s v were calculated the contingency coefficient and cramer s v values have a maximum limit of 1 while for pearson s phi it corresponds to the minimum of the roots of r 1 and c 1 r and c refer to number of rows and columns respectively it is equal to 3 317 and 4 359 for rainfall flow and previous soil moisture flow respectively but before that and to make the assumed causal variables rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture conditions in parallel with their corresponding hydrological response response time rt has been derived from the hyetograph hydrograph hydrological method as the time between the two corresponding peaks and then removed from the time series 2 2 3 bcm predictive modelling the data series obtained from previous phase will feed the causal model through bayesian networks bns bn is a probabilistic graphical model pgm consisting on a set of random variables organised in a directed acyclic graph dag which is formed by parent and child nodes and arcs connecting them to each other scutari 2016 and based on bayes theorem to express the conditional probability distribution of an event given the occurrence of another event provided that these two events are interdependent stated as the eq 1 bayes price and null 1763 1 p a b p b a p a p b p b 0 where a and b are two events and p a b is a conditional probability called the posterior probability of a given b p b a also a conditional probability called the posterior probability of b given a p a and p b are the prior probabilities of a and b respectively 2 2 3 1 learning bayesian network learning includes two aspects structure learning and parameter learning structure learning refers to learning the structure of the dag from data and it can be achieved by two major approaches score based and constraint based causal learning parviainen and kaski 2017 nevertheless in the simplest case the bayesian structure can be specified by an expert if the relationship between child nodes and parent nodes is known in this study the flow discharge is influenced by the rainfall event i e rainfall intensity and the antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall so the bayesian structure is known parameter learning refers to learning the distribution or the conditional probability tables cpt of a bn from data once the bayesian topological structure is defined there are different parameter learning algorithms such as expectation maximisation gradient descent and monte carlo methods reed and mengshoel 2014 in this study expectation maximisation em algorithm was adopted to conduct the parameter learning and to perform the maximum likelihood bayes network to understand how the algorithm works references such as korb and nicholson 2004 russell and norvig 2009 can be consulted the bn model was trained using both complete and partial datasets 2 2 3 2 inference the flow discharge bcm was simulated by inferring prior knowledge on the observation rainfall intensity and antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall of the upstream meteorological station 2 2 3 3 evaluation evaluation is an important aspect in building our bcm to evaluate the model quantitative performance three types of evaluation methods are to be discussed evidence sensitivity analysis data based evaluation and scenario analysis 2 2 3 4 evidence sensitivity analysis it is intended to examine the sensitivity of results considering variations in evidence kjærulff and madsen 2008 and helps to identify which inputs most affect the output richards et al 2013 it is commonly performed in a probabilistic way using two statistic quantitative measures variance reduction vr and mutual information mi i e entropy reduction marcot 2012 expressed in percentage vr measures the precision of the estimates resulting from a given simulation botev and ridder 2017 and ranges from 0 to 100 where higher percentage means a higher effect mi is defined as the expected reduction in entropy uncertainty it reports the expected degree to which the joint probability of two variables x and y from what it would be if they were independent korb and nicholson 2004 if mi is equal to zero x and y are mutually independent pearl 1988 the reader may refer to norsys 2005 to understand their mathematical expressions 2 2 3 5 data based evaluation the data were also used to evaluate the general bcm for that 10 events including ev1 ev2 ev3 ev4 s2 ev4 s3 ev5 ev6 s1 ev6 s2 ev7 ev8 have been used to train the model and 2 events including ev4 s1 and ev6 s3 have been used to test the model another new interesting event that was recorded the 26 03 2022 at 04 00 with a duration of 10 h whose characteristics are as follows maximum rainfall intensity 6 0 mm h average rainfall intensity 3 4 mm h total accumulated rainfall 33 6 mm peak flow 3 5 m3 s and a lag time of 6 h has been used together with the two previous events to test the model to get an approximate training testing split ratio of 80 20 to evaluate the classification success and the degree of adjustment of the bcm in comparison with the test cases error rate and three scoring rules namely logarithmic loss quadratic loss brier score and spherical payoff han et al 2019 were utilised logarithmic loss quantifies the classifier s accuracy by penalising misclassification and ranges from zero to infinity with zero indicating the best goodness of fit quadratic loss is the square of the difference between the predicted and the actual probability vectors and ranges between 0 and 2 where zero corresponds to the best execution values of spherical payoff vary between 0 and 1 with 1 being the best model performance rong et al 2020 this reference could be consulted for their corresponding equations 2 2 3 6 scenario analysis scenario analysis is a parametric sensitivity analysis that looks at how changes in model parameters cpts would affect query results it is a kind of model state simulation by inferring causal effects from observational data and to judge whether the resulting probabilities are reasonable and logical through expert and experiential knowledge 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall runoff extreme events characterisation and temporal rainfall distribution the characteristics of the previously identified events namely date of occurrence duration maximal intensity imax average intensity iavg total rainfall pt peak discharge peak q response time and antecedent 24 h cumulative rainfall pr24 are resumed in table 2 their maximal intensity ranges from a minimum of 1 1 mm h to a maximum of 22 2 mm h and their corresponding peak discharges from 1 1 to 26 1 m3 s some of them are characterised by a short duration but with a high rainfall intensity while others last a long time and accumulate a large amount of precipitation others present a short duration a moderate rainfall intensity and consequently a moderate amount of rainfall but are preceded by other rainfall events in this case the soil is sufficiently completely or partially wet so that the event in question can generate runoff at the outlet of the watershed the amplitude of which depends on the total accumulated rainfall based on these characteristics it can be concluded that the high flow hydrological events tend to occur when the soil is previously saturated but also when rainfall is most extreme this shows the complex and dynamic rainfall runoff relationship of the upper andarax watershed table 3 shows the division of rainfall events into four quartiles according to rainfall duration and their average characteristics many previous studies have reported that rain quartile i is the most frequent compared to other quartiles back 2011 huff 1990 perica et al 2013 our result showed that the rainfall station has the largest number of rainstorms in 2nd quartile followed by the 1st quartile as it was found for peninsular malaysia in azli and rao 2010 this is mainly due to the definition of events where in all the aforementioned studies the data analysis focused on defining a criterion for rainfall events separation whereas this study focused on flooding hydrological events identification for rainfall events definition in addition this might be partly due to differences in rainfall characteristics for different climate locations out of the total 12 rainstorms 3 4 are in quartile i and quartile ii corresponding to an average response time of 4 3 h which testifies that the study area is distinguished by a swift hydrological response maldonado et al 2022 as it is mentioned in section 2 1 only one rain event has been recorded in quartile iii and two events in quartile iv however they exhibit the highest average peak discharges due to their long duration and total amount of rainfall the cumulative hyetographs were calculated and then non dimensionalised by dividing the values on the axis by the duration of the storm and the values of the ordinates by the total rainfall depth an example of each first second third and fourth quartile average dimensionless cumulative hyetographs is shown in fig 4 their analysis reveals that first second and fourth quartiles are close to each other especially the second and the fourth ones which behave almost like a diagonal however it seems that the third quartile dimensionless cumulative hyetograph has greater difference than the others it is represented by only one exceptional rainfall event ev8 that in reality behaves like events type ii since approximately 97 5 of the total rainfall occur in the first 12 h of the event only 2 4 mm negligible rainfall fall in the last 4 h in addition it behaves as a diagonal in the first 60 of the event duration even like the fourth rain quartile it can be concluded consequently that the upper andarax represented by ohanes rainfall station is generally characterised by a symmetric temporal rainfall distribution hyetograph in this case the effect of duration on the shape of the cumulative dimensionless hyetographs is negligible which is consistent with yin et al s results for the central and eastern parts of china yin et al 2016 the corresponding dimensionless hydrographs are shown in fig 5 there is a strong similarity in the temporal distributions of flow discharges being in general symmetric as a result of a symmetric hyetographs however there is a small difference in the hydrographs shape due to temporal rainfall distribution that affect hydrograph peak values and rainfall duration this leads to a different time to peak values and other hydrograph characteristics such as a duration of rising and falling parts of the hydrograph besides rainfall events type ii relatively correspond to a platykurtic curve since they exhibit the lowest average peak discharge compared to other event types a weibull function has been adjusted to the dimensionless cumulative rainfall curves to calculate the non exceedance probability 2 5 10 30 50 70 90 95 and 98 that is how the curves that relate cumulative rainfall in and rainfall duration in with the probability fig 6 are obtained each curve represents a dimensionless hyetograph associated with a probability and therefore with a return period which can be considered equal to the inverse of the exceedance probability in the present study as the huff curves are developed by using data from individual station they are called as point developed huff curves the idea or the possibility of generating a general point developed huff curves including all quartiles due to the small number of events can be supported by the obtained results regarding the symmetric temporal distributions of rainfall and flow discharges based on the design requirements which impose a certain return period it will be possible to choose the design curve corresponding to the probability of the hyetograph and to simulate its corresponding hydrological response in general it corresponds to 50 in this study the 50 probability which is equivalent to a two year return period correspond to an almost symmetrical temporal rainfall distribution within these circumstances the first 50 of the rainfall depth occur in the first 50 of the rainfall duration and the second 50 in the second 50 of rainfall duration 3 2 statistical dependency rt corresponding to each event or sub event is mentioned in table 2 it ranges from 1 to 15 h with an average of 5 7 h it should be noted that the prediction of the response time is not the subject of this study however further studies can rely on the same methodology to develop in parallel a bcm for rt prediction alternatively it can be taken as the total average or the average for each type of rainfall event table 3 or even through cluster or principal component analyses based on the different extreme events characteristics the results of the chi square statistical test of independence show a calculated p value 0 0001 well below the significance level of 0 05 this reveals the existence of a statistically significant association and dependence di leo and sardanelli 2020 between rainfall intensity and flow discharge and between previous soil moisture represented by antecedent cumulative rainfall and flow discharge the calculated association coefficients are summarised in table 4 according to the association coefficients limits the results clearly mark the association between the variables in question however some differences in the interpretation of these coefficients are found in the literature for instance regarding the cramer s v the rainfall flow and previous soil moisture flow associations can be interpreted as strong and moderate respectively according to lee 2016 whereas according to akoglu 2018 both are interpreted as very strong associations anyway the flow is clearly more dependent on the rainfall intensity than on the previous soil moisture the higher the coefficients values the more the variables are interdependent 3 3 bayesian causal modelling based on the previous rigorous characterisation it was decided to build four sub models corresponding to each type of rainfall events and a general model including all events 3 3 1 learning training and simulation learning was done automatically using netica 6 09 application software norsys 2005 rainfall and flow discharge data were divided into a certain number of intervals since netica does not support the introduction of continuous variables the number of intervals was first maximised fig 7 to test the predictive capacity of the models then it was adjusted due to the scarce and limited dataset and consequently the inability of the models to simulate all possible scenarios the results of the simulated more complex general model fig 7 show that the average probable flow discharge value is 2 3 m3 s the simulation results of the four sub models based on the training data are shown in fig 8 3 3 2 evaluation 3 3 2 1 evidence sensitivity analysis an evidence sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the sub models and the general model using variance reduction vr and mutual information mi this was done to estimate the impact of a change in the state of the causal or parent node rainfall and pr24 rainfall intensity and antecedent soil conditions at ohanes rainfall station on the state of the query node flow discharge flow discharge at the andarax hydrometric station table 5 summarises the evidence sensitivity analysis results of flow discharge node using variance reduction and mutual information as shown in the results and not surprisingly variance reduction and mutual information are equal to 100 for the flow discharge which is the target variable among the parent nodes in general modelling flow discharge is most sensitive to rainfall and less sensitive to pr24 in terms of vr the influence of rainfall intensity on vr decreases with the increase of rainfall duration sub model i to sub model iv while the impact of pr24 increases this is justified by the fact that flow discharge values are largely caused by rainfall intensity for short duration rainfall events while for longer duration rainfall events they are caused by cumulative rainfall and soil saturation as shown in the characterisation phase table 3 where events type i present the highest average maximal intensity while the longer events type iii and iv present the highest cumulative rainfall however precedent conditions have a significant impact on reducing uncertainty mi sometimes even greater than that of rainfall intensity sub model i ii and iv this happens because the flows in the recession curve and the base flows that follow it even if the rainfall event has ended can coincide with high values of cumulative rainfall admittedly this increasing cumulative rainfall does not influence the decrease in flow values but it does increase the belief that large cumulative rainfall values generally coincide with low recession curve flows or its following base flows for that it is recommended for further studies when sufficient records and data are available to predict separately the rising and the falling curves of the hydrograph molina et al 2022 3 3 2 2 data based evaluation about 390 h were used to train the general model while 110 hours data were used for its validation validation results showed that 25 cases were erroneously classified which represent an error rate of 22 7 if a reduced number of long intervals is chosen the error rate must be markedly low or even zero despite this the accuracy rate is highly satisfactory the logarithmic loss quadratic loss and spherical payoff statistics also show a fairly good fit on the one hand the logarithmic loss and the quadratic loss exhibit relatively low values 0 84 and 0 30 respectively while the spherical payoff has a value 0 8 close to one according to previous studies that used the same scoring rules through netica software to evaluate bayesian predictive models the obtained values indicate a remarkable model performance han et al 2019 and fully prove its excellent predictability dlamini 2010 rong et al 2020 3 3 2 3 scenario analysis this is the second type of sensitivity analysis where researchers previously used to employ only one or the other of these methods in any one study pollino et al 2007 it was seen by data exploration that rainfall goes with runoff for all the three first sub models i ii and iii additionally evidence sensitivity analysis showed that the impact of cumulative rainfall indicating initial and previous soil state on the vr of the flow discharge is very low compared to that of the rainfall intensity for that pr24 has been excluded and the number of intervals has been reduced and adjusted to the available dataset on the other hand for type iv events the impact of pr 24 on the vr of the flow discharge compared to that of rainfall is almost half also it has been verified through the dataset that when low rainfall intensities coincide with relatively high flows this can only be explained by the influence of the antecedent soil conditions in this case the pr24 was maintained and the number of intervals was adjusted fig 8 the number of intervals despite reduced it is useful and sufficient to prevent the flooding risk knowing the downstream bankfull flow netica provides an easy way to test a scenario allowing the user to input evidence into a node by setting a specific distribution to a node the effect of the scenario can then be examined by its influence on other nodes by probability propagation figs 8a and 8b show the simulation results of the four sub models in average and maximum peak scenarios respectively all sub models present a logical and reasonable behaviour with respect to a maximum peak scenario this has also been verified and noticed for all other model states and scenarios both simulated scenarios demonstrate that quartiles iii and iv rainfall events even less frequent exhibit the highest average and maximum peak discharges in presence of extreme rainfall conditions that can exceed greatly the minimum bankfull flow of the upper andarax river hence causing floods and possible associated economic damages quartiles i and ii flash floods events are more frequent but less dangerous at least at local scale but that may contribute with other tributaries to the downstream overflowing of the andarax river and the flooding of the city of almeria since all the identified extreme events have been associated with real floods recorded in the city of almeria and studied in depth by garcía 2019 with respect to previous studies the majority that used bayesian predictive models for flood forecasting was dedicated to only predict the flood peak discharges in regions with abundant data for the full flooding hydrographs prediction despite the hydropredict extreme one study made by boutkhamouine et al 2020 was found it consists on runoff runoff modelling to estimate the discharge at the outlet of the salat river basin france based on the discharge from the upstream gauging stations and in which the authors had to deal with the time of flow transfer instead of the response time without any previous hydrological characterisation without considering the base flow and without events distinction the model showed good performances estimating the river flow as mentioned by the authors this method constitutes an essential and less explored domain and this is the starting point of a brand new research line on the hydrological extremes prediction 4 conclusions with the objective of predicting extreme high flow events in the upper andarax watershed in se spain estimating their associated uncertainty and assessing the impact of their causal factors an event based bayesian causal modelling bcm approach was adopted based on three main phases including 1 data preparation 2 extremes characterisation and analysis 3 predictive bayesian causal modelling and accounting for 1 extreme events characterisation and sub modelling 2 base flow consideration and 3 previous soil moisture influence as a result twelve rainfall runoff events were selected their characterisation revealed the complex and dynamic non linear rainfall flow relationship in the semi arid upper andarax watershed where high flow hydrological events tend to occur when rainfall is most extreme but also when the soil is previously saturated this may be due to the spatio temporal variability of precipitation within the watershed or even to the associated meteorological conditions that it is recommended to identify characterise and model them in a probabilistic way it was also found that the selected events and divided into four quartiles are generally characterised by a symmetric rainfall distribution conducing to a symmetric basin response the statistical dependency between variables showed that the basin response is more dependent on the rainfall intensity than on the soil moisture represented by the antecedent cumulative rainfall and that the latter has a significant effect on the quartile iv extreme events and may be very useful to reduce the uncertainty on the predicted value of the flow the bcm predictive models have shown a great ability to understand and to model this complex relationship even with limited and scarce dataset and model complexity regarding the high number of states and shorter intervals furthermore the predictive models present a reasonable and logical behaviour with respect to peak values but also for all model states and scenarios finally the simulated sub models demonstrated that the most hazardous events are those of quartiles iii and iv whereas all events types may contribute to river overflowing and flooding beyond the watershed geographical limits this study could be a decision making tool for flood risk management in the andarax river basin further researches could be conducted to investigate the possibility of using satellite based soil moisture data instead of precipitation for the analysis of soil moisture status which may improve the results to investigate the possibility to extrapolate the results on ungauged river basins in se spain constrained by similar physiographic characteristics and climatic conditions to estimate the futuristic flood magnitude based on the projection of future pluvial flooding events under climate data

7837,study region asia study focus hydropower capacity is expected to increase in asia due to plentiful potential and many investors although climate change studies of hydropower have been implemented most studies have focused on the quantity of change rather than change points a change point is the time when the plant capacity designed in the past is no longer valid due to climate change and the efficiency or amount of hydropower can be significantly reduced previous studies were constrained to certain stations due to a lack of data in this study a method for exploring the change points based on the technical hydropower potential thp is proposed with simple data and the future change points of hydropower in asia are identified new hydrological insight for the region in this study an approach for detecting the change points of hydropower due to climate change is proposed and the change points in the asia are identified one novelty is the proposed approach is only required discharge and elevation to detect the points another novelty is the analysis of thp changes based on different hydropower capacities considering climate change they have never been discussed and can be utilized for resource expansion and the management of installed plants furthermore the change points are new findings since it has never been reported for most asia due to limited data availability graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change technical hydropower potential change points asia region data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction at the 2015 united nations climate change conference the paris agreement was adopted it includes a series of mandatory measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aims to increase climate finance for developing nations to 100 billion united nations 2015 this approach is shifting the global paradigm of energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy more than 170 countries have renewable energy targets and approximately 150 countries support renewable energy policies irena 2021 renewable energy accounted for 10 8 of the world s energy production as of 2018 with the renewable energy capacity rising 21 5 over the past five years 2014 2018 reflecting rapid growth ren21 2020 in 2019 the increase in renewable energy generation exceeded the increase in energy demand for the first time irena 2020 hydropower has become a preferred renewable energy source due to its mature technology high efficiency low production and operating costs and long design life killingtveit 2019 hydropower sources accounted for 47 5 of the world s renewable energy capacity in 2019 and the main investors of hydropower for increasing capacity are located in asia such as china lao pdr bhutan and tajikistan arrigada et al 2019 ren21 2020 therefore the hydropower capacity of asia is expected to considerably increase due to the plentiful hydropower potential hp and the abundance of investors van vliet et al 2016b climate change impacts hydropower due to changes and variability in precipitation temperature runoff etc corresponding research has been conducted on hydropower potential and generation at large scales such as the continental and global scales yalew et al 2020 generation is based on the actual amount of production at installed plants but potential is the projected generation when plants are constructed assessments of the impacts of climate change on hydropower potential or generation have led to an improved understanding of the interdependencies between water and energy systems and informed resource expansion investment planning and energy policy turner and voision 2022 most hydropower facilities are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they were designed based on stationarity and consistency assumptions to establish a plan to mitigate and adapt these impacts both quantifying the impacts and detecting the times of dramatic changes are important for a hydropower plant a change point is the time when the capacity established based on historical hydrological conditions is no longer valid in other words the efficiency of or amount of hydropower produced by the designed plant based on historical conditions is significantly reduced at this time additionally the generation at the plant will dramatically change potentially leading to economic disadvantages or the loss of opportunity for additional hydropower generation due to the fixed capacity therefore change points should be determined to implement the appropriate maintenance of installed plants and adapt to climate change however most previous studies conducted globally or in regions of asia have focused on the quantity of hydropower changes these studies tried to quantify changes in gross hydropower potential ghp with runoff or discharge simulations based on hydrological models hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 van vliet et al 2016a hose et al 2017 paltan et al 2021 changes in hydropower generation potentials were calculated considering the relationship between ghp and observed hydropower generation data hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 in addition zhou et al 2015 and gernaat et al 2017 tried to estimate quantitative changes in realistic hydropower potential as the technical hydropower potential thp and economic hydropower potential ehp considering technical and economic components river regulation by dams has been considered in the process of estimating changes in hydropower potential van vliet et al 2016a chowdhury et al 2021 siala et al 2021 wan et al 2021 although these studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on hydropower most studies have focused on the quantities of changes rather than the corresponding change points only a few studies have attempted to identify the change points for hydropower in historical or future periods due to climate change these studies were limited to historical periods or small spatial area due to the availability of observation data sets such as generation data operation rules and benefits for estimating hydropower generation at existing plants the studies analyzed historical change points with observation data or future change points based on calibrated plant operation approach with observation data sets both are required long term observation data sets neagoe et al 2020 and bardosa et al 2021 tried to identify change points based on observed hydropower generation data at limited numbers of stations in romania and brazil in a historical period skoulikaris and ganoulis 2017 and zhang et al 2021 searched for change points associated with hydropower generation revenue in future periods at a few dams in greece and china gu et al 2022 prioritized the necessity of adaptation for hydropower stations considering the revenue of hydropower generation in china these studies were limited to historical periods or stations with sufficient information to expand on the above studies the hydropower potential rather than the simulated generation at installed plants can be utilized to explore the change points of hydropower and the potential can be simply calculated with limited data previous studies have argued that the hydropower potential can closely represent fluctuation of generation over coarse time scales and the hydropower potential was utilized to regress total hydropower generation in certain countries hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 turner and voision 2022 additionally annual discharge which is used to calculate ghp was found to be highly correlated with observed hydropower generation at a plant on a yearly scale kao et al 2015 therefore the change points in hydropower potential which require little information to identify can be utilized in regions where data are scarce to determine the change points of hydropower generation in particular when using thp which considers the technical components of hydropower generation such as the practical capacity the efficiency of generation and turbines it is possible to explore the change points of hydropower potential considering the stationarity and consistency assumptions of hydropower facilities in this study a method for exploring the change points of hydropower based on thp is proposed and the change points of hydropower in regions of asia are identified the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents an overview of the study area the collected data and the research methodologies in section 3 the results are described and the thp changes change points and uncertainties are discussed section 4 provides a research summary and the main conclusions of this work 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was selected as the asia region which spatially covers latitudes s 9 75 n 54 75 degrees and longitudes e 30 75 e 149 75 degrees fig 1 compared with other continents the asian continent has a large hp because it receives abundant rainfall and includes highland areas such as the himalayas the yalthai mountains and the ring of fire van vliet et al 2016b in addition china lao pdr bhutan and tajikistan have made large investments in hydropower energy ren21 2020 following large investments in hydropower plants many power plants were built in china but relatively few hydropower projects were implemented in other countries therefore the development potential is high in tajikistan bhutan and lao pdr in this study the asian region are classified into 11 386 basins to calculate the hp based on hydrosheds which is a watershed polygon map verdin and greenlee 1996 lehner and grill 2013 approximately 99 of all the basins are 10 000 square kilometers or less and basins of this size are suitable for hydropower development in asia large scale international rivers such as the brahmaputra mekong ganges indus and irrawaddy exist and there are many other small scale transboundary rivers in addition the asian continent is classified into 5 regions to effectively analyze regional results these regions include central asia ca north asia na south asia sa east asia ea and southeast asia sea 2 2 methodology fig 2 shows the framework of this study the framework consists of data collection hydropower analysis and change point detection first geospatial data gridded observed climate data and gridded climate change scenarios were obtained then the hydropower analysis involved calculating the differential head estimated between the average level and outlet level in each basin performing hydrological modeling and flow duration analyses and estimating thps after simulating the grid runoff values with a global hydrological model ghm for the historical and future periods the grided runoffs were interpolated to the basin scale with the areal weight method the interpolated runoff was accumulated considering the upstream boundary to estimate streamflow in each basin based on the streamflow results a flow duration analysis was performed for the historical and future periods thps were calculated from the differential head and flow duration analysis results in the historical and future periods finally the change points of hydropower were detected by quantifying the changes in thps and the corresponding uncertainty of future thps also quantified from gcms 2 3 climate forcing data sets for weather data the precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and average wind speed in the historical and future periods were collected in grid form 0 5 degrees as the input data for the ghm observed weather data from 1976 to 2005 provided by bae et al 2013 were used bae et al 2013 adopted daily precipitation and temperature data from the asian prescription highly resolved data integration toward evaluation aphrodite and daily wind speed data from the national centers for environmental prediction and national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis set for ghm simulations kalnay et al 1996 yatagai et al 2012 bae et al 2013 aphrodite has a 0 5 degree resolution but ncep ncar reanalysis has a 2 5 degree resolution bae et al 2013 bilinearly interpolated the reanalysis data to unify the resolution to 0 5 degrees aphrodite data are based on observations but ncep ncar reanalysis data are from model simulations although the reanalysis data are not observations we treat these data as observations for classification for climate change scenarios data from five suitable gcms were used in historical and future periods as shown in table 1 five gcms were selected and all the original gcm data sets were downscaled to 0 5 degrees from 1976 to 2100 based on the detrended quantile mapping dqm method by kim and bae 2020 in this study the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were considered 2 4 geospatial data sets digital elevation models dems for differential head calculations and basin maps for spatial classification were obtained additionally the u s geological survey usgs hydro1k dem food and agriculture organization fao soil data and university of maryland umd vegetation data were adopted as ghm inputs and they were utilized for the establishment of the hydrological model as described by bae et al 2013 the usgs hydro1k dem was also used for differential head estimation and the hydrosheds data set which includes a watershed polygon map for the world was directly adopted for basin boundary classification 2 5 hydrological modeling a variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 was used to estimate runoff vic has been widely used in continental and global hydrological analyses nijssen et al 2001a 2001b specifically the vic model which was not established in this study but was established by bae et al 2013 was applied to simulate future flow based on climate change scenarios bae et al 2013 suggested parameters for the vic model with a spatial resolution of 0 5 degrees in the study region the parameter sets were calibrated and validated for some gauged basins in this study area and the parameters were regionalized in ungauged basins based on the corresponding climate classification of gauged basins these parameters have been used in hydrological application research such as in climate change impact assessments of water resources and drought analyses bae et al 2017 lee et al 2019 kim et al 2020a 2020b in this study the vic model was used to simulate the amount of runoff in the historical 1976 2005 reference 1976 2005 and future 2011 2100 periods the historical runoff data were simulated based on observation data from bae et al 2013 and reference and future runoff data were simulated based on gcm data from kim and bae 2020 the runoff from the vic model is gridded data and it was converted to basin data through areal weighted interpolation the basin scale runoff was converted to streamflow based on cumulative runoff calculations considering the upstream boundary of each basin without a physical routing process bae et al 2013 who established the original vic model utilized the same approach to convert runoff to streamflow and the calibration and verification results for converted streamflow displayed acceptable accuracy at a monthly time step because changes in thps are assessed at a longer time step year in this study than the monthly step adopted by bae et al 2013 we can expect the travel time of streamflow to have less of an effect on thp than did that in their analysis and the effect ignorable that is the reason why the physical routing scheme was not considered in this study to investigate the corresponding trends periods were divided into the historical s0 1976 2005 near future s1 2011 2040 moderate future s2 2041 2070 and distant future s3 2071 2100 periods to calculate the results for s0 historical data were used and to calculate the future changes in s1 s2 and s3 reference and future data were used additionally reference data were used to calculate the ratio of change in future periods 2 6 technical hydropower potential in the design of hydropower plants not only the potential of streamflow but also technical economic and environmental considerations are needed depending on the specific case the type of hydropower potential which is the expected hydropower generation for a designed plant can be transformed into ghp thp economic hydropower potential ehp and exploitable hydropower potential ghp is the theoretical gross amount of potential energy available when all streamflow flows to sea level without any other consideration therefore in the ghp concept any loss associated with technical components economic feasibility or environmental restriction is not considered based on the current technology all amounts of ghp cannot be captured due to loss from generation the practical capacity of plants maintenance etc thus thp is the available hydropower potential based on the current technology zhou et al 2015 thp considers the loss associated with technical components but economic and environmental factors are not considered in previous studies the generator efficiency and practical capacity of plants were used to classify ghp and thp zhou et al 2015 the generation efficiency is the efficiency related to turbines and generators and in this study it was considered a fixed constant the practical capacity is the magnitude of plants and is considered a fixed maximum generation flow in other words when the streamflow exceeds the maximum flow the maximum flow value is used in the previous approach the maximum flow threshold was set based on an investigation of the benefits and cost of installed plants u s bureau of reclamation 2011 this threshold can lead to similar thp and ehp values given the relevant economic considerations notably zhou et al 2015 calculated similar thp and ehp levels and the difference in potentials was approximately 20 we attempted to mitigate this similarity issue by extracting thp from ghp using a ghp equation practical capacity and efficiency rather than information from installed plants thp can be extracted from ghp considering efficiencies and practical capacity the practical capacity can be decided based on the maximum generation flow q dmax minimum generation flow q dmin and the available generation flow corresponding to the capacity can be calculated with daily flow duration analyses as expressed in eqs 2 and 3 as expressed in eq 1 the annual average streamflow is used to calculate annual ghp and all potential energy in the streamflow is converted to hydropower hose et al 2017 in this study it is assumed that the maximum generation flow is the annual average flow used in ghp calculations to derive the thp the minimum generation flow is set as the drought flow and reflects the concept that hydropower plants are difficult to operate during drought periods ri 185 y and ri 355 y were utilized as q d max y and q d min y respectively since they represent average and drought flows moon and kang 2016 finally the thp can be calculated with available generation flow and net differential height as shown eqs 4 and 5 1 ghp y ρ g q ave h ave 2 ri o y i y 29 y q o i 30 3 if ri o y q d max then qr o y q d max else if ri o y q dmin then qr o y 0 else if qr o y ri o y 4 h net c h ave h out 5 thp y η ρ g h net o 1 365 qr o y 365 where ghp y is the ghp kw in year y ρ is the density of water 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 q ave is the annual average streamflow m 3 s h ave is the average elevation of the basin m rio y m3 s is the annual average of qo i m3 s for 30 years ending in year y qo i m3 s denotes the oth daily streamflow value in descending order over a year qro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the practical capacity c is the coefficient of head loss 0 92 h net is the net differential height m h out is the elevation at the basin outlet m thp y kw is the thp in year y estimated based on the relevant capacities and η is the efficiency of generation 0 85 the coefficient of head loss and efficiency of generation were established based on the suggestions of the ccaw 2019 in feasibility analyses of large hydropower plants in the literature these coefficients and efficiencies are commonly adopted for plants in south korea 2 7 identification of change points the change point of interest in this study is the time when the historical design capacity of a hydropower plant is no longer valid due to climate change when the hydrological conditions change the plant can experience one of two outcomes the first outcome is decreased hydropower generation due to reduced streamflow and the second is increased hydropower generation however the ratio of utilized flow to total flow is reduced in this case in the first case the concern is related to energy deficiency and the second case inefficiency can be high to the low utilization ratio of total flow both cases require management to mitigate energy losses and maximize generations because the climate is gradually changing it is difficult to determine the time at which effects will be significant initially the generation of plants will gradually change and when climate change accelerates at a certain point generation will abruptly change the time at which the generation will abruptly change is the change point of hydropower generation in previous studies the change points were directly detected by analyzing observed generation time series from installed hydropower plants in a historical period or calibrated plant operation rules based on the time series data of installed plants in a future period since both methods require long term generation data and economic considerations some of them were only applied in historical periods with observations neagoe et al 2020 bardosa et al 2021 and others were applied at stations with long term observed data that were used to simulate generation in the future skoulikaris and ganoulis 2017 zhang et al 2021 gu et al 2022 this approach can be used to easily identify change points and the results are intuitive however long term input data are required to obtain the results which is an obstacle to applying the approach in data limited regions in this study a conceptual approach is proposed to detect change points based on thp and it requires only discharge and elevation data sets several studies have suggested that the discharge or hydropower potential are related to the observed generation at plants hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 kao et al 2015 turner and voision 2022 therefore this approach could be practically effective for detecting the change points of hydropower generation in order to quantify how the historical design valid the difference between the potential generations at plants designed based on historical and future hydrological conditions was adopted as shown in eq 6 6 thp diff y thp fcon y thp hcon y where thp hcon y and thp fcon y represent the technical potential generation kw in the yth year for a designed plant based on historical and future conditions respectively thp diff y is the difference between potentials kw hcon is the fixed historical condition 1976 2005 and fcon is the future condition in the yth year thp hcon represents the future potential generation of installed plants based on historical data and thp fcon represents the future potential generation of newly constructed plants in the future therefore the difference can represent the amount of obtainable energy when the capacity is updated corresponding to future hydrological condition the capacity designed in the past will not be suitable for future hydrological condition which will result in a gradual increase in the difference between thp fcon and thp hcon in the future as shown fig 3 unlike thp hcon which cannot change beyond a certain level due to its capacity designed in the past thp fcon will change continuously and this difference may increase dramatically at certain point in the future this study detects the time at which the difference abruptly increases as a change point and from this point on the design conditions in the past are no longer valid the difference is the target variable participating in the change point search the flow duration curve used to calculate the differences in generation is shown in fig 4 as mentioned in section 2 6 the changeable design condition based on the flow condition is the practical capacity therefore different capacities were applied to calculate thp hcon and thp fcon from the flow duration analysis results as shown in fig 4 and eqs 7 and 8 the capacity of thp hcon is fixed from 1976 to 2005 and the capacity of thp fcon is varied each year for instance if y is equal to 2100 q dmax and q dmin for thp fcon are determined based on flow data from 2071 to 2100 thp hcon and thp fcon can be calculated with eqs 9 and 10 if ri o y q d max 2005 then hqr o y q d max 2005 else if ri o y q dmin 2005 then hqr o y 0 7 else if hqr o y ri o y if ri o y q d max y then fqr o y q d max y else if ri o y q dmin y then fqr o y 0 8 else if fqr o y ri o y 9 thp hcon y η ρ g h net o 1 365 hqr o y 365 10 thp fcon y η ρ g h net o 1 365 fqr o y 365 where hqro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the historical capacity and fqro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the future capacity pettitt s test was adopted to detect change points based on the differences in thps pettitt 1979 the test is a kind of nonparametric test that is commonly utilized to find abrupt changes in time series xie et al 2019 in particular in the hydrological field it has been used to analyze the change points in hydroclimate time series in the context of climate change neagoe et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this study the difference of thps was utilized as hydroclimate timeseries according to a comparison study of methods for detecting change points by xie et al 2019 pettitt s test displayed excellent performance in detecting change points and yielded stable results under various conditions the detailed equations used to calculate the pettitt statistics and confidence levels are shown in eqs 11 13 11 k t max u t t 12 u t t i 1 t j i 1 t sgn x i x j 13 p 2 exp 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 where k t is pettitt s statistic x denotes the sample data in this study thp diff y t and t are the lengths of each time series p is the confidence level of pettitt s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in thps based on different hydrological design conditions in this study to detect the change points of hydropower two kinds of thps thp hcon and thp fcon were calculated in this section the changes in thps in a future period are discussed since these thps provide meaningful information as mentioned since these thps are associated with different capacities from historical and future conditions thp hcon represents the change in the potential generation of installed plants and thp fcon represents the change in the potential generation of newly developed plants fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of thp in the s0 period and both thp fcon and thp hcon are the same in the historical period the thp is concentrated in highland regions including the karakoram mountains and himalayan mountains in the northern sas the tibetan plateau region the yunnan guizhou plateau region in southern china and northern sea and the ring of fire region in indonesia and papua new guinea the basins that are blank were excluded from the thp calculations because of zero maximum generation flow values generally in arid areas and negative elevations in reference to sea level as observed for some islands the thp for the s0 period in asia is 3 21 tw table 2 gives a comparison of the results of this study and other studies studies that were conducted in recent periods and used land masks similar to those applied in this study were selected for comparison the results of this study cover most asian basins with papua new guinea located in oceania other studies excluded papua new guinea from asia zhou et al 2015 calculated ghp thp and ehp and it is the only study that is directly comparable with this study of thp due to the use of similar land masks van vliet et al 2016b calculated ghp with three ghms and the average value is presented in table 2 hose et al 2017 calculated ghp based on the average monthly discharge by combining observed discharge data at stations and values simulated with hydrological models since station data were used a common data period cannot be obtained for comparison based on the methodology used thp should be smaller than ghp thp in this study was found to be in the ghp range of 2 9 5 61 tw reported in other studies the thp result is considered reasonable because it is mostly lower than the ghp results in other studies compared to the thp reported by zhou et al 2015 the thp in this study was approximately 270 higher this difference is due to differences in methodology zhou et al 2015 set q dmax based on monthly streamflow and a 30 exceedance probability and annual average streamflow was used to establish q dmax in this study therefore q dmax in this study is much larger than the value in the literature at most times except during some wet periods as suggested in the methodology zhou et al 2015 set the exceedance probability based on generation data from power plants however the generation capacity of a plant is designed based on both technical and economic considerations therefore the thp methodology of zhou et al 2015 considers some characteristics of ehp in fact the results of zhou et al 2015 indicate that the difference between thp and ehp is not large in this study the annual average streamflow which was used to calculate ghp was applied as q dmax to extract only the technical potential from ghp the flows in the drought period were excluded when estimating generation flows with q dmin therefore the results of this study are conceptually closer to actual thp values than are those of previous studies however the methodology used in this study has some limitations some technical components were ignored such as the plant scale dynamic head river routing and reservoir operation the head is overestimated since it is the difference between the average and minimum head in a basin in reality head is determined based on the plant scale and water level of rivers which dynamically change in this study streamflow was calculated as the accumulation of runoff and the proposed method does not consider river length or flow velocity when converting runoff to streamflow some stations have reservoirs that are used to manage the flow for generation and these reservoirs are operated not only for generation but also for water supply and flood control therefore the real available flow may be less than the flow calculated in this study these limitations can result in the overestimation of thp additionally as described by van vliet et al 2016b the results of global and continental scale hp studies exhibited significant differences these differences were caused by variations in input data and ghms notably climate and topography vary at different scales and ghms which are calibrated in a few basins worldwide produce different results in different cases these limitations must be addressed in the future fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the change in thps in the near future period 2011 2040 to that in the far future period 2071 2100 the thps used to calculate this ratio were the averaged values of the results based on five gcms the thp in the asia region increases in the future compared to that in the historical period the change in thp hcon was smaller than that in thp fcon because thp hcon was calculated considering the historical capacity the sensitivity of thp to climate change was relatively small this result indicates that generation by hydropower plants constructed in the past is less affected by climate change than is generation at newly constructed plants additionally the range of change in thps based on rcp 8 5 was larger than that in the case of rcp 4 5 in the near future thp fcon increased in most cas and nas regions and thp fcon decreased in the southern cas southern china northern sas and northern sea regions in the far future most regions except southern china sas and northern sea displayed a large increase in thp fcon the thp hcon results exhibited a similar spatial distribution as the change in thp fcon but the range of change was smaller overall it was found that climate change has a notable effect on the asian region by increasing the thps therefore it is expected that hydropower will be expanded in feasible basins due to the increasing trend of thp fcon moreover the generation of installed plants will increase due to the increasing trend of thp hcon however the benefits that climate change will have on hydropower cannot be fully utilized at installed plants because there are differences between the thp fcon and thp hcon trends in fig 5 thps decrease in the karakoram mountains and himalaya mountains in northern sas and sea and southern china where thp levels are high therefore there is concern about the reduction in hydropower resources in those regions in addition an analysis of countries with active investments in hydropower indicated that lao pdr and china except the southern part have positive conditions for developing hydropower in historical and future periods but in southern china bhutan may experience a decrease in thp in the future 3 2 change points based on differences in thps in this section the change points of hydropower were detected based on the difference thp diff between thp fcon and thp hcon fig 7 shows the results of thp changes and change points in asia in the rcp scenarios the blue range and line are the changes in thp fcon based on different gcms and the averaged value respectively the red range and line are the changes in thp hcon based on different gcms and the averaged value respectively the green line is pettit s statistic and the orange line represents thp diff when the orange line changes rapidly and the green line reaches its maximum value at a certain point it indicates that the capacity of hydropower plants in the historical period is no longer valid due to climate change and the point is selected as a change point fig 7 a shows the results for rcp 4 5 thp fcon exhibits greater uncertainty in the future than does thp hcon and beginning in the 2050s thp fcon increases noticeably compared to thp hcon thp diff fluctuates close to 0 until 2050 but a clearly positive change is observed beginning in the 2050 s according to pettit s static 2055 was selected as the change point where thp diff changed significantly and the p value was 4 42 10 15 following significance tests it was found that a significant change occurred in 2027 with a p value of less than 0 001 fig 7 b shows the results for rcp 8 5 the uncertainty in thp fcon is larger than that in thp hcon and the rcp8 5 result exhibits a larger range than the rcp4 5 result the difference in thps displays a noticeable change beginning in the 2050s and the increase in thp diff is larger than that for rcp 4 5 based on pettit s test 2056 was the most significant change point with a p value for 4 42 10 15 and in 2038 a significant change occurred with a p value of less than 0 001 a significant change in thp in asia is expected to occur with very high confidence due to climate change therefore it is necessary to establish adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change within the next 10 years the differences in thps will significantly change which will lead to a change in hydropower generation for plants installed in the historical period s0 or before in terms of climate change adaptation measures to adapt to climate change in the hydropower field should be established and implemented before the late 2020s before the 2050s active adaptation measures that can be used to adapt to rapid changes should be implemented for this purpose it is necessary to establish and sufficiently discuss adaptation measures that can be used in advance in various stages fig 8 shows the change points and confidence levels according to the difference in thps for each rcp scenario in fig 8 a and b the closer to blue a basin is the closer the change point is to being reached in the early future and vice versa for basins in red in most regions a change point occurred in the 2050s and a rapid change point corresponding to the 2030s was found in most of the cas northern sas northern sea and southern china regions the change points did not rapidly occur in areas with large changes in thps rather in many cases the change points occurred rapidly in areas with small changes in thps in cas and papua new guinea rapid change points were associated with large increases in thps in the northern sas southern china and northern sea regions thp exhibited a slight decrease and generally stable trend when a change point occurred therefore because rapid changes do not necessarily occur in regions with large quantitative changes only limited information on adaptation can be provided based on quantitative changes alone therefore change point analysis is essential for assessing hp change in the context of climate change fig 8 c and d show the confidence levels according to the rcp results the closer to blue a basin is the higher the corresponding confidence level is and vice versa for basins in red very high confidence can be observed in most regions which suggests that an abrupt change point will occur with a very high probability in most regions of asia 3 3 uncertainties of thp change estimates for different gcms in climate change studies uncertainty assessment is important because it represents the robustness or possible error of results in this study we attempted to quantify the uncertainty of gcms which is the main driver of uncertainty in climate change studies table 3 shows the future change in thps and the deviations associated with gcms notably the deviations represent the uncertainty among gcms in the far future for rcp4 5 thp fcon increased by 6 07 on average and for rcp 8 5 the average increase was 8 98 however thp hcon was found to increase by 0 53 and 2 00 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the deviation among gcms indicates uncertainty and the deviations in thp hcon for which the generation capacity is limited by past flow conditions are smaller than those in thp fcon considering the deviation among gcms thp fcon is expected to increase by 2 30 9 84 and 3 18 14 78 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively and thp hcon is expected to change by 1 15 2 21 and 0 72 4 72 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the uncertainty of thp changes is increases over time as suggested in section 3 2 a change points was found to occur in the 2050s namely in 2055 and 2056 in the two scenarios and the deviation among gcms was 7 4 years and 3 6 years for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively therefore a major change point is expected to occur between 2048 and 2062 for rcp4 5 and 2052 2060for rcp8 5 although differences depending on the gcm applied can be seen in table 3 the trends of future changes predicted with different gcms look consistent as shown in fig 7 the ensemble average of the gcm results indicated an increasing thp trend which is close to the upper boundary of uncertainty in fig 7 this is because the results of only one gcm deviated from the result of other models which led to a relatively high uncertainty boundary since four of the five gcms displayed consistent results the results of this study can be considered consistent in other words the uncertainty associated with gcms does not have a critical influence on changes in the overall trends of the results in this study 4 summary and conclusions in this study a method for exploring the change points of hydropower based on thp is proposed and the change points in asia are determined one novelty is the proposal of a new approach for identifying the change points of hydropower with limited data another novelty is that the thps which can represent potential generation from existing and newly developed plants were analyzed additionally for the first time the change points of hydropower are reported with a novel approach based on thp in most of asia a summary of this study is given below a change point is defined as the time when the historical design capacity of a hydropower plant is no longer valid due to climate change to detect change points two thps were utilized depending on the design capacity thp hcon and thp fcon are the future potential generation values of designed plants based on historical and future hydrological conditions respectively conceptually thp hcon and thp fcon can represent future potential generation for existing plants designed in the past and newly developed plants in the future respectively a change point is identified when the difference in thps abruptly increases since this increase suggests that the historical design capacity does not match the future flow condition the proposed method is used to conveniently analyze change points with only discharge and elevation data the thp in the historical period in asia was 3 21 tw and it was reasonably calculated compared to the values obtained with different methods used in previous studies because only technical components excluding economic components were considered the potential was higher than that in previous studies in particular the potential was mainly high in high altitude areas such as the tibetan plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and ring of fire changes in thp fcon and thp hcon in the future period were analyzed thp fcon displayed higher sensitivity to climate change than did thp hcon and the range of variation in thp fcon was larger than that for thp hcon in most regions climate change was found to have a positive effect on existing and new plants due to increases in both thp values notably the installed plants in the past cannot fully utilize all the advantages of climate change due to their fixed capacity additionally a decrease in thps occurred in the karakoram mountains the himalaya mountains and south china in most asian regions on average the thp diff which is the difference between thp hcon and thp fcon in 2027 and 2038 was found to experience a statistically significant change and the thp diff in 2055 or 2056 increased very sharply therefore adaptation methods should be established and implemented by the late 2020s and active adaptation measures should be implemented in the 2050s in particular in the northern sas southern china and northern sea where thps are expected to change rapidly active adaptation measures need to be implemented in the 2030s to quantify the robustness and possible errors of this study an uncertainty analysis of the results of different gcms was performed thp fcon and thp hcon increased on average by 6 07 8 98 and 0 53 2 00 respectively into the far future period and the deviations were estimated to be 3 77 5 80 and 1 68 2 72 respectively although the rate of increase in thp highly varied most of the gcm results consistently indicated an increase in thp most of the change points occurred in the period of 2055 2056 and the deviation was 3 6 7 4 years the uncertainty of gcms did not have a notable influence on the overall trend of the results obtained in this study but it is necessary to consider the above ranges when assessing the results of this study the reported results regarding the changes in thp fcon and thp hcon can be used for resource expansion investment planning and the management of installed hydropower plants the change points based on differences in thps can be utilized to schedule adjustments to the hydropower sector in the future a study to consider more detailed technical components and a study to evaluate the hydropower potential using cmip6 a more

7837,study region asia study focus hydropower capacity is expected to increase in asia due to plentiful potential and many investors although climate change studies of hydropower have been implemented most studies have focused on the quantity of change rather than change points a change point is the time when the plant capacity designed in the past is no longer valid due to climate change and the efficiency or amount of hydropower can be significantly reduced previous studies were constrained to certain stations due to a lack of data in this study a method for exploring the change points based on the technical hydropower potential thp is proposed with simple data and the future change points of hydropower in asia are identified new hydrological insight for the region in this study an approach for detecting the change points of hydropower due to climate change is proposed and the change points in the asia are identified one novelty is the proposed approach is only required discharge and elevation to detect the points another novelty is the analysis of thp changes based on different hydropower capacities considering climate change they have never been discussed and can be utilized for resource expansion and the management of installed plants furthermore the change points are new findings since it has never been reported for most asia due to limited data availability graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change technical hydropower potential change points asia region data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction at the 2015 united nations climate change conference the paris agreement was adopted it includes a series of mandatory measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aims to increase climate finance for developing nations to 100 billion united nations 2015 this approach is shifting the global paradigm of energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy more than 170 countries have renewable energy targets and approximately 150 countries support renewable energy policies irena 2021 renewable energy accounted for 10 8 of the world s energy production as of 2018 with the renewable energy capacity rising 21 5 over the past five years 2014 2018 reflecting rapid growth ren21 2020 in 2019 the increase in renewable energy generation exceeded the increase in energy demand for the first time irena 2020 hydropower has become a preferred renewable energy source due to its mature technology high efficiency low production and operating costs and long design life killingtveit 2019 hydropower sources accounted for 47 5 of the world s renewable energy capacity in 2019 and the main investors of hydropower for increasing capacity are located in asia such as china lao pdr bhutan and tajikistan arrigada et al 2019 ren21 2020 therefore the hydropower capacity of asia is expected to considerably increase due to the plentiful hydropower potential hp and the abundance of investors van vliet et al 2016b climate change impacts hydropower due to changes and variability in precipitation temperature runoff etc corresponding research has been conducted on hydropower potential and generation at large scales such as the continental and global scales yalew et al 2020 generation is based on the actual amount of production at installed plants but potential is the projected generation when plants are constructed assessments of the impacts of climate change on hydropower potential or generation have led to an improved understanding of the interdependencies between water and energy systems and informed resource expansion investment planning and energy policy turner and voision 2022 most hydropower facilities are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they were designed based on stationarity and consistency assumptions to establish a plan to mitigate and adapt these impacts both quantifying the impacts and detecting the times of dramatic changes are important for a hydropower plant a change point is the time when the capacity established based on historical hydrological conditions is no longer valid in other words the efficiency of or amount of hydropower produced by the designed plant based on historical conditions is significantly reduced at this time additionally the generation at the plant will dramatically change potentially leading to economic disadvantages or the loss of opportunity for additional hydropower generation due to the fixed capacity therefore change points should be determined to implement the appropriate maintenance of installed plants and adapt to climate change however most previous studies conducted globally or in regions of asia have focused on the quantity of hydropower changes these studies tried to quantify changes in gross hydropower potential ghp with runoff or discharge simulations based on hydrological models hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 van vliet et al 2016a hose et al 2017 paltan et al 2021 changes in hydropower generation potentials were calculated considering the relationship between ghp and observed hydropower generation data hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 in addition zhou et al 2015 and gernaat et al 2017 tried to estimate quantitative changes in realistic hydropower potential as the technical hydropower potential thp and economic hydropower potential ehp considering technical and economic components river regulation by dams has been considered in the process of estimating changes in hydropower potential van vliet et al 2016a chowdhury et al 2021 siala et al 2021 wan et al 2021 although these studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on hydropower most studies have focused on the quantities of changes rather than the corresponding change points only a few studies have attempted to identify the change points for hydropower in historical or future periods due to climate change these studies were limited to historical periods or small spatial area due to the availability of observation data sets such as generation data operation rules and benefits for estimating hydropower generation at existing plants the studies analyzed historical change points with observation data or future change points based on calibrated plant operation approach with observation data sets both are required long term observation data sets neagoe et al 2020 and bardosa et al 2021 tried to identify change points based on observed hydropower generation data at limited numbers of stations in romania and brazil in a historical period skoulikaris and ganoulis 2017 and zhang et al 2021 searched for change points associated with hydropower generation revenue in future periods at a few dams in greece and china gu et al 2022 prioritized the necessity of adaptation for hydropower stations considering the revenue of hydropower generation in china these studies were limited to historical periods or stations with sufficient information to expand on the above studies the hydropower potential rather than the simulated generation at installed plants can be utilized to explore the change points of hydropower and the potential can be simply calculated with limited data previous studies have argued that the hydropower potential can closely represent fluctuation of generation over coarse time scales and the hydropower potential was utilized to regress total hydropower generation in certain countries hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 turner and voision 2022 additionally annual discharge which is used to calculate ghp was found to be highly correlated with observed hydropower generation at a plant on a yearly scale kao et al 2015 therefore the change points in hydropower potential which require little information to identify can be utilized in regions where data are scarce to determine the change points of hydropower generation in particular when using thp which considers the technical components of hydropower generation such as the practical capacity the efficiency of generation and turbines it is possible to explore the change points of hydropower potential considering the stationarity and consistency assumptions of hydropower facilities in this study a method for exploring the change points of hydropower based on thp is proposed and the change points of hydropower in regions of asia are identified the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents an overview of the study area the collected data and the research methodologies in section 3 the results are described and the thp changes change points and uncertainties are discussed section 4 provides a research summary and the main conclusions of this work 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area was selected as the asia region which spatially covers latitudes s 9 75 n 54 75 degrees and longitudes e 30 75 e 149 75 degrees fig 1 compared with other continents the asian continent has a large hp because it receives abundant rainfall and includes highland areas such as the himalayas the yalthai mountains and the ring of fire van vliet et al 2016b in addition china lao pdr bhutan and tajikistan have made large investments in hydropower energy ren21 2020 following large investments in hydropower plants many power plants were built in china but relatively few hydropower projects were implemented in other countries therefore the development potential is high in tajikistan bhutan and lao pdr in this study the asian region are classified into 11 386 basins to calculate the hp based on hydrosheds which is a watershed polygon map verdin and greenlee 1996 lehner and grill 2013 approximately 99 of all the basins are 10 000 square kilometers or less and basins of this size are suitable for hydropower development in asia large scale international rivers such as the brahmaputra mekong ganges indus and irrawaddy exist and there are many other small scale transboundary rivers in addition the asian continent is classified into 5 regions to effectively analyze regional results these regions include central asia ca north asia na south asia sa east asia ea and southeast asia sea 2 2 methodology fig 2 shows the framework of this study the framework consists of data collection hydropower analysis and change point detection first geospatial data gridded observed climate data and gridded climate change scenarios were obtained then the hydropower analysis involved calculating the differential head estimated between the average level and outlet level in each basin performing hydrological modeling and flow duration analyses and estimating thps after simulating the grid runoff values with a global hydrological model ghm for the historical and future periods the grided runoffs were interpolated to the basin scale with the areal weight method the interpolated runoff was accumulated considering the upstream boundary to estimate streamflow in each basin based on the streamflow results a flow duration analysis was performed for the historical and future periods thps were calculated from the differential head and flow duration analysis results in the historical and future periods finally the change points of hydropower were detected by quantifying the changes in thps and the corresponding uncertainty of future thps also quantified from gcms 2 3 climate forcing data sets for weather data the precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and average wind speed in the historical and future periods were collected in grid form 0 5 degrees as the input data for the ghm observed weather data from 1976 to 2005 provided by bae et al 2013 were used bae et al 2013 adopted daily precipitation and temperature data from the asian prescription highly resolved data integration toward evaluation aphrodite and daily wind speed data from the national centers for environmental prediction and national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis set for ghm simulations kalnay et al 1996 yatagai et al 2012 bae et al 2013 aphrodite has a 0 5 degree resolution but ncep ncar reanalysis has a 2 5 degree resolution bae et al 2013 bilinearly interpolated the reanalysis data to unify the resolution to 0 5 degrees aphrodite data are based on observations but ncep ncar reanalysis data are from model simulations although the reanalysis data are not observations we treat these data as observations for classification for climate change scenarios data from five suitable gcms were used in historical and future periods as shown in table 1 five gcms were selected and all the original gcm data sets were downscaled to 0 5 degrees from 1976 to 2100 based on the detrended quantile mapping dqm method by kim and bae 2020 in this study the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were considered 2 4 geospatial data sets digital elevation models dems for differential head calculations and basin maps for spatial classification were obtained additionally the u s geological survey usgs hydro1k dem food and agriculture organization fao soil data and university of maryland umd vegetation data were adopted as ghm inputs and they were utilized for the establishment of the hydrological model as described by bae et al 2013 the usgs hydro1k dem was also used for differential head estimation and the hydrosheds data set which includes a watershed polygon map for the world was directly adopted for basin boundary classification 2 5 hydrological modeling a variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 was used to estimate runoff vic has been widely used in continental and global hydrological analyses nijssen et al 2001a 2001b specifically the vic model which was not established in this study but was established by bae et al 2013 was applied to simulate future flow based on climate change scenarios bae et al 2013 suggested parameters for the vic model with a spatial resolution of 0 5 degrees in the study region the parameter sets were calibrated and validated for some gauged basins in this study area and the parameters were regionalized in ungauged basins based on the corresponding climate classification of gauged basins these parameters have been used in hydrological application research such as in climate change impact assessments of water resources and drought analyses bae et al 2017 lee et al 2019 kim et al 2020a 2020b in this study the vic model was used to simulate the amount of runoff in the historical 1976 2005 reference 1976 2005 and future 2011 2100 periods the historical runoff data were simulated based on observation data from bae et al 2013 and reference and future runoff data were simulated based on gcm data from kim and bae 2020 the runoff from the vic model is gridded data and it was converted to basin data through areal weighted interpolation the basin scale runoff was converted to streamflow based on cumulative runoff calculations considering the upstream boundary of each basin without a physical routing process bae et al 2013 who established the original vic model utilized the same approach to convert runoff to streamflow and the calibration and verification results for converted streamflow displayed acceptable accuracy at a monthly time step because changes in thps are assessed at a longer time step year in this study than the monthly step adopted by bae et al 2013 we can expect the travel time of streamflow to have less of an effect on thp than did that in their analysis and the effect ignorable that is the reason why the physical routing scheme was not considered in this study to investigate the corresponding trends periods were divided into the historical s0 1976 2005 near future s1 2011 2040 moderate future s2 2041 2070 and distant future s3 2071 2100 periods to calculate the results for s0 historical data were used and to calculate the future changes in s1 s2 and s3 reference and future data were used additionally reference data were used to calculate the ratio of change in future periods 2 6 technical hydropower potential in the design of hydropower plants not only the potential of streamflow but also technical economic and environmental considerations are needed depending on the specific case the type of hydropower potential which is the expected hydropower generation for a designed plant can be transformed into ghp thp economic hydropower potential ehp and exploitable hydropower potential ghp is the theoretical gross amount of potential energy available when all streamflow flows to sea level without any other consideration therefore in the ghp concept any loss associated with technical components economic feasibility or environmental restriction is not considered based on the current technology all amounts of ghp cannot be captured due to loss from generation the practical capacity of plants maintenance etc thus thp is the available hydropower potential based on the current technology zhou et al 2015 thp considers the loss associated with technical components but economic and environmental factors are not considered in previous studies the generator efficiency and practical capacity of plants were used to classify ghp and thp zhou et al 2015 the generation efficiency is the efficiency related to turbines and generators and in this study it was considered a fixed constant the practical capacity is the magnitude of plants and is considered a fixed maximum generation flow in other words when the streamflow exceeds the maximum flow the maximum flow value is used in the previous approach the maximum flow threshold was set based on an investigation of the benefits and cost of installed plants u s bureau of reclamation 2011 this threshold can lead to similar thp and ehp values given the relevant economic considerations notably zhou et al 2015 calculated similar thp and ehp levels and the difference in potentials was approximately 20 we attempted to mitigate this similarity issue by extracting thp from ghp using a ghp equation practical capacity and efficiency rather than information from installed plants thp can be extracted from ghp considering efficiencies and practical capacity the practical capacity can be decided based on the maximum generation flow q dmax minimum generation flow q dmin and the available generation flow corresponding to the capacity can be calculated with daily flow duration analyses as expressed in eqs 2 and 3 as expressed in eq 1 the annual average streamflow is used to calculate annual ghp and all potential energy in the streamflow is converted to hydropower hose et al 2017 in this study it is assumed that the maximum generation flow is the annual average flow used in ghp calculations to derive the thp the minimum generation flow is set as the drought flow and reflects the concept that hydropower plants are difficult to operate during drought periods ri 185 y and ri 355 y were utilized as q d max y and q d min y respectively since they represent average and drought flows moon and kang 2016 finally the thp can be calculated with available generation flow and net differential height as shown eqs 4 and 5 1 ghp y ρ g q ave h ave 2 ri o y i y 29 y q o i 30 3 if ri o y q d max then qr o y q d max else if ri o y q dmin then qr o y 0 else if qr o y ri o y 4 h net c h ave h out 5 thp y η ρ g h net o 1 365 qr o y 365 where ghp y is the ghp kw in year y ρ is the density of water 1000 kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 q ave is the annual average streamflow m 3 s h ave is the average elevation of the basin m rio y m3 s is the annual average of qo i m3 s for 30 years ending in year y qo i m3 s denotes the oth daily streamflow value in descending order over a year qro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the practical capacity c is the coefficient of head loss 0 92 h net is the net differential height m h out is the elevation at the basin outlet m thp y kw is the thp in year y estimated based on the relevant capacities and η is the efficiency of generation 0 85 the coefficient of head loss and efficiency of generation were established based on the suggestions of the ccaw 2019 in feasibility analyses of large hydropower plants in the literature these coefficients and efficiencies are commonly adopted for plants in south korea 2 7 identification of change points the change point of interest in this study is the time when the historical design capacity of a hydropower plant is no longer valid due to climate change when the hydrological conditions change the plant can experience one of two outcomes the first outcome is decreased hydropower generation due to reduced streamflow and the second is increased hydropower generation however the ratio of utilized flow to total flow is reduced in this case in the first case the concern is related to energy deficiency and the second case inefficiency can be high to the low utilization ratio of total flow both cases require management to mitigate energy losses and maximize generations because the climate is gradually changing it is difficult to determine the time at which effects will be significant initially the generation of plants will gradually change and when climate change accelerates at a certain point generation will abruptly change the time at which the generation will abruptly change is the change point of hydropower generation in previous studies the change points were directly detected by analyzing observed generation time series from installed hydropower plants in a historical period or calibrated plant operation rules based on the time series data of installed plants in a future period since both methods require long term generation data and economic considerations some of them were only applied in historical periods with observations neagoe et al 2020 bardosa et al 2021 and others were applied at stations with long term observed data that were used to simulate generation in the future skoulikaris and ganoulis 2017 zhang et al 2021 gu et al 2022 this approach can be used to easily identify change points and the results are intuitive however long term input data are required to obtain the results which is an obstacle to applying the approach in data limited regions in this study a conceptual approach is proposed to detect change points based on thp and it requires only discharge and elevation data sets several studies have suggested that the discharge or hydropower potential are related to the observed generation at plants hamududu and kilingtveit 2012 kao et al 2015 turner and voision 2022 therefore this approach could be practically effective for detecting the change points of hydropower generation in order to quantify how the historical design valid the difference between the potential generations at plants designed based on historical and future hydrological conditions was adopted as shown in eq 6 6 thp diff y thp fcon y thp hcon y where thp hcon y and thp fcon y represent the technical potential generation kw in the yth year for a designed plant based on historical and future conditions respectively thp diff y is the difference between potentials kw hcon is the fixed historical condition 1976 2005 and fcon is the future condition in the yth year thp hcon represents the future potential generation of installed plants based on historical data and thp fcon represents the future potential generation of newly constructed plants in the future therefore the difference can represent the amount of obtainable energy when the capacity is updated corresponding to future hydrological condition the capacity designed in the past will not be suitable for future hydrological condition which will result in a gradual increase in the difference between thp fcon and thp hcon in the future as shown fig 3 unlike thp hcon which cannot change beyond a certain level due to its capacity designed in the past thp fcon will change continuously and this difference may increase dramatically at certain point in the future this study detects the time at which the difference abruptly increases as a change point and from this point on the design conditions in the past are no longer valid the difference is the target variable participating in the change point search the flow duration curve used to calculate the differences in generation is shown in fig 4 as mentioned in section 2 6 the changeable design condition based on the flow condition is the practical capacity therefore different capacities were applied to calculate thp hcon and thp fcon from the flow duration analysis results as shown in fig 4 and eqs 7 and 8 the capacity of thp hcon is fixed from 1976 to 2005 and the capacity of thp fcon is varied each year for instance if y is equal to 2100 q dmax and q dmin for thp fcon are determined based on flow data from 2071 to 2100 thp hcon and thp fcon can be calculated with eqs 9 and 10 if ri o y q d max 2005 then hqr o y q d max 2005 else if ri o y q dmin 2005 then hqr o y 0 7 else if hqr o y ri o y if ri o y q d max y then fqr o y q d max y else if ri o y q dmin y then fqr o y 0 8 else if fqr o y ri o y 9 thp hcon y η ρ g h net o 1 365 hqr o y 365 10 thp fcon y η ρ g h net o 1 365 fqr o y 365 where hqro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the historical capacity and fqro y m3 s is the available generation flow based on the future capacity pettitt s test was adopted to detect change points based on the differences in thps pettitt 1979 the test is a kind of nonparametric test that is commonly utilized to find abrupt changes in time series xie et al 2019 in particular in the hydrological field it has been used to analyze the change points in hydroclimate time series in the context of climate change neagoe et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this study the difference of thps was utilized as hydroclimate timeseries according to a comparison study of methods for detecting change points by xie et al 2019 pettitt s test displayed excellent performance in detecting change points and yielded stable results under various conditions the detailed equations used to calculate the pettitt statistics and confidence levels are shown in eqs 11 13 11 k t max u t t 12 u t t i 1 t j i 1 t sgn x i x j 13 p 2 exp 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 where k t is pettitt s statistic x denotes the sample data in this study thp diff y t and t are the lengths of each time series p is the confidence level of pettitt s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in thps based on different hydrological design conditions in this study to detect the change points of hydropower two kinds of thps thp hcon and thp fcon were calculated in this section the changes in thps in a future period are discussed since these thps provide meaningful information as mentioned since these thps are associated with different capacities from historical and future conditions thp hcon represents the change in the potential generation of installed plants and thp fcon represents the change in the potential generation of newly developed plants fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of thp in the s0 period and both thp fcon and thp hcon are the same in the historical period the thp is concentrated in highland regions including the karakoram mountains and himalayan mountains in the northern sas the tibetan plateau region the yunnan guizhou plateau region in southern china and northern sea and the ring of fire region in indonesia and papua new guinea the basins that are blank were excluded from the thp calculations because of zero maximum generation flow values generally in arid areas and negative elevations in reference to sea level as observed for some islands the thp for the s0 period in asia is 3 21 tw table 2 gives a comparison of the results of this study and other studies studies that were conducted in recent periods and used land masks similar to those applied in this study were selected for comparison the results of this study cover most asian basins with papua new guinea located in oceania other studies excluded papua new guinea from asia zhou et al 2015 calculated ghp thp and ehp and it is the only study that is directly comparable with this study of thp due to the use of similar land masks van vliet et al 2016b calculated ghp with three ghms and the average value is presented in table 2 hose et al 2017 calculated ghp based on the average monthly discharge by combining observed discharge data at stations and values simulated with hydrological models since station data were used a common data period cannot be obtained for comparison based on the methodology used thp should be smaller than ghp thp in this study was found to be in the ghp range of 2 9 5 61 tw reported in other studies the thp result is considered reasonable because it is mostly lower than the ghp results in other studies compared to the thp reported by zhou et al 2015 the thp in this study was approximately 270 higher this difference is due to differences in methodology zhou et al 2015 set q dmax based on monthly streamflow and a 30 exceedance probability and annual average streamflow was used to establish q dmax in this study therefore q dmax in this study is much larger than the value in the literature at most times except during some wet periods as suggested in the methodology zhou et al 2015 set the exceedance probability based on generation data from power plants however the generation capacity of a plant is designed based on both technical and economic considerations therefore the thp methodology of zhou et al 2015 considers some characteristics of ehp in fact the results of zhou et al 2015 indicate that the difference between thp and ehp is not large in this study the annual average streamflow which was used to calculate ghp was applied as q dmax to extract only the technical potential from ghp the flows in the drought period were excluded when estimating generation flows with q dmin therefore the results of this study are conceptually closer to actual thp values than are those of previous studies however the methodology used in this study has some limitations some technical components were ignored such as the plant scale dynamic head river routing and reservoir operation the head is overestimated since it is the difference between the average and minimum head in a basin in reality head is determined based on the plant scale and water level of rivers which dynamically change in this study streamflow was calculated as the accumulation of runoff and the proposed method does not consider river length or flow velocity when converting runoff to streamflow some stations have reservoirs that are used to manage the flow for generation and these reservoirs are operated not only for generation but also for water supply and flood control therefore the real available flow may be less than the flow calculated in this study these limitations can result in the overestimation of thp additionally as described by van vliet et al 2016b the results of global and continental scale hp studies exhibited significant differences these differences were caused by variations in input data and ghms notably climate and topography vary at different scales and ghms which are calibrated in a few basins worldwide produce different results in different cases these limitations must be addressed in the future fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the change in thps in the near future period 2011 2040 to that in the far future period 2071 2100 the thps used to calculate this ratio were the averaged values of the results based on five gcms the thp in the asia region increases in the future compared to that in the historical period the change in thp hcon was smaller than that in thp fcon because thp hcon was calculated considering the historical capacity the sensitivity of thp to climate change was relatively small this result indicates that generation by hydropower plants constructed in the past is less affected by climate change than is generation at newly constructed plants additionally the range of change in thps based on rcp 8 5 was larger than that in the case of rcp 4 5 in the near future thp fcon increased in most cas and nas regions and thp fcon decreased in the southern cas southern china northern sas and northern sea regions in the far future most regions except southern china sas and northern sea displayed a large increase in thp fcon the thp hcon results exhibited a similar spatial distribution as the change in thp fcon but the range of change was smaller overall it was found that climate change has a notable effect on the asian region by increasing the thps therefore it is expected that hydropower will be expanded in feasible basins due to the increasing trend of thp fcon moreover the generation of installed plants will increase due to the increasing trend of thp hcon however the benefits that climate change will have on hydropower cannot be fully utilized at installed plants because there are differences between the thp fcon and thp hcon trends in fig 5 thps decrease in the karakoram mountains and himalaya mountains in northern sas and sea and southern china where thp levels are high therefore there is concern about the reduction in hydropower resources in those regions in addition an analysis of countries with active investments in hydropower indicated that lao pdr and china except the southern part have positive conditions for developing hydropower in historical and future periods but in southern china bhutan may experience a decrease in thp in the future 3 2 change points based on differences in thps in this section the change points of hydropower were detected based on the difference thp diff between thp fcon and thp hcon fig 7 shows the results of thp changes and change points in asia in the rcp scenarios the blue range and line are the changes in thp fcon based on different gcms and the averaged value respectively the red range and line are the changes in thp hcon based on different gcms and the averaged value respectively the green line is pettit s statistic and the orange line represents thp diff when the orange line changes rapidly and the green line reaches its maximum value at a certain point it indicates that the capacity of hydropower plants in the historical period is no longer valid due to climate change and the point is selected as a change point fig 7 a shows the results for rcp 4 5 thp fcon exhibits greater uncertainty in the future than does thp hcon and beginning in the 2050s thp fcon increases noticeably compared to thp hcon thp diff fluctuates close to 0 until 2050 but a clearly positive change is observed beginning in the 2050 s according to pettit s static 2055 was selected as the change point where thp diff changed significantly and the p value was 4 42 10 15 following significance tests it was found that a significant change occurred in 2027 with a p value of less than 0 001 fig 7 b shows the results for rcp 8 5 the uncertainty in thp fcon is larger than that in thp hcon and the rcp8 5 result exhibits a larger range than the rcp4 5 result the difference in thps displays a noticeable change beginning in the 2050s and the increase in thp diff is larger than that for rcp 4 5 based on pettit s test 2056 was the most significant change point with a p value for 4 42 10 15 and in 2038 a significant change occurred with a p value of less than 0 001 a significant change in thp in asia is expected to occur with very high confidence due to climate change therefore it is necessary to establish adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change within the next 10 years the differences in thps will significantly change which will lead to a change in hydropower generation for plants installed in the historical period s0 or before in terms of climate change adaptation measures to adapt to climate change in the hydropower field should be established and implemented before the late 2020s before the 2050s active adaptation measures that can be used to adapt to rapid changes should be implemented for this purpose it is necessary to establish and sufficiently discuss adaptation measures that can be used in advance in various stages fig 8 shows the change points and confidence levels according to the difference in thps for each rcp scenario in fig 8 a and b the closer to blue a basin is the closer the change point is to being reached in the early future and vice versa for basins in red in most regions a change point occurred in the 2050s and a rapid change point corresponding to the 2030s was found in most of the cas northern sas northern sea and southern china regions the change points did not rapidly occur in areas with large changes in thps rather in many cases the change points occurred rapidly in areas with small changes in thps in cas and papua new guinea rapid change points were associated with large increases in thps in the northern sas southern china and northern sea regions thp exhibited a slight decrease and generally stable trend when a change point occurred therefore because rapid changes do not necessarily occur in regions with large quantitative changes only limited information on adaptation can be provided based on quantitative changes alone therefore change point analysis is essential for assessing hp change in the context of climate change fig 8 c and d show the confidence levels according to the rcp results the closer to blue a basin is the higher the corresponding confidence level is and vice versa for basins in red very high confidence can be observed in most regions which suggests that an abrupt change point will occur with a very high probability in most regions of asia 3 3 uncertainties of thp change estimates for different gcms in climate change studies uncertainty assessment is important because it represents the robustness or possible error of results in this study we attempted to quantify the uncertainty of gcms which is the main driver of uncertainty in climate change studies table 3 shows the future change in thps and the deviations associated with gcms notably the deviations represent the uncertainty among gcms in the far future for rcp4 5 thp fcon increased by 6 07 on average and for rcp 8 5 the average increase was 8 98 however thp hcon was found to increase by 0 53 and 2 00 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the deviation among gcms indicates uncertainty and the deviations in thp hcon for which the generation capacity is limited by past flow conditions are smaller than those in thp fcon considering the deviation among gcms thp fcon is expected to increase by 2 30 9 84 and 3 18 14 78 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively and thp hcon is expected to change by 1 15 2 21 and 0 72 4 72 in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the uncertainty of thp changes is increases over time as suggested in section 3 2 a change points was found to occur in the 2050s namely in 2055 and 2056 in the two scenarios and the deviation among gcms was 7 4 years and 3 6 years for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively therefore a major change point is expected to occur between 2048 and 2062 for rcp4 5 and 2052 2060for rcp8 5 although differences depending on the gcm applied can be seen in table 3 the trends of future changes predicted with different gcms look consistent as shown in fig 7 the ensemble average of the gcm results indicated an increasing thp trend which is close to the upper boundary of uncertainty in fig 7 this is because the results of only one gcm deviated from the result of other models which led to a relatively high uncertainty boundary since four of the five gcms displayed consistent results the results of this study can be considered consistent in other words the uncertainty associated with gcms does not have a critical influence on changes in the overall trends of the results in this study 4 summary and conclusions in this study a method for exploring the change points of hydropower based on thp is proposed and the change points in asia are determined one novelty is the proposal of a new approach for identifying the change points of hydropower with limited data another novelty is that the thps which can represent potential generation from existing and newly developed plants were analyzed additionally for the first time the change points of hydropower are reported with a novel approach based on thp in most of asia a summary of this study is given below a change point is defined as the time when the historical design capacity of a hydropower plant is no longer valid due to climate change to detect change points two thps were utilized depending on the design capacity thp hcon and thp fcon are the future potential generation values of designed plants based on historical and future hydrological conditions respectively conceptually thp hcon and thp fcon can represent future potential generation for existing plants designed in the past and newly developed plants in the future respectively a change point is identified when the difference in thps abruptly increases since this increase suggests that the historical design capacity does not match the future flow condition the proposed method is used to conveniently analyze change points with only discharge and elevation data the thp in the historical period in asia was 3 21 tw and it was reasonably calculated compared to the values obtained with different methods used in previous studies because only technical components excluding economic components were considered the potential was higher than that in previous studies in particular the potential was mainly high in high altitude areas such as the tibetan plateau yunnan guizhou plateau and ring of fire changes in thp fcon and thp hcon in the future period were analyzed thp fcon displayed higher sensitivity to climate change than did thp hcon and the range of variation in thp fcon was larger than that for thp hcon in most regions climate change was found to have a positive effect on existing and new plants due to increases in both thp values notably the installed plants in the past cannot fully utilize all the advantages of climate change due to their fixed capacity additionally a decrease in thps occurred in the karakoram mountains the himalaya mountains and south china in most asian regions on average the thp diff which is the difference between thp hcon and thp fcon in 2027 and 2038 was found to experience a statistically significant change and the thp diff in 2055 or 2056 increased very sharply therefore adaptation methods should be established and implemented by the late 2020s and active adaptation measures should be implemented in the 2050s in particular in the northern sas southern china and northern sea where thps are expected to change rapidly active adaptation measures need to be implemented in the 2030s to quantify the robustness and possible errors of this study an uncertainty analysis of the results of different gcms was performed thp fcon and thp hcon increased on average by 6 07 8 98 and 0 53 2 00 respectively into the far future period and the deviations were estimated to be 3 77 5 80 and 1 68 2 72 respectively although the rate of increase in thp highly varied most of the gcm results consistently indicated an increase in thp most of the change points occurred in the period of 2055 2056 and the deviation was 3 6 7 4 years the uncertainty of gcms did not have a notable influence on the overall trend of the results obtained in this study but it is necessary to consider the above ranges when assessing the results of this study the reported results regarding the changes in thp fcon and thp hcon can be used for resource expansion investment planning and the management of installed hydropower plants the change points based on differences in thps can be utilized to schedule adjustments to the hydropower sector in the future a study to consider more detailed technical components and a study to evaluate the hydropower potential using cmip6 a more

7838,study region dak lak province in the central highlands of vietnam study focus intensification of agriculture has resulted in unsustainably high levels of groundwater use in the central highlands high monsoonal rainfall provides opportunities to boost groundwater storage through managed aquifer recharge mar yet experience with mar in the region is absent in response five farm scale pilots were implemented in collaboration with local farmers whereby runoff from roofs and fields was recharged into shallow dug wells the pilots were closely monitored over three years new hydrological insights for the region mar pilots exhibited large contrasts in performance with volumes recharged ranging from 5 to 530 m3 per year pilot sites with cleaner roof runoff water performed best whilst those using more turbid water from unpaved roads performed worst water quality analyses did not identify parameters of major concern for irrigation field data and modelling indicate that the size of the recharge water plumes are small relative to the high groundwater velocities making the recharge water difficult to recover from the recharge well in this setting water is however contained locally providing potential for improved water availability within the local area farmer attitudes towards mar vary in response to the technical performance and a range of socioeconomic factors these findings may provide insights for researchers or practitioners from other regions where groundwater dependence is high but experience in mar is lacking keywords managed aquifer recharge hard rock aquifer south east asia climate resilience data availability data can be made available on request 1 introduction decades of intensification of agricultural production systems across vietnam s central highlands has greatly increased smallholder farmer wellbeing and livelihoods but also led to increased stress on water resources meyfroidt et al 2013 cheesman and bennett 2005 major crops grown in the region such

the central highlands bears similarities with the deccan trap region of western india throughout the deccan trap and other drought prone hardrock regions of peninsular india mar is undertaken through large scale state government programs these programs have evolved over decades commencing from grassroots efforts by farmers to directly recharge their dug wells using simple methods to capture pretreat and store local runoff these practices have proven effective in climate adaptation and help provide motivation for this study verma and shah 2020 the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of mar from a set of pilot trials it reports on the hydraulic water quality and socioeconomic data collected during a three year trial with the aims of establishing 1 the volumes of surface water stored and the factors that affect this 2 the transport of recharge water in the aquifer 3 the risks to groundwater quality due to recharge 4 the costs of mar and 5 the attitudes of the participating farmers 2 site description this study was conducted in krong buk district dak lak province krong buk district is situated within the dak lak plateau one of the most extensive plateaus in the central highlands the fertile red brown volcanic soils are well suited to agriculture with production of robusta coffee dominant d haeze et al 2003 2022 the climate is tropical with a monomodal rainfall regime driven by the southwest monsoon mainly falling from may to october the area is characterised by a regionally extensive basaltic aquifer system jica 2002 d haeze 2005 mk17 project team

specific yield of 0 12 viossanges et al 2019 the weathered aquifer is underlain by variably fractured hard basalt with alternating sequences of fresh basalt and thick clays productive fractures can be intersected over depth intervals ranging between 60 and 145 m below ground level the more permeable shallow aquifer provides the main supply of groundwater for the irrigation of coffee across the plateau viossanges et al 2019 milnes et al 2015 most of the water is sourced from shallow unlined dug wells that intersect much or all of the weathered aquifer profile most wells have diameters varying from 1 2 to 1 6 m and depths ranging from around 10 30 m depending on the location and thickness of the aquifer viossanges et al 2019 mk17 project team 2013 3 approach and methods 3 1 site selection sites for mar piloting were selected on more elevated areas of the landscape identified through previous geospatial investigations to be hotspots of water scarcity milnes et al 2015 shallow irrigation wells with scope for conversion to mar together with equivalent sites closeby that served as reference sites for the without mar case were identified according to the following criteria 1 irrigation well routinely exposed to dry season water shortages as verified by the well owning farmer 2 appropriate area to harvest local runoff water for recharge 3 adequate clearing in close proximity to the well for installation of infrastructure for runoff diversion and water pre treatment 4 depth to groundwater of more than 5 m at the end of the wet season to ensure sufficient latent aquifer storage capacity to accommodate groundwater level rise due to recharge 5 approval by the well owning farmer to modify the irrigation well for mar and 6 no use of the well for domestic purposes since the fitness of the water abstracted for household use needed to be confirmed through the trial initial field inspections were conducted in february march 2017 within cu ne and ea toh communes of krong buk district fig 1 in total twenty five sites were inspected and subsequently ranked according to the above criteria this procedure led to five mar sites being established referred to as m1 to m5 along with seven nearby reference sites as two sites had two reference wells identified with respect to the associated mar site e g m1 r1 the mar sites are located in two general clusters one for m1 to m3 is situated within ea krom village and a second for m4 to m5 in kmu village situated around 2 3 km west fig 1 separation distances between the mar site and their associated reference sites ranged from 70 to 210 m sites were distributed across four micro watersheds that all lie within the catchment of the krong buk river a tributary of the srepok basin that forms part of the lower mekong basin d haeze 2022 the elevation across the study area ranges from about 700 800 m amsl 3 2 design and implementation five farm scale pilots were set up to harvest surface runoff to store in the weathered basaltic aquifer ubiquitous to the area simple low cost methods that have potential to be reproduced by farmers were used existing unlined dug wells were retrofitted for recharge fig 2 rainfall runoff from areas immediately upslope of the irrigation wells was diverted and infiltrated after pretreatment to reduce suspended solid loads entering the aquifer the major sources of runoff included local fields at two sites m1 m2 and a mix of residential roof paved surfaces and fields at three sites m3 m5 table 1 fig 3 for sites m1 to m3 a flow diversion channel was required to transport water from the natural drainage line towards a 400 litre sediment trap followed by a filtration tank both of simple masonry construction for sites m4 and m5 existing concrete lined channels were used to convey water to a polyethylene plastic tank of one metre diameter readily available from local farm supply stores that was dissected in half and each half installed below ground sediment traps at these two sites were not needed a large collection area at m5 allowed two parallel filtration tanks to be installed the filtration tanks were packed with a 30 cm layer of fine gravel 5 mm below a 30 cm layer of medium sand 0 5 mm over the tank mesh sheeting was used to keep out coarse vegetation and other debris inflow and outflow pipes are 2 inch diameter or wider pvc pipe fitted with flow control valves above and below the tank a plastic elbow was added to the end of the pvc pipe to redirect water vertically downwards in the well and a nozzle endcap fitted to reduce the water s kinetic energy to minimize risk of erosion within the well pilot testing was carried out for three consecutive monsoon seasons from may 2017 to december 2019 after the first year most sites featured design enhancements to help increase the volume and efficiency of recharge based on reviews of the initial data and field inspections table 1 one of the sites m2 was discontinued after the second year due to poor performance 3 3 regulatory arrangements potential for adverse impacts stem from direct recharge of surface water runoff into aquifers as a result of mar which modifies the hydrologic cycle that operates within the micro watersheds including the pathways to control natural processes that allow potential pollutants present in recharge water to be attenuated dillon et al 2010 the primary water quality risks in the intensively used agricultural watersheds of the central highlands are likely to be derived from residues associated with inputs from agriculture washoff of sediment from fields and microbial pathogens from livestock and other fauna the ministry of natural resources and environment monre has responsibility for the protection of surface water and groundwater monre 2006 this includes responsibility for preventing depletion and degradation of water resources and licencing for abstraction the 2011 government of vietnam decree no 38 2011 nd cp makes reference to the avoidance of overexploitation and discharge of waste to water bodies but makes no provision for licencing of mar with appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks inclusive of mar entirely absent permission to undertake the trial was provided by the department of natural resources and environment donre and the department of agriculture and rural development dard in dak lak province these authorities considered the monitoring program put forward as detailed below sufficient to ensure adequate protection to groundwater resources from potential risks 3 4 monitoring and analysis mar and reference sites were monitored using procedures and protocols briefly covered below 3 4 1 mar recharge rates recharge rates were estimated at each pilot site from the combined use of rainfall groundwater level and filtration tank flow rate data twelve water depth and temperature recorders were used to monitor all mar and reference wells data was collected every five minutes within the first year of monitoring between august 2017 and january 2018 seven of the groundwater recorders failed due to water entering the units through casing failures all recorders were subsequently replaced by the manufacturer in march 2018 with an improved design and no further technical issues were observed a tipping bucket rain gauge was set up at kmu village close to the m4 m5 cluster by careful interpretation of the rainfall and groundwater level data the start and end of each mar recharge event could be identified noting that the recharge events were associated with quick groundwater level build up which later also quickly dissipated when inflows from the filtration tank to the well ceased fig 4 through comparison of groundwater levels at the mar well and the nearest reference well the water level signatures from mar derived recharge could be differentiated from other processes affecting groundwater levels e g diffuse recharge local pumping etc flow rates through the filtration tanks were monitored periodically during dry periods so as not to interfere with the recharge process flow rates through the tank were estimated by measuring the rate of decrease in tank water level after filling the tank and opening the valves to enable drainage into the well the storage characteristics of each tank was determined to convert changes in levels to volumes the volume of recharge for each recharge event was estimated by multiplying the length of each recharge event by the tank flow rate measured from the nearest time of the event the volume of recharge during each year was aggregated from event wise values the uncertainty in the estimation of the duration of the recharge event was determined to be 6 on average based on the five minute water level recordings and recharge duration information presented later 3 4 2 water quality monitoring regular water quality testing was performed during the trial during the first year each of the mar wells were sampled five times three times in the wet season and two in the dry season the reference wells were sampled only once each season as the temporal variations in water quality were anticipated to be less during the second and third years monitoring was limited to just three mar wells m1 m4 and m5 together with their reference wells due to resource constraints at least one site was selected in each of the two village clusters with an emphasis on sites that tended to show promise in the wet season a six litre bucket was suspended within each mar well directly below the entry pipe to collect the recharge water as the sites were difficult to access during wet weather conditions in the dry season samples were collected by pumping the wells continuously for at least thirty minutes to flush the well before taking a sample the sampling suite included a range of physical chemical and biological parameters the rationale for the selection of pesticide indicators took into account a our surveys of local stockists and farmers to identify pesticides sold and used in the area b discussions with local experts from government authorities c a review of relevant reference material from the literature and other online sources and d the analytical capability of the laboratory eleven pesticide indicators were selected that included four of the top ten pesticides used in 2015 by volume according to data provided by the vietnam pesticide association aldrin chlordane chlorpyrifos dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane ddd dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt diazinon dieldrin endosulfan lindane heptachlor samples were kept under refrigerated conditions and transported to the laboratories in cooler boxes packed with ice subsamples were dispatched to the iso 17025 accredited sgs laboratory in ho chi minh city for analysis subsamples for e coli were tested at the dak lak health department provincial preventative medicine center in buon ma thuot due to the need for sample receipt within twelve hours of collection 3 4 3 mar costs the economics of mar is a key factor for its acceptance ross and hasnain 2018 mar projects incur both fixed capital and variable operation and maintenance o m costs maliva 2014 both sets of costs inclusive of material and labour were itemized for each site in 2017 and 2018 only items necessary to mar system functioning were included and non essential research related costs omitted from the analysis 3 4 4 farmer attitudes attitudes are an important factor affecting the commitment of farmers to new technologies chi and yamada 2002 determining the attitudes of farmers to mar is thus a critical indicator and necessary step towards assessing the potential for successful adoption of mar beyond the pilots farmer attitudes were deduced through a process of consultation with the farmers as follows a with individual well owners during the site selection surveys prior to the trial february and march 2017 b with mar pilot well owners who were interviewed and asked to complete a likert type scale survey croasmun and ostrom 2011 that uses questionnaires to gather responses according to a predetermined rating scale e g from strongly disagree through to strongly agree june 2018 and c from a focus group discussion with four mar and six reference well owners plus a community leader towards the end of the second monsoon season november 2018 4 results 4 1 groundwater levels rainfall patterns together with observed groundwater levels for two sites one set for m1 m1 r1 and another for m4 m4 r1 are presented in fig 5 all wells show characteristic rises during each wet season due to rainfall recharge processes with levels typically peaking during august to september intense rainfall associated with typhoon activity may generate multiple peaks over the season e g a major secondary peak in november 2017 when 102 mm of rainfall was recorded due to from typhoon damrey relative to the average annual rainfall of around 1700 mm year based on rainfall records from 2001 to 2012 for four measurement stations situated within a 51 km radius of the study area annual rainfall during 2017 and 2018 were around 5 and 15 below average respectively whereas in 2019 it was about average trends in annual rainfall are reflected in the annual trends in minimum depth to groundwater level comparing both pairs of wells shows consistency in the broad trends although short term variations are substantially different the mar wells feature the distinct peaks associated with mar recharge events these are substantially more pronounced at m4 than m1 as the major recharge contribution to well recharge came from the residential roof with high runoff coefficient groundwater level mounding associated with recharge peaks dissipate within a matter of hours to days following the cessation of each recharge event as is more clearly observed in fig 4 the reference wells feature sharp declines from daily pumping for domestic supply from nearby shallow wells which are largely absent from the mar wells that were not used for domestic purposes 4 2 recharge performance cumulative recharge curves reveal substantial differences in the volumes recharged between sites within each year and at each site between years fig 6 the overall variation ranges from a minimum of 5 m3 from 24 recharge events at m1 in 2018 to a maximum of 530 m3 from 229 events at m4 in 2019 the two order of magnitude difference in recharge performance may be attributed to the following factors i inter annual rainfall variability ii system design and iii site maintenance additionally the slightly delayed start of operations and some data loss due to logger failure in the first year likely reduced the recharge quantity annual rainfall totals for the three years were 1600 1462 and 1730 mm respectively a contrast of 18 between the lowest rainfall year in 2018 and the highest in 2019 the effect of annual rainfall variability is difficult to clearly discern on a site wise basis due to the confounding influence of design and management related factors however at an aggregated level the higher average values of recharge in 2019 compared with 2018 can likely be attributed in part to the higher rainfall due to the similarities in the recharge well and pretreatment systems the main design related factor controlling recharge was the type and area of runoff collection which influenced the quantity and quality of the source water although rainfall in 2018 was lower than the previous year the design improvements made after the first year table 1 led to major improvements at m3 and m5 with modest improvements at m4 approximately in proportion with the additional roof area added declines were evident at the m1 and m2 sites where performance was poorer as detailed below highest rates of recharge were observed for sites m3 m4 and m5 where most of the runoff is derived from roofs or other paved surfaces higher runoff coefficients for roofs compared to fields generates a higher number of recharge events the average number of recharge events per season for sites m3 m4 and m5 over the three year trial period was 145 whereas for m1 and m2 it was only 38 the average event based duration of recharge for all sites was 1 4 h and varied from 1 2 h at sites m2 and m4 up to 1 6 h at sites m1 and m5 site maintenance in the first two years was limited to cleaning deposited sediment and other debris in the filtration tanks at the start and end of the season except where major issues were observed and the upper sand layer was replaced maintenance was increased in the third year to a frequency of every 1 2 months over the monsoon season it followed that filtration tank flow rates largely reflected the degree of site maintenance flow rates through the tanks varied widely across the sites fig 7 with values mostly in the range from around 5 30 m3 day in 2017 18 and increasing to 20 45 m3 day in 2019 lowest rates were associated with m2 which had much lower values often 10 m3 day or less as this site collects runoff from an unpaved road table 1 and had the most turbid water sediment removal as determined by turbidity levels before and after sedimentation and filtration treatment were in the range of 50 90 across all the sites 4 3 recoverability of recharge water 4 3 1 hydraulics the dimensions of a homogeneous cylindrical recharge water plume can be estimated and compared with the ambient groundwater velocity for an assumed saturated aquifer thickness of 15 m and specific yield of 0 12 viossanges et al 2019 the radius of the plume ranges from 0 9 to 9 7 m due to differences in the volume recharged in any year from darcy s law the distance that the recharge plume would drift over an assumed six month effective storage period ranges from 5 to 13 m across the five sites for average groundwater flow gradients between the mar and reference well pairs ranging from 0 03 to 0 07 this lateral movement expressed in relation to the plume radius gives ratio s that vary from 1 1 to 11 5 ratio s consistently in excess of 1 would suggest limited scope to directly recover the recharge water from the same well used for recharge dry season pumping occurred at around half of the mar wells two in the first year m2 and m4 and three in the second m2 m4 and m5 accessibility of other nearby wells was the reason given for not using the other mar wells as farmers have on average between two and three wells equipped for pumping reliable estimates of pumped volume at those sites were not available 4 3 2 hydrochemistry contrasts in the quality of the recharge and ambient waters for constituents such as total dissolved solids tds and nitrate no3 enables the movement of recharge water to be established hydrochemically both tds and nitrate levels were higher for the recharge water at all mar sites during the wet season except for nitrate at m4 where the predominant roof runoff recharge water was difficult to distinguish from the ambient groundwater fig 8 the elevated signatures of both parameters evident in the wet season at all mar sites are no longer evident in the dry season with values declining to those of the reference wells this suggests that recharge water migrates downstream before there is any chance of recovery during the dry season 4 3 3 numerical modelling a numerical model was developed to gain greater insight on the recharged water behaviour within the groundwater system associated with an individual mar well ten mar related scenarios were implemented that accounted for potential differences in the volumes of water recharged ambient groundwater velocity and aquifer porosity distributed and lumped scheduling of recharge and pumping events was also compared together they attempt to cover the range of potential hydrogeological and mar operating conditions that may apply to the mar pilots details on the model design and implementation are provided by pavelic et al 2019 the simulations suggest that the scope for farmers to recover recharge water from the mar well is generally low the proportion of recharge water recovered as determined through solute mass balance ranges from 0 to 39 table 2 scenarios with low groundwater velocities have far higher recoverability increased groundwater velocities due to high hydraulic conductivity and or hydraulic gradients leads to more pronounced movement of the plume downstream of the mar well and makes capturing the recharge water in the dry season increasingly difficult previous studies have also shown that the opportunity to recover the recharge water from a mar well in the dry season is primarily a function of the size of the recharge water body relative to the local velocity of groundwater flow pavelic et al 2002 examination of the simulated longitudinal concentration distributions suggests that the recharge water may migrate 150 m or less within one year the analysis also suggests that the recharge of individual mar wells would lead to limited groundwater mounding ranging from 0 3 to 1 2 m as determined from an additional no mar scenario mounding would diminish with less than 20 days well before the dry season periods when groundwater pumping is needed overall modelled hydraulic and solute transport results appear to be in general agreement with the field observations 4 4 water quality water quality data for each of the mar wells and the reference wells aggregated are summarised on a seasonal basis in table 3 vietnamese drinking and irrigation water standards where they are available for specific parameters according to the socialist republic of vietnam 2015 are also given 4 4 1 tds and major ions the major ions were all well below both standards tds values for the recharge waters were most variable during the wet season ranging from 8 to 245 mg l compared to 6 144 mg l for the dry season tds values for the ambient groundwater at reference wells were consistently lower than at mar wells ranging from 5 to 22 mg l the concentrations of major inorganic parameters and tds were consistently elevated in the surface runoff during the wet season compared to the ambient groundwater at the reference wells it appears that the removal of ions takes place within the aquifer the contrasting redox conditions between the recharge and ambient waters likely triggers reactions that lead to the loss of some ions due to sorption or transformation onto aquifer surfaces the specific processes that take place are unknown previous mar studies have shown for example that elevated concentrations of bicarbonate and calcium due to high dissolved carbon dioxide in rainwater can be reduced by groundwater storage herczeg et al 2004 more thorough geochemical studies would be needed to adequately address this issue 4 4 2 ph ph of the reference wells are mildly acidic and almost always below the minimum standard value for drinking of 6 5 and in many cases below the lower standard for irrigation of 5 5 the mar wells too were below the standards during both wet and dry seasons although there are no human health consequences due to consumption of acidic water its aggressive characteristics can lead to pipe corrosion and enriched levels of dissolved metals 4 4 3 turbidity turbidity levels for the reference wells ranged from 0 1 to 17 ntu and were often above the drinking water standard of 2 ntu during the wet season turbidity values of the mar wells were generally substantially higher than the standard 1 550 ntu dry season values were lower than wet season values but still remained above the standard turbid water has no direct affect on human health but turbidity does affect the aesthetic qualities and can affect disinfection during water treatment high turbidity does not have known negative impacts for agricultural use 4 4 4 nitrate nitrate levels in all samples were all considerably below the drinking standards the highest nitrate levels detected in the mar wells was 26 mg l whereas for reference wells the highest was 6 mg l values are given as no3 concentrations of all nitrogenous compounds detected were more elevated in recharge water relative to the reference wells but not at levels of concern for drinking 4 4 5 metals levels of arsenic and copper were not of concern at both the mar and reference wells iron in contrast was regularly detected above the drinking limit of 0 3 mg l at the mar wells measured as the total concentration on filtered samples the reference wells also routinely exceeded the standard the major rhodic ferralsol soils in the area are high in iron and aluminium oxides d haeze et al 2003 and can be transported by runoff as indicated the high turbidity values in the recharge water iron is a key element for human nutrition but high levels can affect the taste and appearance of water and the standards are therefore mainly for aesthetic purposes manganese concentration at reference wells occasionally exceeded the drinking standard but less frequently than iron 4 4 6 microbial e coli levels were much higher than the drinking standards for all mar wells during the wet season values were considerably lower during the dry season but only on limited occasions were they below detection reference wells were below detection on most occasions e coli presence provides an indication of impacts from animal wastes within the runoff collection areas bacterial contamination is of short duration as e coli is attenuated outside of the host within periods of days to weeks dillon et al 2010 4 4 7 pesticides no pesticides were identified at any time in any of the mar or reference wells it can be noted that drinking water standards are available for six of the eleven compounds aldrin chlordane ddt dieldrin lindane and heptachlor and in each case the detection levels were below the standards the absence of pesticide detection in any of the mar and reference wells is welcome and perhaps not unexpected given that some of the pesticide indicators tested included persistent organic pesticides pops banned in 1992 other pops were banned more recently february 2018 by the ministry of agriculture and rural development under circular no 03 2018 tt bnnptnt monitoring of pops was considered important as they may persist for decades or continue to be used by farmers due to poor adherence to government regulations nguyen 2017 one of the banned pesticides the organophosphate insecticide diazinon was observed in the field 4 5 costs of mar the maximum and minimum capital costs were for m5 and m4 sites at around vnd 25 million usd 1100 and vnd 12 6 million usd 562 respectively table 4 capital costs for design improvements in the second year were much lower than the initial investment in the first year the o m costs show large variation between lower performing sites m1 m2 and better performing sites m3 m4 and m5 highest o m costs of vnd 56 400 usd 2 49 per m3 at the m2 site due to high rates of sedimentation that needed considerable labour for periodic cleaning the o m costs for m3 m5 were low at approximately vnd 1300 usd 0 05 per m3 the average capital cost of usd 880 vnd 19 900 is likely to be within the reach of local coffee farmers each mar farmer owns no less than two hectares of land and the average gross income from coffee was determined to be of usd 2800 ha over the 2005 09 period by amarsinghe et al 2015 farmer feedback suggests that the costs of any additional construction could be significantly lower than those incurred during the study as a simpler design that would be applied and all labour costs would be provided in kind 4 6 farmer attitudes initial consultations with farmers prior to the trial indicated that they were generally interested in mar since prior to then the notion that their wells could be utilized for recharge as well as for abstraction was unfamiliar to them some farmers requested mar be implemented at their sites others expressed concern about whether the water to be recharged would remain in the proximity of their wells and property boundaries and about the high sediment levels in runoff that could lead to clogging of the well and aquifer formation one of the reference well owners who did not consent to using his well for mar as he was considering to use the well for domestic supply in future and was concerned about the potential impacts of pesticides due to their regular use in the area however all farmers agreed that the opportunity to increase groundwater storage at the community scale could be enhanced if mar were implemented once the mar trials had been implemented each of the participating farmers knew how mar functioned including the how the sediment trap and filtration tank worked the survey of the mar well owners showed that the m1 and m2 owners considered the trial to be financed by foreign organizations and the m1 well owner even hoped some financial assistance would trickle down for the use of his well for the trial when asked if they were prepared to take responsibility for the o m of mar in the future m1 and m3 well owners were not receptive because they have access to sufficient options for irrigation water supply the m1 well owner did not think that mar could help improve groundwater storage after seeing how mar works in contrast the m2 m4 and m5 well owners were willing if financial support were provided to maintain the o m including labour costs the m2 owner also considered there was a need for scaling mar across the village because he recognized that the pilot scale may not be sufficient to bring about significant positive impacts the m1 m2 and m3 well owners were not willing to recommend mar to other farmers as direct positive benefits had yet to be observed in contrast m4 and m5 well owners would recommend the approach the focus group discussion two years into the trial reaffirmed that the perceptions of the trial were heterogeneous but for most part famers were optimistic about mar when asked whether they or other farmers have or will apply mar at other sites their response was a clear not yet since they preferred to observe the impacts of the trial more clearly and to receive guidance from the authorities m2 and m3 r2 owners noted no negative or positive effects of mar whereas the m5 r2 owner believed that groundwater levels in his well had improved due to m5 an unlikely scenario given the local groundwater flow direction a minority of reference well owners e g m5 r1 were forthcoming in revealing that they did not have sufficient knowledge to establish the effect of mar 5 discussion the results of this study have shown that the social and economic dimensions of mar are of high importance in shaping farmer attitudes and hence opportunities for future uptake in the central highlands farmer attitudes are also strongly coupled to biophysical aspects that affect the functioning and performance of mar systems the key biophysical and socioeconomic aspects are discussed below the volumes recharged during the trial ranged between approximately 50 and 500 m3 per year excluding the poorest functioning sites these volumes would be sufficient to provide one round of irrigation of between 0 11 and 1 1 ha of coffee for a plantation density of 1100 trees per hectare for improved irrigation application rates of 400 litres tree round d haeze 2022 typically coffee would require three rounds of irrigation over the course of the dry season and the average farm size in the area is around 1 1 ha viossanges et al 2019 hence individual mar systems would not meet the full irrigation water demand but can provide useful supplemental supplies for irrigation the farmer consultations show that owners of mar wells that had performed well had more optimistic views than those whose performance was low the high performing m4 owner thought that mar was a significant development that had helped enhance groundwater storage similarly the m5 owner and other well owners and community leaders noted that if all the roofs in the area were used for recharge then significant improvements in the groundwater resources of the area could be expected farmers believe that using simpler and lower cost mar systems to harvest water from roofs would encourage others in the area to apply mar the proportion of recharge water that was recovered was low with modelling results suggesting that anywhere from 0 to 39 of the water recharged would be recovered during the dry season farmers participating in mar expect that the water they recharge would be recovered surveys of farmer conducting mar in dug wells across 11 states of india suggest that they expect to recover around 30 of the water recharged but also acknowledge the collective gains made by recharging groundwater together with their neighbours krishnan et al 2009 the applicability of these results to the vietnam context is not known as it would have required more targeted farmer engagement these results indicate that mar alters the movement of water within the watershed surface runoff that would typically move quickly through the watershed is redirected to the aquifer where it is slowed down greatly giving more opportunity for the recharged water to be made available in the local area recharge water may be withdrawn from nearby wells and or from surface water courses which are strongly dependent on groundwater discharge in the dry season months viossanges et al 2019 recharging water in high rainfall years and retaining water locally provides buffering in drought years to help farmers maintain regular irrigation scheduling farmer attitudes towards mar are also shaped by the economics of mar the capital and maintenance costs associated with this study were calculated to be usd 0 6 per m3 or less this is comparable to projects in south asian countries reported by ross and hasnain 2018 soni et al 2020 assessed the volume of water recharged through individual dug wells in hardrock aquifers in rajasthan india during the 2018 monsoon to range from 2 to 176 m3 per well those values are comparable to this study the authors concluded that the economic gains provided to farmers from the additional recharge did not justify the upfront and ongoing costs cost benefit analysis of this kind consider only the agricultural production benefits and are perhaps better suited to more arid settings such as rajasthan where recharge water allows for increased cropping intensity in the more humid central highlands where perennial crops are largely grown and effectively no additional land is available for the expansion of irrigated area the main benefit of mar is in terms of improved water security owing to stabilisation of water supplies in years of high and low rainfall mar provides additional groundwater storage enabling farmers to maintain optimum watering and preserving crop yields in dry years establishing those benefits would require further information and more detailed analysis on a broader scale as to how much aquifer recharge and storage would be required to provide for this additional supply while maintaining pumping yields and avoiding excessive aquifer depletion this is an area that requires further research 6 conclusions a set of five farm scale mar pilots were established and tested in dak lak province to evaluate the potential of mar as a new water management approach for the central highlands the quantity of runoff water stored in the aquifer ranged between 5 and 530 m3 high performing pilot sites recharge sufficient water to allow for one round of irrigation for coffee over an area of up to 1 1 ha recharge performance was observed to depend on the water source rainfall amount system design and the degree of site maintenance sites using cleanest water drawn from rooves had highest performance whilst sites using highly turbid runoff water from unpaved roads had the lowest water quality sampling revealed that there was no measured parameter that presents a major concern for irrigation several parameters entering the mar wells such as total dissolved solids nitrate and turbidity were elevated compared to the reference wells but were either short lived or at levels not of major concern relative to the national water quality standards the effects of episodic recharge events on groundwater levels are small and recharge mounds decay over time scales of hours to days much of the water recharged into the aquifer was unlikely to be directly recoverable from the recharge well during the dry season due to the small size of the recharge water plume relative to the high groundwater velocities resulting from steep hydraulic gradients water is however retained within the watershed within distances of tens of metres from the source of recharge providing potential for the community to benefit from improved water security for irrigation domestic and dry season baseflow estimated costs for installing mar systems appear to be comparable to mar projects in similar contexts the capital costs are around vnd 13 25 million usd 600 1100 and annual operating costs are approximately vnd 1300 usd 0 05 per m3 for sites that perform well despite no previous exposure the participating farmers developed a sound understanding of mar and closely observed its functioning and performance some farmers particularly at sites where performance was poor were unwilling to take responsibility to operate and maintain the mar systems until the benefits are made more obvious others would like to see the trial replicated on a wider scale the trial results offer scope for farmers to directly benefit from mar however reliable quantification of those benefits relative to the costs for different scales of mar implementation are essential to instil in local farmers a stronger sense of ownership and long term commitment to mar whilst the pilot trials provide an initial proof of concept for mar the number of pilot sites and their geographic extent are limited and residual governance challenges remain a wider range of pilots across the central highlands would be of value to strengthen the case for greater mar adoption to enhance smallholder farmer resilience to growing water demands and climate

7838,study region dak lak province in the central highlands of vietnam study focus intensification of agriculture has resulted in unsustainably high levels of groundwater use in the central highlands high monsoonal rainfall provides opportunities to boost groundwater storage through managed aquifer recharge mar yet experience with mar in the region is absent in response five farm scale pilots were implemented in collaboration with local farmers whereby runoff from roofs and fields was recharged into shallow dug wells the pilots were closely monitored over three years new hydrological insights for the region mar pilots exhibited large contrasts in performance with volumes recharged ranging from 5 to 530 m3 per year pilot sites with cleaner roof runoff water performed best whilst those using more turbid water from unpaved roads performed worst water quality analyses did not identify parameters of major concern for irrigation field data and modelling indicate that the size of the recharge water plumes are small relative to the high groundwater velocities making the recharge water difficult to recover from the recharge well in this setting water is however contained locally providing potential for improved water availability within the local area farmer attitudes towards mar vary in response to the technical performance and a range of socioeconomic factors these findings may provide insights for researchers or practitioners from other regions where groundwater dependence is high but experience in mar is lacking keywords managed aquifer recharge hard rock aquifer south east asia climate resilience data availability data can be made available on request 1 introduction decades of intensification of agricultural production systems across vietnam s central highlands has greatly increased smallholder farmer wellbeing and livelihoods but also led to increased stress on water resources meyfroidt et al 2013 cheesman and bennett 2005 major crops grown in the region such as coffee pepper avocado and durian are highly dependent on irrigation during the dry season to help improve crop yields and quality d heaze 2022 amarasinghe et al 2015 groundwater supplies are a major source of irrigation across large parts of the central highlands cheesman and bennett 2005 the hardrock aquifers of the region are showing pronounced signs of stress due to shortfalls in groundwater availability from traditional shallow wells the drilling of deeper tubewells is becoming more common to ensure reliable water supplies milnes et al 2015 cheesman and bennett 2005 d haeze et al 2005 increasing groundwater use is also impacting on groundwater inputs to streams viossanges et al 2019 abundant monsoonal rainfall provides scope to enhance groundwater storage by storing

possibility of utilizing mar to help bridge water supply and demand gaps bui et al 2015 ccafs sea 2016 2030 water resources group 2017 mar is practiced in more than 60 countries to fulfil a variety of water management goals across a diverse range of settings dillon et al 2019 southeast asia lags behind other regions with cases of field implementation reported in just three countries thailand malaysia and indonesia there are no known cases of mar implementation in vietnam although feasibility studies have been conducted stefan 2014 thoa et al 2008 the extensive upland basaltic terrain of the central highlands bears similarities with the deccan trap region of western india throughout the deccan trap and other drought prone hardrock regions of peninsular india mar is undertaken through large scale state government programs these programs have evolved over decades commencing from grassroots efforts by farmers to directly recharge their dug wells using simple methods to capture pretreat and store local runoff these practices have proven effective in climate adaptation and help provide motivation for this study verma and shah 2020 the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of mar from a set of pilot trials it reports on the hydraulic water quality and socioeconomic data collected during a three year trial with the aims of establishing 1 the volumes of surface water stored and the factors that affect this 2 the transport of recharge water in the aquifer 3 the risks to groundwater quality due to recharge 4 the costs of mar and 5 the attitudes of the participating farmers 2 site description this study was conducted in krong buk district dak lak province krong buk district is situated within the dak lak plateau one of the most extensive plateaus in the central highlands the fertile red brown volcanic soils are well suited to agriculture with production of robusta coffee dominant d haeze et al 2003 2022 the climate is tropical with a monomodal rainfall regime driven by the southwest monsoon mainly falling from may to october the area is characterised by a regionally extensive basaltic aquifer system jica 2002 d haeze 2005 mk17 project team 2013 milnes et al 2015 the upper unconfined aquifer is regionally extensive and is composed of heavily weathered basalt to depths of up to 30 m with hydraulic conductivities of around 4 m day and specific yield of 0 12 viossanges et al 2019 the weathered aquifer is underlain by variably fractured hard basalt with alternating sequences of fresh basalt and thick clays productive fractures can be intersected over depth intervals ranging between 60 and 145 m below ground level the more permeable shallow aquifer provides the main supply of groundwater for the irrigation of coffee across the plateau viossanges et al 2019 milnes et al 2015 most of the water is sourced from shallow unlined dug wells that intersect much or all of the weathered aquifer profile most wells have diameters varying from 1 2 to 1 6 m and depths ranging from around 10 30 m depending on the location and thickness of the aquifer viossanges et al 2019 mk17 project team 2013 3 approach and methods 3 1 site selection sites for mar piloting were selected on more elevated areas of the landscape identified through previous geospatial investigations to be hotspots of water scarcity milnes et al 2015 shallow irrigation wells with scope for conversion to mar together with equivalent sites closeby that served as reference sites for the without mar case were identified according to the following criteria 1 irrigation well routinely exposed to dry season water shortages as verified by the well owning farmer 2 appropriate area to harvest local runoff water for recharge 3 adequate clearing in close proximity to the well for installation of infrastructure for runoff diversion and water pre treatment 4 depth to groundwater of more than 5 m at the end of the wet season to ensure sufficient latent aquifer storage capacity to accommodate groundwater level rise due to recharge 5 approval by the well owning farmer to modify the irrigation well for mar and 6 no use of the well for domestic purposes since the fitness of the water abstracted for household use needed to be confirmed through the trial initial field inspections were conducted in february march 2017 within cu ne and ea toh communes of krong buk district fig 1 in total twenty five sites were inspected and subsequently ranked according to the above criteria this procedure led to five mar sites being established referred to as m1 to m5 along with seven nearby reference sites as two sites had two reference wells identified with respect to the associated mar site e g m1 r1 the mar sites are located in two general clusters one for m1 to m3 is situated within ea krom village and a second for m4 to m5 in kmu village situated around 2 3 km west fig 1 separation distances between the mar site and their associated reference sites ranged from 70 to 210 m sites were distributed across four micro watersheds that all lie within the catchment of the krong buk river a tributary of the srepok basin that forms part of the lower mekong basin d haeze 2022 the elevation across the study area ranges from about 700 800 m amsl 3 2 design and implementation five farm scale pilots were set up to harvest surface runoff to store in the weathered basaltic aquifer ubiquitous to the area simple low cost methods that have potential to be reproduced by farmers were used existing unlined dug wells were retrofitted for recharge fig 2 rainfall runoff from areas immediately upslope of the irrigation wells was diverted and infiltrated after pretreatment to reduce suspended solid loads entering the aquifer the major sources of runoff included local fields at two sites m1 m2 and a mix of residential roof paved surfaces and fields at three sites m3 m5 table 1 fig 3 for sites m1 to m3 a flow diversion channel was required to transport water from the natural drainage line towards a 400 litre sediment trap followed by a filtration tank both of simple masonry construction for sites m4 and m5 existing concrete lined channels were used to convey water to a polyethylene plastic tank of one metre diameter readily available from local farm supply stores that was dissected in half and each half installed below ground sediment traps at these two sites were not needed a large collection area at m5 allowed two parallel filtration tanks to be installed the filtration tanks were packed with a 30 cm layer of fine gravel 5 mm below a 30 cm layer of medium sand 0 5 mm over the tank mesh sheeting was used to keep out coarse vegetation and other debris inflow and outflow pipes are 2 inch diameter or wider pvc pipe fitted with flow control valves above and below the tank a plastic elbow was added to the end of the pvc pipe to redirect water vertically downwards in the well and a nozzle endcap fitted to reduce the water s kinetic energy to minimize risk of erosion within the well pilot testing was carried out for three consecutive monsoon seasons from may 2017 to december 2019 after the first year most sites featured design enhancements to help increase the volume and efficiency of recharge based on reviews of the initial data and field inspections table 1 one of the sites m2 was discontinued after the second year due to poor performance 3 3 regulatory arrangements potential for adverse impacts stem from direct recharge of surface water runoff into aquifers as a result of mar which modifies the hydrologic cycle that operates within the micro watersheds including the pathways to control natural processes that allow potential pollutants present in recharge water to be attenuated dillon et al 2010 the primary water quality risks in the intensively used agricultural watersheds of the central highlands are likely to be derived from residues associated with inputs from agriculture washoff of sediment from fields and microbial pathogens from livestock and other fauna the ministry of natural resources and environment monre has responsibility for the protection of surface water and groundwater monre 2006 this includes responsibility for preventing depletion and degradation of water resources and licencing for abstraction the 2011 government of vietnam decree no 38 2011 nd cp makes reference to the avoidance of overexploitation and discharge of waste to water bodies but makes no provision for licencing of mar with appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks inclusive of mar entirely absent permission to undertake the trial was provided by the department of natural resources and environment donre and the department of agriculture and rural development dard in dak lak province these authorities considered the monitoring program put forward as detailed below sufficient to ensure adequate protection to groundwater resources from potential risks 3 4 monitoring and analysis mar and reference sites were monitored using procedures and protocols briefly covered below 3 4 1 mar recharge rates recharge rates were estimated at each pilot site from the combined use of rainfall groundwater level and filtration tank flow rate data twelve water depth and temperature recorders were used to monitor all mar and reference wells data was collected every five minutes within the first year of monitoring between august 2017 and january 2018 seven of the groundwater recorders failed due to water entering the units through casing failures all recorders were subsequently replaced by the manufacturer in march 2018 with an improved design and no further technical issues were observed a tipping bucket rain gauge was set up at kmu village close to the m4 m5 cluster by careful interpretation of the rainfall and groundwater level data the start and end of each mar recharge event could be identified noting that the recharge events were associated with quick groundwater level build up which later also quickly dissipated when inflows from the filtration tank to the well ceased fig 4 through comparison of groundwater levels at the mar well and the nearest reference well the water level signatures from mar derived recharge could be differentiated from other processes affecting groundwater levels e g diffuse recharge local pumping etc flow rates through the filtration tanks were monitored periodically during dry periods so as not to interfere with the recharge process flow rates through the tank were estimated by measuring the rate of decrease in tank water level after filling the tank and opening the valves to enable drainage into the well the storage characteristics of each tank was determined to convert changes in levels to volumes the volume of recharge for each recharge event was estimated by multiplying the length of each recharge event by the tank flow rate measured from the nearest time of the event the volume of recharge during each year was aggregated from event wise values the uncertainty in the estimation of the duration of the recharge event was determined to be 6 on average based on the five minute water level recordings and recharge duration information presented later 3 4 2 water quality monitoring regular water quality testing was performed during the trial during the first year each of the mar wells were sampled five times three times in the wet season and two in the dry season the reference wells were sampled only once each season as the temporal variations in water quality were anticipated to be less during the second and third years monitoring was limited to just three mar wells m1 m4 and m5 together with their reference wells due to resource constraints at least one site was selected in each of the two village clusters with an emphasis on sites that tended to show promise in the wet season a six litre bucket was suspended within each mar well directly below the entry pipe to collect the recharge water as the sites were difficult to access during wet weather conditions in the dry season samples were collected by pumping the wells continuously for at least thirty minutes to flush the well before taking a sample the sampling suite included a range of physical chemical and biological parameters the rationale for the selection of pesticide indicators took into account a our surveys of local stockists and farmers to identify pesticides sold and used in the area b discussions with local experts from government authorities c a review of relevant reference material from the literature and other online sources and d the analytical capability of the laboratory eleven pesticide indicators were selected that included four of the top ten pesticides used in 2015 by volume according to data provided by the vietnam pesticide association aldrin chlordane chlorpyrifos dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane ddd dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt diazinon dieldrin endosulfan lindane heptachlor samples were kept under refrigerated conditions and transported to the laboratories in cooler boxes packed with ice subsamples were dispatched to the iso 17025 accredited sgs laboratory in ho chi minh city for analysis subsamples for e coli were tested at the dak lak health department provincial preventative medicine center in buon ma thuot due to the need for sample receipt within twelve hours of collection 3 4 3 mar costs the economics of mar is a key factor for its acceptance ross and hasnain 2018 mar projects incur both fixed capital and variable operation and maintenance o m costs maliva 2014 both sets of costs inclusive of material and labour were itemized for each site in 2017 and 2018 only items necessary to mar system functioning were included and non essential research related costs omitted from the analysis 3 4 4 farmer attitudes attitudes are an important factor affecting the commitment of farmers to new technologies chi and yamada 2002 determining the attitudes of farmers to mar is thus a critical indicator and necessary step towards assessing the potential for successful adoption of mar beyond the pilots farmer attitudes were deduced through a process of consultation with the farmers as follows a with individual well owners during the site selection surveys prior to the trial february and march 2017 b with mar pilot well owners who were interviewed and asked to complete a likert type scale survey croasmun and ostrom 2011 that uses questionnaires to gather responses according to a predetermined rating scale e g from strongly disagree through to strongly agree june 2018 and c from a focus group discussion with four mar and six reference well owners plus a community leader towards the end of the second monsoon season november 2018 4 results 4 1 groundwater levels rainfall patterns together with observed groundwater levels for two sites one set for m1 m1 r1 and another for m4 m4 r1 are presented in fig 5 all wells show characteristic rises during each wet season due to rainfall recharge processes with levels typically peaking during august to september intense rainfall associated with typhoon activity may generate multiple peaks over the season e g a major secondary peak in november 2017 when 102 mm of rainfall was recorded due to from typhoon damrey relative to the average annual rainfall of around 1700 mm year based on rainfall records from 2001 to 2012 for four measurement stations situated within a 51 km radius of the study area annual rainfall during 2017 and 2018 were around 5 and 15 below average respectively whereas in 2019 it was about average trends in annual rainfall are reflected in the annual trends in minimum depth to groundwater level comparing both pairs of wells shows consistency in the broad trends although short term variations are substantially different the mar wells feature the distinct peaks associated with mar recharge events these are substantially more pronounced at m4 than m1 as the major recharge contribution to well recharge came from the residential roof with high runoff coefficient groundwater level mounding associated with recharge peaks dissipate within a matter of hours to days following the cessation of each recharge event as is more clearly observed in fig 4 the reference wells feature sharp declines from daily pumping for domestic supply from nearby shallow wells which are largely absent from the mar wells that were not used for domestic purposes 4 2 recharge performance cumulative recharge curves reveal substantial differences in the volumes recharged between sites within each year and at each site between years fig 6 the overall variation ranges from a minimum of 5 m3 from 24 recharge events at m1 in 2018 to a maximum of 530 m3 from 229 events at m4 in 2019 the two order of magnitude difference in recharge performance may be attributed to the following factors i inter annual rainfall variability ii system design and iii site maintenance additionally the slightly delayed start of operations and some data loss due to logger failure in the first year likely reduced the recharge quantity annual rainfall totals for the three years were 1600 1462 and 1730 mm respectively a contrast of 18 between the lowest rainfall year in 2018 and the highest in 2019 the effect of annual rainfall variability is difficult to clearly discern on a site wise basis due to the confounding influence of design and management related factors however at an aggregated level the higher average values of recharge in 2019 compared with 2018 can likely be attributed in part to the higher rainfall due to the similarities in the recharge well and pretreatment systems the main design related factor controlling recharge was the type and area of runoff collection which influenced the quantity and quality of the source water although rainfall in 2018 was lower than the previous year the design improvements made after the first year table 1 led to major improvements at m3 and m5 with modest improvements at m4 approximately in proportion with the additional roof area added declines were evident at the m1 and m2 sites where performance was poorer as detailed below highest rates of recharge were observed for sites m3 m4 and m5 where most of the runoff is derived from roofs or other paved surfaces higher runoff coefficients for roofs compared to fields generates a higher number of recharge events the average number of recharge events per season for sites m3 m4 and m5 over the three year trial period was 145 whereas for m1 and m2 it was only 38 the average event based duration of recharge for all sites was 1 4 h and varied from 1 2 h at sites m2 and m4 up to 1 6 h at sites m1 and m5 site maintenance in the first two years was limited to cleaning deposited sediment and other debris in the filtration tanks at the start and end of the season except where major issues were observed and the upper sand layer was replaced maintenance was increased in the third year to a frequency of every 1 2 months over the monsoon season it followed that filtration tank flow rates largely reflected the degree of site maintenance flow rates through the tanks varied widely across the sites fig 7 with values mostly in the range from around 5 30 m3 day in 2017 18 and increasing to 20 45 m3 day in 2019 lowest rates were associated with m2 which had much lower values often 10 m3 day or less as this site collects runoff from an unpaved road table 1 and had the most turbid water sediment removal as determined by turbidity levels before and after sedimentation and filtration treatment were in the range of 50 90 across all the sites 4 3 recoverability of recharge water 4 3 1 hydraulics the dimensions of a homogeneous cylindrical recharge water plume can be estimated and compared with the ambient groundwater velocity for an assumed saturated aquifer thickness of 15 m and specific yield of 0 12 viossanges et al 2019 the radius of the plume ranges from 0 9 to 9 7 m due to differences in the volume recharged in any year from darcy s law the distance that the recharge plume would drift over an assumed six month effective storage period ranges from 5 to 13 m across the five sites for average groundwater flow gradients between the mar and reference well pairs ranging from 0 03 to 0 07 this lateral movement expressed in relation to the plume radius gives ratio s that vary from 1 1 to 11 5 ratio s consistently in excess of 1 would suggest limited scope to directly recover the recharge water from the same well used for recharge dry season pumping occurred at around half of the mar wells two in the first year m2 and m4 and three in the second m2 m4 and m5 accessibility of other nearby wells was the reason given for not using the other mar wells as farmers have on average between two and three wells equipped for pumping reliable estimates of pumped volume at those sites were not available 4 3 2 hydrochemistry contrasts in the quality of the recharge and ambient waters for constituents such as total dissolved solids tds and nitrate no3 enables the movement of recharge water to be established hydrochemically both tds and nitrate levels were higher for the recharge water at all mar sites during the wet season except for nitrate at m4 where the predominant roof runoff recharge water was difficult to distinguish from the ambient groundwater fig 8 the elevated signatures of both parameters evident in the wet season at all mar sites are no longer evident in the dry season with values declining to those of the reference wells this suggests that recharge water migrates downstream before there is any chance of recovery during the dry season 4 3 3 numerical modelling a numerical model was developed to gain greater insight on the recharged water behaviour within the groundwater system associated with an individual mar well ten mar related scenarios were implemented that accounted for potential differences in the volumes of water recharged ambient groundwater velocity and aquifer porosity distributed and lumped scheduling of recharge and pumping events was also compared together they attempt to cover the range of potential hydrogeological and mar operating conditions that may apply to the mar pilots details on the model design and implementation are provided by pavelic et al 2019 the simulations suggest that the scope for farmers to recover recharge water from the mar well is generally low the proportion of recharge water recovered as determined through solute mass balance ranges from 0 to 39 table 2 scenarios with low groundwater velocities have far higher recoverability increased groundwater velocities due to high hydraulic conductivity and or hydraulic gradients leads to more pronounced movement of the plume downstream of the mar well and makes capturing the recharge water in the dry season increasingly difficult previous studies have also shown that the opportunity to recover the recharge water from a mar well in the dry season is primarily a function of the size of the recharge water body relative to the local velocity of groundwater flow pavelic et al 2002 examination of the simulated longitudinal concentration distributions suggests that the recharge water may migrate 150 m or less within one year the analysis also suggests that the recharge of individual mar wells would lead to limited groundwater mounding ranging from 0 3 to 1 2 m as determined from an additional no mar scenario mounding would diminish with less than 20 days well before the dry season periods when groundwater pumping is needed overall modelled hydraulic and solute transport results appear to be in general agreement with the field observations 4 4 water quality water quality data for each of the mar wells and the reference wells aggregated are summarised on a seasonal basis in table 3 vietnamese drinking and irrigation water standards where they are available for specific parameters according to the socialist republic of vietnam 2015 are also given 4 4 1 tds and major ions the major ions were all well below both standards tds values for the recharge waters were most variable during the wet season ranging from 8 to 245 mg l compared to 6 144 mg l for the dry season tds values for the ambient groundwater at reference wells were consistently lower than at mar wells ranging from 5 to 22 mg l the concentrations of major inorganic parameters and tds were consistently elevated in the surface runoff during the wet season compared to the ambient groundwater at the reference wells it appears that the removal of ions takes place within the aquifer the contrasting redox conditions between the recharge and ambient waters likely triggers reactions that lead to the loss of some ions due to sorption or transformation onto aquifer surfaces the specific processes that take place are unknown previous mar studies have shown for example that elevated concentrations of bicarbonate and calcium due to high dissolved carbon dioxide in rainwater can be reduced by groundwater storage herczeg et al 2004 more thorough geochemical studies would be needed to adequately address this issue 4 4 2 ph ph of the reference wells are mildly acidic and almost always below the minimum standard value for drinking of 6 5 and in many cases below the lower standard for irrigation of 5 5 the mar wells too were below the standards during both wet and dry seasons although there are no human health consequences due to consumption of acidic water its aggressive characteristics can lead to pipe corrosion and enriched levels of dissolved metals 4 4 3 turbidity turbidity levels for the reference wells ranged from 0 1 to 17 ntu and were often above the drinking water standard of 2 ntu during the wet season turbidity values of the mar wells were generally substantially higher than the standard 1 550 ntu dry season values were lower than wet season values but still remained above the standard turbid water has no direct affect on human health but turbidity does affect the aesthetic qualities and can affect disinfection during water treatment high turbidity does not have known negative impacts for agricultural use 4 4 4 nitrate nitrate levels in all samples were all considerably below the drinking standards the highest nitrate levels detected in the mar wells was 26 mg l whereas for reference wells the highest was 6 mg l values are given as no3 concentrations of all nitrogenous compounds detected were more elevated in recharge water relative to the reference wells but not at levels of concern for drinking 4 4 5 metals levels of arsenic and copper were not of concern at both the mar and reference wells iron in contrast was regularly detected above the drinking limit of 0 3 mg l at the mar wells measured as the total concentration on filtered samples the reference wells also routinely exceeded the standard the major rhodic ferralsol soils in the area are high in iron and aluminium oxides d haeze et al 2003 and can be transported by runoff as indicated the high turbidity values in the recharge water iron is a key element for human nutrition but high levels can affect the taste and appearance of water and the standards are therefore mainly for aesthetic purposes manganese concentration at reference wells occasionally exceeded the drinking standard but less frequently than iron 4 4 6 microbial e coli levels were much higher than the drinking standards for all mar wells during the wet season values were considerably lower during the dry season but only on limited occasions were they below detection reference wells were below detection on most occasions e coli presence provides an indication of impacts from animal wastes within the runoff collection areas bacterial contamination is of short duration as e coli is attenuated outside of the host within periods of days to weeks dillon et al 2010 4 4 7 pesticides no pesticides were identified at any time in any of the mar or reference wells it can be noted that drinking water standards are available for six of the eleven compounds aldrin chlordane ddt dieldrin lindane and heptachlor and in each case the detection levels were below the standards the absence of pesticide detection in any of the mar and reference wells is welcome and perhaps not unexpected given that some of the pesticide indicators tested included persistent organic pesticides pops banned in 1992 other pops were banned more recently february 2018 by the ministry of agriculture and rural development under circular no 03 2018 tt bnnptnt monitoring of pops was considered important as they may persist for decades or continue to be used by farmers due to poor adherence to government regulations nguyen 2017 one of the banned pesticides the organophosphate insecticide diazinon was observed in the field 4 5 costs of mar the maximum and minimum capital costs were for m5 and m4 sites at around vnd 25 million usd 1100 and vnd 12 6 million usd 562 respectively table 4 capital costs for design improvements in the second year were much lower than the initial investment in the first year the o m costs show large variation between lower performing sites m1 m2 and better performing sites m3 m4 and m5 highest o m costs of vnd 56 400 usd 2 49 per m3 at the m2 site due to high rates of sedimentation that needed considerable labour for periodic cleaning the o m costs for m3 m5 were low at approximately vnd 1300 usd 0 05 per m3 the average capital cost of usd 880 vnd 19 900 is likely to be within the reach of local coffee farmers each mar farmer owns no less than two hectares of land and the average gross income from coffee was determined to be of usd 2800 ha over the 2005 09 period by amarsinghe et al 2015 farmer feedback suggests that the costs of any additional construction could be significantly lower than those incurred during the study as a simpler design that would be applied and all labour costs would be provided in kind 4 6 farmer attitudes initial consultations with farmers prior to the trial indicated that they were generally interested in mar since prior to then the notion that their wells could be utilized for recharge as well as for abstraction was unfamiliar to them some farmers requested mar be implemented at their sites others expressed concern about whether the water to be recharged would remain in the proximity of their wells and property boundaries and about the high sediment levels in runoff that could lead to clogging of the well and aquifer formation one of the reference well owners who did not consent to using his well for mar as he was considering to use the well for domestic supply in future and was concerned about the potential impacts of pesticides due to their regular use in the area however all farmers agreed that the opportunity to increase groundwater storage at the community scale could be enhanced if mar were implemented once the mar trials had been implemented each of the participating farmers knew how mar functioned including the how the sediment trap and filtration tank worked the survey of the mar well owners showed that the m1 and m2 owners considered the trial to be financed by foreign organizations and the m1 well owner even hoped some financial assistance would trickle down for the use of his well for the trial when asked if they were prepared to take responsibility for the o m of mar in the future m1 and m3 well owners were not receptive because they have access to sufficient options for irrigation water supply the m1 well owner did not think that mar could help improve groundwater storage after seeing how mar works in contrast the m2 m4 and m5 well owners were willing if financial support were provided to maintain the o m including labour costs the m2 owner also considered there was a need for scaling mar across the village because he recognized that the pilot scale may not be sufficient to bring about significant positive impacts the m1 m2 and m3 well owners were not willing to recommend mar to other farmers as direct positive benefits had yet to be observed in contrast m4 and m5 well owners would recommend the approach the focus group discussion two years into the trial reaffirmed that the perceptions of the trial were heterogeneous but for most part famers were optimistic about mar when asked whether they or other farmers have or will apply mar at other sites their response was a clear not yet since they preferred to observe the impacts of the trial more clearly and to receive guidance from the authorities m2 and m3 r2 owners noted no negative or positive effects of mar whereas the m5 r2 owner believed that groundwater levels in his well had improved due to m5 an unlikely scenario given the local groundwater flow direction a minority of reference well owners e g m5 r1 were forthcoming in revealing that they did not have sufficient knowledge to establish the effect of mar 5 discussion the results of this study have shown that the social and economic dimensions of mar are of high importance in shaping farmer attitudes and hence opportunities for future uptake in the central highlands farmer attitudes are also strongly coupled to biophysical aspects that affect the functioning and performance of mar systems the key biophysical and socioeconomic aspects are discussed below the volumes recharged during the trial ranged between approximately 50 and 500 m3 per year excluding the poorest functioning sites these volumes would be sufficient to provide one round of irrigation of between 0 11 and 1 1 ha of coffee for a plantation density of 1100 trees per hectare for improved irrigation application rates of 400 litres tree round d haeze 2022 typically coffee would require three rounds of irrigation over the course of the dry season and the average farm size in the area is around 1 1 ha viossanges et al 2019 hence individual mar systems would not meet the full irrigation water demand but can provide useful supplemental supplies for irrigation the farmer consultations show that owners of mar wells that had performed well had more optimistic views than those whose performance was low the high performing m4 owner thought that mar was a significant development that had helped enhance groundwater storage similarly the m5 owner and other well owners and community leaders noted that if all the roofs in the area were used for recharge then significant improvements in the groundwater resources of the area could be expected farmers believe that using simpler and lower cost mar systems to harvest water from roofs would encourage others in the area to apply mar the proportion of recharge water that was recovered was low with modelling results suggesting that anywhere from 0 to 39 of the water recharged would be recovered during the dry season farmers participating in mar expect that the water they recharge would be recovered surveys of farmer conducting mar in dug wells across 11 states of india suggest that they expect to recover around 30 of the water recharged but also acknowledge the collective gains made by recharging groundwater together with their neighbours krishnan et al 2009 the applicability of these results to the vietnam context is not known as it would have required more targeted farmer engagement these results indicate that mar alters the movement of water within the watershed surface runoff that would typically move quickly through the watershed is redirected to the aquifer where it is slowed down greatly giving more opportunity for the recharged water to be made available in the local area recharge water may be withdrawn from nearby wells and or from surface water courses which are strongly dependent on groundwater discharge in the dry season months viossanges et al 2019 recharging water in high rainfall years and retaining water locally provides buffering in drought years to help farmers maintain regular irrigation scheduling farmer attitudes towards mar are also shaped by the economics of mar the capital and maintenance costs associated with this study were calculated to be usd 0 6 per m3 or less this is comparable to projects in south asian countries reported by ross and hasnain 2018 soni et al 2020 assessed the volume of water recharged through individual dug wells in hardrock aquifers in rajasthan india during the 2018 monsoon to range from 2 to 176 m3 per well those values are comparable to this study the authors concluded that the economic gains provided to farmers from the additional recharge did not justify the upfront and ongoing costs cost benefit analysis of this kind consider only the agricultural production benefits and are perhaps better suited to more arid settings such as rajasthan where recharge water allows for increased cropping intensity in the more humid central highlands where perennial crops are largely grown and effectively no additional land is available for the expansion of irrigated area the main benefit of mar is in terms of improved water security owing to stabilisation of water supplies in years of high and low rainfall mar provides additional groundwater storage enabling farmers to maintain optimum watering and preserving crop yields in dry years establishing those benefits would require further information and more detailed analysis on a broader scale as to how much aquifer recharge and storage would be required to provide for this additional supply while maintaining pumping yields and avoiding excessive aquifer depletion this is an area that requires further research 6 conclusions a set of five farm scale mar pilots were established and tested in dak lak province to evaluate the potential of mar as a new water management approach for the central highlands the quantity of runoff water stored in the aquifer ranged between 5 and 530 m3 high performing pilot sites recharge sufficient water to allow for one round of irrigation for coffee over an area of up to 1 1 ha recharge performance was observed to depend on the water source rainfall amount system design and the degree of site maintenance sites using cleanest water drawn from rooves had highest performance whilst sites using highly turbid runoff water from unpaved roads had the lowest water quality sampling revealed that there was no measured parameter that presents a major concern for irrigation several parameters entering the mar wells such as total dissolved solids nitrate and turbidity were elevated compared to the reference wells but were either short lived or at levels not of major concern relative to the national water quality standards the effects of episodic recharge events on groundwater levels are small and recharge mounds decay over time scales of hours to days much of the water recharged into the aquifer was unlikely to be directly recoverable from the recharge well during the dry season due to the small size of the recharge water plume relative to the high groundwater velocities resulting from steep hydraulic gradients water is however retained within the watershed within distances of tens of metres from the source of recharge providing potential for the community to benefit from improved water security for irrigation domestic and dry season baseflow estimated costs for installing mar systems appear to be comparable to mar projects in similar contexts the capital costs are around vnd 13 25 million usd 600 1100 and annual operating costs are approximately vnd 1300 usd 0 05 per m3 for sites that perform well despite no previous exposure the participating farmers developed a sound understanding of mar and closely observed its functioning and performance some farmers particularly at sites where performance was poor were unwilling to take responsibility to operate and maintain the mar systems until the benefits are made more obvious others would like to see the trial replicated on a wider scale the trial results offer scope for farmers to directly benefit from mar however reliable quantification of those benefits relative to the costs for different scales of mar implementation are essential to instil in local farmers a stronger sense of ownership and long term commitment to mar whilst the pilot trials provide an initial proof of concept for mar the number of pilot sites and their geographic extent are limited and residual governance challenges remain a wider range of pilots across the central highlands would be of value to strengthen the case for greater mar adoption to enhance smallholder farmer resilience to growing water demands and climate

7839,study region a flood study was performed in the ephemeral ugab river in the arid north western part of namibia the headwaters of the river lie on the higher namibian plateau where most floods are generated and propagate west through the namib desert to the atlantic ocean study focus estimation of a 1 annual exceedance probability aep flood is required for upgrading of road infrastructure in compliance with revised road standards the existing ugab river bridge needs to accommodate the 1 flood or be replaced at a high cost from hydraulic modelling it was determined that the bridge can accommodate a 2000 m3s 1 flood the regional maximum flood model estimates the 1 flood at 3600 m3s 1 while a flood frequency analysis ffa based on short term systematic data predicts the flood at 550 m3s 1 this inconsistency needed to be resolved incorporation of palaeoflood discharges 14 floods over the last 1260 years into the ffa produced a 1 flood of 820 m3s 1 indicating that the existing bridge has sufficient flood capacity new hydrological insights for the region this study shows that palaeoflood hydrology improves conventional hydrological methods in dryland regions providing long term registers for reliable estimation of ffa this is especially applicable to regions with complex hydrology or with scarce gauged discharges or where data is simply unavailable graphical abstract ga1 keywords palaeoflood hydrology ephemeral rivers scarce data hydraulics infrastructure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction africa lags behind the rest of the world in terms of road infrastructure development although significant efforts have been made in recent years to stimulate the growth of regional transport networks oecd acet 2020 in a study of road transport quality indices buys et al 2010 with only 13 of its roads paved namibia ranks 11 out of 42 sub saharan countries recent efforts in road network development involve upgrading of existing infrastructure e g bridges culverts the engineering design of these infrastructure relies on probabilistic analysis of flood data for gauged catchments institute of hydrology 1999 or deterministic approaches typically based on the design storm for ungauged basins chow et al 1988 in dryland regions the scarcity of rainfall and discharge gauge stations as well as the immense spatial and temporal variability of extreme events complicates the implementation of these conventional engineering procedures for instance in namibia ephemeral rivers complicate the effectiveness of a national water resource monitoring system it is challenging to calibrate water level recorders without water flows and difficult to maintain and they tend to malfunction especially during extreme floods jacobsen et al 1995 this results in limited data this becomes challenging adding a large variability of flood peaks and with frequent no flow years zaman et al 2012 metzger et al 2020 similarly deterministic approaches assume that return period of concurrent rainfall and peak discharge are the same therefore the design flood of a given recurrence interval can be estimated from rainfall runoff modelling of a single rainfall duration event houghton carr 1999 these premises are uncertain in large catchments of dryland regions since peak discharges and flood hydrographs are highly dependent on spatio temporal distribution of the rainfall emmanuel et al 2017 initial soil moisture conditions pathiraja et al 2012 and spatial attributes of the soil hydrological processes beven 2000 2001 another major limitation of these standard approaches is related to the problem of available flood peak datasets representative of flood behaviour at the site of the infrastructure this issue is exacerbated in dryland regions where flood hydrographs are often attenuated downstream in terms of peak discharge duration and volume due to transmission losses into local alluvial aquifers dahan et al 2008 morin et al 2009 grodek et al 2020 therefore there is a need for hydrological reasoning in the flood frequency estimation procedure merz and blöschl 2008a combining the effective use of flood data with hydrological and statistical judgment institute of hydrology 1999 as part of this hydrological reasoning merz and blöschl 2008a suggest expanding flood information into three types i e i temporal flood data collection to the period before or after the discharge observations ii spatial information based on regional analysis and iii causal information expansion analysis based on better understanding of flood generating and hydrograph propagation in the catchment of interest in the case of type i where systematic flood records are not available or too short to derive reliable results from the hydrological data can be supplemented with records of extreme floods obtained by using palaeoflood hydrology and records of historical floods derived from written chronicles or direct observation benito et al 2004 palaeoflood hydrology investigates physical evidence of large floods over long time periods kochel and baker 1982 the basic hypothesis in the statistical modelling of palaeoflood information is that a certain threshold of water level exists and that over a specified time interval all exceedances of this level have been recorded in the form of geological evidence left along the river channels such as sediment deposits in hyper arid regions such as the desert of namibia these sediment deposits also known as slackwater flood deposits remain well preserved in stratigraphic sequences as stage indicators of floods grodek et al 2013 greenbaum et al 2014 cloete et al 2018 regional flood frequency analysis dimensionless frequency curves with a regional analogous behaviour to at site frequency curve in dryland regions is found to be heavier tailed zaman et al 2012 and their regression models result in a poorer performance than in the temperate regional models smith et al 2014 as a result of the high spatially and heterogeneous hydrology metzger et al 2020 still regional flood data have been used in namibia to define the upper bound to envelope curve flood magnitudes for infrastructure design kovács 1988 cloete et al 2014 the general aim of this paper is to combine the effective use of catchment base flood registers in conjunction with on site flood inferred information applied to a practical case of planning decisions in relation to a bridge design crossing the ugab river in namibia the specific aims are to 1 extend the record of the large floods by reconstructing palaeoflood stages and chronologies and estimating their magnitudes and frequency 2 provide information on the single largest historical flood at the bridge from the field evidence to link the on site flood discharges with gauged floods within the catchment 3 execute the flood frequency analysis based on gauged floods and palaeoflood data in conjunction with non statistically inferred data that supports hydrological reasoning for better design and planning decisions 2 the case study and its environment proposed upgrading of the mr 76 road route c35 on google maps from a gravel road to asphalt surfaced standards requires that the annual flood risk for overtopping of bridges such as the ugab river bridge be reduced from 2 to 1 drainage manual 2014 the mr 76 between the towns of uis and khorixas north western namibia is a major rout linking the port of walvis bay with the north of namibia and zambia the existing bridge constructed in the early 1960 s is 75 m long and the deck is elevated about six metres above the riverbed it has a flood discharge capacity of 2000 m3s 1 without overtopping the catchment area upstream of the bridge is relatively large at 21 400 km2 if the existing bridge could accommodate the 1 flood without overtopping a new bridge would not be required which will bring about a significant cost saving to the proposed road upgrading based on the estimated flood capacity the 1 flood therefore had to be less than 2000 m3s 1 the ugab river heads on the western highlands of the namibia central plateau and drains west down the western escarpment across the central namib desert to the atlantic ocean fig 1 the landscape in the upper eastern basin is relatively flat and incised into the underlying basement bedrock along the middle lower reaches the total basin area is 29 360 km2 strohbach 2008 and 450 km long the average slope is 0 3 the climate varies from semiarid in the high plateau headwaters in the east 1000 m above sea level masl with mean annual rainfall of 250 530 mm down to 10 mm along the hyperarid coastal belt the dominant vegetation on the ugab river catchment consists of mainly three biomes acacia tree and shrub savannah in the upper catchment nama karoo biome of scattered shrubs and grass in the middle stream with the sparse grass of the namib desert flora in the downstream part of the river jacobsen et al 1995 shikangala and mapani 2021 floods are mostly generated on the higher and wetter headwater rainfall is generated by convective storms during october to april austral summer the intense orographic rainfall leading to flooding is a result of warm moist air from the north east rising over the high elevated areas all the major rain and floods events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during summer months january to march 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric data the ugab bridge is located between two flow gauging stations which are operated by the namibia department of water affairs dwa the upper station operated since 1967 at a weir at vingerklip coordinates 20 24 50 s 15 28 16 e altitude 920 masl and the coastal station at ugab slab since 1977 coordinates 21 05 21 s 13 48 08 e altitude 80 masl fig 1 the river length upstream of vingerklip weir is 170 km and the catchment area is 14 200 km2 the river length upstream of ugab slab gauging station is 401 km and catchment area of 28 900 km2 as in many remote desert areas the data is limited partially reliable and needs to be treated with caution however the highest recorded peak discharge measured at vingerklip weir was 417 m3s 1 which dropped down to 258 m3s 1 at ugab slab station 231 km downstream february 1985 the drop in peak discharge between the stations is mainly a result of the peak flow attenuation along its desert route as flows fill up the shallow local aquifers and as flood water is detained in tributary channels and on flood plains flash floods with short duration and low peak discharge which occur on the upper section of the river never reach the downstream station at ugab slab 3 2 bernoulli approach at the bridge the mr76 bridge over the ugab river was constructed in the 1960 s and has been exposed to the same flood sequence as the two flow gauging stations and the largest recorded flood have left marks on the concrete bridge piers these can be converted to velocity by applying bernoulli s energy equation this approach was used to verify progression of the largest flood peak from vingerklip weir to the ugab bridge typical to floods in arid regions the water has a high silt clay content these particles penetrate the porous concrete surface of the bridge piers and leave a stain particularly at the flood peak where the water level lingers longer than the rising and receding legs of the hydrograph fig 2 since large floods in the ugab river are so rare the stains have remained visible for decades the bernoulli approach utilises the difference in dynamic and static pressure measured against a bridge pier converting it to velocity this velocity multiplied by the area of discharge and an appropriate discharge coefficient produces a

the rmf method kovács regional maximum flood rmf is an empirically established upper limit of flood peaks that can be reasonably expected at any site in southern africa based on maximum flood peaks recorded since 1856 at more than 500 sites kovács 1988 the relative flood peak magnitude is expressed by the francou rodier regional coefficient k the rmf peak can be instantly calculated if the geographic position of the site and its effective catchment area are known kovács also introduced fractions of the rmf to estimate the n year flood applying the fractions 0 65 0 575 and 0 50 to the rmf produced the 200 100 and 50 year flood peaks respectively 3 5 quantitative palaeoflood methods palaeoflood hydrology is a reconstruction of the magnitude and frequency of recent past and ancient floods on the bases of sedimentary evidence left by extreme floods baker 2008 high water marks hwm and palaeostage indicators psis high water marks include mud silt seed lines and flotsam e g fine organic debris grass woody debris that closely mark peak flood stage this type of evidence typically only persists for weeks months in humid climates and decades in semi arid arid climates williams and costa 1988 in contrast palaeostage indicators provide longer lasting evidence of peak flow stages and typically consist of fine textured flood sediment slackwater flood deposits gravel and boulder bars silt lines erosion features baker and kochel 1988 webb and jarrett 2002 and botanical evidence such as scars and other damage such as bent stems on riparian trees the evidence can persist for centuries to millennia depending on the environment standard methodological tasks in this palaeoflood study include benito et al 2020 i preliminary inventory of potential sites using aerial photographs ii field visits and exploration with emphasis on identification of sedimentary evidence of palaeofloods iii geomorphological and stratigraphical description with emphasis on identifying discrete flood units iv sample collection for age dating radiocarbon and luminescence dating v topographic surveys of valley river geometry and flood sites elevation vi hydraulic modelling and discharge estimation vii comparison with available historical observed and gauge record data and viii flood frequency analysis 3 6 optically stimulated luminescence dating dating of sedimentary flood units and intervening deposits is a key task supporting flood statistical analysis a variety of dating methods are available but the most commonly used are radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence osl dating for osl sand samples were collected in the field using light tight pvc cylinders from which quartz particles with grain size of 88 125 µm were extracted from the bulk sediment samples using routine laboratory procedures stavi et al 2021 briefly the samples were wet sieved to the selected grain size carbonates were dissolved by 8 hcl heavy minerals were removed by magnetic separation and feldspars was dissolved and quartz etched with 40 hf for 40 min followed by soaking in 16 hcl to dissolve any fluorides which may have precipitated equivalent dose de was measured on 1 2 mm aliquots 16 42 aliquots per sample using a modified single aliquot regenerative sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 and either a refurbished risø da 12 or a da 20 tl osl reader equipped with calibrated 90 sr β sources quartz stimulation was carried out with blue led and detection was through 7 5 mm u 340 filters the average de and errors were calculated using the central age model cam after removing distinct outliers dose rates were calculated from the concentrations of the radioactive elements k u and th measured on a subset of sediment sample by icp ms u th or icp aes k moisture contents were estimated at 5 2 and the cosmic dose was estimated from current burial depths 3 7 radiocarbon flood chronology was determined using radiocarbon the accelerator mass spectrometry ams radiocarbon dating was carried out by beta analytic radiocarbon dates are quoted in the text as the 2σ calibrated age range 95 radiocarbon ages were calibrated to calendar ages by oxcal 4 3 software ramsey 2001 based on hogg et al 2020 calibration data set shcal20 3 8 hydraulic modelling applying the energy based inverse hydraulic modeling on discrete palaeostage indicators psi allows indirect determination of palaeoflood discharges baker 2008 discharge estimation by hydraulic modelling was carried out using the step backwater method the most commonly utilised method in palaeoflood hydrology o connor et al 1986 webb and jarrett 2002 computations were run using the hec ras 4 1 one dimensional flow model hydrologic engineering center 2010 a topographic survey of the entire river reach at both the upstream and downstream sites was performed using drone photogrammetry with ground control points vertical variance measured over the ground control points was 11 mm over several kilometres which indicates a high level of accuracy cross sections were generated from the survey data these surveys were tied in with flood deposit elevations at each cross section signs of upper bound flood marks were also surveyed flood evidence from several sites along a river reach assist in adjusting the friction coefficients the manning s coefficients for the main channel was estimated at n 0 033 and along the riverbanks at n 0 037 3 9 flood frequency analysis flood frequency analysis ffa was carried out on the annual flood series for the period 1968 2009 and the non systematic record based on palaeoflood discharge estimates the daily average discharges over the period 1968 2009 were adjusted from vingerklip weir to reflect peak discharges at the ugab bridge using the square root method the frequency analysis was performed using the afins software botero and francés 2010 in statistical analysis stream flow monitoring data is considered systematic information whereas flood observations reported as having occurred above some thresholds are known as censored data sets leese 1973 most palaeoflood information is considered data censored above a perception threshold lb or between ranges db of discharges fig 3 perception thresholds are stages that reflect the range of flows that would have been recorded had they occurred for any given year over a specified time span england jr et al 2019 the analysis assumes that the number of k observations exceeding a perception threshold arbitrary level or discharge xh in m years is known similar to partial duration series a difference with gauged partial duration series data is that the exact peak flow value for a palaeoflood above threshold xh may not be known concerning the floods below xh their exact values are not known but at least it is known they were smaller than xh fig 3 a set of probability distribution functions was fitted to the flood data series namely the gumbel g generalised extreme value gev two component extreme value tcev and exponential distribution the parameters set for these statistical functions have been estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation mle method stedinger and cohn 1986 the tcev distribution rossi et al 1984 was found to best fit the data since it provides a good representation of two flood populations ordinary e g local storms and extraordinary floods e g mesoscale convective systems 4 estimating the 1 aep flood from gauged data sets conventional methods in this section the main results from conventional approaches to determine the 1 flood discharge for infrastructure design are presented these approaches see sections 4 1 to 4 3 are based on 1 statistical analysis from available flow gauging station data and transpose values to the ugab bridge square root method 2 hydraulic calculations using silt lines marks left by recent floods on the bridge piers and 3 regional maximum flood peak based discharge catchment area relationships 4 1 probabilistic approach a probabilistic analysis of the hydrometric data table 1 is the appropriate first step however the data have no flow years which pose a problem the probability of a zero flow floodpeaks an approach in dealing with zero s is to perform a probability distribution by excluding the no flow years from a dataset fischer 2012 hence reducing the number of observations ntotal nzero thereafter apply the fraction of non zero years over the total dataset to the probability distribution e g the product of p non zero and the fraction ntotal nzero ntotal this reduces the probability of occurrence of floods by creating a shift in the time scale which reduces the flood peak for the recurrence intervals for example the gumbel 1 exceedance probability flood at ugab slab excluding the no flow years is 278 m3s 1 and after adjustment for the no flow years the flood peak reduces to 254 m3s 1 the distribution of discharge rates at vingerklip and ugab slab stations including the adjustment for no flow years are indicated in table 2 the vingerklip probability discharges were transposed to the ugab bridge using the square root method eq 2 table 2 the transposed 1 flood discharge at the ugab bridge is in the range of 490 500 m3s 1 the largest flood at vingerklip weir the 1985 flood with a discharge of 417 m3s 1 provided a transposed value of 512 m3s 1 at the ugab bridge on site flood mark evidence combined with hydraulic calculations may be used to support the values obtained from the transposition 4 2 bridge hydraulic approach from measurements at the bridge pier the difference in elevation of the dynamic and static pressure left by floodmarks δh provides the energy head eq 1 for the upper flood marks δh 0 45 m the calculated point velocity is 3 0 ms 1 for an average flow depth of 3 6 m and an effective width of 70 m the discharge area is 252 m2 for a discharge coefficient 0 64 cloete 2004 the discharge is 480 m3s 1 this can be associated with the 1985 flood the highest flood recorded at vingerklip weir estimated at 512 m3s 1 by the transposed discharge from the vingerklip station the similar discharge value estimated using the hydraulic approach at the bridge confirms the result obtained from transposing the vingerklip weir data for the lower flood marks δh 0 21 m the velocity is 2 0 ms 1 and for the average flow depth of 1 4 m and discharge coefficient of 0 64 the discharge rate is estimated at 130 m3s 1 this flood peak can be associated with either the 1997 or the 2008 2009 floods 4 3 the rmf model 1 flood the rmf model was also applied to estimate the 1 probability flood at the bridge the effective catchment area upstream of the ugab bridge is 21 400 km2 and the regional rmf coefficient k 4 kovács 1988 this produces a regional maximum flood peak of 6300 m3s 1 by converting this maximum floodpeak to a 1 probability flood as discussed in section 3 4 the discharge rate is estimated to be approximately 3500 m3s 1 the rmf method assumes a homogeneous rainfall runoff response for the selected k region the model however appears to significantly overestimate the 1 probability flood peak when compared to the probabilistic model this is likely due to sparse run off data for the region during the model construction 5 palaeoflood hydrology 5 1 field data collection the field work for the palaeoflood study was conducted at two sites with preserved sedimentary evidence 1 upstream ugab reach us 17 km upstream from the bridge and 2 downstream ugab reach ds located 3 km downstream from the bridge fig 4 the palaeoflood evidence was mainly identified at slackwater depositional environments channel widening alcoves in bedrock walls and back flooded tributary mouths the palaeoflood sites were chosen within bedrock controlled section of the river where channel geometry is expected to remain stable over time which is critical to produce robust discharge estimations from hydraulic modelling the fieldwork entailed identification of flood evidence of water levels palaeostage reached or exceeded during large floods with an emphasis on sedimentary evidence slackwater flood deposits swds baker and kochel 1988 baker et al 2002 a detailed stratigraphy with emphasis on contacts between flood beds was performed in fifteen stratigraphic profiles individual flood units were identified through a variety of sedimentological indicators baker 1987 benito et al 2003 namely the identification of clay layers at the top of a unit erosion surfaces bioturbation indicating the exposure of a sedimentary surface angular clast layers where slope materials were deposited between floods in addition to changes in sediment color apart from identifying individual flood units sedimentary flow structures were also described to elucidate any changing dynamics during a particular flood and or infer flow velocities that could improve discharge estimation benito et al 2003 multiple stratigraphic diagrams were described at each studied reach showing the identified flood layers as well as the colluvial and aeolian beds marking non flooding times with subaerial exposure in the case of luminescence dating sediment samples were taken in pvc pipes to avoid sun light exposition organic samples charcoal seeds and wood were collected for radiocarbon determination 5 2 stratigraphy and chronology of upstream ugab site at the upstream ugab site us the catchment area is 20 700 km2 the studied reach covers a length of 1 4 km with an average channel bottom width of 30 m fig 5a the river channel is entrenched on bedrock with a shallow alluvium the right hand side of the valley when facing downstream shows a gentle topography covered by flood sediments and old gravelly and boulder deposits whereas the left hand side consist of a vertical cliff with accumulation of large rock falls and debris flow from small gullies fig 6a four slackwater deposit profiles swd were described together with two prominent large woody debris lines formed by large tree logs at high elevation fig 6b the highest profile us 50 fig 7 is a 75 cm thick fine sand sediment with current ripples and wavy lamination that closely matches in elevation with a tree log line dated at current era ce 1130 1220 with an associated discharge of 1015 m3s 1 this flood bed is also represented in the upper flood bed of profile us 51 that comprises six flood beds five predating an osl age 3390 240 figs 6c and 7 in a flood bench on the left side of the valley profile us 53 figs 6d and 7 comprises at least eleven flood beds deposited over the last 250 years with discharge range 250 665 m3s 1 a woody debris tree log at the sector where the flood bench wedges out to the slope was radiocarbon dated at ce 1870 1950 matching with a discharge of 675 m3s 1 the profile us 54 fig 6e is located in a back flooded tributary stream entering the canyon from the right hand side in the tributary a flood deposit bench sediment can be traced 100 m upstream of the tributary containing at least five flood beds with an associated discharge of 475 m3s 1 post dating an osl date of ce 1610 1680 5 3 stratigraphy and chronology of downstream ugab site the downstream ugab reach ds covers a length of 2500 m with an average stream bed width of 35 m fig 5b the channel bed is entrenched on bedrock although the channel bottom is covered by alluvial fine sand five profiles of slackwater flood deposits were described along the reach the most complete ds 10 is located at the right hand side of the valley formed by a flood sediment bench deposited by back flooded effect due to a bedrock channel constriction fig 8a a trench next to the valley side exposes a 1 7 m thick deposited formed by at least seven flood beds intercalated by fine gravel slope deposits figs 8b and 9 the highest flood deposits are associated with estimated minimum discharge of 930 m3s 1 whereas the bottom flood bed was deposited by a discharge exceeding 600 m3s 1 the first and fifth flood units were osl dated at ce 720 850 and ce 1020 1120 respectively fig 9 about 200 m downstream profile ds 13 is located at a flood sediment bench within a tributary stream entering the canyon from the left hand side fig 5b the bench is 1 3 m thick formed by at least five flood beds with erosive contacts and eventually intercalated slope wash material fig 9 the basal flood bed was osl dated at ce 800 910 indicating a similar time framework to profile ds10 and the second higher flood bed was dated at ce 1490 1540 this sequence contains depositional evidence of the largest floods in this reach over the last millennium with a minimum discharge of 1130 m3s 1 the profiles ds 15 and ds 16 are located at an expansion reach at a margin of a high flow chute channel fig 5b the highest flood sediments are forming distinct small benches that wedges out to the slope reaching a flood stage with a minimum discharge of 850 m3s 1 with related lines of woody debris tree logs one of them radiocarbon dated at ce 1790 1950 fig 8c further downstream profile ds 14 figs 8d and 9 located at a tributary stream contains at least two flood beds the lower dated at ce 1580 1620 with a minimum discharge estimation of 1050 m3s 1 5 4 palaeoflood and gauged flood data composition as expected in this arid region with little bioturbation evidence of floods up to 1260 years old are well preserved evidence was also obtained from tree log lines defining high water marks the oldest and highest was emplaced at ce 1130 the composited and better palaeoflood evidence is from the downstream site with at least 14 palaeofloods since ce 750 the largest flood reaches a minimum discharge of 1130 m3s 1 in the stratigraphy the sediments of some flood units were dated by optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating see tables 4 and 5 the undated flood units were assigned an interpolated age at regular intervals between dated flood sediments table 6 the sediments are located along flood benches rock shelters and upstream tributary valleys each stratigraphic site comprises an individual record of successive floods built by vertical accretion similar to the floodplain deposition on an alluvial river this vertical accretion by deposition of new flood layer means that progressively higher discharges are required to deposit a new flood layer over time this phenomenon is named as self censuring flood stack cf house et al 2002 moreover as the flood bed stack height increases it is inundated less frequently which results in a larger time gap to deposit the subsequent flood unit hence note that initially floods exceeding 600 m3s 1 occurred at intervals of 70 years but as the threshold of discharge increased the time interval between floods increased therefore floods exceeding 800 m3s 1 occurred every 150 years the largest flood on record recorded as high water marks by a tree log at the upstream ugab site reaching a discharge of 1130 m3s 1 table 6 the statistical analysis using non standard data of flood magnitude and timing e g palaeofloods and historical isolated observations requires a temporal organisation of data based on perception thresholds see benito et al 2020 the combined palaeoflood data is organised on six perception thresholds related to the elevation of stratigraphic sites while the applicable period of each threshold is the period for which the site is expected to record all floods above that height table 7 fig 10a therefore floods with smaller discharge than the required threshold values of deposition xh are not deposited according to the elevation of the flood benches table 7 shows the threshold of discharge and timing required for deposition of flood units in order to perform a flood frequency analysis the vingerklip weir data was transposed to the ugab bridge site using the square root method the 1985 floodpeak transposed from vingerklip weir to the bridge compares well with the flood peak generated from the bridge flood marks the interest of this study however lies in the upper tail of the data which was provided by the palaeoflood data which is site specific to the bridge site in so doing a probabilistic analysis was executed at the bridge site utilising the transposed systematic data in conjunction with the palaeoflood data the transposed flood peak data is indicated in table 3 the two component extreme value tcev gumbel g generalised extreme value gev and exponential distribution functions were applied to both systematic plus palaeoflood data and to only systematic data the distribution of discharge values associated with different recurrence intervals ri are shown in table 8 the best performance was obtained by the two component extreme value tcev and generalised extreme value gev with a good visual matching of the distribution curves to the flood plotting positions for the low and high discharge values in addition the statistical results are similar in both distribution functions up to the 1 flood recurrence intervals in both cases the 1 flood was ca 825 m3s 1 for higher flood probabilities the two component extreme value tcev distribution provided the more realistic values with associated discharges lower than the gev distribution only one flood over the last 1260 years reached a discharge of 1130 m3s 1 the two large historical floods that occurred in the ugab river namely the 1933 and 1953 may be related to two high tree log lines observed in the study sites with an associated discharge of ca 800 m3s 1 whereas a lower tree log line it would be likely related to the 1963 flood with an estimated discharge of ca 600 m3s 1 the incorporation of the palaeoflood data into the ffa resulted in higher discharge values for a given flood probability than those obtained using only the systematic record table 8 major differences are found towards the lowest probabilities for example the 0 2 annual probability flood of the combined historical and natural systematic records is 1250 m3s 1 whereas with the systematic period it was 685 m3s 1 6 discussion 6 1 hydrological reasoning in flood frequency estimation for infrastructure design civil infrastructure such as roadways bridges or dams requires knowledge of flood risk and recurrence probability to assist in the infrastructure design stedinger et al 1993 the investment and risk is proportionate to the societal benefits and the potential damage in case of failure dams can have a lifespan of 100 200 years and national roads up to 50 years the design flood quantification typically relies on the standard approach of frequency analysis klemeš 1993 this procedure has evolved in many ways including regional frequency analysis to solve the estimation problems related to the lack of sufficient data to produce reliable extrapolations to large return periods merz and blöschl 2008a stedinger and griffins 2008 dryland regions typically show a complex hydrology with spatial variation in rainfall intensity and duration requiring more local information to guide the designer on estimating the flood peak and associated societal risk a global scale analysis of regional flood frequency analysis shows that arid regions exhibit higher percentage errors in the regression models than those of temperate or tropical regions smith et al 2014 in general arid regions show much steeper flood frequency growth curve than humid regions zaman et al 2012 partially a consequence of the large variability of flood peak discharges with many years with zero or very low maximum discharge metzger et al 2020 for instance 20 of annual maximum discharges of the available ugab river gauge record 42 years are below 10 m3s 1 producing practical problems for the parameter estimation of the distribution function the expansion of the information beyond the flood sample at the river reach or point of interest may involve spatial causal and temporal expansion merz and blöschl 2008b first in our case spatial expansion by the rmf method assuming rainfall runoff homogenous contribution significantly overestimates the 1 flood compared to the probabilistic model secondly causal information analysis in arid regions is often difficult to address as it involves to derivate flood frequency from flow data that usually is not available at the required scale therefore temporal expansion of flood records from indirect flood evidence either palaeoflood or historical registers should be considered a good practice to assist with infrastructure design the case study demonstrates that palaeoflood evidence provides stage information of extreme floods going back centuries whose physical preservation is exceptional in arid environments due to the lack of vegetation cover disturbing the flood sediments management of flood risk should be continually adapted in response to new knowledge merz and blöschl 2008a although palaeoflood studies are seldom used on infrastructure design currently there is a great potential for including palaeoflood information as a standard procedure to expand the temporal record of exceptional floods st george et al 2020 strategies infrastructure and operational practice have capacity for modification based on such new information sayers et al 2013 and or catchment changes jongman 2018 the development of new statistical tools that allow the inclusion of very large floods from palaeoflood reconstructions improves the estimation of the upper tail of the distribution function and provides a new framework towards a standard application of palaeoflood hydrology in design e g us bulletin 17 c england et al 2019 at a time when infrastructure is expanding to remote dryland regions of africa buys et al 2010 oecd acet 2020 quantitative data on very large floods that occurred over a centennial time scale enables flood risk managers to respond to reality minimizing damages in a purposeful and planned way 6 2 temporal flood history expansion from palaeoflood evidence southern africa has a number of regions where a lack of hydrological data hampers the ability to make informed decisions about flood hazards and to effectively manage flood risks this palaeoflood study resulted in valuable data to estimate the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods at specific sites in the catchment in particular the ugab river contains abundant sedimentary evidence of ancient floods deposited mainly at tributary mouths and expansion reaches and locally overlying high alluvial surfaces the dry environmental conditions of the region favour the preservation identification and persistence of these fine textured flood sediments and the contacts between flood units the atmospheric conditions leading to extreme flooding are related to further south than normal incursions of the semi permanent angola low pressure cell and moisture advected from the indian ocean or the african tropics henschel et al 2005 grodek et al 2013 the abnormal moisture transport toward central and southern namibia produces higher than average seasonal rain that may even penetrate the namib desert and cause regional flooding this widespread flood response should also be reflected by the flood stratigraphy with a similar temporal framework and number of flood units the most complete palaeoflood stratigraphy is found on tributary mouths and upstream of tributary valleys being back flooded during high flood stages the composited palaeoflood evidence mainly based on the stratigraphy of the downstream site shows 14 palaeoflood events since ce 750 the undated flood units were assigned an interpolated age at regular intervals between dated flood sediments initially floods exceeding 600 m3s 1 occurred at intervals of 70 years but as the threshold of discharge increased the time interval between floods increased therefore floods exceeding 800 m3s 1 occurred approximately every 150 years the largest flood on record recorded as high water marks by a tree log at the upper ugab site reached a discharge rate of 1130 m3s 1 6 3 gain on flood frequency estimation at ugab river bridge the highest flood marks on the bridge 1985 flood reveal a peak discharge of 480 m3s 1 based on bernoulli s theorem this fits the result of the square root method of 512 m3s 1 transposing the vingerklip weir peak discharge to the bridge these results provide data for the lower end of the probability distribution while the palaeoflood hydrology provides the data for the upper tail flow records from the ugab slab weir were not included in projecting discharge at the bridge since evidence proves that there is significant attenuation particularly downstream of the bridge because of high water losses to the streambed flood peak data generated through the rmf model was not included in the analyses it is proved that the assumption of regional homogeneous parameters is not the case as the channel morphology and rainfall runoff behaviour is not uniform along the transition from the semi arid area toward extremely arid area grodek et al 2013 greenbaum et al 2014 in the future the results of the palaeoflood study may upgrade the rmf model to reflect the attenuation of flood peaks through the extreme arid namib desert coastal belt 7 conclusions flood risk estimation improves with the length and quality of hydrological data which are relatively sparse in namibia in the case of the ugab river gauging records have been found incomplete and limited to about 45 years therefore the largest and rarest floods are potentially underrepresented and thus the distribution of all magnitudes of floods through time is poorly constrained this situation complicates decisions related to flood hazard at the uis khorixas road bridge over the ugab river to increase the hydrological data records palaeoflood studies were performed at two sites 17 km upstream of the ugab bridge and 3 km downstream the composited palaeoflood evidence was collected at the downstream site showing 14 palaeofloods since ce 750 as expected in this arid region with little bioturbation the stratigraphic evidence of floods is well preserved evidence was also obtained from tree log lines defining high water marks the oldest and highest was emplaced at ce 1600 reaching a minimum discharge rate of 1130 m3s 1 the calculated 1 probability flood for the bridge gev distribution is 573 m3s 1 based on only the systematic data and 842 m3s 1 when combining the palaeoflood and the systematic data based on the palaeoflood evidence the existing bridge over the ugab river can accommodate the 1 flood and the maximum palaeoflood record without overtopping therefore upgrading of the road will not require demolishing and replacement of the existing bridge credit authorship contribution

7839,study region a flood study was performed in the ephemeral ugab river in the arid north western part of namibia the headwaters of the river lie on the higher namibian plateau where most floods are generated and propagate west through the namib desert to the atlantic ocean study focus estimation of a 1 annual exceedance probability aep flood is required for upgrading of road infrastructure in compliance with revised road standards the existing ugab river bridge needs to accommodate the 1 flood or be replaced at a high cost from hydraulic modelling it was determined that the bridge can accommodate a 2000 m3s 1 flood the regional maximum flood model estimates the 1 flood at 3600 m3s 1 while a flood frequency analysis ffa based on short term systematic data predicts the flood at 550 m3s 1 this inconsistency needed to be resolved incorporation of palaeoflood discharges 14 floods over the last 1260 years into the ffa produced a 1 flood of 820 m3s 1 indicating that the existing bridge has sufficient flood capacity new hydrological insights for the region this study shows that palaeoflood hydrology improves conventional hydrological methods in dryland regions providing long term registers for reliable estimation of ffa this is especially applicable to regions with complex hydrology or with scarce gauged discharges or where data is simply unavailable graphical abstract ga1 keywords palaeoflood hydrology ephemeral rivers scarce data hydraulics infrastructure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction africa lags behind the rest of the world in terms of road infrastructure development although significant efforts have been made in recent years to stimulate the growth of regional transport networks oecd acet 2020 in a study of road transport quality indices buys et al 2010 with only 13 of its roads paved namibia ranks 11 out of 42 sub saharan countries recent efforts in road network development involve upgrading of existing infrastructure e g bridges culverts the engineering design of these infrastructure relies on probabilistic analysis of flood data for gauged catchments institute of hydrology 1999 or deterministic approaches typically based on the design storm for ungauged basins chow et al 1988 in dryland regions the scarcity of rainfall and discharge gauge stations as well as the immense spatial and temporal variability of extreme events complicates the implementation of these conventional engineering procedures for instance in namibia ephemeral rivers complicate the effectiveness of a national water resource monitoring system it is challenging to calibrate water level recorders without water flows and difficult to maintain and they tend to malfunction especially during extreme floods jacobsen et al 1995 this results in limited data this becomes challenging adding a large variability of flood peaks and with frequent no flow years zaman et al 2012 metzger et al 2020 similarly deterministic approaches assume that return period of concurrent rainfall and peak discharge are the same therefore the design flood of a given recurrence interval can be estimated from rainfall runoff modelling of a single rainfall duration event houghton carr 1999 these premises are uncertain in large catchments of dryland regions since peak discharges and flood hydrographs are highly dependent on spatio temporal distribution of the rainfall emmanuel et al 2017 initial soil moisture conditions pathiraja et al 2012 and spatial attributes of the soil hydrological processes beven 2000 2001 another major limitation of these standard approaches is related to the problem of available flood peak datasets representative of flood behaviour at the site of the infrastructure this issue is exacerbated in dryland regions where flood hydrographs are often attenuated downstream in terms of peak discharge duration and volume due to transmission losses into local alluvial aquifers dahan et al 2008 morin et al 2009 grodek et al 2020 therefore there is a need for hydrological reasoning in the flood frequency estimation procedure merz and blöschl 2008a combining the effective use of flood data with hydrological and statistical judgment institute of hydrology 1999 as part of this hydrological reasoning merz and blöschl 2008a suggest expanding flood information into three types i e i temporal flood data collection to the period before or after the discharge observations ii spatial information based on regional analysis and iii causal information expansion analysis based on better understanding of flood generating and hydrograph propagation in the catchment of interest in the case of type i where systematic flood records are not available or too short to derive reliable results from the hydrological data can be supplemented with records of extreme floods obtained by using palaeoflood hydrology and records of historical floods derived from written chronicles or direct observation benito et al 2004 palaeoflood hydrology investigates physical evidence of large floods over long time periods kochel and baker 1982 the basic hypothesis in the statistical modelling of palaeoflood information is that a certain threshold of water level exists and that over a specified time interval all exceedances of this level have been recorded in the form of geological evidence left along the river channels such as sediment deposits in hyper arid regions such as the desert of namibia these sediment deposits also known as slackwater flood deposits remain well preserved in stratigraphic sequences as stage indicators of floods grodek et al 2013 greenbaum et al 2014 cloete et al 2018 regional flood frequency analysis dimensionless frequency curves with a regional analogous behaviour to at site frequency curve in dryland regions is found to be heavier tailed zaman et al 2012 and their regression models result in a poorer performance than in the temperate regional models smith et al 2014 as a result of the high spatially and heterogeneous hydrology metzger et al 2020 still regional flood data have been used in namibia to define the upper bound to envelope curve flood magnitudes for infrastructure design kovács 1988 cloete et al 2014 the general aim of this paper is to combine the effective use of catchment base flood registers in conjunction with on site flood inferred information applied to a practical case of planning decisions in relation to a bridge design crossing the ugab river in namibia the specific aims are to 1 extend the record of the large floods by reconstructing palaeoflood stages and chronologies and estimating their magnitudes and frequency 2 provide information on the single largest historical flood at the bridge from the field evidence to link the on site flood discharges with gauged floods within the catchment 3 execute the flood frequency analysis based on gauged floods and palaeoflood data in conjunction with non statistically inferred data that supports hydrological reasoning for better design and planning decisions 2 the case study and its environment proposed upgrading of the mr 76 road route c35 on google maps from a gravel road to asphalt surfaced standards requires that the annual flood risk for overtopping of bridges such as the ugab river bridge be reduced from 2 to 1 drainage manual 2014 the mr 76 between the towns of uis and khorixas north western namibia is a major rout linking the port of walvis bay with the north of namibia and zambia the existing bridge constructed in the early 1960 s is 75 m long and the deck is elevated about six metres above the riverbed it has a flood discharge capacity of 2000 m3s 1 without overtopping the catchment area upstream of the bridge is relatively large at 21 400 km2 if the existing bridge could accommodate the 1 flood without overtopping a new bridge would not be required which will bring about a significant cost saving to the proposed road upgrading based on the estimated flood capacity the 1 flood therefore had to be less than 2000 m3s 1 the ugab river heads on the western highlands of the namibia central plateau and drains west down the western escarpment across the central namib desert to the atlantic ocean fig 1 the landscape in the upper eastern basin is relatively flat and incised into the underlying basement bedrock along the middle lower reaches the total basin area is 29 360 km2 strohbach 2008 and 450 km long the average slope is 0 3 the climate varies from semiarid in the high plateau headwaters in the east 1000 m above sea level masl with mean annual rainfall of 250 530 mm down to 10 mm along the hyperarid coastal belt the dominant vegetation on the ugab river catchment consists of mainly three biomes acacia tree and shrub savannah in the upper catchment nama karoo biome of scattered shrubs and grass in the middle stream with the sparse grass of the namib desert flora in the downstream part of the river jacobsen et al 1995 shikangala and mapani 2021 floods are mostly generated on the higher and wetter headwater rainfall is generated by convective storms during october to april austral summer the intense orographic rainfall leading to flooding is a result of warm moist air from the north east rising over the high elevated areas all the major rain and floods events recorded during the instrumental period occurred during summer months january to march 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric data the ugab bridge is located between two flow gauging stations which are operated by the namibia department of water affairs dwa the upper station operated since 1967 at a weir at vingerklip coordinates 20 24 50 s 15 28 16 e altitude 920 masl and the coastal station at ugab slab since 1977 coordinates 21 05 21 s 13 48 08 e altitude 80 masl fig 1 the river length upstream of vingerklip weir is 170 km and the catchment area is 14 200 km2 the river length upstream of ugab slab gauging station is 401 km and catchment area of 28 900 km2 as in many remote desert areas the data is limited partially reliable and needs to be treated with caution however the highest recorded peak discharge measured at vingerklip weir was 417 m3s 1 which dropped down to 258 m3s 1 at ugab slab station 231 km downstream february 1985 the drop in peak discharge between the stations is mainly a result of the peak flow attenuation along its desert route as flows fill up the shallow local aquifers and as flood water is detained in tributary channels and on flood plains flash floods with short duration and low peak discharge which occur on the upper section of the river never reach the downstream station at ugab slab 3 2 bernoulli approach at the bridge the mr76 bridge over the ugab river was constructed in the 1960 s and has been exposed to the same flood sequence as the two flow gauging stations and the largest recorded flood have left marks on the concrete bridge piers these can be converted to velocity by applying bernoulli s energy equation this approach was used to verify progression of the largest flood peak from vingerklip weir to the ugab bridge typical to floods in arid regions the water has a high silt clay content these particles penetrate the porous concrete surface of the bridge piers and leave a stain particularly at the flood peak where the water level lingers longer than the rising and receding legs of the hydrograph fig 2 since large floods in the ugab river are so rare the stains have remained visible for decades the bernoulli approach utilises the difference in dynamic and static pressure measured against a bridge pier converting it to velocity this velocity multiplied by the area of discharge and an appropriate discharge coefficient produces a discharge rate cloete 2000 2004 meyer et al 2002 derived from bernoulli s equation velocity v is a function of energy head h and gravity 1 v 2 g δ h where v is the point velocity at the bridge pier ms 1 g is gravitational acceleration 9 81 ms 2 δh is the energy head in meters the difference in elevation of the dynamic and static pressure 3 3 the square root method the square root method projects a flood peak from a known point e g a gauging weir to a point further upstream or downstream in a river by multiplying the discharge rate with the ratio of the square root of the catchments drainage manual et al 2006 2 q 1 q 0 a 1 a 0 where q0 is the floodpeak at vingerklip weir in m3s 1 q1 is the transposed floodpeak in m3s 1 from vingerklip weir to ugab bridge a0 is the catchment area upstream of vingerklip weir a1 is the catchment area upstream of ugab bridge the method assumes homogeneity of the increased catchment area in terms of catchment characteristics and rainfall distribution 3 4 the rmf method kovács regional maximum flood rmf is an empirically established upper limit of flood peaks that can be reasonably expected at any site in southern africa based on maximum flood peaks recorded since 1856 at more than 500 sites kovács 1988 the relative flood peak magnitude is expressed by the francou rodier regional coefficient k the rmf peak can be instantly calculated if the geographic position of the site and its effective catchment area are known kovács also introduced fractions of the rmf to estimate the n year flood applying the fractions 0 65 0 575 and 0 50 to the rmf produced the 200 100 and 50 year flood peaks respectively 3 5 quantitative palaeoflood methods palaeoflood hydrology is a reconstruction of the magnitude and frequency of recent past and ancient floods on the bases of sedimentary evidence left by extreme floods baker 2008 high water marks hwm and palaeostage indicators psis high water marks include mud silt seed lines and flotsam e g fine organic debris grass woody debris that closely mark peak flood stage this type of evidence typically only persists for weeks months in humid climates and decades in semi arid arid climates williams and costa 1988 in contrast palaeostage indicators provide longer lasting evidence of peak flow stages and typically consist of fine textured flood sediment slackwater flood deposits gravel and boulder bars silt lines erosion features baker and kochel 1988 webb and jarrett 2002 and botanical evidence such as scars and other damage such as bent stems on riparian trees the evidence can persist for centuries to millennia depending on the environment standard methodological tasks in this palaeoflood study include benito et al 2020 i preliminary inventory of potential sites using aerial photographs ii field visits and exploration with emphasis on identification of sedimentary evidence of palaeofloods iii geomorphological and stratigraphical description with emphasis on identifying discrete flood units iv sample collection for age dating radiocarbon and luminescence dating v topographic surveys of valley river geometry and flood sites elevation vi hydraulic modelling and discharge estimation vii comparison with available historical observed and gauge record data and viii flood frequency analysis 3 6 optically stimulated luminescence dating dating of sedimentary flood units and intervening deposits is a key task supporting flood statistical analysis a variety of dating methods are available but the most commonly used are radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence osl dating for osl sand samples were collected in the field using light tight pvc cylinders from which quartz particles with grain size of 88 125 µm were extracted from the bulk sediment samples using routine laboratory procedures stavi et al 2021 briefly the samples were wet sieved to the selected grain size carbonates were dissolved by 8 hcl heavy minerals were removed by magnetic separation and feldspars was dissolved and quartz etched with 40 hf for 40 min followed by soaking in 16 hcl to dissolve any fluorides which may have precipitated equivalent dose de was measured on 1 2 mm aliquots 16 42 aliquots per sample using a modified single aliquot regenerative sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 and either a refurbished risø da 12 or a da 20 tl osl reader equipped with calibrated 90 sr β sources quartz stimulation was carried out with blue led and detection was through 7 5 mm u 340 filters the average de and errors were calculated using the central age model cam after removing distinct outliers dose rates were calculated from the concentrations of the radioactive elements k u and th measured on a subset of sediment sample by icp ms u th or icp aes k moisture contents were estimated at 5 2 and the cosmic dose was estimated from current burial depths 3 7 radiocarbon flood chronology was determined using radiocarbon the accelerator mass spectrometry ams radiocarbon dating was carried out by beta analytic radiocarbon dates are quoted in the text as the 2σ calibrated age range 95 radiocarbon ages were calibrated to calendar ages by oxcal 4 3 software ramsey 2001 based on hogg et al 2020 calibration data set shcal20 3 8 hydraulic modelling applying the energy based inverse hydraulic modeling on discrete palaeostage indicators psi allows indirect determination of palaeoflood discharges baker 2008 discharge estimation by hydraulic modelling was carried out using the step backwater method the most commonly utilised method in palaeoflood hydrology o connor et al 1986 webb and jarrett 2002 computations were run using the hec ras 4 1 one dimensional flow model hydrologic engineering center 2010 a topographic survey of the entire river reach at both the upstream and downstream sites was performed using drone photogrammetry with ground control points vertical variance measured over the ground control points was 11 mm over several kilometres which indicates a high level of accuracy cross sections were generated from the survey data these surveys were tied in with flood deposit elevations at each cross section signs of upper bound flood marks were also surveyed flood evidence from several sites along a river reach assist in adjusting the friction coefficients the manning s coefficients for the main channel was estimated at n 0 033 and along the riverbanks at n 0 037 3 9 flood frequency analysis flood frequency analysis ffa was carried out on the annual flood series for the period 1968 2009 and the non systematic record based on palaeoflood discharge estimates the daily average discharges over the period 1968 2009 were adjusted from vingerklip weir to reflect peak discharges at the ugab bridge using the square root method the frequency analysis was performed using the afins software botero and francés 2010 in statistical analysis stream flow monitoring data is considered systematic information whereas flood observations reported as having occurred above some thresholds are known as censored data sets leese 1973 most palaeoflood information is considered data censored above a perception threshold lb or between ranges db of discharges fig 3 perception thresholds are stages that reflect the range of flows that would have been recorded had they occurred for any given year over a specified time span england jr et al 2019 the analysis assumes that the number of k observations exceeding a perception threshold arbitrary level or discharge xh in m years is known similar to partial duration series a difference with gauged partial duration series data is that the exact peak flow value for a palaeoflood above threshold xh may not be known concerning the floods below xh their exact values are not known but at least it is known they were smaller than xh fig 3 a set of probability distribution functions was fitted to the flood data series namely the gumbel g generalised extreme value gev two component extreme value tcev and exponential distribution the parameters set for these statistical functions have been estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation mle method stedinger and cohn 1986 the tcev distribution rossi et al 1984 was found to best fit the data since it provides a good representation of two flood populations ordinary e g local storms and extraordinary floods e g mesoscale convective systems 4 estimating the 1 aep flood from gauged data sets conventional methods in this section the main results from conventional approaches to determine the 1 flood discharge for infrastructure design are presented these approaches see sections 4 1 to 4 3 are based on 1 statistical analysis from available flow gauging station data and transpose values to the ugab bridge square root method 2 hydraulic calculations using silt lines marks left by recent floods on the bridge piers and 3 regional maximum flood peak based discharge catchment area relationships 4 1 probabilistic approach a probabilistic analysis of the hydrometric data table 1 is the appropriate first step however the data have no flow years which pose a problem the probability of a zero flow floodpeaks an approach in dealing with zero s is to perform a probability distribution by excluding the no flow years from a dataset fischer 2012 hence reducing the number of observations ntotal nzero thereafter apply the fraction of non zero years over the total dataset to the probability distribution e g the product of p non zero and the fraction ntotal nzero ntotal this reduces the probability of occurrence of floods by creating a shift in the time scale which reduces the flood peak for the recurrence intervals for example the gumbel 1 exceedance probability flood at ugab slab excluding the no flow years is 278 m3s 1 and after adjustment for the no flow years the flood peak reduces to 254 m3s 1 the distribution of discharge rates at vingerklip and ugab slab stations including the adjustment for no flow years are indicated in table 2 the vingerklip probability discharges were transposed to the ugab bridge using the square root method eq 2 table 2 the transposed 1 flood discharge at the ugab bridge is in the range of 490 500 m3s 1 the largest flood at vingerklip weir the 1985 flood with a discharge of 417 m3s 1 provided a transposed value of 512 m3s 1 at the ugab bridge on site flood mark evidence combined with hydraulic calculations may be used to support the values obtained from the transposition 4 2 bridge hydraulic approach from measurements at the bridge pier the difference in elevation of the dynamic and static pressure left by floodmarks δh provides the energy head eq 1 for the upper flood marks δh 0 45 m the calculated point velocity is 3 0 ms 1 for an average flow depth of 3 6 m and an effective width of 70 m the discharge area is 252 m2 for a discharge coefficient 0 64 cloete 2004 the discharge is 480 m3s 1 this can be associated with the 1985 flood the highest flood recorded at vingerklip weir estimated at 512 m3s 1 by the transposed discharge from the vingerklip station the similar discharge value estimated using the hydraulic approach at the bridge confirms the result obtained from transposing the vingerklip weir data for the lower flood marks δh 0 21 m the velocity is 2 0 ms 1 and for the average flow depth of 1 4 m and discharge coefficient of 0 64 the discharge rate is estimated at 130 m3s 1 this flood peak can be associated with either the 1997 or the 2008 2009 floods 4 3 the rmf model 1 flood the rmf model was also applied to estimate the 1 probability flood at the bridge the effective catchment area upstream of the ugab bridge is 21 400 km2 and the regional rmf coefficient k 4 kovács 1988 this produces a regional maximum flood peak of 6300 m3s 1 by converting this maximum floodpeak to a 1 probability flood as discussed in section 3 4 the discharge rate is estimated to be approximately 3500 m3s 1 the rmf method assumes a homogeneous rainfall runoff response for the selected k region the model however appears to significantly overestimate the 1 probability flood peak when compared to the probabilistic model this is likely due to sparse run off data for the region during the model construction 5 palaeoflood hydrology 5 1 field data collection the field work for the palaeoflood study was conducted at two sites with preserved sedimentary evidence 1 upstream ugab reach us 17 km upstream from the bridge and 2 downstream ugab reach ds located 3 km downstream from the bridge fig 4 the palaeoflood evidence was mainly identified at slackwater depositional environments channel widening alcoves in bedrock walls and back flooded tributary mouths the palaeoflood sites were chosen within bedrock controlled section of the river where channel geometry is expected to remain stable over time which is critical to produce robust discharge estimations from hydraulic modelling the fieldwork entailed identification of flood evidence of water levels palaeostage reached or exceeded during large floods with an emphasis on sedimentary evidence slackwater flood deposits swds baker and kochel 1988 baker et al 2002 a detailed stratigraphy with emphasis on contacts between flood beds was performed in fifteen stratigraphic profiles individual flood units were identified through a variety of sedimentological indicators baker 1987 benito et al 2003 namely the identification of clay layers at the top of a unit erosion surfaces bioturbation indicating the exposure of a sedimentary surface angular clast layers where slope materials were deposited between floods in addition to changes in sediment color apart from identifying individual flood units sedimentary flow structures were also described to elucidate any changing dynamics during a particular flood and or infer flow velocities that could improve discharge estimation benito et al 2003 multiple stratigraphic diagrams were described at each studied reach showing the identified flood layers as well as the colluvial and aeolian beds marking non flooding times with subaerial exposure in the case of luminescence dating sediment samples were taken in pvc pipes to avoid sun light exposition organic samples charcoal seeds and wood were collected for radiocarbon determination 5 2 stratigraphy and chronology of upstream ugab site at the upstream ugab site us the catchment area is 20 700 km2 the studied reach covers a length of 1 4 km with an average channel bottom width of 30 m fig 5a the river channel is entrenched on bedrock with a shallow alluvium the right hand side of the valley when facing downstream shows a gentle topography covered by flood sediments and old gravelly and boulder deposits whereas the left hand side consist of a vertical cliff with accumulation of large rock falls and debris flow from small gullies fig 6a four slackwater deposit profiles swd were described together with two prominent large woody debris lines formed by large tree logs at high elevation fig 6b the highest profile us 50 fig 7 is a 75 cm thick fine sand sediment with current ripples and wavy lamination that closely matches in elevation with a tree log line dated at current era ce 1130 1220 with an associated discharge of 1015 m3s 1 this flood bed is also represented in the upper flood bed of profile us 51 that comprises six flood beds five predating an osl age 3390 240 figs 6c and 7 in a flood bench on the left side of the valley profile us 53 figs 6d and 7 comprises at least eleven flood beds deposited over the last 250 years with discharge range 250 665 m3s 1 a woody debris tree log at the sector where the flood bench wedges out to the slope was radiocarbon dated at ce 1870 1950 matching with a discharge of 675 m3s 1 the profile us 54 fig 6e is located in a back flooded tributary stream entering the canyon from the right hand side in the tributary a flood deposit bench sediment can be traced 100 m upstream of the tributary containing at least five flood beds with an associated discharge of 475 m3s 1 post dating an osl date of ce 1610 1680 5 3 stratigraphy and chronology of downstream ugab site the downstream ugab reach ds covers a length of 2500 m with an average stream bed width of 35 m fig 5b the channel bed is entrenched on bedrock although the channel bottom is covered by alluvial fine sand five profiles of slackwater flood deposits were described along the reach the most complete ds 10 is located at the right hand side of the valley formed by a flood sediment bench deposited by back flooded effect due to a bedrock channel constriction fig 8a a trench next to the valley side exposes a 1 7 m thick deposited formed by at least seven flood beds intercalated by fine gravel slope deposits figs 8b and 9 the highest flood deposits are associated with estimated minimum discharge of 930 m3s 1 whereas the bottom flood bed was deposited by a discharge exceeding 600 m3s 1 the first and fifth flood units were osl dated at ce 720 850 and ce 1020 1120 respectively fig 9 about 200 m downstream profile ds 13 is located at a flood sediment bench within a tributary stream entering the canyon from the left hand side fig 5b the bench is 1 3 m thick formed by at least five flood beds with erosive contacts and eventually intercalated slope wash material fig 9 the basal flood bed was osl dated at ce 800 910 indicating a similar time framework to profile ds10 and the second higher flood bed was dated at ce 1490 1540 this sequence contains depositional evidence of the largest floods in this reach over the last millennium with a minimum discharge of 1130 m3s 1 the profiles ds 15 and ds 16 are located at an expansion reach at a margin of a high flow chute channel fig 5b the highest flood sediments are forming distinct small benches that wedges out to the slope reaching a flood stage with a minimum discharge of 850 m3s 1 with related lines of woody debris tree logs one of them radiocarbon dated at ce 1790 1950 fig 8c further downstream profile ds 14 figs 8d and 9 located at a tributary stream contains at least two flood beds the lower dated at ce 1580 1620 with a minimum discharge estimation of 1050 m3s 1 5 4 palaeoflood and gauged flood data composition as expected in this arid region with little bioturbation evidence of floods up to 1260 years old are well preserved evidence was also obtained from tree log lines defining high water marks the oldest and highest was emplaced at ce 1130 the composited and better palaeoflood evidence is from the downstream site with at least 14 palaeofloods since ce 750 the largest flood reaches a minimum discharge of 1130 m3s 1 in the stratigraphy the sediments of some flood units were dated by optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating see tables 4 and 5 the undated flood units were assigned an interpolated age at regular intervals between dated flood sediments table 6 the sediments are located along flood benches rock shelters and upstream tributary valleys each stratigraphic site comprises an individual record of successive floods built by vertical accretion similar to the floodplain deposition on an alluvial river this vertical accretion by deposition of new flood layer means that progressively higher discharges are required to deposit a new flood layer over time this phenomenon is named as self censuring flood stack cf house et al 2002 moreover as the flood bed stack height increases it is inundated less frequently which results in a larger time gap to deposit the subsequent flood unit hence note that initially floods exceeding 600 m3s 1 occurred at intervals of 70 years but as the threshold of discharge increased the time interval between floods increased therefore floods exceeding 800 m3s 1 occurred every 150 years the largest flood on record recorded as high water marks by a tree log at the upstream ugab site reaching a discharge of 1130 m3s 1 table 6 the statistical analysis using non standard data of flood magnitude and timing e g palaeofloods and historical isolated observations requires a temporal organisation of data based on perception thresholds see benito et al 2020 the combined palaeoflood data is organised on six perception thresholds related to the elevation of stratigraphic sites while the applicable period of each threshold is the period for which the site is expected to record all floods above that height table 7 fig 10a therefore floods with smaller discharge than the required threshold values of deposition xh are not deposited according to the elevation of the flood benches table 7 shows the threshold of discharge and timing required for deposition of flood units in order to perform a flood frequency analysis the vingerklip weir data was transposed to the ugab bridge site using the square root method the 1985 floodpeak transposed from vingerklip weir to the bridge compares well with the flood peak generated from the bridge flood marks the interest of this study however lies in the upper tail of the data which was provided by the palaeoflood data which is site specific to the bridge site in so doing a probabilistic analysis was executed at the bridge site utilising the transposed systematic data in conjunction with the palaeoflood data the transposed flood peak data is indicated in table 3 the two component extreme value tcev gumbel g generalised extreme value gev and exponential distribution functions were applied to both systematic plus palaeoflood data and to only systematic data the distribution of discharge values associated with different recurrence intervals ri are shown in table 8 the best performance was obtained by the two component extreme value tcev and generalised extreme value gev with a good visual matching of the distribution curves to the flood plotting positions for the low and high discharge values in addition the statistical results are similar in both distribution functions up to the 1 flood recurrence intervals in both cases the 1 flood was ca 825 m3s 1 for higher flood probabilities the two component extreme value tcev distribution provided the more realistic values with associated discharges lower than the gev distribution only one flood over the last 1260 years reached a discharge of 1130 m3s 1 the two large historical floods that occurred in the ugab river namely the 1933 and 1953 may be related to two high tree log lines observed in the study sites with an associated discharge of ca 800 m3s 1 whereas a lower tree log line it would be likely related to the 1963 flood with an estimated discharge of ca 600 m3s 1 the incorporation of the palaeoflood data into the ffa resulted in higher discharge values for a given flood probability than those obtained using only the systematic record table 8 major differences are found towards the lowest probabilities for example the 0 2 annual probability flood of the combined historical and natural systematic records is 1250 m3s 1 whereas with the systematic period it was 685 m3s 1 6 discussion 6 1 hydrological reasoning in flood frequency estimation for infrastructure design civil infrastructure such as roadways bridges or dams requires knowledge of flood risk and recurrence probability to assist in the infrastructure design stedinger et al 1993 the investment and risk is proportionate to the societal benefits and the potential damage in case of failure dams can have a lifespan of 100 200 years and national roads up to 50 years the design flood quantification typically relies on the standard approach of frequency analysis klemeš 1993 this procedure has evolved in many ways including regional frequency analysis to solve the estimation problems related to the lack of sufficient data to produce reliable extrapolations to large return periods merz and blöschl 2008a stedinger and griffins 2008 dryland regions typically show a complex hydrology with spatial variation in rainfall intensity and duration requiring more local information to guide the designer on estimating the flood peak and associated societal risk a global scale analysis of regional flood frequency analysis shows that arid regions exhibit higher percentage errors in the regression models than those of temperate or tropical regions smith et al 2014 in general arid regions show much steeper flood frequency growth curve than humid regions zaman et al 2012 partially a consequence of the large variability of flood peak discharges with many years with zero or very low maximum discharge metzger et al 2020 for instance 20 of annual maximum discharges of the available ugab river gauge record 42 years are below 10 m3s 1 producing practical problems for the parameter estimation of the distribution function the expansion of the information beyond the flood sample at the river reach or point of interest may involve spatial causal and temporal expansion merz and blöschl 2008b first in our case spatial expansion by the rmf method assuming rainfall runoff homogenous contribution significantly overestimates the 1 flood compared to the probabilistic model secondly causal information analysis in arid regions is often difficult to address as it involves to derivate flood frequency from flow data that usually is not available at the required scale therefore temporal expansion of flood records from indirect flood evidence either palaeoflood or historical registers should be considered a good practice to assist with infrastructure design the case study demonstrates that palaeoflood evidence provides stage information of extreme floods going back centuries whose physical preservation is exceptional in arid environments due to the lack of vegetation cover disturbing the flood sediments management of flood risk should be continually adapted in response to new knowledge merz and blöschl 2008a although palaeoflood studies are seldom used on infrastructure design currently there is a great potential for including palaeoflood information as a standard procedure to expand the temporal record of exceptional floods st george et al 2020 strategies infrastructure and operational practice have capacity for modification based on such new information sayers et al 2013 and or catchment changes jongman 2018 the development of new statistical tools that allow the inclusion of very large floods from palaeoflood reconstructions improves the estimation of the upper tail of the distribution function and provides a new framework towards a standard application of palaeoflood hydrology in design e g us bulletin 17 c england et al 2019 at a time when infrastructure is expanding to remote dryland regions of africa buys et al 2010 oecd acet 2020 quantitative data on very large floods that occurred over a centennial time scale enables flood risk managers to respond to reality minimizing damages in a purposeful and planned way 6 2 temporal flood history expansion from palaeoflood evidence southern africa has a number of regions where a lack of hydrological data hampers the ability to make informed decisions about flood hazards and to effectively manage flood risks this palaeoflood study resulted in valuable data to estimate the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods at specific sites in the catchment in particular the ugab river contains abundant sedimentary evidence of ancient floods deposited mainly at tributary mouths and expansion reaches and locally overlying high alluvial surfaces the dry environmental conditions of the region favour the preservation identification and persistence of these fine textured flood sediments and the contacts between flood units the atmospheric conditions leading to extreme flooding are related to further south than normal incursions of the semi permanent angola low pressure cell and moisture advected from the indian ocean or the african tropics henschel et al 2005 grodek et al 2013 the abnormal moisture transport toward central and southern namibia produces higher than average seasonal rain that may even penetrate the namib desert and cause regional flooding this widespread flood response should also be reflected by the flood stratigraphy with a similar temporal framework and number of flood units the most complete palaeoflood stratigraphy is found on tributary mouths and upstream of tributary valleys being back flooded during high flood stages the composited palaeoflood evidence mainly based on the stratigraphy of the downstream site shows 14 palaeoflood events since ce 750 the undated flood units were assigned an interpolated age at regular intervals between dated flood sediments initially floods exceeding 600 m3s 1 occurred at intervals of 70 years but as the threshold of discharge increased the time interval between floods increased therefore floods exceeding 800 m3s 1 occurred approximately every 150 years the largest flood on record recorded as high water marks by a tree log at the upper ugab site reached a discharge rate of 1130 m3s 1 6 3 gain on flood frequency estimation at ugab river bridge the highest flood marks on the bridge 1985 flood reveal a peak discharge of 480 m3s 1 based on bernoulli s theorem this fits the result of the square root method of 512 m3s 1 transposing the vingerklip weir peak discharge to the bridge these results provide data for the lower end of the probability distribution while the palaeoflood hydrology provides the data for the upper tail flow records from the ugab slab weir were not included in projecting discharge at the bridge since evidence proves that there is significant attenuation particularly downstream of the bridge because of high water losses to the streambed flood peak data generated through the rmf model was not included in the analyses it is proved that the assumption of regional homogeneous parameters is not the case as the channel morphology and rainfall runoff behaviour is not uniform along the transition from the semi arid area toward extremely arid area grodek et al 2013 greenbaum et al 2014 in the future the results of the palaeoflood study may upgrade the rmf model to reflect the attenuation of flood peaks through the extreme arid namib desert coastal belt 7 conclusions flood risk estimation improves with the length and quality of hydrological data which are relatively sparse in namibia in the case of the ugab river gauging records have been found incomplete and limited to about 45 years therefore the largest and rarest floods are potentially underrepresented and thus the distribution of all magnitudes of floods through time is poorly constrained this situation complicates decisions related to flood hazard at the uis khorixas road bridge over the ugab river to increase the hydrological data records palaeoflood studies were performed at two sites 17 km upstream of the ugab bridge and 3 km downstream the composited palaeoflood evidence was collected at the downstream site showing 14 palaeofloods since ce 750 as expected in this arid region with little bioturbation the stratigraphic evidence of floods is well preserved evidence was also obtained from tree log lines defining high water marks the oldest and highest was emplaced at ce 1600 reaching a minimum discharge rate of 1130 m3s 1 the calculated 1 probability flood for the bridge gev distribution is 573 m3s 1 based on only the systematic data and 842 m3s 1 when combining the palaeoflood and the systematic data based on the palaeoflood evidence the existing bridge over the ugab river can accommodate the 1 flood and the maximum palaeoflood record without overtopping therefore upgrading of the road will not require demolishing and replacement of the existing bridge credit authorship contribution
