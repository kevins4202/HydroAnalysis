a total of 108 plants 27 per species were planted each spaced at 5 m x 4 m in a 0 21 ha area the treatments were replicated three times under a randomized complete block design rcbd because the area receives good annual rainfall and soils are moderately fertile hence no irrigation fertilizer and manure were provided to plants during the experimental period weeding and cleaning operations were carried out regularly to maintain plant growth more details about the experimental set up can be found in kaushal et al 2020a 2 3 infiltration experiments and estimation of hydraulic properties 2 3 1 measurement of steady state infiltration rate ssir by hood infiltrometer in the present study topsoil ssirs were recorded at pressure heads of 0 10 and 30 mm using a hood infiltrometer under six year old bamboo species i e b vulgaris b balcooa d hamiltonii and d strictus during the first week of february 2018 all measurements were taken approximately 1 meter away from the clump of the bamboos we adopted the procedure elaborated by schwärzel and punzel 2007 theoretical considerations for estimating saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity macropore hydraulic flux and water conducting porosity wcp are described below 2 3 2 saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity we adopted the methodology of ankeny et al 1991 to determine the relationship between hydraulic conductivity k ψ l t 1 and pressure head ψ l from the measured ssirs wooding s 1968 analytical solution for steady infiltration from a circular source was used to estimate the parameters of the hydraulic conductivity function of gardner 1958 1 k ψ k s e x p α ψ where ks and α l 1 are the shc and the sorptive number respectively wooding s solution for a constant ψ at the soil surface is given by 2 k ψ q ψ π a 2 a g α where q ψ l3 t 1 is the ssir g 0 25 a shape factor and a l the radius of the hood ψ the sorptive number α was computed using ssirs values between two consecutive ψ values as follows 3 α i i 1 ln q i ln q i 1 ψ i ψ i 1 i 1 2 n 1 where qi and qi 1 are measured adjacent ssirs l3 t 1 and ψi and ψi 1 are the corresponding pressure heads the k ψ for pressure heads 0 10 and 30

30 as α often varies with a decline in water potential in structured soils a piece wise approach provides the best estimate of k ψ values clothier and smettem 1990 2 3 3 estimation of macropore hydraulic flux the hydraulic flux conducted through the macropores pores having greater than 1 mm equivalent diameter which corresponds to 30 mm pressure head was calculated by integrating the k ψ curves as given in the following equation 7 ϕ t ψ i ψ i 1 k ψ d ψ where ϕt is the macropore hydraulic flux also called the tension flux potential and ψi and ψi 1 are the adjacent pressure heads the ϕt

porosity wcp the wcp corresponding to the pore radii a and b was estimated using the hydraulic conductivity characteristics at two adjacent ψ values patra et al 2019 schwen et al 2011 singh et al 2021 watson and luxmoore 1986 we adopted the procedure of bodhinayake et al 2004 where wcp a b l3 l 3 was determined from the hydraulic conductivity in the pressure head intervals ψ a and ψ b 9 wcp a b 2 μ

surface tension of water 9 4 108 g hr 2 at 20 c water temperature the mathematical solution of eq 9 given by bodhinayake et al bodhinayake et al 2004 for gardner s exponential relationship eq 1 was applied to estimate wcp the analytical equation is given as 10 w c p a b 2 μ ρ g k s σ 2 exp 2 σ α ρ g b 4 σ 2 ρ g b 2 4 σ ρ g b α 2 α 2 exp 2 σ α ρ g a 4 σ 2 ρ g a 2 4 σ ρ g a α 2 α 2 where ks is the

and water air interface assumed to be 0 buczko et al 2006 schwen et al 2011 please see that the other symbols are already defined in the previous equations as it can also be seen from eq 11 that the pore radius at 0 mm pressure head can not be defined as ψ appears in the denominator a value of 2 50 mm was assumed to represent the most oversized pores this approximation may be reasonable to represent the biopores created by bigger soil faunas such as earthworms bodhinayake and si 2004 patra et al 2019 the estimated pore radii for 10 and 30 mm pressure heads were 1 49 mm and 0 49 mm respectively as calculated using equation 11 the calculated wcp values were multiplied by 100 to convert them into a percentage of soil volume 2 3 5 sampling and analysis of soil soil cores and grab samples were collected from beneath the hood 0 50 mm after the infiltration runs the soil organic carbon soc was determined by wet digestion walkley and black 1934 soil bulk density was determined by the core method using a steel core 5 cm internal diameter and 5 cm height blake and hartge 1986 the soil aggregate size distribution was determined following the wet sieving method yoder 1936 a sieve shaker equipped with a column of sieves at mesh sizes 4 2 1 0 5 0 25 and 0 125 mm was used air dried samples 100 gram was used for wet sieving the aggregate mean weight diameter mwd was estimated using the following equation kemper and rosenau 1986 12 m w d m m i 1 n x i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the aggregates mass g proportion retained on each sieve to the total soil mass xi is the sieve mean diameter mm soil samples were taken at 0 10 cm depths below the hood instrument after the infiltration culmination to estimate the root biomass after soaking samples in water for eight hours and stirring manually soil root suspension sieved roots repeatedly washed and all root separated for categorizing into two classes i e fine roots 2 5 mm diameter and coarse roots 2 5 mm diameter and all roots coarse and fine roots were oven dried at 65 2 c temperature to a constant weight to determine the dry root biomass more details about the root sampling procedure can be found in kaushal et al 2020a 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova was performed to test the statistical significance among mean values of shc and nshc wcp and macropore hydraulic flux tension flux potential the normality of data was checked using the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 values were log transformed where needed the spss software version 16 was used for statistical analysis the significance level was tested at α 0 05 tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test snedecor and cochran 1968 was used to compare the means of different treatments correlation analysis was performed between shc and various soil and plant parameters to assess relationships and key factors influencing soil hydraulic conductivity characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bamboo species on soil hydraulic conductivity and macropore hydraulic flux figure 2 presents the saturated k 0 and near saturated k 10 and k 30 hydraulic conductivity values estimated from the ssirs at 0 10 and 30 mm pressure heads under four bamboo species d hamiltonii 33 55 mm hr 1 plantations showed the highest mean k 0 value followed by d strictus 16 92 mm hr 1 b vulgaris 12 88 mm hr 1 and b balcoaa 11 12 mm hr 1 under d hamiltonii plantations k 10 and k 30 were recorded highest with the value of 19 15 mm hr 1 and 8 51 mm hr 1 respectively however compared to k 0 values for different species the trends for k 10 and k 30 were different the highest value recorded for k 10 was under d hamiltonii followed by b vulgaris 8 64 mm hr 1 d strictus 8 18 mm hr 1 and b balcooa 6 55 mm hr 1 while the maximum value observed for k 30 was under d hamiltonii followed by b vulgaris 4 99 mm hr 1 b balcooa 4 01 mm hr 1 and d strictus 3 74 mm hr 1 the soil s structural changes in the near saturated conditions are signified by these hydraulic conductivity trends induced by the modified pore characteristics as influenced by different bamboo species d hamiltonii showed significantly higher p 0 05 values of k 0 and k 10 than b vulgaris and b balcooa but was statistically at par p 0 05 with d strictus nevertheless for all four species k 30 values were not statistically different p 0 05 moreover figure 3 illustrates the effect of different bamboo species on macropore hydraulic flux or the tension flux potential ϕ t mm 2 s 1 eq 7 calculated for 0 to 30 mm pressure head the ϕ t stands for the macropore hydraulic flux as 30 mm pressure head corresponds to an equivalent pore diameter of 1 mm and any soil pore with a diameter of 1 mm or more are categorized as macropores luxmoore 1981 like the trends of k ψ values d hamiltonii 504 mm2 hr 1 showed the highest ϕ t followed by b vulgaris 234 mm2 hr 1 d strictus 219 6 mm2 hr 1 and b balcooa 180 mm2 hr 1 however under d hamiltonii the mean ϕ t value was only significantly p 0 05 higher than that of b balcooa and d strictus in different species the difference in shc values may be explained by the variation in root biomass which is largely dependent on factors such as microenvironment species composition microorganisms and root herbivores eissenstat and volder 2005 espeleta et al 2009 also ide et al 2010 and kaushal et al 2020a b stated that due to fine root production and litterfall under bamboos they observed greater infiltration and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity in the same experimental set up kaushal et al 2020a evaluated the rooting characteristics of seven bamboo species viz bambusa balcooa bambusa bambos bambusa vulgaris bambusa nutans dendrocalamus hamiltonii dendrocalamus stocksii and dendrocalamus strictus and their impact on soil health properties they also found higher root biomass and saturated hydraulic conductivity in d hamiltonii however their measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity were based on laboratory method i e using constant head permeameter method in soil cores extracted from the field our study involved in situ measurements using a hood tension infiltrometer under saturated and near saturated conditions knowledge of both saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics not only provides greater insights into soil structural changes but also enables characterization of soil pores and their influence on water transmission in the soil 3 2 effect of bamboo species on water conducting macroporosity table 2 presents the effect of different bamboo species on wcp from 0 to 30 mm pressure head d hamiltonii had significantly p 0 05 higher wcp values followed by d strictus and b vulgaris and b balcooa considering the two pore radii range i e 1 49 mm and 1 49 0 49 mm the total wcp in the above two pore radii interval i e all pores 0 49 mm also followed the same trend furthermore the contribution of flow by the pores with these pore size range to total flow i e at saturation was computed by dividing the difference in hydraulic conductivity in each ψ range by the shc watson and luxmoore 1986 the results fig 4 elucidated a relatively higher contribution by pores with larger pore radius to the saturated flow for all studied bamboo species the larger pores contained a tiny proportion 10 4 parts table 2 of the total volume of soil however a substantial total flow was transmitted through these pores the soil pores having radii 0 49 mm conducted about 54 69 64 94 75 44 and 72 65 of total flow at 0 mm pressure head in the corresponding wcp of 0 00016 0 00011 0 0005 and 0 0002 of soil volume under b vulgaris b balcooa d hamiltonii and d strictus respectively fig 4 and table 2 in previous studies bodhinayake and si 2004 patra et al 2019 yu et al 2015 authors have reported for different land use and management practices similar ranges of wcp the species effect on soil pore characteristics is highlighted by these different contribution values to macropores total flow under different bamboo species such effects on soil pores may also be dictated by the morphological characteristics of different bamboo species roots bodner et al 2014 showed that root systems of cover crops differing in axes morphology led to distinctive pore dynamics hence the root pore interface processes may play an important role in modifying the soil structural characteristics similarly cadisch et al 2004 also stated that decaying tree roots create larger pores in a greater proportion that improve the soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 correlation of shc k 0 with different biophysical properties the correlation coefficients were analyzed to assess the differential effect of bamboo species on soil s hydraulic properties the shc values represented in this study as k 0 were correlated with bulk density soc aggregate mwd total root biomass and leaf litter dry weight fig 5 as expected bulk density which is an indirect estimate of total porosity was weekly and negatively correlated with k 0 values fig 5a a higher total porosity lower bulk density may not always be related to higher hydraulic conductivity as the water transmission occurs with connected pores rather than the total amount of pores some of the soil pores may be constricted or blind ended hence the continuous ones can only effectively contribute to the water transmission in soil the soc had a weak correlation with k 0 values fig 5b the interspaces of bamboo clumps were mechanically ploughed to suppress the weeds mounding operations were also performed to support the emerging culms therefore the weak correlation is related to soil disturbance due to the regular intercultural operation resulting in higher organic matter decomposition and subsequent carbon loss to the atmosphere soil aggregate mwd and root biomass were found to have a significant p 0 05 and positive correlation with k 0 values fig 5c d water stable aggregate is critical for pore space infiltration physical protection of organic matter root growth and is vital for influencing soil hydrological properties carter 2004 paudel et al 2011 the macrostructure of topsoil may be improved in two ways by higher root biomass firstly the root itself may create higher macroporosity due to the development of bigger pores kargas et al 2016 and schmitt et al 1999 also found that the aboveground stems and roots can lessen the runoff and sedimentation by improving soil infiltration rate second root biomass has also been found to enhance the soil aggregation process due to the root binding effect beven and germann 1982 burri et al 2009 kaushal et al 2020a pohl et al 2009 tewari et al 2019 kukal and bawa 2008 and saha et al 2007 also found higher soil mwd and macro aggregates under different tree plantations these results indicated that the formation of inter aggregate pores with greater aggregate mwd in turn improves hydraulic conductivity the surface soil bamboo roots can thus be a vital factor controlling hydraulic properties there was a positive but weak correlation between the leaf litter dry weight and the k 0 values fig 5e a similar and positive correlation was stated by hiraoka and onda 2012 in moso bamboo on the contrary they observed a better correlation between infiltration capacity and litter cover area rather than the dry litter weight in this study even though the litter cover area was not measured it was hypothesized that d hamiltonii due to its broader leaves table 1 may cover a larger area as compared with the other species and therefore enhances biological activity beneath the litter layer thereby increasing the infiltration capacity through bigger bio pores the topsoil may also be protected by the larger litter cover area from direct rainfall impact thereby preventing the topsoil sealing preserving the macropores and facilitating the higher hydraulic conductivity 4 conclusions the impact of bamboo species on soil hydraulic properties is an important aspect of the bamboo plantation s eco hydrology as it affects the runoff soil erosion and overall water balance of bamboo dominated land use systems results revealed that there were considerable differences in surface hydraulic conductivity and macropore characteristics among the different bamboo species in terms of shc macropore hydraulic flux and water conducting macroporosity the studied bamboo species trends were d hamiltonii d strictus b vulgaris b balcooa correlation analysis revealed that higher root biomass and aggregate mean weight diameter were the determining factors for the improvement of soil hydraulic properties in near saturated conditions higher root biomass and improved soil aggregation increased the connected macropores thereby improving the surface soil hydraulic conductivity overall among the species evaluated d hamiltonii was found to be a promising species for improvement of soil hydro physical quality and is therefore recommended for reducing runoff controlling soil erosion and improving the groundwater recharge of an area with similar soil and climatic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

pore radius at 0 mm pressure head can not be defined as ψ appears in the denominator a value of 2 50 mm was assumed to represent the most oversized pores this approximation may be reasonable to represent the biopores created by bigger soil faunas such as earthworms bodhinayake and si 2004 patra et al 2019 the estimated pore radii for 10 and 30 mm pressure heads were 1 49 mm and 0 49 mm respectively as calculated using equation 11 the calculated wcp values were multiplied by 100 to convert them into a percentage of soil volume 2 3 5 sampling and analysis of soil soil cores and grab samples were collected from beneath the hood 0 50 mm after the infiltration runs the soil organic carbon soc was determined by wet digestion walkley and black 1934 soil bulk density was determined by the core method using a steel core 5 cm internal diameter and 5 cm height blake and hartge 1986 the soil aggregate size distribution was determined following the wet sieving method yoder 1936 a sieve

various soil and plant parameters to assess relationships and key factors influencing soil hydraulic conductivity characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bamboo species on soil hydraulic conductivity and macropore hydraulic flux figure 2 presents the saturated k 0 and near saturated k 10 and k 30 hydraulic conductivity values estimated from the ssirs at 0 10 and 30 mm pressure heads under four bamboo species d hamiltonii 33 55 mm hr 1 plantations showed the highest mean k 0 value followed by d strictus 16 92 mm hr 1 b vulgaris 12 88 mm hr 1 and b balcoaa 11 12 mm hr 1 under d hamiltonii plantations k 10 and k 30 were recorded highest with the value of 19 15 mm hr 1 and 8 51 mm hr 1 respectively however compared to k 0 values for different species the trends for k 10 and k 30 were different the highest value recorded for k 10 was under d hamiltonii followed by b vulgaris 8 64 mm hr 1 d strictus 8 18 mm hr 1 and b balcooa 6 55 mm hr 1 while the maximum value observed for k 30 was under d hamiltonii followed by b vulgaris 4 99 mm hr 1 b balcooa 4 01 mm hr 1 and d strictus 3 74 mm hr 1 the soil s structural changes in the near saturated conditions are signified by these hydraulic conductivity trends induced by the modified pore characteristics as influenced by different bamboo species d hamiltonii showed significantly higher p 0 05 values of k 0 and k 10 than b vulgaris and b balcooa but was statistically at par p 0 05 with d strictus nevertheless for all four species k 30 values were not statistically different p 0 05 moreover figure 3 illustrates the effect of different bamboo species on macropore hydraulic flux or the tension flux potential ϕ t mm 2 s 1 eq 7 calculated for 0 to 30 mm pressure head the ϕ t stands for the macropore hydraulic flux as 30 mm pressure head corresponds to an equivalent pore diameter of 1 mm and any soil pore with a diameter of 1 mm or more are categorized as macropores luxmoore 1981 like the trends of k ψ values d hamiltonii 504 mm2 hr 1 showed the highest ϕ t followed by b vulgaris 234 mm2 hr 1 d strictus 219 6 mm2 hr 1 and b balcooa 180 mm2 hr 1 however under d hamiltonii the mean ϕ t value was only significantly p 0 05 higher than that of b balcooa and d strictus in different species the difference in shc values may be explained by the variation in root biomass which is largely dependent on factors such as microenvironment species composition microorganisms and root herbivores eissenstat and volder 2005 espeleta et al 2009 also ide et al 2010 and kaushal et al 2020a b stated that due to fine root production and litterfall under bamboos they observed greater infiltration and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity in the same experimental set up kaushal et al 2020a evaluated the rooting characteristics of seven bamboo species viz bambusa balcooa bambusa bambos bambusa vulgaris bambusa nutans dendrocalamus hamiltonii dendrocalamus stocksii and dendrocalamus strictus and their impact on soil health properties they also found higher root biomass and saturated hydraulic conductivity in d hamiltonii however their measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity were based on laboratory method i e using constant head permeameter method in soil cores extracted from the field our study involved in situ measurements using a hood tension infiltrometer under saturated and near saturated conditions knowledge of both saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics not only provides greater insights into soil structural changes but also enables characterization of soil pores and their influence on water transmission in the soil 3 2 effect of bamboo species on water conducting macroporosity table 2 presents the effect of different bamboo species on wcp from 0 to 30 mm pressure head d hamiltonii had significantly p 0 05 higher wcp values followed by d strictus and b vulgaris and b balcooa considering the two pore radii range i e 1 49 mm and 1 49 0 49 mm the total wcp in the above two pore radii interval i e all pores 0 49 mm also followed the same trend furthermore the contribution of flow by the pores with these pore size range to total flow i e at saturation was computed by dividing the difference in hydraulic conductivity in each ψ range by the shc watson and luxmoore 1986 the results fig 4 elucidated a relatively higher contribution by pores with larger pore radius to the saturated flow for all studied bamboo species the larger pores contained a tiny proportion 10 4 parts table 2 of the total volume of soil however a substantial total flow was transmitted through these pores the soil pores having radii 0 49 mm conducted about 54 69 64 94 75 44 and 72 65 of total flow at 0 mm pressure head in the corresponding wcp of 0 00016 0 00011 0 0005 and 0 0002 of soil volume under b vulgaris b balcooa d hamiltonii and d strictus respectively fig 4 and table 2 in previous studies bodhinayake and si 2004 patra et al 2019 yu et al 2015 authors have reported for different land use and management practices similar ranges of wcp the species effect on soil pore characteristics is highlighted by these different contribution values to macropores total flow under different bamboo species such effects on soil pores may also be dictated by the morphological characteristics of different bamboo species roots bodner et al 2014 showed that root systems of cover crops differing in axes morphology led to distinctive pore dynamics hence the root pore interface processes may play an important role in modifying the soil structural characteristics similarly cadisch et al 2004 also stated that decaying tree roots create larger pores in a greater proportion that improve the soil hydraulic conductivity 3 3 correlation of shc k 0 with different biophysical properties the correlation coefficients were analyzed to assess the differential effect of bamboo species on soil s hydraulic properties the shc values represented in this study as k 0 were correlated with bulk density soc aggregate mwd total root biomass and leaf litter dry weight fig 5 as expected bulk density which is an indirect estimate of total porosity was weekly and negatively correlated with k 0 values fig 5a a higher total porosity lower bulk density may not always be related to higher hydraulic conductivity as the water transmission occurs with connected pores rather than the total amount of pores some of the soil pores may be constricted or blind ended hence the continuous ones can only effectively contribute to the water transmission in soil the soc had a weak correlation with k 0 values fig 5b the interspaces of bamboo clumps were mechanically ploughed to suppress the weeds mounding operations were also performed to support the emerging culms therefore the weak correlation is related to soil disturbance due to the regular intercultural operation resulting in higher organic matter decomposition and subsequent carbon loss to the atmosphere soil aggregate mwd and root biomass were found to have a significant p 0 05 and positive correlation with k 0 values fig 5c d water stable aggregate is critical for pore space infiltration physical protection of organic matter root growth and is vital for influencing soil hydrological properties carter 2004 paudel et al 2011 the macrostructure of topsoil may be improved in two ways by higher root biomass firstly the root itself may create higher macroporosity due to the development of bigger pores kargas et al 2016 and schmitt et al 1999 also found that the aboveground stems and roots can lessen the runoff and sedimentation by improving soil infiltration rate second root biomass has also been found to enhance the soil aggregation process due to the root binding effect beven and germann 1982 burri et al 2009 kaushal et al 2020a pohl et al 2009 tewari et al 2019 kukal and bawa 2008 and saha et al 2007 also found higher soil mwd and macro aggregates under different tree plantations these results indicated that the formation of inter aggregate pores with greater aggregate mwd in turn improves hydraulic conductivity the surface soil bamboo roots can thus be a vital factor controlling hydraulic properties there was a positive but weak correlation between the leaf litter dry weight and the k 0 values fig 5e a similar and positive correlation was stated by hiraoka and onda 2012 in moso bamboo on the contrary they observed a better correlation between infiltration capacity and litter cover area rather than the dry litter weight in this study even though the litter cover area was not measured it was hypothesized that d hamiltonii due to its broader leaves table 1 may cover a larger area as compared with the other species and therefore enhances biological activity beneath the litter layer thereby increasing the infiltration capacity through bigger bio pores the topsoil may also be protected by the larger litter cover area from direct rainfall impact thereby preventing the topsoil sealing preserving the macropores and facilitating the higher hydraulic conductivity 4 conclusions the impact of bamboo species on soil hydraulic properties is an important aspect of the bamboo plantation s eco hydrology as it affects the runoff soil erosion and overall water balance of bamboo dominated land use systems results revealed that there were considerable differences in surface hydraulic conductivity and macropore characteristics among the different bamboo species in terms of shc macropore hydraulic flux and water conducting macroporosity the studied bamboo species trends were d hamiltonii d strictus b vulgaris b balcooa correlation analysis revealed that higher root biomass and aggregate mean weight diameter were the determining factors for the improvement of soil hydraulic properties in near saturated conditions higher root biomass and improved soil aggregation increased the connected macropores thereby improving the surface soil hydraulic conductivity overall among the species evaluated d hamiltonii was found to be a promising species for improvement of soil hydro physical quality and is therefore recommended for reducing runoff controlling soil erosion and improving the groundwater recharge of an area with similar soil and climatic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

981,the paper deals with the long term and seasonal variability of low flows using the example of a mountain river the study covers the laborec river in the eastern part of slovakia and the main aim of the research is to identify and establish long term fluctuations of low flows on this river the analysis aims to indicate trends of low flows and seasonal variability of outflows based on various measures and research methods as well as the links between them basic data on daily flow and precipitation series were collected from 1980 to 2019 low flow periods were identified in relation to the fitting of the threshold level method to the 70th and 95th percentile on the flow duration curve as a constant multi annual cut off q70 q95 the longest lasting flows were those below q70 which were determined in the shallow cut offs that occurred for most of the year i e from june to december and in january the greatest culmination of flows below q95 was in august and september the range of minimal unit outflow is the smallest in the summer autumn period and results from long periods without precipitation and with increased evapotranspiration the highest range of unit outflow was recorded from december to april knowledge of low river flows should be one of the important elements of advanced planning which in the future may help to reduce conflicts between water users during

the most important tributaries of the laborec are the river uh and cirocha the laborec catchment is asymmetric with left sided tributaries dominating over right sided ones the upper and eastern part of the laborec river catchment is built of the magura nappe group of the flysch belt external western carpatians crystalline massifs the lower part of the catchment area is made up of neogene and quaternary deposits with greater substrate permeability bezák et al 2011 the humenne hydrological station covers a catchment area of 1 321 63 km2 which accounts for 29 22 of the total basin while the izkovce station covers a catchment area of the laborec of 4 350 86 km2 accounting for 96 2 of the entire basin the water with increased surface from the left hand side has a mean overflow which in the analysed multilayer flowed at 12 63 m3 s 1 at the humenne station and 50 07 m3 s 1 at the izkovce station table 1 as the catchment area increases the average flow is recorded which in the analysed

hydrometeorological institute shmi in bratislava were used the study included two water level gauge profiles located on the laborec the study was carried out in relation to the hydrological year which in slovakia lasts from 1 november to 31 october of the following year monthly and annual averages were calculated based on daily values in order to identify changes in low flows of the river along its course the data were analysed statistically which included determining the data homogeneity and detecting trends until the completion of the low water flow data related to the code values of hydrological flows from 1980 2019 were obtained from the slovak hydrometeorological institute in bratislava we will be working on two hydrological stations located on the laborec river for characterization of meteorological conditions data on atmospheric precipitation were used for three meteorological stations kamenica nad cirochou medzilaborce and michalovce 2 2 1 statistical data homogeneity the statistical homogeneity of the data was determined using the non parametric kruskal wallis test known as the rank sum test this involved ordering and assigning a rank to the items of all samples and then determining the sum of ranks for each sample if the verified hypothesis h0 that all samples derive from a single general population i e that they are homogenous is true then the sum of ranks for individual samples should not differ significantly the x2 statistic used in this test has an asymptotic distribution with k 1 degrees of freedom for the assumed significance level α and for k 1 degrees of freedom the critical value x2 is read from the pearson x2 distribution table such that p x2 xα2 α if the calculated value of statistics x2 xα2 then the h0 hypothesis should be rejected whereas if x2 xα2 then there is no reason to reject the h0 hypothesis indicating that all the samples are homogenous the null hypothesis h0 was verified as significant at α 0 05 2 2 2

the minimum annual and monthly flows were determined along with their trends in the multiannual period 1980 2019 the non parametric mann kendall test was used to detect a trend in hydrological time series to determine low water levels the limit value of the flow was used corresponding to the 70th and 95th percentiles of the flow duration curve along with the higher ones determined on the basis of daily values for the entire multiannual period the flow with a probability of 70 is the limit value for the shallow low flow and is most often used in hydrological studies fleig et al 2006 marx et al 2018 to identify a deep low flow a flow with a probability of q95 was assumed which indicates the depletion of renewable water resources in the active water exchange zone and corresponds well with biological indices tomaszewski 2012 dakova et al 2000 the following quantitative parameters describing its size were selected for the assessment of the hydrological low flow minimum flow qmin and duration of the low flow tn low flows of the river were converted into specific values in dm3 s 1 km 2 which made it possible to compare the results for catchments of different sizes nq the seasonality of the low flow was assessed using the gmo seasonality index used by oliver 1980 to determine the distribution of rainfall throughout the year this indicator was adopted by soya 2002 to determine the concentration of the hydrological regime the gmo indicator used by jokiel and tomalski 2017 was the concentration of the average monthly runoff for 12 carpathian rivers after transforming the formula for low flow purposes for q70 and q95 the modified gmo index equation is as shown in the equation which reads 3 g m o j i 1 12 l q m i 2 i 1 12 l q m i 2 100 where gmo j index

low flow system it indicates the limitations resulting from the lack of power supply during long periods without precipitation and the dominant supply of underground water the minimum flow value can also be modified by such factors as lakes wetlands or forest retention this may depend on some operations related to water management especially below dams due to guaranteed flow tomaszewski 2012 the distribution of the annual flow minima of the laborec river is characterised by strong variability fig 3 the lowest values of low unit outflow nnq at both stations were similar 0 41 dm3 s 1 km 2 for the humenne station and 0 56 dm3 s 1 km 2 for the izkovce station respectively the average and the highest values from among the minimum outflows were characterised by greater variation average values of low outflow in the analysed period ranged from 1 28 dm3 s 1 km 2 upper course to 2 75 dm3 s 1 km 2 in the izkovce profile lower course at the humenne station the highest low outflow wnq was 2 74 dm3 s 1 km 2 while in the izkovce station 4 39 dm3 s 1 km 2 differences in the size of the low unit outflow are due to the fact that the laborec river receives water rich tributaries in the section between the humenne and izkovce stations this area is more fully supplied with groundwater due to its geological structure fig 3 shows a linear trend of low annual outflows which is a regression function low annual flows in 1980 and 2019 indicate a slight upward trend at humenne station while at izkovce station the trend is clearly declining to detect low flow trends in hydrological time series a non parametric mann kendall test was used in the analysis of long term variability of low flows the existence of a linear trend at the level of significance α 0 05 was checked a statistically significant downward trend was detected for the course of low flows at the izkovce hydrological station in the case of humenne station the upward trend was not detected table 3 3 2 low and severe low flow in 1980 and 2019 the non cancellable periods were identified on the basis of the boundary flow method where the order of cut off was taken as the flow corresponding to the 70th and 95th percentile of the flow duration curve with the higher ones determined on the basis of daily values for the entire 1980 2019 period table 4 the criterion for the occurrence of mild hydrological drought shallow includes flows below the limit value corresponding to the 70th percentile of the flow duration curve q70 in turn the limit values for the occurrence of deep drought are based on q95 the adopted limit values are the recommended limits for determining the subcutaneous flows in long hydrological data sets tallaksen and van lannen 2004 tomaszewski 2012 tokarczyk 2013 flow limits for individual stations are presented in table 4 fig 4 shows the number of days with flows below q70 and q95 the average number of days with shallow lowering below q70 between 1980 and 2019 is at a similar level 108 days at humenne station and 110 days at izkovce station this means that the number of days with steady flow lowering is about 30 per year it is noteworthy that the number of days with shallow cut offs varies between years the majority of the days with shallow flow were recorded at the humenne station in the years 1980 2004 while at the izkovce station a significantly higher number of days occurred in the years 2007 2019 the maximum long term low flows which lasted for more than half of the year more than 200 days occurred in 1987 and were recorded at both stations at the humenne station the flows below q70 lasted 221 days while at the izkovce station 232 days the number of days with low flows that lasted more than 200 were also recorded in 2015 221 days and 2019 240 days and were recorded only at the izkovce station in 2010 which was considered to be one of the extremely wet years in europe hänsel 2020 kubiak wójcicka 2020 days with shallow low flows occurred exclusively at the izkovce station while at the humenne station no flows below q70 were recorded the threshold value of the deep subcutane q95 was 1 34 dm3 s 1 km 2 at the humenne station while in izkovce it was 2 59 dm3 s 1 km 2 and is half that of low flow severe low flow appeared with less frequency than low flow despite the fact that the average number of such days in the analysed period was the same at both stations about 18 days the number of days with deep low flows in particular years showed greater disproportions fig 5 the increase in the number of days with deep low flows at izkovce station since 2009 is noteworthy since 2009 the number of days with deep low flows below q95 at the izkovce station has increased significantly this may be associated with a change in conditions within the catchment area or a higher water intake in this section the reasons for this state of affairs among others are the control of water management on the rivers water regulation through hydrotechnical structures and water discharges the construction of a reservoir named starina on the left bank tributary of the laborec the cirocha river most likely had an impact on the alimentation of low flows of the laborec river this reservoir was built between 1983 1989 storage volume is 45 03 million cubic m fendek 2018 the flow of the laborec below the humenne station is influenced by the large zemplinska sirava reservoir which was built between 1961 1965 beran 2020 the water volume is 185 million cubic m the water from the reservoir is used for irrigation of areas of the east slovak lowland which is intensively used for agriculture the increase in the number of days with low flows on the laborec river may be caused by water intake for cooling of the vojany power plant 3 3 monthly variability of low flows seasonality of hydrological features is one of the key factors that control the development and stability of natural ecosystems parajka et al 2009 kubiak wójcicka 2020 the distribution of annual minimum outflows is characterised by strong variability during the year fig 6 the highest minimum flow exceeded 20 dm3 s 1 km 2 at the izkovce station while at humenne station it exceeded 17 dm3 s 1 km 2 the lowest minimum flow was 0 56 dm3 s 1 km 2 izkovce and 0 54 dm3 s 1 km 2 humenne particularly noteworthy is the wide range of low flows in individual months the highest range of low individual outflows occurred in february and was 18 96 dm3 s 1 km 2 in the izkovce profile while in the humenne profile it was 15 4 dm3 s 1 km 2 and took place in march the large range of the minimum unit outflows in these months is due to the supply of the river through melting snow in recent years there has been a noticeable increase in air temperature in the winter months which causes accelerated snow melting and thus contributes to a greater supply of rivers this is confirmed by the mk trend analysis which showed a statistically significant upward trend of minimum flows in february at the izkovce station in the summer autumn period the range of the minimum unit outflow is the smallest which is due to long periods without precipitation and increased evapotranspiration in the months of june july september and october a statistically significant downward trend of the minimum flows was detected at the izkovce station it is worth noting that the wide interquartile range together with the range of interquartile deviations indicates the predominance of natural or quasi natural factors determining the formation of low flows in the catchment a very narrow range is determined primarily by water management systems and units which manifest themselves in stable or systematic activities 3 4 seasonality of low and severe low flows seasonal analysis of the variability of low flows is extremely important in terms of rational water management depending on the water demand the periods in which the water supply of main sectors of the national economy is particularly important are determined establishing the period with low flows during the year is therefore important in the economic use of water resources e g in the vegetation period for agriculture to determine the seasonal variability of low flows the seasonality index otherwise known as the index of concentration of flows characteristic of shallow gmo70 and deep gmo95 low flows was used figs 7 and 8 the results of the gmo index range from 8 3 to 100 its hydrological interpretation indicates that the absolute lack of seasonality of low flows means that all 12 values of monthly minimum flows are equal the index is 8 3 theoretically if a low flow occurs in only 1 month the index value reaches 100 which means absolute concentration of low flow seasonality indexes estimated for shallow low flow q70 of the examined sections ranged from 11 65 izkovce to 13 07 humenne while for the deep low flow humenne they ranged from 15 99 izkovce to 18 89 humenne this means that the concentration of days with shallow low flow took place in about 11 months whereas with deep low flows about 10 months a year for comparison tomaszewski and kubiak wojcicka who calculated the gmo index for low flow in 17 selected rivers in poland between 1951 and 2015 received results in the range 8 6 11 6 tomaszewski and kubiak wójcicka 2021 this indicates that mountain rivers have a higher level of seasonality of low flows than lowland rivers in the analysed years we can observe that there were years in which the concentration of days with low flows was much higher this is especially visible in the cases of the deep low flows which occurred in 1984 1990 1994 1995 and 2014 at the izkovce station gmo 100 a smaller number of years with a 100 concentration of deep sedimentation was observed at humenne hydrological station 1993 2000 2013 and 2014 interestingly concentration of deep sedimentation at both stations took place simultaneously only in 2014 this should be related to the regulation of outflow through reservoirs located on the laborec river tributaries the results obtained by means of the gmo indicator confirm the graphs of the distribution of the number of days with shallow and deep sedimentation fig 9 the highest number of days with flows below q70 was recorded in most of the year except for the period from february to april at the izkovce station while at the humenne station from february to may on average in many years the shallow low flows lasted about 50 of days per month and were most frequent from july to october in the remaining months the average number of days with flows below q70 occupied less than 30 of the days in the month or did not occur at all april in the case of deep sedimentation q95 the maximum number of days with flows below q95 was recorded in january and from july to december the average number of days with deep sedimentation in the studied period was recorded in august and september 3 5 discussion the analysis of low flows on the laborec river showed differentiated values on a multiannual and seasonal basis at individual hydrological stations while the values of low annual and monthly flows at humenne station did not show any statistically significant trends in the case of the izkovce station the low flows of laborec river showed a clear and statistically significant downward trend the results obtained for the izkovce station coincide with the data presented by zeleňáková et al 2014 for eastern slovakia the analysis of water balance components carried out by fendeková et al 2018 for the period 1931 2016 showed that due to increasing air temperature and evapotranspiration there is a decrease in outflow in slovakia the application of trend detection in eastern slovakia has led to the identification of several rising significant trends in precipitation but more clearly rising significant trends in temperature data labudová et al 2015 zeleňáková et al 2018 the decreasing trend of low outflows should be associated with the amount and distribution of precipitation the driest year during the analysed period was 2015 when the lowest annual amounts of precipitation were recorded in the laborec catchment area as well as 2003 these years recorded some of the lowest precipitation since 1901 in central europe orth et al 2016 research conducted by floriancic et al 2020 for river basins in switzerland between 2000 2018 showed that typical low flows in all the observed years were more strongly correlated with precipitation anomalies than with evapotranspiration anomalies however in the driest years 2003 2011 2015 and 2018 the correlation between precipitation anomalies and low flows decreased to about zero suggesting that under these extreme conditions low precipitation alone cannot explain the differences in annual low flows floriancic et al 2020 analysis of seasonal variability of low flows of the laborec river indicated that in the summer autumn months a statistically significant downward trend of minimum flows was detected at the izkovce station this applies especially to the summer months when river flows are usually low the research carried out by repel et al 2020 in the poprad catchment area showed that the number of rainy days has been decreasing in recent years but the maximum intensity of rainfall is increasing from year to year in the case of the laborec river catchment area there was a correlation between the number of days without rainfall so called 0 rainfall and the number of days with flows below q70 and q95 tables 5 and 6 the highest correlation coefficients were obtained in the months of the summer half year at humenne station the greater strength of correlation was between the number of days with flows below q70 and the number of days with 0 precipitation a correlation coefficient above 0 4 was recorded from june to october except in august in the case of days with flows below q95 this relation was much weaker which may indicate the influence of other factors determining low flows in this period greater variation of the correlation coefficient in particular months was obtained at the izkovce station the statistical significance of pearson s r correlation coefficient was determined on the basis of the linearly interpolated critical value df 38 α 0 05 from the statistical table included in the book by runge 2007 the presented results of seasonality of low flows refer to seasonal changes in flows in multi year periods carried out by other authors periods with low flows coincide with droughts which were determined by vido et al 2019 using a standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the analysis of spei trends showed an increase in drought trends in the period from april to august which posed a serious threat to the development of the agricultural sector in slovakia an additional factor influencing the amount of low outflow is anthropogenic activities carried out within a catchment area such as water intake for economic purposes and control of water management within water bodies kohnová et al 2019 point out that the amount of outflow in the laborec river catchment may be affected by changes in land use the pressure to which water resources are subjected is increasing and often leads to a decrease in available water resources kubiak wójcicka 2020 the results of research conducted by roňcák et al 2019 in the laborec catchment area indicate the need to reassess the water demand and the future design of water management structures in slovakia a period of low flows usually occurs when there is the greatest competition for water between river flow needs and non river users bradford and heinonen 2008 episodes of low flow can seriously hamper water management tasks and during severe hydrological drought can lead to serious social economic and environmental consequences drought sene 2010 it is therefore necessary to continuously monitor changes in low flows in order to capture disturbing trends so that appropriate remedial measures actions can be taken in the catchment area planning and management phase it will also be useful in the process of river restoration planning wyżga et al 2020 4 conclusion the study analysed the low flows of the laborec river at two hydrological stations in period 1980 2019 during the 40 year research period it was found that the size of the low flows varies depending on the analysed hydrological stations the conducted research indicates the possibility of more frequent occurrence of low flows which is closely related to meteorological conditions within the catchment area and human activity the analysis of minimal flows of the laborec river allowed the long term and seasonal periods of water shortage to be identified the greatest water shortages occurred in the summer autumn period when the range of minimum flows was the lowest and the number of days with flows below q70 was the highest the key months in this period were august and september which had the longest flows below q95 this is of great importance for the functioning of water ecosystems and the use of water resources by various sectors of the national economy e g water supply agriculture or energy the winter spring period is characterised by a larger range of minimum outflows understanding the regime and characteristics of low flows is essential for effective planning design construction maintenance use and management of different water management systems and structures knowledge of low river flows should be one of the important elements of advanced planning that can help reduce conflicts between water users in the future actively responding to climate threats by improving current management practices may be among the most efficient of these elements the results should improve forecasting methods for small flows and support the implementation of water scarcity mitigation strategies such actions will help to reduce

981,the paper deals with the long term and seasonal variability of low flows using the example of a mountain river the study covers the laborec river in the eastern part of slovakia and the main aim of the research is to identify and establish long term fluctuations of low flows on this river the analysis aims to indicate trends of low flows and seasonal variability of outflows based on various measures and research methods as well as the links between them basic data on daily flow and precipitation series were collected from 1980 to 2019 low flow periods were identified in relation to the fitting of the threshold level method to the 70th and 95th percentile on the flow duration curve as a constant multi annual cut off q70 q95 the longest lasting flows were those below q70 which were determined in the shallow cut offs that occurred for most of the year i e from june to december and in january the greatest culmination of flows below q95 was in august and september the range of minimal unit outflow is the smallest in the summer autumn period and results from long periods without precipitation and with increased evapotranspiration the highest range of unit outflow was recorded from december to april knowledge of low river flows should be one of the important elements of advanced planning which in the future may help to reduce conflicts between water users during the peak demand period keywords low flow hydrological drought laborec river slovakia 1 introduction periods of low flow which depend mainly on climatic conditions are an integral part of the

and semi arid areas and in the mediterranean climate zone tal et al 2010 stubbington et al 2018 research carried out in recent years indicates that the disappearance of river flows is an increasingly common phenomenon in the rivers of temperate european climate datry et al 2018 it is mainly observed in short rivers which are not covered by systematic hydrological observations rutkowska et al 2018 solarczyk and kubiak wójcicka 2019 a lack of flow in small watercourses may result in low flows or may also lead to temporary disappearance of the flow of recipient rivers recycler future climate changes may lead to more intense hydrological cycle processes according to the latest climate change scenarios described by the intergovernmental panel on the fourth assessment report on climate change ipcc 2013 air temperature will continue to rise with increased precipitation variability the increase in air temperature will increase the rate of evapotranspiration and accelerate the water cycle increased evaporation in summer will most likely cause more frequent and more intense low flow conditions such changes increase the risk of extremely low flows and droughts which are critical

separating subcompensatory periods is the threshold level method tlm which is based on the assumption that the subcompensatory period is the period in which the flows are equal to or lower than the accepted threshold level yevjevich 1967 tomaszewski 2012 the threshold level can be established in many ways statistical hydrological and economic criteria may be the basis for selecting the method of

useful tool to support the assessment of water management facilities and facilities dependent on river flow variability tomaszewski 2014 the analysis of a low flow regime is very important not only for research but also for practical purposes the results of such analyses are also highly useful in water management planning the main research goal is the identification and stabilization of multi year fluctuations in the low flows of the laborec river the analysis aims to show trends in low flows and the variability of seasonal runoff in the care of various measures and methods of research and the connection between them the proposed patterns of changes in low flows on the example of a mountain river may provide for the transfer of a number of different studies and simulations of models for

austria fig 1 slovakia covers an area of 49 035 km2 80 of which is located at an altitude over 720 m a s l fendeková et al 2018 as a case study the selected laborec river is located in the eastern part of the country the laborec is a river of the bodrog river system its catchment area is 4 522 km2 and it is characterised by a large network 1 01 km km 2 the average elevation is at 675 5 m a s l the most important tributaries of the laborec are the river uh and cirocha the laborec catchment is asymmetric with left sided tributaries dominating over right sided ones the upper and eastern part of the laborec river catchment is built of the magura nappe group of the flysch belt external western carpatians crystalline massifs the lower part of the catchment area is made up of neogene and quaternary deposits with greater substrate permeability bezák et al 2011 the humenne hydrological station covers a catchment area of 1 321 63 km2 which accounts for 29 22 of the total basin while the izkovce station covers a catchment area of the laborec of 4 350 86 km2 accounting for 96 2 of the entire basin the water with increased surface from the left hand side has a mean overflow which in the analysed multilayer flowed at 12 63 m3 s 1 at the humenne station and 50 07 m3 s 1 at the izkovce station table 1 as the catchment area increases the average flow is recorded which in the analysed multiyear period was 12 63 m3 s 1 at the humenne station and 50 07 m3 s 1 at the izkovce station table 1 annual precipitation in the laborec river catchment area shows significant time and spatial variation higher precipitation is recorded at the rainfall stations kamenica nad cirochou medzilaborce and michalovce located in the northern and eastern part of the laborec river catchment area from 800 to 1000 mm per year while in the southern part of the catchment below the humenne station the average annual precipitation is lower ranging from 600 to 700 mm per year zeleňáková et al 2017 kubiak wójcicka et al 2019 an analysis of precipitation for only three meteorological stations located in different parts of the catchment between 1980 and 2019 showed significant variation in the average annual amounts of rainfall which ranged from 641 2 mm to 857 8 mm during the analysed period 1980 2019 the highest annual amounts of precipitation were recorded in 2010 at all three meteorological stations while the lowest precipitation was recorded in 2003 kamenica and 2015 medzilaborce and michalovce table 2 the course of annual precipitation for the three meteorological stations located in the laborec river catchment area between 1980 and 2019 is presented in fig 2 2 2 data to determine low flow data on daily flow values from the hydrological years 1980 2019 obtained from the slovak hydrometeorological institute shmi in bratislava were used the study included two water level gauge profiles located on the laborec the study was carried out in relation to the hydrological year which in slovakia lasts from 1 november to 31 october of the following year monthly and annual averages were calculated based on daily values in order to identify changes in low flows of the river along its course the data were analysed statistically which included determining the data homogeneity and detecting trends until the completion of the low water flow data related to the code values of hydrological flows from 1980 2019 were obtained from the slovak hydrometeorological institute in bratislava we will be working on two hydrological stations located on the laborec river for characterization of meteorological conditions data on atmospheric precipitation were used for three meteorological stations kamenica nad cirochou medzilaborce and michalovce 2 2 1 statistical data homogeneity the statistical homogeneity of the data was determined using the non parametric kruskal wallis test known as the rank sum test this involved ordering and assigning a rank to the items of all samples and then determining the sum of ranks for each sample if the verified hypothesis h0 that all samples derive from a single general population i e that they are homogenous is true then the sum of ranks for individual samples should not differ significantly the x2 statistic used in this test has an asymptotic distribution with k 1 degrees of freedom for the assumed significance level α and for k 1 degrees of freedom the critical value x2 is read from the pearson x2 distribution table such that p x2 xα2 α if the calculated value of statistics x2 xα2 then the h0 hypothesis should be rejected whereas if x2 xα2 then there is no reason to reject the h0 hypothesis indicating that all the samples are homogenous the null hypothesis h0 was verified as significant at α 0 05 2 2 2 detecting trends the non parametric mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is commonly used in hydrological analyses was used to track changes in river outflow trends mann kendall statistics and the β directional coefficient expressed by the theil sen estimator theil 1950 sen 1968 were calculated for periods covering every possible combination of start and end years for the multi year research period the minimum length of calculation period was 30 years as per the standard for hydrological calculations burn and elnur 2002 hannaford et al 2013 mann kendall s statistics were

the formula 5 β median x j x k j k a positive β value indicates an upward increasing trend and a negative value indicates a downward decreasing trend in a time series 2 3 methods in this paper first the minimum annual and monthly flows were determined along with their trends in the multiannual period 1980 2019 the non parametric mann kendall test was used to detect a trend in hydrological time series to determine low water levels the limit value of the flow was used corresponding to the 70th and 95th percentiles of the flow duration curve along with the higher ones determined on the basis of daily values for the entire multiannual period the flow with a probability of 70 is the limit value for the shallow low flow and is most often used in hydrological studies fleig et al 2006 marx et al 2018 to identify a deep low flow a flow with a probability of q95 was assumed which indicates the depletion of renewable water resources in the active water exchange zone and corresponds well with biological indices tomaszewski 2012 dakova et al 2000 the following quantitative parameters describing its size were selected for the assessment of the hydrological low flow minimum flow qmin and duration of the low flow tn low flows of the river were converted into specific values in dm3 s 1 km 2 which made it possible to compare the results for catchments of different sizes nq the seasonality of the low flow was assessed using the gmo seasonality index used by oliver 1980 to determine the distribution of rainfall throughout the year this indicator was adopted by soya 2002 to determine the concentration of the hydrological regime the gmo indicator used by jokiel and tomalski 2017 was the concentration of the average monthly runoff for 12 carpathian rivers after transforming the formula for low flow purposes for q70 and q95 the modified gmo index equation is as shown in the equation which reads 3 g m o j i 1 12 l q m i 2 i 1 12 l q m i 2 100 where gmo j index

low flow system it indicates the limitations resulting from the lack of power supply during long periods without precipitation and the dominant supply of underground water the minimum flow value can also be modified by such factors as lakes wetlands or forest retention this may depend on some operations related to water management especially below dams due to guaranteed flow tomaszewski 2012 the distribution of the annual flow minima of the laborec river is characterised by strong variability fig 3 the lowest values of low unit outflow nnq at both stations were similar 0 41 dm3 s 1 km 2 for the humenne station and 0 56 dm3 s 1 km 2 for the izkovce station respectively the average and the highest values from among the minimum outflows were characterised by greater variation average values of low outflow in the analysed period ranged from 1 28 dm3 s 1 km 2 upper course to 2 75 dm3 s 1 km 2 in the izkovce profile lower course at the humenne station the highest low outflow wnq was 2 74 dm3 s 1 km 2 while in the izkovce station 4 39 dm3 s 1 km 2 differences in the size of the low unit outflow are due to the fact that the laborec river receives water rich tributaries in the section between the humenne and izkovce stations this area is more fully supplied with groundwater due to its geological structure fig 3 shows a linear trend of low annual outflows which is a regression function low annual flows in 1980 and 2019 indicate a slight upward trend at humenne station while at izkovce station the trend is clearly declining to detect low flow trends in hydrological time series a non parametric mann kendall test was used in the analysis of long term variability of low flows the existence of a linear trend at the level of significance α 0 05 was checked a statistically significant downward trend was detected for the course of low flows at the izkovce hydrological station in the case of humenne station the upward trend was not detected table 3 3 2 low and severe low flow in 1980 and 2019 the non cancellable periods were identified on the basis of the boundary flow method where the order of cut off was taken as the flow corresponding to the 70th and 95th percentile of the flow duration curve with the higher ones determined on the basis of daily values for the entire 1980 2019 period table 4 the criterion for the occurrence of mild hydrological drought shallow includes flows below the limit value corresponding to the 70th percentile of the flow duration curve q70 in turn the limit values for the occurrence of deep drought are based on q95 the adopted limit values are the recommended limits for determining the subcutaneous flows in long hydrological data sets tallaksen and van lannen 2004 tomaszewski 2012 tokarczyk 2013 flow limits for individual stations are presented in table 4 fig 4 shows the number of days with flows below q70 and q95 the average number of days with shallow lowering below q70 between 1980 and 2019 is at a similar level 108 days at humenne station and 110 days at izkovce station this means that the number of days with steady flow lowering is about 30 per year it is noteworthy that the number of days with shallow cut offs varies between years the majority of the days with shallow flow were recorded at the humenne station in the years 1980 2004 while at the izkovce station a significantly higher number of days occurred in the years 2007 2019 the maximum long term low flows which lasted for more than half of the year more than 200 days occurred in 1987 and were recorded at both stations at the humenne station the flows below q70 lasted 221 days while at the izkovce station 232 days the number of days with low flows that lasted more than 200 were also recorded in 2015 221 days and 2019 240 days and were recorded only at the izkovce station in 2010 which was considered to be one of the extremely wet years in europe hänsel 2020 kubiak wójcicka 2020 days with shallow low flows occurred exclusively at the izkovce station while at the humenne station no flows below q70 were recorded the threshold value of the deep subcutane q95 was 1 34 dm3 s 1 km 2 at the humenne station while in izkovce it was 2 59 dm3 s 1 km 2 and is half that of low flow severe low flow appeared with less frequency than low flow despite the fact that the average number of such days in the analysed period was the same at both stations about 18 days the number of days with deep low flows in particular years showed greater disproportions fig 5 the increase in the number of days with deep low flows at izkovce station since 2009 is noteworthy since 2009 the number of days with deep low flows below q95 at the izkovce station has increased significantly this may be associated with a change in conditions within the catchment area or a higher water intake in this section the reasons for this state of affairs among others are the control of water management on the rivers water regulation through hydrotechnical structures and water discharges the construction of a reservoir named starina on the left bank tributary of the laborec the cirocha river most likely had an impact on the alimentation of low flows of the laborec river this reservoir was built between 1983 1989 storage volume is 45 03 million cubic m fendek 2018 the flow of the laborec below the humenne station is influenced by the large zemplinska sirava reservoir which was built between 1961 1965 beran 2020 the water volume is 185 million cubic m the water from the reservoir is used for irrigation of areas of the east slovak lowland which is intensively used for agriculture the increase in the number of days with low flows on the laborec river may be caused by water intake for cooling of the vojany power plant 3 3 monthly variability of low flows seasonality of hydrological features is one of the key factors that control the development and stability of natural ecosystems parajka et al 2009 kubiak wójcicka 2020 the distribution of annual minimum outflows is characterised by strong variability during the year fig 6 the highest minimum flow exceeded 20 dm3 s 1 km 2 at the izkovce station while at humenne station it exceeded 17 dm3 s 1 km 2 the lowest minimum flow was 0 56 dm3 s 1 km 2 izkovce and 0 54 dm3 s 1 km 2 humenne particularly noteworthy is the wide range of low flows in individual months the highest range of low individual outflows occurred in february and was 18 96 dm3 s 1 km 2 in the izkovce profile while in the humenne profile it was 15 4 dm3 s 1 km 2 and took place in march the large range of the minimum unit outflows in these months is due to the supply of the river through melting snow in recent years there has been a noticeable increase in air temperature in the winter months which causes accelerated snow melting and thus contributes to a greater supply of rivers this is confirmed by the mk trend analysis which showed a statistically significant upward trend of minimum flows in february at the izkovce station in the summer autumn period the range of the minimum unit outflow is the smallest which is due to long periods without precipitation and increased evapotranspiration in the months of june july september and october a statistically significant downward trend of the minimum flows was detected at the izkovce station it is worth noting that the wide interquartile range together with the range of interquartile deviations indicates the predominance of natural or quasi natural factors determining the formation of low flows in the catchment a very narrow range is determined primarily by water management systems and units which manifest themselves in stable or systematic activities 3 4 seasonality of low and severe low flows seasonal analysis of the variability of low flows is extremely important in terms of rational water management depending on the water demand the periods in which the water supply of main sectors of the national economy is particularly important are determined establishing the period with low flows during the year is therefore important in the economic use of water resources e g in the vegetation period for agriculture to determine the seasonal variability of low flows the seasonality index otherwise known as the index of concentration of flows characteristic of shallow gmo70 and deep gmo95 low flows was used figs 7 and 8 the results of the gmo index range from 8 3 to 100 its hydrological interpretation indicates that the absolute lack of seasonality of low flows means that all 12 values of monthly minimum flows are equal the index is 8 3 theoretically if a low flow occurs in only 1 month the index value reaches 100 which means absolute concentration of low flow seasonality indexes estimated for shallow low flow q70 of the examined sections ranged from 11 65 izkovce to 13 07 humenne while for the deep low flow humenne they ranged from 15 99 izkovce to 18 89 humenne this means that the concentration of days with shallow low flow took place in about 11 months whereas with deep low flows about 10 months a year for comparison tomaszewski and kubiak wojcicka who calculated the gmo index for low flow in 17 selected rivers in poland between 1951 and 2015 received results in the range 8 6 11 6 tomaszewski and kubiak wójcicka 2021 this indicates that mountain rivers have a higher level of seasonality of low flows than lowland rivers in the analysed years we can observe that there were years in which the concentration of days with low flows was much higher this is especially visible in the cases of the deep low flows which occurred in 1984 1990 1994 1995 and 2014 at the izkovce station gmo 100 a smaller number of years with a 100 concentration of deep sedimentation was observed at humenne hydrological station 1993 2000 2013 and 2014 interestingly concentration of deep sedimentation at both stations took place simultaneously only in 2014 this should be related to the regulation of outflow through reservoirs located on the laborec river tributaries the results obtained by means of the gmo indicator confirm the graphs of the distribution of the number of days with shallow and deep sedimentation fig 9 the highest number of days with flows below q70 was recorded in most of the year except for the period from february to april at the izkovce station while at the humenne station from february to may on average in many years the shallow low flows lasted about 50 of days per month and were most frequent from july to october in the remaining months the average number of days with flows below q70 occupied less than 30 of the days in the month or did not occur at all april in the case of deep sedimentation q95 the maximum number of days with flows below q95 was recorded in january and from july to december the average number of days with deep sedimentation in the studied period was recorded in august and september 3 5 discussion the analysis of low flows on the laborec river showed differentiated values on a multiannual and seasonal basis at individual hydrological stations while the values of low annual and monthly flows at humenne station did not show any statistically significant trends in the case of the izkovce station the low flows of laborec river showed a clear and statistically significant downward trend the results obtained for the izkovce station coincide with the data presented by zeleňáková et al 2014 for eastern slovakia the analysis of water balance components carried out by fendeková et al 2018 for the period 1931 2016 showed that due to increasing air temperature and evapotranspiration there is a decrease in outflow in slovakia the application of trend detection in eastern slovakia has led to the identification of several rising significant trends in precipitation but more clearly rising significant trends in temperature data labudová et al 2015 zeleňáková et al 2018 the decreasing trend of low outflows should be associated with the amount and distribution of precipitation the driest year during the analysed period was 2015 when the lowest annual amounts of precipitation were recorded in the laborec catchment area as well as 2003 these years recorded some of the lowest precipitation since 1901 in central europe orth et al 2016 research conducted by floriancic et al 2020 for river basins in switzerland between 2000 2018 showed that typical low flows in all the observed years were more strongly correlated with precipitation anomalies than with evapotranspiration anomalies however in the driest years 2003 2011 2015 and 2018 the correlation between precipitation anomalies and low flows decreased to about zero suggesting that under these extreme conditions low precipitation alone cannot explain the differences in annual low flows floriancic et al 2020 analysis of seasonal variability of low flows of the laborec river indicated that in the summer autumn months a statistically significant downward trend of minimum flows was detected at the izkovce station this applies especially to the summer months when river flows are usually low the research carried out by repel et al 2020 in the poprad catchment area showed that the number of rainy days has been decreasing in recent years but the maximum intensity of rainfall is increasing from year to year in the case of the laborec river catchment area there was a correlation between the number of days without rainfall so called 0 rainfall and the number of days with flows below q70 and q95 tables 5 and 6 the highest correlation coefficients were obtained in the months of the summer half year at humenne station the greater strength of correlation was between the number of days with flows below q70 and the number of days with 0 precipitation a correlation coefficient above 0 4 was recorded from june to october except in august in the case of days with flows below q95 this relation was much weaker which may indicate the influence of other factors determining low flows in this period greater variation of the correlation coefficient in particular months was obtained at the izkovce station the statistical significance of pearson s r correlation coefficient was determined on the basis of the linearly interpolated critical value df 38 α 0 05 from the statistical table included in the book by runge 2007 the presented results of seasonality of low flows refer to seasonal changes in flows in multi year periods carried out by other authors periods with low flows coincide with droughts which were determined by vido et al 2019 using a standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the analysis of spei trends showed an increase in drought trends in the period from april to august which posed a serious threat to the development of the agricultural sector in slovakia an additional factor influencing the amount of low outflow is anthropogenic activities carried out within a catchment area such as water intake for economic purposes and control of water management within water bodies kohnová et al 2019 point out that the amount of outflow in the laborec river catchment may be affected by changes in land use the pressure to which water resources are subjected is increasing and often leads to a decrease in available water resources kubiak wójcicka 2020 the results of research conducted by roňcák et al 2019 in the laborec catchment area indicate the need to reassess the water demand and the future design of water management structures in slovakia a period of low flows usually occurs when there is the greatest competition for water between river flow needs and non river users bradford and heinonen 2008 episodes of low flow can seriously hamper water management tasks and during severe hydrological drought can lead to serious social economic and environmental consequences drought sene 2010 it is therefore necessary to continuously monitor changes in low flows in order to capture disturbing trends so that appropriate remedial measures actions can be taken in the catchment area planning and management phase it will also be useful in the process of river restoration planning wyżga et al 2020 4 conclusion the study analysed the low flows of the laborec river at two hydrological stations in period 1980 2019 during the 40 year research period it was found that the size of the low flows varies depending on the analysed hydrological stations the conducted research indicates the possibility of more frequent occurrence of low flows which is closely related to meteorological conditions within the catchment area and human activity the analysis of minimal flows of the laborec river allowed the long term and seasonal periods of water shortage to be identified the greatest water shortages occurred in the summer autumn period when the range of minimum flows was the lowest and the number of days with flows below q70 was the highest the key months in this period were august and september which had the longest flows below q95 this is of great importance for the functioning of water ecosystems and the use of water resources by various sectors of the national economy e g water supply agriculture or energy the winter spring period is characterised by a larger range of minimum outflows understanding the regime and characteristics of low flows is essential for effective planning design construction maintenance use and management of different water management systems and structures knowledge of low river flows should be one of the important elements of advanced planning that can help reduce conflicts between water users in the future actively responding to climate threats by improving current management practices may be among the most efficient of these elements the results should improve forecasting methods for small flows and support the implementation of water scarcity mitigation strategies such actions will help to reduce

982,in most of the basins due to the lack of sedimentation stations there is no accurate information on sediment deposition and soil erosion in such basins empirical models are used to estimate the sediment rate at the basin scale the applicability of these models is troublesome the objectives of this study were to determine the erosion status of the zarivar lake basin and to evaluate the efficiency of the factorial scoring model fsm in estimating the sediment rate physiological and hydrological characteristics of 10 sub basins of zarivar lake were obtained using field measurements and aerial data in the gis environment the specific weight of the sediments was calculated in the laboratory and used to determine the weight of sediments the sediment rate in sub basins was measured in situ furthermore by determining the effective parameters the sediment rate for each sub basin was obtained using fsm and the results were compared with the measured rate for the whole basin the average minimum and maximum rate of observed sediment were 0 28 0 007 and 1 17 m3 ha yr respectively however these rates were obtained by fsm as 103 70 20 90 and 365 m3 ha yr respectively which differed from the observed values based on the results the model is not sufficiently efficient to evaluate the sediment rate in the studied sub basins keywords sediment zarivar lake empirical model factorial scoring method check dam 1 introduction soil erosion and sedimentary processes are a real complicate issue which result from the interaction between various processes that are still incorrectly understood among the most crucial threats to ecosystem stability soil erosion was identified as one of the major soil threats to ecosystem stability alewell et al 2019 neyshabouri et al 2002 in the eu 0 43 of crop productivity loses annually due to 12 million ha of agricultural areas that suffer from severe erosion which causes around 1 25 billion as cost of this loss lópez vincente and wu 2019 large amounts of sediment are deposited annually in lakes rivers and dam reservoirs due to climate and human changes runoff and frequent flood lead to increase in watersheds which increase the soil erosion and sediment concentration neyshabouri et al 2002 the human made activities have intensified storm runoff and soil erosion in many watersheds amini et al 2014 amini et al 2009 to lessening the adverse effects of erosion it is necessary to take soil conservation measures katra 2020 provides a review and field experiments on soil erosion in semi arid soils by wind and dust emission due to human activities they clearly showed the response of dust emission to numerous land uses with agricultural activities in semi arid loess soils lake sediment and soil erosion are primary concerns of watershed managers around the world to support reduced sediment load into poyang lake and guide localized soil erosion control measures in a watershed system with limited available data yuan and forshay 2020 acknowledged high risk soil erosion areas and conditions that drive sediment yield intended zarivar lake is regarded as one of the most important wetland regions in south eastern corner in western iran solgi and mohamadi galangashi 2018 ebrahimi mohammadi et al 2012 evaluated suspended sediment runoff and nutrient yield from different tributaries to zarivar lake in base flows and flood they found that the maximum suspended sediments were yielded by western and northern parts of the watershed whereas the western parts of the watershed yielded the maximum phosphate to the zarivar lake the maximum contribution of runoff suspended sediments nitrate and phosphate were happened in spring and winter seasons respectively khaledian and habibi 2001 studied the erosion status of the watershed and sedimentation rate in the zarivar lake using aerial photos and watershed maps and utilizing epm and psiac models they reported that approximately 46 000 m3 of sediment is deposited in the lake annually this rate of deposition will affect the lake reservoir capacity particularly in the shallow part of the lake due to the lack of sedimentation stations at the outlet of the basins empirical models appear to be suitable tools for producing essential data for basins management khaledian et al 2017 most of the erosion models use environmental and basin factors to describe the basin in terms of sensitivity to erosion and sediment transport katra 2020 de vente and poesen 2005 at the basin scale the spatial configuration of local factors such as vegetation cover lithology and topography determine to what extent this is reflected in basin sediment yield ssy de vente and poesen 2005 for assessing sustainability in water resources the ssy has been considered as comprehensive index garg and jothiprakash 2012 vegetation cover is dominant factor in flood reduction and soil erosion in waterways shafaei et al 2019 a range of models is available to estimate soil erosion se and ssy some models such as pacific southwest inter agency committee psiac fsm vegetation surface material drainage density model vsd gavrilovic coleman and sactena scoring model cssm and wallingford scoring model wsm include sheet rill gully bank erosion landslides and connectivity at least partly in the assessment of basin sediment yield sediment deposition in dams and lakes reservoir is most vital as it reduces its useful life and impairs the aims of these enormous water resources hesami and amini 2016 one of the latest models to estimate the amount of sediment and erosion is factorial scoring model fsm khodami 2005 and gholami and mesri alamdari 2013 used this model and found that the fsm model has more suitable match than the psiac model ghahari et al 2018 evaluated the fsm performance using sediment survey of check dam reservoirs their results indicated that the uncalibrated fms model overestimated the sedimentation while the calibrated fms model showed a 75 agreement with observed data haregeweyn et al 2005 evaluated the fsm model in eight basins in the ethiopian region measuring the amount of sediment behind check dams the results indicated the accuracy of fsm model de vente et al 2006 recommended the landslide as the sixth factor to be added to the fsm and concluded that the landslide has a dominant role in soil erosion de vente et al 2013 used the data from 700 selected catchments and evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of 14 available models for soil erosion they mentioned that each model predicts precise sediment rate only when the considered processes are indeed dominant brooshkeh et al 2018 compared the efficiency of fsm mpsiac and psiac model to estimate sediment yield in small catchments with areas between 14 3 and 556 ha they used satellite images and field operations then found that the fsm model compared with the other two models had more errors and fsm has no efficiency in estimating the sediment of small watersheds it seems that the research community contemporaneously works for updating the existing empirical approaches and improving the applicability of complex process oriented models nachtergaele et al 2010 the present study aimed to investigate the sediment rate in the zarivar lake in addition the efficiency of the fsm model for estimating erosion rate and its sensitivity to determining factors in sedimentation were assessed using field measurements due to large dependency on water storage for irrigation and public water supplies reservoir sedimentation and erosion are acute problems in this area therefore the results of this research as a first attempt are vital for decision makers and researchers 2 methods and instrumentation 2 1 study area iran as an arid and semi arid area is faced with soil erosion challenges the zarivar lake basin is located between 46 4 51 e and 46 15 30 e longitude and 35 28 23 n and 35 36 30 n latitude it is located in the northwest of kurdistan province in iran and covers an area of 158 km2 this area includes zarivar basin where the drainage of the surrounding heights goes into a lake with the same name in the center of the basin the area and perimeter of zarivar lake are 2449 ha and 27 1 km respectively further the length of the lake is 8590 m and the width is 2556 m in the central part the studied area includes nine villages which are scattered almost uniformly around the lake and in the foothills this basin is limited to the ghezelche su basin from north iraq from the west and marivan city from southeast regarding its climate the basin is categorized as humid in de martonne and as humid and cold in emberger classifications amini et al 2018 the annual precipitation in the basin is about 743 mm which is 60 higher than the average precipitation in kurdistan province the average annual temperature is 13 6 c based on the measurements in the marivan station amini et al 2018 the dominant vegetation of the basin is composed of oak forests and an area of about 2250 ha of agricultural lands gardens and lands with respect to the geological characteristics western areas mainly consist of compact units and cretaceous phyllites as well as shale and layers of limestone fig 1 illustrates the geographical location map of the study area 2 2 sub basins and check dams in order to estimate and evaluate the sedimentation rate in the zarivar basin 10 sub basins with check dams and sediment trenches were selected the boundaries of the sub basins were delineate using aerial data and gis software several factors were considered in selecting the check dams first they did not include spillway and were selected in a way so that they have sufficient time for sedimentation in addition the morphology of the waterways and the proper location of the check dams were taken into consideration global positioning system gps was used to show the geographic coordinates of the check dams the location of the zarivar lake and the sub basins are shown in fig 2 moreover the characteristics of the studied basins sub basins and villages in each sub basin are indicated in table 1 the geographic coordinates x and y are based on the metric coordinate system utm wgs84 zone 38 2 3 reservoir sedimentation field measurements were conducted in 2017 in order to evaluate sedimentation in the zarivar lake watershed the sediment rate behind the sedimentation excluders dimensions of check dams including the height from the base and the length of the crest area of the reservoir and length of sedimentation along the stream channels were measured using precise mapping further the kinds of materials as well as the implementation method of the structures and their position in relation to the waterways were documented the sedimentation reservoirs were networked after determining their dimensions in the present study the dimensions of the networks were considered as 2 3 m based on the area of the sedimentation reservoir in the reservoir to measure the thickness of the sediment in sub layers some boreholes were drilled down to the primary bed of the waterways using hand tools and auger for determining the location of the boreholes the first borehole was drilled in the middle of the reservoir then based on the created networks the following boreholes were drilled in the middle of each network accordingly the zero height points were provided by converting the sedimentation boundary layer to a point in which no sediment deposited in addition a dotted layer was prepared from the points of the boreholes and dem was prepared from the layer the surfer16 5 446 software was used in order to find the interpolation between the measured thicknesses next the 3d map of the sediments in the reservoirs of check dams was illustrated and the volume of the sediments was calculated fig 3 shows the networking in the sedimentation reservoirs drilling of the borehole and sedimentation assessment of the reservoirs the amount of the sedimentation in each reservoir was calculated in m3 and total sedimentation in the basin was calculated from the sum of the sediments in the sedimentation behind check dams along the waterways in order to assess the average annual sedimentation in the basin the sediment rate in each sub basin was divided by the age of the check dams 2 4 sediment density the amount of pores in the sediments of reservoirs was evaluated by calculating the actual specific density of the sediments the field sampling i e cylinder method was conducted to calculate the specific density in this regard the sediments were sampled using a sharp edged metal cylinder a point was selected in the network and then its surface was cleared from any plants the cylinder was placed on the soil from its sharp edged side and was pushed into the soil then the special plate was placed on the cylinder which was evenly hit with a plastic hammer when the soil came out of the top holes on the plate the cylinder was pulled up by pushing away the extra soil in its surrounding in the next step the cylinder was heated in the oven at 105 c for 24 hours in order to obtain dry soil the sample was placed in the desiccator for measuring its weight after analyzing the sediment samples real and apparent bulk specific density were calculated for the drilled profiles in the reservoirs of the check dams fig 4 shows the field samples for determining the specific density of the sediments 2 5 sub basins physiographic characteristics physiographic characteristics of each sub basin are considered as a set of parameters with constant and specified amounts that identify the situation and general characteristics of the basins using the aerial data and field measurements the characteristics of the sub basins were determined and the results were provided as maps in arcgis environment and were delineated as different layers various data including physiographic lithologic pedology hydrological topological vegetation land use and erosion data in the sub basins were utilized in the present study 2 6 factorial scoring model the fsm model is regarded as a semi qualitative model which was first presented by verstraeten et al 2003 for assessing sediment rate in the basins this model uses five factors to calculate sedimentation in the basins including topography geology basin shape gully and vegetation cover the scores of the five factors in the fsm model in the basin were determined based on table 2 and were assigned to the above mentioned layers vegetation factor in fsm model is one of the factors that have a significant effect on the erosion rate of the area there are three vegetation statuses in fsm model for this factor which are good moderate and poor vegetation cover for example good vegetation cover means that more 75 of the area is covered with vegetation accordingly the fsm index was calculated by multiplying the five factors after scoring the five factors of the fsm model and calculation of sedimentation rate related to each sub basin upstream of the check dam those numbers are multiplied and the value of the fsm index is obtained using this index and based on eq 1 the erodibility rate is obtained de vente and poesen 2005 1 s s y 4193 a 0 44 7 77 f s m i n d e x 310 99 where ssy denotes specific sediment rate in ton km2 a is sub basin area in km2 and the fsm index is calculated by multiplying the above mentioned five factors de vente et al 2013 different layers of data for physiographic characteristics were calculated and delineate including the sub basin boundary waterways network length perimeter average slope drainage density the length of the hydrographic network over the basin area concentration time and average annual precipitation in addition lithological land use vegetation and erosion maps were extracted fig 5 shows a sample of lithological maps erosion type slope and vegetation of dsh5 sub basin in the fsm model the topography was identified based on the slope of the hillsides and the difference between the height of the lowest and highest points in the sub basins in addition to the slope map of the sub basins in order to recognize the significance of this factor field surveying is needed in this regard digital elevation model dem was used to delineate the slope map the lithological units as a significant factor in the fsm were ranked based on their erodibility and were considered in scoring the erodibility factor lithology plays the most important role in the erosion of the basins and was classified and scored based on the kind and combination of the lithological units this factor was identified using the geological map of iran with the scale of 1 100000 the watershed shape is another contributing factor in the concentration time of the runoff and sedimentation of the watershed therefore the shape was calculated using the physiographic studies of the basin and drainage density further the situation and amount of vegetation cover and density in each studied sub basin were investigated by field observation and assessing satellite images the vegetation factor was scored using the satellite images and preparing the weighted vegetation map among the erosion kinds rill badland and gully erosions that usually occur in a basin gully erosion leads to more sedimentation in general gully factor was determined using a combination of field observation data from aerial photos with a scale of 1 20000 gathered from iran national cartographic center and landsat and aster maps of erosion 2 7 evaluating the efficiency of fsm statistical measures were used to evaluate the efficiency of the fsm and calculate the errors of the model in this study the sediment rate in the reservoirs and the evaluated sedimentation by the model were compared using mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and efficiency factor ef through equations 2 4 by spss software najafzadeh and oliveto 2020 saberi

sediment rate o m is average values related to sediment measurement and pi is evaluated sediment rate the accuracy of the model increases when the values of rmse and mse are smaller the negative value of ef represents the difference between the average of the measured and the predicted values and the maximum value for ef equals 1 to calibrate the model based on the conditions of the study area ssy values calculated using the area of the sub basin upstream the check dams eq 1 were analyzed and a regression equation was obtained further the accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the ssy values from the fsm model and the observed sedimentation based on the field measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment rate the sedimentation assessment of the reservoirs was used to calculate the volume of the sediments behind the check dams using the measured samples the results of the assessment for each sub basins and the density of the samples from the reservoirs are presented in table 3 table 3 shows significant differences in sediment transport in sub basins which can be related to characteristics of waterways sediment the slope and the situation of the waterways relative to the main river at the upstream waterways the slope is steep and the velocity of the flow is high which provides the flow potential to transport sediments with different sizes to the reservoirs field observations indicated that due to the small size of the reservoir sediments do not have the opportunity to deposit according to their size in fact before the current strikes the structure the length of the reservoir in line with the flow is not long enough to significantly diminish the flow energy therefore the deposited sediments do not have specific layering and cannot be classified based on the grain size in general the sediments which were transported by flood and deposited behind the check dams were heterogeneous and included a mixture of predominantly coarse grained sediments in downstream check dams sediments become fine grained since the flood volume and flow velocity have decreased by passing through several check dams based on the sediment layers observed in excavated profiles behind the check dams sediment layering did not significantly change and had the similar texture these results of the present study are in line with those of katra 2020 3 2 the fsm model results 3 2 1 key parameters in the fsm model the amount of erosion and sedimentation was evaluated by assessing the field using the physical characteristics of the basin and determining quantitative values of factors such as topography vegetation gully concentration lithology and basin shape in erosion studies topographic characteristics play determining roles in the erosion status and production of sediment high topographic fluctuations and steep hillsides result in producing surface runoff and increase the volume velocity and erosivity of the runoff table 4 indicates the scores of the contributing factors in transporting sediments in the studied sub basins based on the fsm standards 3 2 2 model efficiency after determining the five factors for each sub basin in the fsm and scoring the fsm index was calculated by multiplying the scores of each factor sedimentation rate for each sub basin was calculated using fsm index eq 1 then the efficiency of the model was assessed by statistical tools the results are presented in table 5 moreover the statistical parameters for field and estimated data by fsm model are shown in table 6 table 6 indicated that the average amount of measured sediments in the reservoirs for 10 studied sub basins was 0 77 m3 ha yr and standard deviation of the data equaled 1 13 m3 ha yr further the minimum and maximum amounts of the observed sediments were 0 2 and 3 24 m3 ha yr respectively in addition the average estimated sediment rate in the sub basins was 103 7 and standard deviation of the data was 108 9 m3 ha yr the sediment rate estimated by fsm resulted in an mse of 51 68 m3 ha yr indicating a higher estimation compared to that of the measured sediment rate the error was over 1 in all the studied basins the lowest error was associated with mdh1 sub basin as 10 44 and the highest relative error was associated with sef2 sub basin as 181 91 m3 ha yr for the data in the present study ef was calculated to be 18282 according to atapourfard et al 2012 the fsm index and evaluated sediment rate in the basin with the smallest area equaled 6 and 4 9 ton ha yr respectively although the sediment rate was 2 1 ton ha yr in a basin with an area of 725 km2 therefore there is a significant difference between the minimum and maximum rate of the specific observed sediment which is consistent with the results of brooshkeh et al 2018 peylashkarian et al 2014 gusman 2012 estimated the fsm of the sediment load in upper liobregat watershed greater than the actual value the rmse of estimation of the fsm model for sediment volumes and weight values were obtained as 34 45 m3 ha yr and 39 61 ton ha yr respectively which is indicative of inappropriate model performance due to the amplitude of variations 4 conclusions the present study aimed to measure and calculate sediment rate in 10 sub basins of the zarivar lake basin with areas in a range of 0 7 370 ha using the fsm model the lowest specific sediment rate was 0 2 m3 ha yr related to the sub basin with forestland use and with low grade metamorphic phyllite lithology while the highest value was 3 24 m3 ha yr for the basin with agricultural land use and with intermountain alluvium lithology in the zarivar lake basin based on the results of the fsm model the lowest sediment rate was 20 9 m3 ha yr in the mdh1 basin and the highest rate was 365 m3 ha yr in sef2 field observations indicated that land use along with lithology and topography of the basin plays a crucial role in producing sediment since lithology directly affects erosion the amount of erosion and sedimentation in the sub basins with lithological structure is significantly higher compared to that of other sub basins by comparing the observed and estimated sedimentation data by the fsm model the model indicated low efficiency in the sub basins with smaller areas the basin with the smallest area showed the highest error declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

982,in most of the basins due to the lack of sedimentation stations there is no accurate information on sediment deposition and soil erosion in such basins empirical models are used to estimate the sediment rate at the basin scale the applicability of these models is troublesome the objectives of this study were to determine the erosion status of the zarivar lake basin and to evaluate the efficiency of the factorial scoring model fsm in estimating the sediment rate physiological and hydrological characteristics of 10 sub basins of zarivar lake were obtained using field measurements and aerial data in the gis environment the specific weight of the sediments was calculated in the laboratory and used to determine the weight of sediments the sediment rate in sub basins was measured in situ furthermore by determining the effective parameters the sediment rate for each sub basin was obtained using fsm and the results were compared with the measured rate for the whole basin the average minimum and maximum rate of observed sediment were 0 28 0 007 and 1 17 m3 ha yr respectively however these rates were obtained by fsm as 103 70 20 90 and 365 m3 ha yr respectively which differed from the observed values based on the results the model is not sufficiently efficient to evaluate the sediment rate in the studied sub basins keywords sediment zarivar lake empirical model factorial scoring method check dam 1 introduction soil erosion and sedimentary processes are a real complicate issue which result from the interaction between various processes that are still incorrectly understood among the most crucial threats to ecosystem stability soil erosion was identified as one of the major soil threats to ecosystem stability alewell et al 2019 neyshabouri et al 2002 in the eu 0 43 of crop productivity loses annually due to 12 million ha of agricultural areas that suffer from severe erosion which causes around 1 25 billion as cost of this loss lópez vincente and wu 2019 large amounts of sediment are deposited annually in lakes rivers and dam reservoirs due to climate and human changes runoff and frequent flood lead to increase in watersheds which increase the soil erosion and sediment concentration neyshabouri et al 2002 the human made activities have intensified storm runoff and soil erosion in many watersheds amini et al 2014 amini et al 2009 to lessening the adverse effects of erosion it is necessary to take soil conservation measures katra 2020 provides a review and field experiments on soil erosion in semi arid soils by wind and dust emission due to human activities they clearly showed the response of dust emission to numerous land uses with agricultural activities in semi arid loess soils lake sediment and soil erosion are primary concerns of watershed managers around the world to support reduced sediment load into poyang lake and guide localized soil erosion control measures in a watershed system with limited available data yuan and forshay 2020 acknowledged high risk soil erosion areas and conditions that drive sediment yield intended zarivar lake is regarded as one of the most important wetland regions in south eastern corner in western iran solgi and mohamadi galangashi 2018 ebrahimi mohammadi et al 2012 evaluated suspended sediment runoff and nutrient yield from different tributaries to zarivar lake in base flows and flood they found that the maximum suspended sediments were yielded by western and northern parts of the watershed whereas the western parts of the watershed yielded the maximum phosphate to the zarivar lake the maximum contribution of runoff suspended sediments nitrate and phosphate were happened in spring and winter seasons respectively khaledian and habibi 2001 studied the erosion status of the watershed and sedimentation rate in the zarivar lake using aerial photos and watershed maps and utilizing epm and psiac models they reported that approximately 46 000 m3 of sediment is deposited in the lake annually this rate of deposition will affect the lake reservoir capacity particularly in the shallow part of the lake due to the lack of sedimentation stations at the outlet of the basins empirical models appear to be suitable tools for producing essential data for basins management khaledian et al 2017 most of the erosion models use environmental and basin factors to describe the basin in terms of sensitivity to erosion and sediment transport katra 2020 de vente and poesen 2005 at the basin scale the spatial configuration of local factors such as vegetation cover lithology and topography determine to what extent this is reflected in basin sediment yield ssy de vente and poesen 2005 for assessing sustainability in water resources the ssy has been considered as comprehensive index garg and jothiprakash 2012 vegetation cover is dominant factor in flood reduction and soil erosion in waterways shafaei et al 2019 a range of models is available to estimate soil erosion se and ssy some models such as pacific southwest inter agency committee psiac fsm vegetation surface material drainage density model vsd gavrilovic coleman and sactena scoring model cssm and wallingford scoring model wsm include sheet rill gully bank erosion landslides and connectivity at least partly in the assessment of basin sediment yield sediment deposition in dams and lakes reservoir is most vital as it reduces its useful life and impairs the aims of these enormous water resources hesami and amini 2016 one of the latest models to estimate the amount of sediment and erosion is factorial scoring model fsm khodami 2005 and gholami and mesri alamdari 2013 used this model and found that the fsm model has more suitable match than the psiac model ghahari et al 2018 evaluated the fsm performance using sediment survey of check dam reservoirs their results indicated that the uncalibrated fms model overestimated the sedimentation while the calibrated fms model showed a 75 agreement with observed data haregeweyn et al 2005 evaluated the fsm model in eight basins in the ethiopian region measuring the amount of sediment behind check dams the results indicated the accuracy of fsm model de vente et al 2006 recommended the landslide as the sixth factor to be added to the fsm and concluded that the landslide has a dominant role in soil erosion de vente et al 2013 used the data from 700 selected catchments and evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of 14 available models for soil erosion they mentioned that each model predicts precise sediment rate only when the considered processes are indeed dominant brooshkeh et al 2018 compared the efficiency of fsm mpsiac and psiac model to estimate sediment yield in small catchments with areas between 14 3 and 556 ha they used satellite images and field operations then found that the fsm model compared with the other two models had more errors and fsm has no efficiency in estimating the sediment of small watersheds it seems that the research community contemporaneously works for updating the existing empirical approaches and improving the applicability of complex process oriented models nachtergaele et al 2010 the present study aimed to investigate the sediment rate in the zarivar lake in addition the efficiency of the fsm model for estimating erosion rate and its sensitivity to determining factors in sedimentation were assessed using field measurements due to large dependency on water storage for irrigation and public water supplies reservoir sedimentation and erosion are acute problems in this area therefore the results of this research as a first attempt are vital for decision makers and researchers 2 methods and instrumentation 2 1 study area iran as an arid and semi arid area is faced with soil erosion challenges the zarivar lake basin is located between 46 4 51 e and 46 15 30 e longitude and 35 28 23 n and 35 36 30 n latitude it is located in the northwest of kurdistan province in iran and covers an area of 158 km2 this area includes zarivar basin where the drainage of the surrounding heights goes into a lake with the same name in the center of the basin the area and perimeter of zarivar lake are 2449 ha and 27 1 km respectively further the length of the lake is 8590 m and the width is 2556 m in the central part the studied area includes nine villages which are scattered almost uniformly around the lake and in the foothills this basin is limited to the ghezelche su basin from north iraq from the west and marivan city from southeast regarding its climate the basin is categorized as humid in de martonne and as humid and cold in emberger classifications amini et al 2018 the annual precipitation in the basin is about 743 mm which is 60 higher than the average precipitation in kurdistan province the average annual temperature is 13 6 c based on the measurements in the marivan station amini et al 2018 the dominant vegetation of the basin is composed of oak forests and an area of about 2250 ha of agricultural lands gardens and lands with respect to the geological characteristics western areas mainly consist of compact units and cretaceous phyllites as well as shale and layers of limestone fig 1 illustrates the geographical location map of the study area 2 2 sub basins and check dams in order to estimate and evaluate the sedimentation rate in the zarivar basin 10 sub basins with check dams and sediment trenches were selected the boundaries of the sub basins were delineate using aerial data and gis software several factors were considered in selecting the check dams first they did not include spillway and were selected in a way so that they have sufficient time for sedimentation in addition the morphology of the waterways and the proper location of the check dams were taken into consideration global positioning system gps was used to show the geographic coordinates of the check dams the location of the zarivar lake and the sub basins are shown in fig 2 moreover the characteristics of the studied basins sub basins and villages in each sub basin are indicated in table 1 the geographic coordinates x and y are based on the metric coordinate system utm wgs84 zone 38 2 3 reservoir sedimentation field measurements were conducted in 2017 in order to evaluate sedimentation in the zarivar lake watershed the sediment rate behind the sedimentation excluders dimensions of check dams including the height from the base and the length of the crest area of the reservoir and length of sedimentation along the stream channels were measured using precise mapping further the kinds of materials as well as the implementation method of the structures and their position in relation to the waterways were documented the sedimentation reservoirs were networked after determining their dimensions in the present study the dimensions of the networks were considered as 2 3 m based on the area of the sedimentation reservoir in the reservoir to measure the thickness of the sediment in sub layers some boreholes were drilled down to the primary bed of the waterways using hand tools and auger for determining the location of the boreholes the first borehole was drilled in the middle of the reservoir then based on the created networks the following boreholes were drilled in the middle of each network accordingly the zero height points were provided by converting the sedimentation boundary layer to a point in which no sediment deposited in addition a dotted layer was prepared from the points of the boreholes and dem was prepared from the layer the surfer16 5 446 software was used in order to find the interpolation between the measured thicknesses next the 3d map of the sediments in the reservoirs of check dams was illustrated and the volume of the sediments was calculated fig 3 shows the networking in the sedimentation reservoirs drilling of the borehole and sedimentation assessment of the reservoirs the amount of the sedimentation in each reservoir was calculated in m3 and total sedimentation in the basin was calculated from the sum of the sediments in the sedimentation behind check dams along the waterways in order to assess the average annual sedimentation in the basin the sediment rate in each sub basin was divided by the age of the check dams 2 4 sediment density the amount of pores in the sediments of reservoirs was evaluated by calculating the actual specific density of the sediments the field sampling i e cylinder method was conducted to calculate the specific density in this regard the sediments were sampled using a sharp edged metal cylinder a point was selected in the network and then its surface was cleared from any plants the cylinder was placed on the soil from its sharp edged side and was pushed into the soil then the special plate was placed on the cylinder which was evenly hit with a plastic hammer when the soil came out of the top holes on the plate the cylinder was pulled up by pushing away the extra soil in its surrounding in the next step the cylinder was heated in the oven at 105 c for 24 hours in order to obtain dry soil the sample was placed in the desiccator for measuring its weight after analyzing the sediment samples real and apparent bulk specific density were calculated for the drilled profiles in the reservoirs of the check dams fig 4 shows the field samples for determining the specific density of the sediments 2 5 sub basins physiographic characteristics physiographic characteristics of each sub basin are considered as a set of parameters with constant and specified amounts that identify the situation and general characteristics of the basins using the aerial data and field measurements the characteristics of the sub basins were determined and the results were provided as maps in arcgis environment and were delineated as different layers various data including physiographic lithologic pedology hydrological topological vegetation land use and erosion data in the sub basins were utilized in the present study 2 6 factorial scoring model the fsm model is regarded as a semi qualitative model which was first presented by verstraeten et al 2003 for assessing sediment rate in the basins this model uses five factors to calculate sedimentation in the basins including topography geology basin shape gully and vegetation cover the scores of the five factors in the fsm model in the basin were determined based on table 2 and were assigned to the above mentioned layers vegetation factor in fsm model is one of the factors that have a significant effect on the erosion rate of the area there are three vegetation statuses in fsm model for this factor which are good moderate and poor vegetation cover for example good vegetation cover means that more 75 of the area is covered with vegetation accordingly the fsm index was calculated by multiplying the five factors after scoring the five factors of the fsm model and calculation of sedimentation rate related to each sub basin upstream of the check dam those numbers are multiplied and the value of the fsm index is obtained using this index and based on eq 1 the erodibility rate is obtained de vente and poesen 2005 1 s s y 4193 a 0 44 7 77 f s m i n d e x 310 99 where ssy denotes specific sediment rate in ton km2 a is sub basin area in km2 and the fsm index is calculated by multiplying the above mentioned five factors de vente et al 2013 different layers of data for physiographic characteristics were calculated and delineate including the sub basin boundary waterways network length perimeter average slope drainage density the length of the hydrographic network over the basin area concentration time and average annual precipitation in addition lithological land use vegetation and erosion maps were extracted fig 5 shows a sample of lithological maps erosion type slope and vegetation of dsh5 sub basin in the fsm model the topography was identified based on the slope of the hillsides and the difference between the height of the lowest and highest points in the sub basins in addition to the slope map of the sub basins in order to recognize the significance of this factor field surveying is needed in this regard digital elevation model dem was used to delineate the slope map the lithological units as a significant factor in the fsm were ranked based on their erodibility and were considered in scoring the erodibility factor lithology plays the most important role in the erosion of the basins and was classified and scored based on the kind and combination of the lithological units this factor was identified using the geological map of iran with the scale of 1 100000 the watershed shape is another contributing factor in the concentration time of the runoff and sedimentation of the watershed therefore the shape was calculated using the physiographic studies of the basin and drainage density further the situation and amount of vegetation cover and density in each studied sub basin were investigated by field observation and assessing satellite images the vegetation factor was scored using the satellite images and preparing the weighted vegetation map among the erosion kinds rill badland and gully erosions that usually occur in a basin gully erosion leads to more sedimentation in general gully factor was determined using a combination of field observation data from aerial photos with a scale of 1 20000 gathered from iran national cartographic center and landsat and aster maps of erosion 2 7 evaluating the efficiency of fsm statistical measures were used to evaluate the efficiency of the fsm and calculate the errors of the model in this study the sediment rate in the reservoirs and the evaluated sedimentation by the model were compared using mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and efficiency factor ef through equations 2 4 by spss software najafzadeh and oliveto 2020 saberi movahed et al 2020 and najafzadeh et al 2018 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 3 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 4 e f i 1 n o i o m 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is number of data oi is observed sediment rate o m is average values related to sediment measurement and pi is evaluated sediment rate the accuracy of the model increases when the values of rmse and mse are smaller the negative value of ef represents the difference between the average of the measured and the predicted values and the maximum value for ef equals 1 to calibrate the model based on the conditions of the study area ssy values calculated using the area of the sub basin upstream the check dams eq 1 were analyzed and a regression equation was obtained further the accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the ssy values from the fsm model and the observed sedimentation based on the field measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment rate the sedimentation assessment of the reservoirs was used to calculate the volume of the sediments behind the check dams using the measured samples the results of the assessment for each sub basins and the density of the samples from the reservoirs are presented in table 3 table 3 shows significant differences in sediment transport in sub basins which can be related to characteristics of waterways sediment the slope and the situation of the waterways relative to the main river at the upstream waterways the slope is steep and the velocity of the flow is high which provides the flow potential to transport sediments with different sizes to the reservoirs field observations indicated that due to the small size of the reservoir sediments do not have the opportunity to deposit according to their size in fact before the current strikes the structure the length of the reservoir in line with the flow is not long enough to significantly diminish the flow energy therefore the deposited sediments do not have specific layering and cannot be classified based on the grain size in general the sediments which were transported by flood and deposited behind the check dams were heterogeneous and included a mixture of predominantly coarse grained sediments in downstream check dams sediments become fine grained since the flood volume and flow velocity have decreased by passing through several check dams based on the sediment layers observed in excavated profiles behind the check dams sediment layering did not significantly change and had the similar texture these results of the present study are in line with those of katra 2020 3 2 the fsm model results 3 2 1 key parameters in the fsm model the amount of erosion and sedimentation was evaluated by assessing the field using the physical characteristics of the basin and determining quantitative values of factors such as topography vegetation gully concentration lithology and basin shape in erosion studies topographic characteristics play determining roles in the erosion status and production of sediment high topographic fluctuations and steep hillsides result in producing surface runoff and increase the volume velocity and erosivity of the runoff table 4 indicates the scores of the contributing factors in transporting sediments in the studied sub basins based on the fsm standards 3 2 2 model efficiency after determining the five factors for each sub basin in the fsm and scoring the fsm index was calculated by multiplying the scores of each factor sedimentation rate for each sub basin was calculated using fsm index eq 1 then the efficiency of the model was assessed by statistical tools the results are presented in table 5 moreover the statistical parameters for field and estimated data by fsm model are shown in table 6 table 6 indicated that the average amount of measured sediments in the reservoirs for 10 studied sub basins was 0 77 m3 ha yr and standard deviation of the data equaled 1 13 m3 ha yr further the minimum and maximum amounts of the observed

weight values were obtained as 34 45 m3 ha yr and 39 61 ton ha yr respectively which is indicative of inappropriate model performance due to the amplitude of variations 4 conclusions the present study

983,the total suspended solids tss concentration is a relevant parameter for stream management a high content of tss has a negative impact on the ecological habitats and the aquatic environment and could also be a limitation for the exploitation of surface water the determination of tss concentration through water sampling and posterior laboratory analysis is a complex and economically expensive procedure in this regard turbidity arises as a useful surrogate measure that allows the indirect estimation of the tss concentration in a simple and economically convenient way in the context of a severely deteriorated water supply system the napostá grande stream constitutes a valuable resource for human and industrial consumption in the city of bahía blanca the general objective of the present investigation is to develop statistically based relations between the parameters involved in the suspended solids transport in order to characterize this phenomenon through the measurement of variables of simple and straightforward field determination the statistical relationship between the tss concentration and turbidity and between discharge and solid flow rate was explored in both regression analyses the statistical correlation resulted highly significant and therefore represent valid calibration tools for future solids transport modelling analysis and prediction as well as for sedimentological balances a comparative analysis of the solids transport between the closure of the medium drainage basin and at the outer limit of the suburban area of bahía blanca city suggests the existence of erosive processes affecting the stream bed and its margins at the section between both sites keywords total suspended solids turbidity stream discharge solid flow rate napostá grande stream basin 1 introduction the content of suspended solids is a relevant parameter for stream management and streamflow quality characterization ahn and steinschneider 2018 bieroza et al 2018 the amount of total suspended solids tss comprises the nutrients and pollutants transported by the water in the form of organic and inorganic particles cieśla et al 2020 the concentration of solid particles has a direct effect on the penetration of light and consequently on the ecological habitats that are prone to develop within the stream bilotta and brazier 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 likewise streams or rivers with significant seasonal regime variability in combination with a large supply of solids in suspension are prone to undergo relevant geomorphological changes in this regard the content of tss is useful to derive a balance of solids which at the same time can be employed in an inference framework to predict what kind of physical changes are plausible to expect in the channel dean et al 2016 the geomorphology of the deltas is also sensitive to the contents of sediments in the streamflow in effect the interruption of the natural streamflow caused by the construction of a dam could generate a radical change both in the geomorphology of the downstream channel as well as in the delta itself mueller et al 2017 słowik et al 2018 in this sense periodical data acquisition on the tss content acquires greater relevance knowing the usual solid supply allows to estimate its effect on the useful capacity of the reservoir and furthermore to quantify possible variations in the shape of the channel downstream of the dam the variables that intervene in the tss concentration are diverse and complex vercruysse et al 2017 indeed the concentration of suspended particles in a particular spot along a stream at a particular time is a sensitive random variable rv which needs to be registered at the higher possible frequency jones et al 2012 however the frequent measurement of tss through discrete water sampling is neither straightforward nor economically convenient each campaign requires accessing the sampling site and performing the corresponding laboratory tests on the other side turbidity has proven to be a reliable and easy to measure surrogate parameter for tss concentration gippel 1995 göransson et al 2013 jones et al 2011 steffy and shank 2018 in this approach the first step consists of conducting paired field determinations of turbidity and tss concentration the gathered data are then employed in a statistical regression scheme to derive an expression relating turbidity and tss concentration lannergård et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 rügner et al 2013 williamson and crawford 2011 even though a series of parameters such as the color of the water the shape and size of the suspended particles affect the relation between turbidity and tss the correspondence between both registers is accepted as long as a statistically significant correlation is established downing 2006 nasrabadi et al 2016 based on the evidence regarding the potential value of turbidity as a proxy for tss concentration the present investigation is aimed at deriving an analytical expression that allows to relate the content of solids and the turbidity in the napostá grande stream in the peri urban zone of the city of bahía blanca buenos aires argentina the water supply system for the city of bahía blanca and its influence area is currently in a critical state recent hydric crises reveal the urgency for the evaluation of potential complementary water sources in order to guarantee the water supply for more than 450 000 inhabitants and for the petrochemical complex installed in the ingeniero white industrial park which is responsible for 60 of the national petrochemical production lópez et al 2012 during the 1990 decade a series of studies was conducted in order to evaluate potential sources of water for human and industrial consumption in bahía blanca and its influence area up to the year 2050 schefer et al 2012 among the alternatives the construction of a dam in the napostá grande stream is highlighted by the authors this project would also contribute to control the frequent overflows of the stream which causes frequent floods in bahía blanca lópez et al 2012 moreover the local water supply agency absa is currently making use of the napostá grande flow through three separate superficial intakes located along the stream in the lower drainage basin however these sources frequently become unusable when the water turbidity surpasses the maximum capacity of 10 nephelometric turbidity units ntu supported by the local water treatment plant an investigation undertaken from 2013 to 2014 lópez et al 2015 reports that 55 of the water samples taken at puente canessa and 80 of the samples taken on a nearby site which is placed 20 km downstream named paso vanoli fig 1 would require additional treatment for human consumption due to high values of turbidity in this regard the construction of a dam in puente canessa would promote the natural decantation of solid particles thus reducing the turbidity both at the reservoir and downstream in brief the napostá grande stream stands as a positive alternative solution to the serious water supply problem that affects the bahía blanca region however the natural resource has not been studied or characterized in depth so far in this context the general objective of the present investigation is to develop statistically based relations between the parameters involved in the suspended solids transport in order to characterize this phenomenon through the measurement of variables of simple and straightforward field determination in this regard the following particular objectives are settled to evaluate the statistical correlation amongst turbidity and tss concentration in the napostá grande stream at the sampling site puente canessa to analyze the existence of a statistically significant correlation between the total discharge and the solid flow rate in the napostá grande stream at puente canessa to analyze the variation of the tss concentration and the solid flow rate in the napostá grande stream between the closure of the middle stream drainage basin and the sub urban area of bahía blanca city 2 study area the napostá grande stream drainage basin is located in the southwest of the buenos aires province argentina the basin extends over an area of 1237 km2 where the climate is classified as subhumid humid mesothermal winds are predominant from the nw and n directions with an estimated 9 km h 1 annual mean velocity rainfall represents the only water income into the stream drainage basin with 666 mm average annual precipitation and a decreasing gradient of 2 4 mm km 1 towards the south the seasonal variation of rainfall allows to identify two well distinguished periods october march which is characterized by a higher rainfall and april september with a markedly inferior areal precipitation carrica 1998 the study area is covered by loessial sediments in outcrop or sub outcrop positions mostly composed by fine sands silts and clayey silts cemented by calcium carbonate these sediments constitute the free aquifer and the largest part of the region unsaturated zone carrica and lexow 2004 the napostá grande stream headwaters are located in the western side of the sierras de ventania mountain range as shown in fig 1 along its 107 km length the stream runs between 2 to 11 m high escarps approximately 90 of the stream drainage basin useful area is dedicated to agricultural and livestock activities alfalfa wheat barley sorghum ray oats and sunflower crops and cattle breeding respectively anthropogenic pressure is concentrated mostly at the lower stream basin at the beginning of the bahía blanca city sub urban area the continued urbanization of this area provoked the invasion of the flood plain through the construction of roads and projects for commercial residential and recreational purposes at the upper drainage basin the stream has an extension of 25 km 4 mean slope and an annual flow rate of 0 4 m3 s 1 the outcrops of quartzite rocks of the mountain sector cover 30 of this area carrica and lexow 2004 in effect this zone has been identified as the primary source of floods and solids entry the

the turbidity and tss concentration sampling campaigns in the napostá grande stream at the site puente canessa were carried out in two separate temporal periods the first one started in may 2012 and the campaigns were conducted on a monthly basis approximately every 30 days until august 2013 except for march and may 2013 when the data collection was temporarily interrupted the second period of sampling started in may 2018 and continued monthly until december of the same year the campaigns were resumed on may 2019 and extended until december 2019 the interruptions in the regularity of the temporal sampling resolution within each period were forced by unavailability of the proper vehicle to access the measurement site the determination of turbidity was performed with a horiba u52 g multi parameter water quality meter the turbidity sensor of the equipment minimizes the interference provoked by the color of the water and measures the intensity of the dispersed light in a 30 angle for the determination of the tss concentration water samples were collected in situ using plastic bottles which were previously rinsed twice with the stream water the bottles were filled in a vertical integrated way i e going downward and upward the height of the vertical profile at an approximately constant speed without reaching the overflow the water samples from the period 2012 2013 were analyzed by the laboratory of the provincial water authority apa whereas from may 2018 the tss determinations were conducted by the environmental chemistry laboratory at universidad nacional del sur both laboratories performed the studies according to standard protocols apha 1995 in november 2018 the maximum turbidity limit supported by the turbidity meter 800 ntu was exceeded and therefore only the tss concentration was registered in that campaign consequently the turbidity sample size is 31 whereas the size of the tss sample is 32 in 21 of the total 32 sampling campaigns the stream discharge ql was measured by wading in this scheme a tag line marked every 0 50 m is tautened across the stream cross section at each marked progressive along the tag line the water depth is measured using the graduated wading rod and the vertical averaged velocity is measured using the fp101 global flow probe once the field data have been registered the flow rate is determined using the velocity area method in particular the method of average velocity was applied the remaining 11 flow rates were estimated through a calibrated curve which relates the stream discharge with the height of the

median of t 11 5 ntu suggests that a moderate value of turbidity is to be expected in puente canessa sampling site the interquartile range computed as the difference between the third and the first quartiles for both rvs 460 l s 1 and 8 6 ntu for ql and t respectively suggests a relatively low dispersion of the samples however the magnitude of the sample sd 2246 l s 1 and 56 4 ntu for ql and t respectively which is affected by the outliers in the dataset indicates a considerably higher dispersion moreover a significant difference is observed between the median and the mean of these two rvs this observation reflects the relevance that overflows have in terms of suspended sediments transport in the napostá grande stream campaigns s10 s11 and s23 which correspond to the highest observed values of ql also corresponds to the highest registers of t in campaign s23 the turbidity exceeded the maximum supported by the horiba meter and tss based on the statistical analysis of the empirical

that site which is compared to the tss concentration at puente canessa 4 1 statistical correlation between turbidity and tss concentration the t and tss data reported in table 1 are neither normal nor homokedastic therefore a natural logarithm transformation is applied to both series in these conditions the transformed data acquire the normal and homokedastic properties and moreover the series show an approximate linear correlation tendency fig 2 a linear regression analysis is performed with the transformed data through an analysis of variance anova with n 30 being n the sample size the datum associated with campaign s12 is classified as outlier and is therefore disregarded for the analysis no influential points were found the resulting equation is 1 l n t s s 1 241 l n t 1 855 where t is expressed in ntu and tss in mg l 1 the regression resulted highly significant p value 0 01 which implies that the slope of the fitting curve is statistically different from zero design problems were detected which are presumably associated to the lack of samples in the range between 80 and 200 ntu considering that no other model for the correlation between t and tss is available for the napostá grande stream at puente canessa eq 1 is preliminary accepted the determination coefficient resulted r2 0 90 meaning that ln tss is explained in a 90 by ln t finally the tss concentration at puente canessa can be estimated from the measured t through the following expression 2 t s s 0 156 t 1 241 where t is in ntu and tss in mg l 1 the solid black line in fig 2 represents the analytical eq 2 and the solid green lines indicate the 95 prediction intervals the potential expression which coincides with the kind of relation reported by other authors méndez et al 2011 ram and terry 2016 is valid for t lower than 250 ntu it is worth mentioning that to improve quality of the approximation data gathering should be continued in order to densify the t sample range between 80 and 200 ntu the tss t ratio corresponding to the site puente canessa in the napostá grande stream lies in general between 0 1 and 0 9 mg l 1 ntu 1 which is an indicator of low water turbidity richter 2009 4 2 statistical correlation between total discharge and solids flow rate the procedure described in section 4 1 is now applied to derive an analytical expression that allows to estimate qs from the ql registers obtained at puente canessa in this scheme the natural logarithm transform is firstly applied to the qlc and qsc data table 1 in these conditions the data result normal and homokedastic the transformed values which are reported as a scatter plot in fig 3 show an approximate positive linear correlation trend on this basis the linear regression performed through anova with n 32 results highly significant p value 0 01 implying that the linear fitting curve slope is statistically different from zero neither influential points nor design problems were found the linear equation is 3 l n q s 2 707 l n q l 12 258 the expression in eq 3 is reported as a continuum solid line in fig 3 together with the 95 prediction intervals solid green lines the determination coefficient resulted r2 0 76 thus it is inferred that ln qs is explained in a 76 by ln ql then the equation of the curve relating the solid and liquid flow rate in the napostá grande stream at puente canessa is 4 q s 4 747 10 6 q l 2 707 where ql is expressed in l s 1 and qs in kg d 1 the expression is valid for ql between 0 2 and 13 5 m3 s 1 the potential equation is in correspondence with results reached by other researchers garcía 2010 méndez et al 2011 all the data lies within the margins defined by the 95 prediction interval suggesting an acceptable level of uncertainty in the results 4 3 analysis of the variation in the tss concentration and solid flow rate between puente canessa and paso vanoli in table 2 m1 m21 identify the 21 sampling campaigns performed simultaneously at the sites paso vanoli and puente canessa in each of these campaigns turbidity tv was measured at paso vanoli and these registers where employed to estimate the total suspended solids concentration tssv using eq 2 at the same time turbidity tc total suspended solids concentration tssc and discharge qlc were determined at the site puente canessa regarding tssc except for m1 which was determined from water sampling all the registers reported in table 2 were estimated through eq 2 using the tc values obtained in the field the qlc values were estimated using the ql h curve in six of these cases however the limnimeter was inoperable due to technical malfunctioning in these occasions which are identified with two asterisks the qlc values were estimated from linear interpolation between the registers obtained at the previous and subsequent limnimetric records the solid flow rate at paso vanoli is estimated as the product between qlc and tssv in order to compute representative statistics the size of the sample population n 21 should be increased however a preliminary analysis with the available data suggests a general tendency for tv registers to be considerably higher than those associated to tc in fact the sample mean of the tv data 46 8 ntu is approximately twice the mean of the tc registers 22 78 ntu as has already been mentioned the discharge at paso vanoli can be assumed to be very similar to the discharge measured upstream at puente canessa therefore the observed difference in the turbidity registers between both sites indicates a higher concentration of suspended particles in the site paso vanoli see tssv in table 2 in order to quantitatively evaluate this difference table 2 reports the percentage relative variation of tss between puente canessa and paso vanoli calculated according to eq 5 5 δ t s s t s s v t s s c t s s c 100 where tss is expressed in it can be observed that apart from m1 all of the tss values indicate an increment in the concentration of solids at paso vanoli furthermore 14 out of 21 registers show a relative increment of the tss concentration higher than 100 with extreme values reaching 600 from these results it is possible to infer that the content of tss in the stream water at the lower drainage basin is very sensitive to the usual variations in the flow rate the variation of the solid flow rate between both locations computed according to eq 6 is also reported in table 2 6 δ q s q s v q s c as expected an incremental trend in the solid discharge between paso vanoli and puente canessa is observed indeed the mean difference in the solid discharge estimated during the analyzed period shows an average increment of 835 kg d 1 which indicates the prevalence of erosive over accretion processes at the stream sector between both sampling sites the variation of the solid flow rate for every registered value of discharge ql is reported in fig 4 this representation allows to visualize that in general see the dots within the shaded area the positive difference in the solids discharge between paso vanoli and puente canessa increases as the liquid flow rate rises the dots corresponding to m1 and m19 are presumably outliers but as has already been mentioned the size of the sample size must be increased to confirm this observation the source of the additional solids in the stream sector between puente canessa and paso vanoli is attributable to solid transport from the bed and its margins indeed a marked decrease in the vegetation coverage of the soil has been registered in the period 2006 2016 caused by fallen trees due to floods lateral erosion of the banks and burning and land deforestation mainly for residential purposes pirchi 2019 based on these results and considering the sustained urbanization and impermeabilization observed in the lower drainage basin from paso vanoli towards the middle basin the erosive processes near puente canessa are expected to augment in the near future as a result of the superficial runoff increment with a consequent increment in the width and depth of the stream cross section basile 2018 the erosive processes between both sites and their presumable magnification in the near future in combination with the low stream slope indicate that the current movements of the meanders pirchi 2019 will proceed this mechanism will gradually modify the stream morphology at the bahía blanca sub urban area causing possible undesirable effects due to lateral movement of the stream axis and changes on stream width and depth especially at those sites currently occupied by public spaces private commercial ventures houses and communication rails and altering projected urban developments however such effects could be altered if a dam is constructed at the site puente canessa indeed closing the stream would cause geomorphological changes downstream from the dam due to the decrease in the flow rate and also due to the consequent modification in the sediment transport provoked by the alteration in the magnitude and frequency of overflows słowik et al 2018 5 conclusions the napostá grande stream constitutes a potentially valuable resource that could improve the deteriorated water supply system of the city of bahía blanca and its area of influence motivated by this a statistical analysis of relevant variables that characterize the napostá grande stream water such as discharge turbidity tss concentration and solid flow rate was performed in this investigation in particular analytical expressions have been developed by statistical correlation which allow to estimate the tss concentration and the solid discharge in the napostá grande stream using turbidity and discharge as surrogates respectively the valid range for the application of the proposed formulas is acceptably wide in correspondence with the magnitude of the parameters that are normally observed in the resource the shape of the fitting curves coincides with the results found by other researchers and the 95 prediction intervals suggests that most of the probability is bounded within acceptably wide margins in order to increase the valid range of application of the proposed formulas and to densify the samples in certain ranges it is planned to install a continuous turbidity meter in puente canessa where a limnimeter is already continuously sampling moreover a preliminary comparative analysis of the content of sediments registered simultaneously at the closure of the middle basin and downstream at the beginning of the bahía blanca peri urban area suggests the existence of erosive processes between both sites moreover the available data suggests that the increasing trend in the solid flow rate variation is magnified as the stream discharge rises this phenomenon in the authors opinion is caused by the impermeabilization in the lower basin caused by the increasing antrophogenic pressure in this area the present study constitutes the foundations for the further development of long and short term studies of the tss concentration in the stream for the establishment of patterns in the discharge variability for the beginning of sediment supply balances in the middle drainage basin of the napostá grande stream and for the calibration of sediment transport models in the study area the implementation of the correlations developed in this investigation applied to historical series of discharge registered at the closure of the middle drainage basin will be a valuable resource for the determination of the dead volume of the reservoir if a dam is constructed

983,the total suspended solids tss concentration is a relevant parameter for stream management a high content of tss has a negative impact on the ecological habitats and the aquatic environment and could also be a limitation for the exploitation of surface water the determination of tss concentration through water sampling and posterior laboratory analysis is a complex and economically expensive procedure in this regard turbidity arises as a useful surrogate measure that allows the indirect estimation of the tss concentration in a simple and economically convenient way in the context of a severely deteriorated water supply system the napostá grande stream constitutes a valuable resource for human and industrial consumption in the city of bahía blanca the general objective of the present investigation is to develop statistically based relations between the parameters involved in the suspended solids transport in order to characterize this phenomenon through the measurement of variables of simple and straightforward field determination the statistical relationship between the tss concentration and turbidity and between discharge and solid flow rate was explored in both regression analyses the statistical correlation resulted highly significant and therefore represent valid calibration tools for future solids transport modelling analysis and prediction as well as for sedimentological balances a comparative analysis of the solids transport between the closure of the medium drainage basin and at the outer limit of the suburban area of bahía blanca city suggests the existence of erosive processes affecting the stream bed and its margins at the section between both sites keywords total suspended solids turbidity stream discharge solid flow rate napostá grande stream basin 1 introduction the content of suspended solids is a relevant parameter for stream management and streamflow quality characterization ahn and steinschneider 2018 bieroza et al 2018 the amount of total suspended solids tss comprises the nutrients and pollutants transported by the water in the form of organic and inorganic particles cieśla et al 2020 the concentration of solid particles has a direct effect on the penetration of light and consequently on the ecological habitats that are prone to develop within the stream bilotta and brazier 2008 vercruysse et al 2017 likewise streams or rivers with significant seasonal regime variability in combination with a large supply of solids in suspension are prone to undergo relevant geomorphological changes in this regard the content of tss is useful to derive a balance of solids which at the same time can be employed in an inference framework to predict what kind of physical changes are plausible to expect in the channel dean et al 2016 the geomorphology of the deltas is also sensitive to the contents of sediments in the streamflow in effect the interruption of the natural streamflow caused by the construction of a dam could generate a radical change both in the geomorphology of the downstream channel as well as in the delta itself mueller et al 2017 słowik et al 2018 in this sense periodical data acquisition on the tss content acquires greater relevance knowing the usual solid supply allows to estimate its effect on the useful capacity of the reservoir and furthermore to quantify possible variations in the shape of the channel downstream of the dam the variables that intervene in the tss concentration are diverse and complex vercruysse et al 2017 indeed the concentration of suspended particles in a particular spot along a stream at a particular time is a sensitive random variable rv which needs to be registered at the higher possible frequency jones et al 2012 however the frequent measurement of tss through discrete water sampling is neither straightforward nor economically convenient each campaign requires accessing the sampling site and performing the corresponding laboratory tests on the other side turbidity has proven to be a reliable and easy to measure surrogate parameter for tss concentration gippel 1995 göransson et al 2013 jones et al 2011 steffy and shank 2018 in this approach the first step consists of conducting paired field determinations of turbidity and tss concentration the gathered data are then employed in a statistical regression scheme to derive an expression relating turbidity and tss concentration lannergård et al 2019 oliveira et al 2018 rügner et al 2013 williamson and crawford 2011 even though a series of parameters such as the color of the water the shape and size of the suspended particles affect the relation between turbidity and tss the correspondence between both registers is accepted as long as a statistically significant correlation is established downing 2006 nasrabadi et al 2016 based on the evidence regarding the potential value of turbidity as a proxy for tss concentration the present investigation is aimed at deriving an analytical expression that allows to relate the content of solids and the turbidity in the napostá grande stream in the peri urban zone of the city of bahía blanca buenos aires argentina the water supply system for the city of bahía blanca and its influence area is currently in a critical state recent hydric crises reveal the urgency for the evaluation of potential complementary water sources in order to guarantee the water supply for more than 450 000 inhabitants and for the petrochemical complex installed in the ingeniero white industrial park which is responsible for 60 of the national petrochemical production lópez et al 2012 during the 1990 decade a series of studies was conducted in order to evaluate potential sources of water for human and industrial consumption in bahía blanca and its influence area up to the year 2050 schefer et al 2012 among the alternatives the construction of a dam in the napostá grande stream is highlighted by the authors this project would also contribute to control the frequent overflows of the stream which causes frequent floods in bahía blanca lópez et al 2012 moreover the local water supply agency absa is currently making use of the napostá grande flow through three separate superficial intakes located along the stream in the lower drainage basin however these sources frequently become unusable when the water turbidity surpasses the maximum capacity of 10 nephelometric turbidity units ntu supported by the local water treatment plant an investigation undertaken from 2013 to 2014 lópez et al 2015 reports that 55 of the water samples taken at puente canessa and 80 of the samples taken on a nearby site which is placed 20 km downstream named paso vanoli fig 1 would require additional treatment for human consumption due to high values of turbidity in this regard the construction of a dam in puente canessa would promote the natural decantation of solid particles thus reducing the turbidity both at the reservoir and downstream in brief the napostá grande stream stands as a positive alternative solution to the serious water supply problem that affects the bahía blanca region however the natural resource has not been studied or characterized in depth so far in this context the general objective of the present investigation is to develop statistically based relations between the parameters involved in the suspended solids transport in order to characterize this phenomenon through the measurement of variables of simple and straightforward field determination in this regard the following particular objectives are settled to evaluate the statistical correlation amongst turbidity and tss concentration in the napostá grande stream at the sampling site puente canessa to analyze the existence of a statistically significant correlation between the total discharge and the solid flow rate in the napostá grande stream at puente canessa to analyze the variation of the tss concentration and the solid flow rate in the napostá grande stream between the closure of the middle stream drainage basin and the sub urban area of bahía blanca city 2 study area the napostá grande stream drainage basin is

nw and n directions with an estimated 9 km h 1 annual mean velocity rainfall represents the only water income into the stream drainage basin with 666 mm average annual precipitation and a decreasing gradient of 2 4 mm km 1 towards the south the seasonal variation of rainfall allows to identify two well distinguished periods october march which is characterized by a higher rainfall and april

concentrated mostly at the lower stream basin at the beginning of the bahía blanca city sub urban area the continued urbanization of this area provoked the invasion of the flood plain through the construction of roads and projects for commercial residential and recreational purposes at the upper drainage basin the stream has an extension of 25 km 4 mean slope and an annual flow rate of 0 4 m3

values which are reported as a scatter plot in fig 3 show an approximate positive linear correlation trend on this basis the linear regression performed through anova with n 32 results highly significant p value 0 01 implying that the linear fitting curve slope is statistically different from zero neither influential points nor design problems were found the linear equation is 3 l n q s 2 707 l n q l 12 258 the expression in eq 3 is reported as a continuum solid line in fig 3 together with the 95 prediction intervals solid green lines the determination coefficient resulted r2 0 76 thus it is inferred that ln qs is explained in a 76 by ln ql then the equation of the curve relating the solid and liquid flow rate in the napostá grande stream at puente canessa is 4 q s 4 747 10 6 q l 2 707 where ql is expressed in l s 1 and qs in kg d 1 the expression is valid for ql between 0 2 and 13 5 m3 s 1 the potential equation is in correspondence with results reached by other researchers garcía 2010 méndez et al 2011 all the data lies within the margins defined by the 95 prediction interval suggesting an acceptable level of uncertainty in the results 4 3 analysis of the variation in the tss concentration and solid flow rate between puente canessa and paso vanoli in table 2 m1 m21 identify the 21 sampling campaigns performed simultaneously at the sites paso vanoli and puente canessa in each of these campaigns turbidity tv was measured at paso vanoli and these registers where employed to estimate the total suspended solids concentration tssv using eq 2 at the same time turbidity tc total suspended solids concentration tssc and discharge qlc were determined at the site puente canessa regarding tssc except for m1 which was determined from water sampling all the registers reported in table 2 were estimated through eq 2 using the tc values obtained in the field the qlc values were estimated using the ql h curve in six of these cases however the limnimeter was inoperable due to technical malfunctioning in these occasions which are identified with two asterisks the qlc values were estimated from linear interpolation between the registers obtained at the previous and subsequent limnimetric records the solid flow rate at paso vanoli is estimated as the product between qlc and tssv in order to compute representative statistics the size of the sample population n 21 should be increased however a preliminary analysis with the available data suggests a general tendency for tv registers to be considerably higher than those associated to tc in fact the sample mean of the tv data 46 8 ntu is approximately twice the mean of the tc registers 22 78 ntu as has already been mentioned the discharge at paso vanoli can be assumed to be very similar to the discharge measured upstream at puente canessa therefore the observed difference in the turbidity registers between both sites indicates a higher concentration of suspended particles in the site paso vanoli see tssv in table 2 in order to quantitatively evaluate this difference table 2 reports the percentage relative variation of tss between puente canessa and paso vanoli calculated according to eq 5 5 δ t s s t s s v t s s c t s s c 100 where tss is expressed in it can be observed that apart from m1 all of the tss values indicate an increment in the concentration of solids at paso vanoli furthermore 14 out of 21 registers show a relative increment of the tss concentration higher than 100 with extreme values reaching 600 from these results it is possible to infer that the content of tss in the stream water at the lower drainage basin is very sensitive to the usual variations in the flow rate the variation of the solid flow rate between both locations computed according to eq 6 is also reported in table 2 6 δ q s q s v q s c as expected an incremental trend in the solid discharge between paso vanoli and puente canessa is observed indeed the mean difference in the solid discharge estimated during the analyzed period shows an average increment of 835 kg d 1 which indicates the prevalence of erosive over accretion processes at the stream sector between both sampling sites the variation of the solid flow rate for every registered value of discharge ql is reported in fig 4 this representation allows to visualize that in general see the dots within the shaded area the positive difference in the solids discharge between paso vanoli and puente canessa increases as the liquid flow rate rises the dots corresponding to m1 and m19 are presumably outliers but as has already been mentioned the size of the sample size must be increased to confirm this observation the source of the additional solids in the stream sector between puente canessa and paso vanoli is attributable to solid transport from the bed and its margins indeed a marked decrease in the vegetation coverage of the soil has been registered in the period 2006 2016 caused by fallen trees due to floods lateral erosion of the banks and burning and land deforestation mainly for residential purposes pirchi 2019 based on these results and considering the sustained urbanization and impermeabilization observed in the lower drainage basin from paso vanoli towards the middle basin the erosive processes near puente canessa are expected to augment in the near future as a result of the superficial runoff increment with a consequent increment in the width and depth of the stream cross section basile 2018 the erosive processes between both sites and their presumable magnification in the near future in combination with the low stream slope indicate that the current movements of the meanders pirchi 2019 will proceed this mechanism will gradually modify the stream morphology at the bahía blanca sub urban area causing possible undesirable effects due to lateral movement of the stream axis and changes on stream width and depth especially at those sites currently occupied by public spaces private commercial ventures houses and communication rails and altering projected urban developments however such effects could be altered if a dam is constructed at the site puente canessa indeed closing the stream would cause geomorphological changes downstream from the dam due to the decrease in the flow rate and also due to the consequent modification in the sediment transport provoked by the alteration in the magnitude and frequency of overflows słowik et al 2018 5 conclusions the napostá grande stream constitutes a potentially valuable resource that could improve the deteriorated water supply system of the city of bahía blanca and its area of influence motivated by this a statistical analysis of relevant variables that characterize the napostá grande stream water such as discharge turbidity tss concentration and solid flow rate was performed in this investigation in particular analytical expressions have been developed by statistical correlation which allow to estimate the tss concentration and the solid discharge in the napostá grande stream using turbidity and discharge as surrogates respectively the valid range for the application of the proposed formulas is acceptably wide in correspondence with the magnitude of the parameters that are normally observed in the resource the shape of the fitting curves coincides with the results found by other researchers and the 95 prediction intervals suggests that most of the probability is bounded within acceptably wide margins in order to increase the valid range of application of the proposed formulas and to densify the samples in certain ranges it is planned to install a continuous turbidity meter in puente canessa where a limnimeter is already continuously sampling moreover a preliminary comparative analysis of the content of sediments registered simultaneously at the closure of the middle basin and downstream at the beginning of the bahía blanca peri urban area suggests the existence of erosive processes between both sites moreover the available data suggests that the increasing trend in the solid flow rate variation is magnified as the stream discharge rises this phenomenon in the authors opinion is caused by the impermeabilization in the lower basin caused by the increasing antrophogenic pressure in this area the present study constitutes the foundations for the further development of long and short term studies of the tss concentration in the stream for the establishment of patterns in the discharge variability for the beginning of sediment supply balances in the middle drainage basin of the napostá grande stream and for the calibration of sediment transport models in the study area the implementation of the correlations developed in this investigation applied to historical series of discharge registered at the closure of the middle drainage basin will be a valuable resource for the determination of the dead volume of the reservoir if a dam is constructed

984,the danube is the longest river in the european union and europe s second longest river after the volga with a total area of 801 463 km2 and covering 10 of continental europe the danube river basin features the highest degree of cultural diversity in the world and plays a major role in the continent s socioeconomic political and cultural life this review aims to assess the evolution of danube water quality wq over the past decades by using keywords a search protocol and filters on the web of science platform a scientific bank of 41 relevant studies was obtained out of the 124 open access articles that were initially available these papers were closely reviewed the review s main conclusions are the following since the beginning of the 1970s the danube water regime has changed because of the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge into the danube basin has increased about fivefold whereas phosphate has doubled due to the increase in anthropogenic inputs most recently reductions of nutrient loads were observed which is linked to political economic and wq management changes even if at nowadays danube wq has an upward trend the river still shows signs of degradation mainly organic pollution downstream of major cities and in some important tributaries also certain specific areas polluted with substances listed as a priority in the european water framework directive as well as with newly emerging contaminants have been identified which is a matter that requires urgent measures key words danube water quality nutrients emerging organic contaminants human faeces xenobiotics 1 introduction the danube the longest river in the european union 2 857 km and europe s second longest river after the volga forms one of the continent s largest and most important water systems the danube river basin drb totalling over 801 463 km2 i e 10 of continental europe features the highest degree of cultural diversity worldwide it is made up of 19 countries fig 1 14 of which called danube countries accommodates 83 million people of different ethnicities and languages and plays a major role in europe s socioeconomic political and cultural life since 1998 water management in the drb has been overseen by the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr which prepared a drb management plan icpdr website drb management plan 2015 based on the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 60 ec ec website 2000 the eu wfd s goal is for all member states to reach at least a good ecological status of water bodies the characterization of water quality wq and subsequently of the ecological status of rivers in accordance with the provisions of the eu wfd is based on a classification system comprising five quality classes high i good ii moderate iii poor iv and bad v ec website 2000 high quality is characterized by minor or non existent anthropic alterations conversely bad quality is defined by severe alterations that result in the absence of relevant biological communities the ecological status is characterized by the one out all out principle and is evaluated using classification systems that are applicable to the following elements biological phytoplankton macroscopic benthic invertebrates and fish fauna and general physicochemical elements temperature oxygenation acidification and nutrients and specific pollutants ec website 2000 starting with the early 1970s the danube s overall state has been negatively influenced by the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants which considerably regulated its flow wq across the drb was first mapped by liepolt in 1967 and schmid assessed danube wq in 1995 and 2002 based on benthic flora and fauna chapman et al 2016 between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge from the danube basin has increased about fivefold while phosphate amounts doubled due to ever growing anthropogenic inputs cozzi et al 2019 in the second half of the 20th century industrial and hydrotechnical activities urban development and agriculture have intensified their pressure on the danube which resulted in marked changes in wq affecting its physical e g temperature suspended sediment and bed load transport chemical e g ammonium nitrate nitrite phosphorus and emerging pollutants and biological properties faecal pollution species loss and biological community alterations due to invasive species habersack et al 2016 kittinger et al 2015 pagliero et al 2014 páll et al 2013 bloesch 2009 takić et al 2012 voza et al 2015 antonijević et al 2014 stoica et al 2014 pekárová et al 2009 this can be linked to numerous factors including i land use changes ii point and diffuse pollution generated by agricultural and industrial activities and individual households and iii catchment water cycle as a result of climate change and anthropogenic modifications in certain sectors of the drb one of the main wq issues consists of organic pollution from untreated or poorly treated urban wastewater the wastewater discharge impact has been clearly shown by notable increases in microbial faecal pollution downstream of major urban settlements kirschner et al 2017 even if at present danube wq has an overall ascending trend the drb management plan states that 49 and 35 of the total length of drb rivers 25 582 km may not achieve good ecological and chemical statuses respectively by 2021 icpdr website drb management plan 2015 mainly due to considerable organic and nutrient pollution generated by point i e wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharges and diffuse sources i e atmospheric deposition excessive fertilization and tile drainage systems hazardous substances and hydro morphological alterations moreover danube and drb rivers are affected by excessive water abstractions mainly used for hydropower generation and irrigation which can substantially alter flow dynamics and consequently reduce available water resources icpdr website drb management plan 2015 considering all aforementioned changes and trends in the drb this paper aims to assess the evolution of danube wq over the past decades by thoroughly reviewing 41 relevant open access studies out of 124 initially available works from the web of science wos platform the most important source of validated scientific information for the academic and research milieu the primary purpose of our work is to synthetically analyze the body of data that consists of scientific papers previously published on said topic the second goal of the work is to comprehensively investigate two main issues space related wq changes stretch or location of the danube section s subjected to wq analyses and time related wq changes in the last decades 1990 2018 comparing the trends when data was available to the high pollution decades i e 1960 1990 it is also relevant to acknowledge that given the importance of danube river 41 scientific articles that provide open access data regarding danube wq add up to a limited database that should be enriched 2 materials and methods we built a bank of research studies on danube wq sourced from the wos platform using a set of relevant keywords the last search was conducted on october 28 2019 said keywords including danube water quality were used in various combinations results 601 studies were then narrowed by applying several search filters open access wos categories and document types and a specific search protocol works in english language no temporal option relevance for our review thematic fit this second search resulted in a second bank of 41 relevant studies out of an initial list of 124 open access articles fig 2 11 articles analyse wq along the entire river 16 detail wq in serbia 7 in romania 2 in slovakia 2 in hungary 1 in germany 1 in austria and finally one focuses on the upper danube wq germany austria slovakia table 1 6 papers were published in 2019 one in 2018 4 in 2017 8

this review s results considering the scientific contributions the papers made on danube wq for the entire river or for stretches that flow across certain states i e considering the number of scientific papers that analyse these issues 3 results and discussions 3 1 wq aspects and concerns of the entire danube over the past three decades a decrease in danube water nutrient loads was noticed as a result of political and economic changes that occurred in several eastern european countries but also because of advancement made in nutrient management in the danube basin cozzi et al 2019 in the 1970s and 1980s it was estimated that the danube contributed 80 of the riverine nutrient load to the black sea chapman et al 2016 from 2000 to 2005 the share of nutrient inputs to the black sea from the danube went down to 50 of the riverine nutrient load and there was a reduction in biochemical oxygen demand bod of 50 chapman et al 2016 however concentrations of inorganic nutrients remained 1 5 times higher compared to values recorded prior to 1950 from 1995 to 2009 the impact of diffuse and point nutrient sources on the danube river and its tributaries was analyzed malagó et al 2017 and it was determined that high loads of nitrogen had entered the river through diffuse sources e g fertilization the use of mineral fertilizers had a major contribution to the pollution of the danube river 55 followed by manure 37 and ammonia 8 malagó et al 2017 nonetheless the agricultural impact was substantially reduced by around 90 mainly due to crop uptake soil denitrification and riparian filter strips nitrogen from urban settlements directly contributed to the load of the danube river by approximately 35 while diffuse emissions from the agricultural sector including the contribution from precipitation accounted for 65 malagó et al 2017 similarly high phosphorus amounts entered the danube basin as a result of fertilizer use 95 of total sources this potential impact was substantially reduced by plant uptake and only 5 of diffuse source loads reached the river system which was heavily affected by phosphorus pollution from point sources malagó et al 2017 also over the past few decades the nutrient inputs that found their way into drb water bodies and the high amounts of sediment retained in reservoirs where dams were constructed have both contributed to pervasive eutrophication and sediment deficit along the entire course of the river tyler et al 2016 nevertheless the last decades trend of nutrient input reduction reflected the combined effects of several factors including improvements in wastewater treatment reservoir nutrient retention particularly phosphorus the economic recession undergone by numerous eastern european countries lower agricultural fertilizer use and a coordinated danube wq monitoring effort chapman et al 2016 while prior to 1998 the year icpdr was founded there was little basin wide coordination of river monitoring in december 1985 the governments of riparian countries along the danube signed the bucharest declaration chapman et al 2016 one of its objectives was to improve danube wq and to this end a monitoring program of 11 cross sections of the danube river was devised chapman et al 2016 the number of sampling sites grew to 61 in 1996 which resulted in the establishment of the trans national monitoring network tnmn the tnmn aimed to collect sufficient data to enable reliable and consistent investigations of wq pollution long term wq trends and concentration and load trends for priority pollutants to support wq analyses for water use and to identify major pollution sources chapman et al 2016 since the 1990s international co operation in the basin has been growing river wq has continued to be a major focus of this co operation together with the improvement of riverine ecosystems starting with 1996 the tnmn s collected data was published annually in the tnmn yearbooks the last one presenting the 2017 wq in the danube river basin compared to the previous 10 years icpdr website tnmn 2017 the conclusions of the tnmn 2017 yearbook icpdr website tnmn 2017 are consistent with the results of the studies conducted by scientists and published in wos papers in terms of the general spatial distribution of key wq parameters dissolved oxygen bod5 codcr n nh4 n no3 p po4 3 ptotal and cd along the danube river in 2017 the highest concentrations of biodegradable organic matter nutrients and cadmium were observed in the middle and lower parts of the river the highest values of dissolved oxygen were found in the upper part of the danube whereas in the lower danube dissolved oxygen levels decrease icpdr website tnmn 2017 since 1996 decreasing trends of biodegradable organic matter have been observed in the lower danube while the decreasing or stable concentrations of ammonium n were recorded across the entire danube river nitrate n concentrations have been rather stable over recent years in the last decade a decreasing trend of orthophosphate p concentrations was mostly seen in the upper part of the danube and at certain sites in the lower danube p total concentration had a decreasing trend in the last decade in the upper and middle danube cadmium concentrations were constant or slightly decreasing in the entire danube river as well as in its tributaries icpdr website tnmn 2017 in terms of loads suspended solids inorganic nitrogen orthophosphate phosphorus total phosphorus bod5 chlorides and where available dissolved phosphorus and silicates in 2017 in the entire danube river the mean annual discharge was lower than in 2016 in the case of suspended solids inorganic nitrogen bod5 orthophosphate total phosphorus and chlorides the highest load was observed in the lower part of the danube river the maximum load of suspended solids inorganic nitrogen orthophosphate total phosphorus dissolved phosphorus chlorides and silicates was observed at the monitoring location danube reni ro5 in romania the maximal load for bod5 was computed for the romanian monitoring station ro2 pristol novo selo icpdr website tnmn 2017 unfortunately there still was an in depth knowledge gap in terms of the levels of hazardous substances in the drb particularly persistent organic compounds endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical compounds which is why icpdr conducted 3 joint danube surveys jdss between 2001 and 2013 the first two jdss were held in 2001 and 2007 the second survey s jds2 findings confirmed the previous conclusions of the icpdr that danube river wq was generally improving it also identified a number of specific polluted areas where priority substances classified as such in the european wfd were found as were newly emerging contaminants that require further examination particularly in some tributaries loos et al 2017 jds2 mainly targeted pharmaceutical compounds pesticides and their degradation products perfluorinated acids and endocrine disrupting compounds loos et al 2017 the third joint danube survey jds3 was conducted by icpdr from august 13 to september 25 2013 along the danube river in nine countries from germany to romania and in the danube delta loos et al 2017 during the third survey the emerging organic contaminants identified by icpdr table 2 were analysed in 71 water samples collected from the danube river and its major tributaries loos et al 2017 several perfluoroalkyl substances were also analyzed as pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid was one of the most important contaminants in jds2 originating mostly from a fluoropolymer production plant located in germany on the inn river tributary loos et al 2017 the third survey conclusion was that danube continues to exhibit signs of degradation downstream of major cities and in several main tributaries as a result of insufficient or non existent treatment of wastewater loos et al 2017 treated and untreated wastewater discharged from wwtps is the main source of the organic contaminants found in the danube river and its tributaries loos et al 2017 most relevant micropollutants found during jds3 were benzotriazoles pharmaceuticals organophosphorus compounds and pfos a loos et al 2017 these compounds concentrations were generally below the environmental quality standard eqs threshold values except for pfos the concentration of which exceeded the annual average water eqs limit of 0 65 ng l along the entire river and also exceeded the fish biota eqs of 9 1 μg kg loos et al 2017 in addition to the emerging organic contaminant pollution another worrying type of danube wq deterioration is the one caused by faeces in 2014 microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria sfib along a 2 580 km stretch of the danube kirschner et al 2017 faecal pollution and the potential presence of pathogenic agents are mainly linked to untreated sewage microbiological contamination from faecal pollution caused by anthropogenic sources is considered to be a crucial issue throughout the drb as it poses a threat to all types of water uses kirschner et al 2017 the contamination of water resources by faecal pollutants poses a high risk to human and animal health as numerous pathogens are often associated with faeces páll et al 2013 faecal indicator bacteria such as total coliforms faecal coliforms thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci faecal streptococci are excreted by humans and warm blooded animals pass sewage treatment plants in large amounts and survive preserving their pathogenicity for a certain time páll et al 2013 in 2014 human faecal pollution was proven to be the primary pollution source along the entire river while animal faecal pollution was found to be of minor importance kirschner et al 2017 escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci were used as general indicators of faecal pollution it turned out that for monitoring the entire river midstream samples were largely representative of faecal pollution levels kirschner et al 2017 however at a few somewhat unexpected sites on the upper middle and lowest danube sectors high pollution values were recorded laterally along the river although the midstream zone had good microbial water quality levels kirschner et al 2017 to conclude at present for the entire danube river the main pollution concerns revolve around nutrients emerging organic contaminants and human faeces fig 3 further reduction in nutrients and organic pollution is needed 3 2 serbian danube wq trends in serbia wq assessment is based on the water quality index wqi method that uses ten selected parameters oxygen saturation bod5 ammonium ion ph total nitrogen orthophosphates suspended solids temperature electrical conductivity and coliform bacteria serbian environmental protection agency website according to the serbian wqi based method there are 4 classes of surface wq i high excellent and very good wq ii good wq iii bad wq iv very bad wq serbian environmental protection agency website in serbia where the danube stretches across 588 km wq monitoring results showed that the eco chemical status of the danube river constantly improved from 1992 to 2006 živadinović et al 2010 regular monthly measurements were taken during this interval at 13 sampling stations and the following parameters were assessed suspended matter nitrates no3 n total nitrogen n total phosphorus p biological oxygen demand for 5 days bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod živadinović et al 2010 the total river load was much higher at the entrance of the danube river into serbia bezdan compared to the outflow point radujevac živadinović et al 2010 the improvement of the eco chemical status was twofold table 3 in terms of both time from 1992 until 2006 and space from bezdan to radujevac živadinović et al 2010 the improvement of danube wq in serbia was confirmed by the presence of 70 desmid taxa along the danube in the province of vojvodina northern serbia stamenković and cvijan 2008 between april 2002 and may 2003 54 water samples for qualitative phytoplankton and physico chemical analyses were collected from seven localities along the danube in northern serbia they showed a high diversity of desmids and good wq in this province stamenković and cvijan 2008 the overall quality of danube water on serbian territory continued to be very good in 2009 when it was analyzed at 16 sampling stations takić et al 2012 unfortunately serbia holds the so called dark point of pollution in the drb one of europe s most polluted watercourses veliki bački channel vbc in vojvodina north serbia which connects the rivers danube and tisa pantelić et al 2012 evaluated the vbc s wq over a ten year period 2000 2009 based on the wqi method the results showed very bad wq near the settlement vrbas downstream of vrbas wqi parameters ranged from bad to good in 2016 pantelić et al analyzed the local population s stance on using the vbc for irrigation and drainage the serbian wqi method showed that the channel included sections that were pure where the local population had a positive attitude towards irrigation and drainage and a section that was heavily degraded and utterly unusable near vrbas where residents stood out for their highly negative standpoints on wq as danube wq is influenced by the wq of its tributaries leščešen et al 2018 used the wqi method to analyse danube tributaries from 2004 to 2013 the highest wq value was measured on drina river while the lowest value was attributed to juzna morava and tisa rivers tisa river wq in serbia was also evaluated by babić et al 2019 between 2011 and 2016 using the serbian wqi parameters derived from a six year public environmental database the tisa river basin trb is the largest sub basin of the drb and its serbian sector covers almost half of vojvodina the most important area for commercial agriculture this study revealed that wq along the serbian tisa slightly decreased downstream serbian wqi values showed that during the monitoring period wq was good and very good was showing an improvement and was having a positive impact on the danube s eco chemical status the changes in tisa wq mostly occurred under the influence of anthropogenic organic pollutants and nutrients total phosphorus ammonia etc between 1995 and 2000 serbian tisa wq was only included in quality classes ii and iii babić et al 2019 petrović and marković 2015 assessed the levels of physicochemical parameters ph electrical conductivity sulphates chlorides temperature turbidity total hardness iron manganese copper dissolved oxygen oxygen saturation suspended solids ammonium nitrogen total nitrogen and orthophosphates in the water samples collected from pek river at 4 sample sites over 6 months from november 2011 to may 2012 pek river is a tributary of the danube located in south eastern serbia according to the serbian water classification pek river falls in the 2nd wq class suitable for bathing recreation and water sports the results of physicochemical analyses showed that copper and sulphates were present in almost all water samples with exceeding values which were linked to wastewater discharge from the majdanpek copper mine as the mine s filtration plant needed more efficient treatment processes petrović and marković 2015 in 2010 serbian danube wq was measured at 11 monitoring stations along the river on a monthly basis following 10 quality parameters oxygen saturation biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium ph total nitrogen oxides orthophosphate suspended solids temperature conductivity and most probable number of coliform bacteria e coli mpn walker et al 2015 due to its absence in many cases the e coli criterion was omitted from the results the stations with the best wq were radujevac and smederevo while the stations with the worst wq were novi sad and bačka palanka walker et al 2015 this suggested that downstream stations had a better wq than upstream ones which according to walker et al 2015 can be explained by the danube river s intense self purification process that reduces the organic load also in 2010 during spring and autumn a study was conducted on the impact of urban wastewaters on danube river wq in serbia kolarević et al 2011 water and sediment samples were collected for microbiological analysis and genotoxicity monitoring from 6 sites the sanitary analysis i e enumeration of total and faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci indicated moderate to critical faecal contamination while the organic load assessment oligotroph to heterotroph ratio index of phosphatase activity revealed moderately polluted water levels kolarević et al 2011 the domination of oligotrophs in almost all water samples indicated a satisfactory level of self purification kolarević et al 2011 mercury resistant bacteria were detected in all water samples with high numbers at locations downstream of belgrade kolarević et al 2011 results showed that the pollution detected at the monitored sites could be mainly attributed to the high amount of untreated or improperly treated urban wastewater while the more intense local agricultural activity during sampling periods probably contributed to the organic pollution in april 2010 despotović et al 2019 proved that the river snail species viviparus acerosus could be used as a potential bioindicator of metal pollution in danube s freshwater ecosystems the authors determined that metal concentrations in snail bodies were affected to a greater extent by river sediment than by the water s metal content in 2011 serbia s danube river water monitored at 17 sampling sites could be best described as moderately polluted voza et al 2015 11 wq parameters were analyzed water temperature ph value suspended solids dissolved oxygen ammonium nitrate orthophosphate silicate sulphate chloride and biochemical oxygen demand voza et al 2015 the 17 monitoring stations were grouped into three statistically significant distance based clusters cluster 1 consisted of seven sampling stations apatin bezdan bogojevo čenta bačka palanka novi sad and slankamen cluster 2 of two sampling stations banatska palanka and pančevo while the third cluster consisted of 8 stations belgrade vinča dobra zemun brza palanka tekija smederevo v gradište and radujevac voza et al 2015 within the same cluster locations had similar characteristics and pollution sources the sampling stations in cluster 1 were located in high pollution areas cluster 2 and its two sampling stations indicated moderate pollution areas finally cluster 3 was classified as serbia s low polluted danube sector voza et al 2015 this effectively divided the serbian danube into an upper river section which covered the stretch from the hungarian border to belgrade and a lower section strongly influenced by the iron gates i and ii dam complex which stretched from belgrade to the bulgarian border as voza et al 2015 proved with regard to the serbian capital antonijević et al 2014 showed that the danube s overall status in the belgrade region at three sampling locations in january and february 2013 was moderate the analysis looked at organic contaminants in the river water heavy metals in the sediments but also several common wq parameters such as total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and major ions the quantification of organic contaminants did not indicate elevated pollution levels antonijević et al 2014 more significant contaminations were found for chromium nickel zinc and partially copper in sediments with values exceeding target values according to serbian regulations but below the intervention values antonijević et al 2014 in serbia between 2004 and 2013 air temperature had a low effect on changes in danube wq and the anthropogenic impact was far more dominant pantelić et al 2015 the biggest impact of air temperature was seen on nitrogen oxide concentration which increases as temperature goes down pantelić et al 2015 amid high concentrations of nitrogen in water algae start pullulating suddenly pantelić et al 2015 once they die out a large amount of oxygen is consumed to decompose organic matter the lack of oxygen negatively affects aerobic water organisms primarily fish pantelić et al 2015 at the same time basarin et al 2016 revealed that the relationship between air ta and water temperature tw is very important because it shows how the temperature of a water body might respond to future changes in ta some adaptation strategies could be established in order to buffer undesirable effects of river warming basarin et al 2016 found that tw influences chemical and biochemical processes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion affects other physical properties of flowing waters and influences the life cycles of lotic biota the authors analyzed the mean monthly tw records of 3 gauging stations bezdan bogojevo and veliko gradište ta series from 2 meteorological stations sombor and veliko gradište were correlated with tw variations over the period 1950 2012 statistically significant warming trends were observed for annual and seasonal minimum and maximum tw at all investigated sites in terms of how safe serbian danube water is for bathing this was assessed by jovanović galović et al from august to september 2014 at five popular public danube beaches in vojvodina using physical chemical and bacteriological tests of water samples while no enterovirus material was found in any sample adenovirus and rotavirus genetic materials were detected in 60 and 31 samples respectively out of a total of 90 jovanović galović et al 2016 statistical analyses showed a significant positive correlation between adenovirus dna and total coliforms and faecal coliforms jovanović galović et al 2016 even when water sample quality levels were adequate for recreational use adenoviruses were detected in 75 of such samples jovanović galović et al 2016 the results indicated that using viral indicators in the analysis of recreational water could prove helpful to better assess public health safety this might be particularly relevant in areas where urban wastewater treatment is insufficient and where surface waters affected by wastewater are used for recreation jovanović galović et al 2016 a positive statistically significant correlation was obtained between danube adenovirus material and both water nitrate concentration and turbidity which are parameters related to faecal contamination jovanović galović et al 2016 to conclude danube wq in serbia improved between 1992 and 2006 and was classified as very good in 2009 fig 4 a lower wq has been noticed since 2010 at stations located in the upper section of the serbian danube stretch faecal pollution was recorded that same year as was a pollution event caused by organic substances linked to untreated or improperly treated urban wastewater and to local agricultural activity respectively in 2011 serbian danube wq was moderate and the same quality class was found in 2013 in the belgrade region fig 4 in 2014 adenoviruses were detected on five public danube beaches in vojvodina linked to faecal pollution fig 4 the viral indicators could be used for assessing public health safety of recreational waters regrettably serbia has one of the most polluted watercourses in europe vbc which connects danube and tisa rivers vbc had very bad wq near the settlement vrbas for ten years 2000 2009 and its water was deemed improper for irrigation and drainage as danube wq is influenced by the wq of its tributaries their water was analyzed and the results showed that between 2004 and 2013 drina river had the highest wq while juzna morava and tisa rivers had the lowest fortunately tisa wq improved from 2011 to 2016 was classified as good and very good and had a positive impact on danube wq in 2011 2012 pek river wq was classified into the 2nd class as high copper and sulphate values were recorded 3 3 danube wq tendencies in romania moving on to romania the studies showed that danube water pollution was higher on romanian territory especially in the lower danube sector pollution was caused by various factors including accidental industrial waste leakage deliberate release of pollutants spillage of oil products from storage tanks and pipelines use of agricultural pesticides and herbicides incorrect waste disposal solubilisation of atmospheric pollutants acid rains etc dumbrava and birghila 2009 apetrei et al 2019 iticescu et al 2019 a 2008 study which analysed danube river water samples collected from 5 sites in constanta county found the highest concentrations of 3 metallic ions chromium iron and copper which indicated that some of the water samples could be categorized in the 5th quality class fig 5 in samples collected in the winter season dumbrava and birghila 2009 from june to september 2010 monthly sampling and analyses from lower danube river water in the galati harbour area established the presence of total coliforms faecal coliforms and e coli in amounts that required the implementation of environmental securing measures to avoid the spread of communicable diseases on a scale that could result in water borne outbreaks in the local community engaged in water based domestic and industrial activities ajeagah et al 2012 the persistence of e coli during the sampling period confirmed the continuous faecal pollution of this medium ajeagah et al 2012 the high presence of organic pollutants combined with the presence of coliforms and e coli could be related to an accumulation of waste matter across the entire ecosystem due to the lack of wwtps for domestic and industrial discharges the high impact of human activities throughout the river basin and to difficulties in the natural operational self purification processes ajeagah et al 2012 in 2012 from july to october an improvement in danube wq was highlighted by computing macro invertebrate indices that indicated a good ecological status for danube at isaccea monitoring station ro14 stoica et al 2014 fig 5 this improvement of the romanian danube wq continued in the following years while the lower danube river km 375 km 175 wq monitoring program 2011 2014 presented moderate to slightly elevated values for most of the 41 quality indicators radu et al 2016 this gradually changed between winter 2013 and winter 2016 as well as during the following years apetrei et al 2019 iticescu et al 2019 in this period 18 parameters were measured upstream and downstream of galati city in 5 sampling points along the lower danube namely ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod n nh4 n no2 n no3 n total p po4 3 so4 2 cl fe total cr total pb2 ni2 mn2 zn2 as2 wq fell into the second category good and third category moderate iticescu et al 2019 fig 5 in 2016 2017 birghila et al 2017 studied the variation of fe ii and total iron concentration in poarta alba midia navodari channel pamnc a 32 7 km long artificial surface water body that connects the danube with the black sea the channel water is taken from the danube upstream of cernavoda town and discharged into the black sea at agigea results indicated a high iron concentration in surface water and a seasonal variation of iron concentration and speciation which can be correlated with the oxidable matter content as iron acts as an oxidizing agent in the presence of oxidable matter on the basis of total iron concentration pamnc water could be included in the fifth quality class the discharge of wastewaters from riverine settlements affects pamnc water quality which is very important for the chemical and ecological status of black sea coastal waters in 2018 wq in the lower danube area in all sampling points near galati city was classified in the second class fig 5 according to the romanian standard of surface wq and the eu water directive the analyzed parameters were ph tds total dissolved solids resistivity turbidity amounts of fe and no3 apetrei et al 2019 the findings of the open access romanian studies state that the wq of the lower danube river improved from 2008 when some of the water samples were categorized in the 5th quality class for chromium iron and copper to 2018 when the wq was classified in the second class namely good quality figs 5 6 between 2013 and 2016 the lower danube river wq was included in the second and third moderate quality categories figs 5 6 unfortunately this stretch of the danube river was affected by organic and faecal pollution in 2010 fig 6 pamnc which connects the danube with the black sea had bad wq in 2016 and 2017 and this could influence the chemical and ecological status of black sea coastal waters the below standard water quality in the channels that connect the danube river with the black sea may influence the latter s coastal ecosystems as it was proved by snigirova et al in 2018 snigirova et al 2021 who focused on the ukrainian black sea coast being affected by the 3rd and 4th water quality classes of the bystroe bystry navigation channel water 3 4 danube wq directions in slovakia the wq of the slovak danube river sector i e the slovak austrian slovak and slovak hungarian stretches changed considerably over the past decades holcík 2003 the danube entering slovak territory was heavily polluted in early 1970 as a consequence of both industrialization mainly the construction of chemical and petrochemical units and of the growing number of inhabitants in vast urban areas on both banks of the danube holcík 2003 wq deteriorated from the 3rd degree of purity beta mesosaprobic to the 4th degree alpha mesosaprobic holcík 2003 the self cleaning capability of the danube decreased considerably and the toxic effects of industrial wastewaters exceeded the limits deemed dangerous to human health and to certain organisms the most hazardous were the wastewaters resulting from petrochemical activities that contained considerable and ever growing amounts of oil holcík 2003 the construction of water purification stations in vienna schwechat and bratislava in the early 1980s substantially influenced and improved wq of the slovak danube segment holcík 2003 the increase in danube river pollution that characterized the 1955 1985 period has been brought to a halt and since that time an improvement in wq has been noticed holcík 2003 fish diversity in the danube s slovak sector was controlled by the inland delta that existed in this region until 1992 seventy six species were recorded in this river section over more than 100 years holcík 2003 while the increasing pollution levels until 1985 led to a decrease in the number of fish species the improvement in wq thereafter partially restored it according to slovak specialists the construction of the gabcíkovo river barrage system which became operational in october 1992 substantially lowered fish species and population richness and fish catch holcík 2003 before 1990 the danube wq in bratislava slovakia s capital was affected by pollution sources located in germany austria and the czech republic pekárová et al 2009 the long term trends of wq variables of the danube river at bratislava chl a ca ec so4 2 cl o2 bod5 n tot po4 p no3 n no2 n etc analyzed based on monthly measurements between 1991 and 2005 revealed that wq improved over that years pekárová et al 2009 the decline in pollutant concentrations was the result of the introduction of wwtps upstream of bratislava pekárová et al 2009 as a short conclusion for the slovak danube river sector the water pollution that defined the 1955 1985 period was halted and wq improved fig 7 3 5 hungarian danube wq trends in budapest the capital of hungary danube wq is high it improved over the past three decades as a result of the construction of communal wwtps and of the limited use of artificial agricultural fertilizers nagy kovács et al 2019 fig 8 suspended particulate matter spm loads in the danube river at göd 1668 river km about 20 km upstream of budapest analyzed between 2003 and 2012 have decreased by about 50 compared to previous years since 1990s which is most likely the result of the construction of hydropower plants on the upper german austrian slovakian stretches of the danube river tóth and bódis 2015 fig 8 3 6 the upper danube germany austria slovakia wq tendencies in the upper danube river southern germany the decline in fish catches has been observed since the early 1990 s grund et al 2010 between 2006 and 2010 a series of studies were conducted in order to identify the factors that could have generated this decline grund et al 2010 a considerable ecotoxicological impact of sediments at different locations along the upper danube river was detected by bioassays given its benthic lifestyle and exposure to sediments but also its decline in fish catches in the upper danube river the common barbel barbus barbus l was selected to be the test organism grund et al 2010 a severe disturbance of hepatic cell metabolism and an impaired health status of the barbel were observed at the contaminated sampling sites rottenacker and ehingen grund et al 2010 although a direct cause effect relationship between sediment contamination and ultrastructural alteration of the barbel could not be established it may be suggested based on toxicity assays that sediment bound xenobiotics could in part account for the hepatocellular changes grund et al 2010 many xenobiotics tended to accumulate in the liver which made this organ particularly sensitive in austria change patterns in the concentrations of total and soluble reactive phosphorus tp and srp and suspended sediments ss at different flow levels in the austrian danube between 1991 and 2013 were analyzed statistically and linked to point and diffuse emissions as well as to extreme hydrological events zoboli et al 2015 the danube was analyzed at its entrance into austrian territory from germany inflow and at its exit from austria outflow zoboli et al 2015 phosphorus retention essentially occurred through deposition and algae growth the stock generated was then exposed to remobilization during flood events when phosphorus peaks were transported downstream and exported to river banks and flooded areas zoboli et al 2015 srp contributed to the identification of point emission impacts as it was typically the prevalent phosphorus species in wwtp effluents zoboli et al 2015 ss provided further information on diffuse pathways as particulate bound phosphorus was the predominant species transported by storm dependent agricultural runoff and erosion processes zoboli et al 2015 the lower number of point discharges during the 1990s resulting from the efforts made by germany and austria translated into decreasing the tp and srp base flow concentrations during 1991 2013 but it did not lead to any changes in higher flow level concentrations nor in the annual transport of tp loads zoboli et al 2015 an acute and enduring decline in tp concentration which affected all flow levels occurred after a major 2002 flood it was once again visible during another major flood in 2013 which recorded lower tp concentrations than the previous event such a decline could not be linked to changes in point or diffuse emissions but as a result of the flood the river system experienced a considerable depletion of its in stream phosphorus stock and a reduced mobilization of tp rich sediments zoboli et al 2015 the upper danube basin germany austria slovakia extending from the danube source down to the gabcikovo reservoir near bratislava is also at risk of eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen availability udias et al 2016 nitrogen losses in the form of nitrate n no3 come from point and diffuse pollution sources acknowledging that over fertilization is a well known issue in the upper danube a proper management of mineral fertilization could lead to important environmental benefits without affecting economic farming income udias et al 2016 in upper danube basin countries the high input of organic nitrogen from manure would indeed allow the reduction of mineral inputs with limited negative effects on crop yields assuming that a correct management of manure would be put in place udias et al 2016 therefore in the upper danube basin wq is affected by sediment bound xenobiotics that generated a decline in fish catches and by eutrophication fig 9 4 conclusions since the early 1970s the danube water regime has changed because of the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants which significantly regulated its flow between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge into the danube basin has increased about fivefold whereas phosphate has doubled due to growing anthropogenic inputs over the past 50 years the different industries urban development agriculture and hydrotechnical activities increased the pressure on the danube and generated notable negative changes in wq most recently reductions in nutrient loads were observed which are linked to political economic and wq management changes that occurred in european countries nevertheless the upper danube basin is still at risk of eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen availability agricultural runoff and erosion processes table 4 even if danube wq is currently on an overall upward trend the river still shows signs of degradation mainly organic pollution downstream of major cities in some important tributaries as well as in the anthropic channels that connect the danube with tisa or the black sea as a result of discharge of untreated or poorly treated wastewater table 4 improperly treated and untreated wastewater released from wwtps is also the main source of emerging organic contaminants found in the danube river and its tributaries and of sediment bound xenobiotics found in the upper danube basin table 4 the impact of wastewater discharges has been clearly shown by marked increases in microbial faecal pollution downstream of major towns and cities microbiological contamination from faecal pollution by anthropogenic sources is considered to be a crucial problem throughout the drb table 4 posing a threat to all types of water uses human faecal pollution was identified as the primary pollution source along the entire river while animal faecal pollution was found to be of minor importance certain specific areas polluted with substances listed as a priority in the european wfd as well as with newly emerging contaminants table 4 require urgent measures the results of this review can be used as a basis for further monitoring investigations and environmental protection actions on the danube but also for regional trans danube cooperation in light of the danube wq security all danube countries are engaged in a committed fight against water pollution and have the full support of icpdr the danube commission and of eu environmental entities if they do not win the danube and its basin s rivers risk failing to achieve a good ecological and chemical status by 2021 mainly due to the high organic and nutrient pollution from point sources and diffuse sources and to hazardous substances the fight for danube s water purity continues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
984,the danube is the longest river in the european union and europe s second longest river after the volga with a total area of 801 463 km2 and covering 10 of continental europe the danube river basin features the highest degree of cultural diversity in the world and plays a major role in the continent s socioeconomic political and cultural life this review aims to assess the evolution of danube water quality wq over the past decades by using keywords a search protocol and filters on the web of science platform a scientific bank of 41 relevant studies was obtained out of the 124 open access articles that were initially available these papers were closely reviewed the review s main conclusions are the following since the beginning of the 1970s the danube water regime has changed because of the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge into the danube basin has increased about fivefold whereas phosphate has doubled due to the increase in anthropogenic inputs most recently reductions of nutrient loads were observed which is linked to political economic and wq management changes even if at nowadays danube wq has an upward trend the river still shows signs of degradation mainly organic pollution downstream of major cities and in some important tributaries also certain specific areas polluted with substances listed as a priority in the european water framework directive as well as with newly emerging contaminants have been identified which is a matter that requires urgent measures key words danube water quality nutrients emerging organic contaminants human faeces xenobiotics 1 introduction the danube the longest river in the european union 2 857 km and europe s second longest river after the volga forms one of the continent s largest and most important water systems the danube river basin drb totalling over 801 463 km2 i e 10 of continental europe features the highest degree of cultural diversity worldwide it is made up of 19 countries fig 1 14 of which called danube countries accommodates 83 million people of different ethnicities and languages and plays a major role in europe s socioeconomic political and cultural life since 1998 water management in the drb has been overseen by the international commission for the protection of the danube river icpdr which prepared a drb management plan icpdr website drb management plan 2015 based on the eu water framework directive eu wfd 2000 60 ec ec website 2000 the eu wfd s goal is for all member states to reach at least a good ecological status of water bodies the characterization of water quality wq and subsequently of the ecological status of rivers in accordance with the provisions of the eu wfd is based on a classification system comprising five quality classes high i good ii moderate iii poor iv and bad v ec website 2000 high quality is characterized by minor or non existent anthropic alterations conversely bad quality is defined by severe alterations that result in the absence of relevant biological communities the ecological status is characterized by the one out all out principle and is evaluated using classification systems that are applicable to the following elements biological phytoplankton macroscopic benthic invertebrates and fish fauna and general physicochemical elements temperature oxygenation acidification and nutrients and specific pollutants ec website 2000 starting with the early 1970s the danube s overall state has been negatively influenced by the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants which considerably regulated its flow wq across the drb was first mapped by liepolt in 1967 and schmid assessed danube wq in 1995 and 2002 based on benthic flora and fauna chapman et al 2016 between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge from the danube basin has increased about fivefold while phosphate amounts doubled due to ever growing anthropogenic inputs cozzi et al 2019 in the second half of the 20th century industrial and hydrotechnical activities urban development and agriculture have intensified their pressure on the danube which resulted in marked changes in wq affecting its physical e g temperature suspended sediment and bed load transport chemical e g ammonium nitrate nitrite phosphorus and emerging pollutants and biological properties faecal pollution species loss and biological community alterations due to invasive species habersack et al 2016 kittinger et al 2015 pagliero et al 2014 páll et al 2013 bloesch 2009 takić et al 2012 voza et al 2015 antonijević et al 2014 stoica et al 2014 pekárová et al 2009 this can be linked to numerous factors including i land use changes ii point and diffuse pollution generated by agricultural and industrial activities and individual households and iii catchment water cycle as a result of climate change and anthropogenic modifications in certain sectors of the drb one of the main wq issues consists of organic pollution from untreated or poorly treated urban wastewater the wastewater discharge impact has been clearly shown by notable increases in microbial faecal pollution downstream of major urban settlements kirschner et al 2017 even if at present danube wq has an overall ascending trend the drb management plan states that 49 and 35 of the total length of drb rivers 25 582 km may not achieve good ecological and chemical statuses respectively by 2021 icpdr website drb management plan 2015 mainly due to considerable organic and nutrient pollution generated by point i e wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharges and diffuse sources i e atmospheric deposition excessive fertilization and tile drainage systems hazardous substances and hydro morphological alterations moreover danube and drb rivers are affected by excessive water abstractions mainly used for hydropower generation and irrigation which can substantially alter flow dynamics and consequently reduce available water resources icpdr website drb management plan 2015 considering all aforementioned changes and trends in the drb this paper aims to assess the evolution of danube wq over the past decades by thoroughly reviewing 41 relevant open access studies out of 124 initially available works from the web of science wos platform the most important source of validated scientific information for the academic and research milieu the primary purpose of our work is to synthetically analyze the body of data that consists of scientific papers previously published on said topic the second goal of the work is to comprehensively investigate two main issues space related wq changes stretch or location of the danube section s subjected to wq analyses and time related wq changes in the last decades 1990 2018 comparing the trends when data was available to the high pollution decades i e 1960 1990 it is also relevant to acknowledge that given the importance of danube river 41 scientific articles that provide open access data regarding danube wq add up to a limited database that should be enriched 2 materials and methods we built a bank of research studies on danube wq sourced from the wos platform using a set of relevant keywords the last search was conducted on october 28 2019 said keywords including danube water quality were used in various combinations results 601 studies were then narrowed by applying several search filters open access wos categories and document types and a specific search protocol works in english language no temporal option relevance for our review thematic fit this second search resulted in a second bank of 41 relevant studies out of an initial list of 124 open access articles fig 2 11 articles analyse wq along the entire river 16 detail wq in serbia 7

this review s results considering the scientific contributions the papers made on danube wq for the entire river or for stretches that flow across certain states i e considering the number of scientific papers that analyse these issues 3 results and discussions 3 1 wq aspects and concerns of the entire danube over the past three decades a decrease in danube water nutrient loads was noticed as a result of political and economic changes that occurred in several eastern european countries but also because of advancement made in nutrient management in the danube basin cozzi et al 2019 in the 1970s and 1980s it was estimated that the danube contributed 80 of the riverine nutrient load to the black sea chapman et al 2016 from 2000 to 2005 the share of nutrient inputs to the black sea from the danube went down to 50 of the riverine nutrient load and there was a reduction in biochemical oxygen demand bod of 50 chapman et al 2016 however concentrations of inorganic nutrients remained 1 5 times higher compared to values recorded prior to 1950 from 1995 to 2009 the impact of diffuse and point nutrient sources on the danube river and its tributaries was analyzed malagó et al 2017 and it was determined that high loads of nitrogen had entered the river through diffuse sources e g fertilization the use of mineral fertilizers had a major contribution to the pollution of the danube river 55 followed by manure 37 and ammonia 8 malagó et al 2017 nonetheless the agricultural impact was substantially reduced by around 90 mainly due to crop uptake soil denitrification and riparian filter strips nitrogen from urban settlements directly contributed to the load of the danube river by approximately 35 while diffuse emissions from the agricultural sector including the contribution from precipitation accounted for 65 malagó et al 2017 similarly high phosphorus amounts entered the danube basin as a result of fertilizer use 95 of total sources this potential impact was substantially reduced by plant uptake and only 5 of diffuse source loads reached the river system which was heavily affected by phosphorus pollution from point sources malagó et al 2017 also over the past few decades the nutrient inputs that found their way into drb water bodies and the high amounts of sediment retained in reservoirs where dams were constructed have both contributed to pervasive eutrophication and sediment deficit along the entire course of the river tyler et al 2016 nevertheless the last decades trend of nutrient input reduction reflected the combined effects of several factors including improvements in wastewater treatment reservoir nutrient retention particularly phosphorus the economic recession undergone by numerous eastern european countries lower agricultural fertilizer use and a coordinated danube wq monitoring effort chapman et al 2016 while prior to 1998 the year icpdr was founded there was little basin wide coordination of river monitoring in december 1985 the governments of riparian countries along the danube signed the bucharest declaration chapman et al 2016 one of its objectives was to improve danube wq and to this end a monitoring program of 11 cross sections of the danube river was devised chapman et al 2016 the number of sampling sites grew to 61 in 1996 which resulted in the establishment of the trans national monitoring network tnmn the tnmn aimed to collect sufficient data to enable reliable and consistent investigations of wq pollution long term wq trends and concentration and load trends for priority pollutants to support wq analyses for water use and to identify major pollution sources chapman et al 2016 since the 1990s international co operation in the basin has been growing river wq has continued to be a major focus of this co operation together with the improvement of riverine ecosystems starting with 1996 the tnmn s collected data was published annually in the tnmn yearbooks the last one presenting the 2017 wq in the danube river basin compared to the previous 10 years icpdr website tnmn 2017 the conclusions of the tnmn 2017 yearbook icpdr website tnmn 2017 are consistent with the results of the studies conducted by scientists and published in wos papers in terms of the general spatial distribution of key wq parameters dissolved oxygen bod5 codcr n nh4 n no3 p po4 3 ptotal and cd along the danube river in 2017 the highest concentrations of biodegradable organic matter nutrients and cadmium were observed in the middle and lower parts of the river the highest values of dissolved oxygen were found in the upper part of the danube whereas in the lower danube dissolved oxygen levels decrease icpdr website tnmn 2017 since 1996 decreasing trends of biodegradable organic matter have been observed in the lower danube while the decreasing or stable concentrations of ammonium n were recorded across the entire danube river nitrate n concentrations have been rather stable over recent years in the last decade a decreasing trend of orthophosphate p concentrations was mostly seen in the upper part of the danube and at certain sites in the lower danube p total concentration had a decreasing trend in the last decade in the upper and middle danube cadmium concentrations were constant or slightly decreasing in the entire danube river as well as in its tributaries icpdr website tnmn 2017 in terms of loads suspended solids inorganic nitrogen orthophosphate phosphorus total phosphorus bod5 chlorides and where available dissolved phosphorus and silicates in 2017 in the entire danube river the mean annual discharge was lower than in 2016 in the case of suspended solids inorganic nitrogen bod5 orthophosphate total phosphorus and chlorides the highest load was observed in the lower part of the danube river the maximum load of suspended solids inorganic nitrogen orthophosphate total phosphorus dissolved phosphorus chlorides and silicates was observed at the monitoring location danube reni ro5 in romania the maximal load for bod5 was computed for the romanian monitoring station ro2 pristol novo selo icpdr website tnmn 2017 unfortunately there still was an in depth knowledge gap in terms of the levels of hazardous substances in the drb particularly persistent organic compounds endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical compounds which is why icpdr conducted 3 joint danube surveys jdss between 2001 and 2013 the first two jdss were held in 2001 and 2007 the second survey s jds2 findings confirmed the previous conclusions of the icpdr that danube river wq was generally improving it also identified a number of specific polluted areas where priority substances classified as such in the european wfd were found as were newly emerging contaminants that require further examination particularly in some tributaries loos et al 2017 jds2 mainly targeted pharmaceutical compounds pesticides and their degradation products perfluorinated acids and endocrine disrupting compounds loos et al 2017 the third joint danube survey jds3 was conducted by icpdr from august 13 to september 25 2013 along the danube river in nine countries from germany to romania and in the danube delta loos et al 2017 during the third survey the emerging organic contaminants identified by icpdr table 2 were analysed in 71 water samples collected from the danube river and its major tributaries loos et al 2017 several perfluoroalkyl substances were also analyzed as pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid was one of the most important contaminants in jds2 originating mostly from a fluoropolymer production plant located in germany on the inn river tributary loos et al 2017 the third survey conclusion was that danube continues to exhibit signs of degradation downstream of major cities and in several main tributaries as a result of insufficient or non existent treatment of wastewater loos et al 2017 treated and untreated wastewater discharged from wwtps is the main source of the organic contaminants found in the danube river and its tributaries loos et al 2017 most relevant micropollutants found during jds3 were benzotriazoles pharmaceuticals organophosphorus compounds and pfos a loos et al 2017 these compounds concentrations were generally below the environmental quality standard eqs threshold values except for pfos the concentration of which exceeded the annual average water eqs limit of 0 65 ng l along the entire river and also exceeded the fish biota eqs of 9 1 μg kg loos et al 2017 in addition to the emerging organic contaminant pollution another worrying type of danube wq deterioration is the one caused by faeces in 2014 microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria sfib along a 2 580 km stretch of the danube kirschner et al 2017 faecal pollution and the potential presence of pathogenic agents are mainly linked to untreated sewage microbiological contamination from faecal pollution caused by anthropogenic sources is considered to be a crucial issue throughout the drb as it poses a threat to all types of water uses kirschner et al 2017 the contamination of water resources by faecal pollutants poses a high risk to human and animal health as numerous pathogens are often associated with faeces páll et al 2013 faecal indicator bacteria such as total coliforms faecal coliforms thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci faecal streptococci are excreted by humans and warm blooded animals pass sewage treatment plants in large amounts and survive preserving their pathogenicity for a certain time páll et al 2013 in 2014 human faecal pollution was proven to be the primary pollution source along the entire river while animal faecal pollution was found to be of minor importance kirschner et al 2017 escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci were used as general indicators of faecal pollution it turned out that for monitoring the entire river midstream samples were largely representative of faecal pollution levels kirschner et al 2017 however at a few somewhat unexpected sites on the upper middle and lowest danube sectors high pollution values were recorded laterally along the river although the midstream zone had good microbial water quality levels kirschner et al 2017 to conclude at present for the entire danube river the main pollution concerns revolve around nutrients emerging organic contaminants and human faeces fig 3 further reduction in nutrients and organic pollution is needed 3 2 serbian danube wq trends in serbia wq assessment is based on the water quality index wqi method that uses ten selected parameters oxygen saturation bod5 ammonium ion ph total nitrogen orthophosphates suspended solids temperature electrical conductivity and coliform bacteria serbian environmental protection agency website according to the serbian wqi based method there are 4 classes of surface wq i high excellent and very good wq ii good wq iii bad wq iv very bad wq serbian environmental protection agency website in serbia where the danube stretches across 588 km wq monitoring results showed that the eco chemical status of the danube river constantly improved from 1992 to 2006 živadinović et al 2010 regular monthly measurements were taken during this interval at 13 sampling stations and the following parameters were assessed suspended matter nitrates no3 n total nitrogen n total phosphorus p biological oxygen demand for 5 days bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod živadinović et al 2010 the total river load was much higher at the entrance of the danube river into serbia bezdan compared to the outflow point radujevac živadinović et al 2010 the improvement of the eco chemical status was twofold table 3 in terms of both time from 1992 until 2006 and space from bezdan to radujevac živadinović et al 2010 the improvement of danube wq in serbia was confirmed by the presence of 70 desmid taxa along the danube in the province of vojvodina northern serbia stamenković and cvijan 2008 between april 2002 and may 2003 54 water samples for qualitative phytoplankton and physico chemical analyses were collected from seven localities along the danube in northern serbia they showed a high diversity of desmids and good wq in this province stamenković and cvijan 2008 the overall quality of danube water on serbian territory continued to be very good in 2009 when it was analyzed at 16 sampling stations takić et al 2012 unfortunately serbia holds the so called dark point of pollution in the drb one of europe s most polluted watercourses veliki bački channel vbc in vojvodina north serbia which connects the rivers danube and tisa pantelić et al 2012 evaluated the vbc s wq over a ten year period 2000 2009 based on the wqi method the results showed very bad wq near the settlement vrbas downstream of vrbas wqi parameters ranged from bad to good in 2016 pantelić et al analyzed the local population s stance on using the vbc for irrigation and drainage the serbian wqi method showed that the channel included sections that were pure where the local population had a positive attitude towards irrigation and drainage and a section that was heavily degraded and utterly unusable near vrbas where residents stood out for their highly negative standpoints on wq as danube wq is influenced by the wq of its tributaries leščešen et al 2018 used the wqi method to analyse danube tributaries from 2004 to 2013 the highest wq value was measured on drina river while the lowest value was attributed to juzna morava and tisa rivers tisa river wq in serbia was also evaluated by babić et al 2019 between 2011 and 2016 using the serbian wqi parameters derived from a six year public environmental database the tisa river basin trb is the largest sub basin of the drb and its serbian sector covers almost half of vojvodina the most important area for commercial agriculture this study revealed that wq along the serbian tisa slightly decreased downstream serbian wqi values showed that during the monitoring period wq was good and very good was showing an improvement and was having a positive impact on the danube s eco chemical status the changes in tisa wq mostly occurred under the influence of anthropogenic organic pollutants and nutrients total phosphorus ammonia etc between 1995 and 2000 serbian tisa wq was only included in quality classes ii and iii babić et al 2019 petrović and marković 2015 assessed the levels of physicochemical parameters ph electrical conductivity sulphates chlorides temperature turbidity total hardness iron manganese copper dissolved oxygen oxygen saturation suspended solids ammonium nitrogen total nitrogen and orthophosphates in the water samples collected from pek river at 4 sample sites over 6 months from november 2011 to may 2012 pek river is a tributary of the danube located in south eastern serbia according to the serbian water classification pek river falls in the 2nd wq class suitable for bathing recreation and water sports the results of physicochemical analyses showed that copper and sulphates were present in almost all water samples with exceeding values which were linked to wastewater discharge from the majdanpek copper mine as the mine s filtration plant needed more efficient treatment processes petrović and marković 2015 in 2010 serbian danube wq was measured at 11 monitoring stations along the river on a monthly basis following 10 quality parameters oxygen saturation biochemical oxygen demand bod ammonium ph total nitrogen oxides orthophosphate suspended solids temperature conductivity and most probable number of coliform bacteria e coli mpn walker et al 2015 due to its absence in many cases the e coli criterion was omitted from the results the stations with the best wq were radujevac and smederevo while the stations with the worst wq were novi sad and bačka palanka walker et al 2015 this suggested that downstream stations had a better wq than upstream ones which according to walker et al 2015 can be explained by the danube river s intense self purification process that reduces the organic load also in 2010 during spring and autumn a study was conducted on the impact of urban wastewaters on danube river wq in serbia kolarević et al 2011 water and sediment samples were collected for microbiological analysis and genotoxicity monitoring from 6 sites the sanitary analysis i e enumeration of total and faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci indicated moderate to critical faecal contamination while the organic load assessment oligotroph to heterotroph ratio index of phosphatase activity revealed moderately polluted water levels kolarević et al 2011 the domination of oligotrophs in almost all water samples indicated a satisfactory level of self purification kolarević et al 2011 mercury resistant bacteria were detected in all water samples with high numbers at locations downstream of belgrade kolarević et al 2011 results showed that the pollution detected at the monitored sites could be mainly attributed to the high amount of untreated or improperly treated urban wastewater while the more intense local agricultural activity during sampling periods probably contributed to the organic pollution in april 2010 despotović et al 2019 proved that the river snail species viviparus acerosus could be used as a potential bioindicator of metal pollution in danube s freshwater ecosystems the authors determined that metal concentrations in snail bodies were affected to a greater extent by river sediment than by the water s metal content in 2011 serbia s danube river water monitored at 17 sampling sites could be best described as moderately polluted voza et al 2015 11 wq parameters were analyzed water temperature ph value suspended solids dissolved oxygen ammonium nitrate orthophosphate silicate sulphate chloride and biochemical oxygen demand voza et al 2015 the 17 monitoring stations were grouped into three statistically significant distance based clusters cluster 1 consisted of seven sampling stations apatin bezdan bogojevo čenta bačka palanka novi sad and slankamen cluster 2 of two sampling stations banatska palanka and pančevo while the third cluster consisted of 8 stations belgrade vinča dobra zemun brza palanka tekija smederevo v gradište and radujevac voza et al 2015 within the same cluster locations had similar characteristics and pollution sources the sampling stations in cluster 1 were located in high pollution areas cluster 2 and its two sampling stations indicated moderate pollution areas finally cluster 3 was classified as serbia s low polluted danube sector voza et al 2015 this effectively divided the serbian danube into an upper river section which covered the stretch from the hungarian border to belgrade and a lower section strongly influenced by the iron gates i and ii dam complex which stretched from belgrade to the bulgarian border as voza et al 2015 proved with regard to the serbian capital antonijević et al 2014 showed that the danube s overall status in the belgrade region at three sampling locations in january and february 2013 was moderate the analysis looked at organic contaminants in the river water heavy metals in the sediments but also several common wq parameters such as total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and major ions the quantification of organic contaminants did not indicate elevated pollution levels antonijević et al 2014 more significant contaminations were found for chromium nickel zinc and partially copper in sediments with values exceeding target values according to serbian regulations but below the intervention values antonijević et al 2014 in serbia between 2004 and 2013 air temperature had a low effect on changes in danube wq and the anthropogenic impact was far more dominant pantelić et al 2015 the biggest impact of air temperature was seen on nitrogen oxide concentration which increases as temperature goes down pantelić et al 2015 amid high concentrations of nitrogen in water algae start pullulating suddenly pantelić et al 2015 once they die out a large amount of oxygen is consumed to decompose organic matter the lack of oxygen negatively affects aerobic water organisms primarily fish pantelić et al 2015 at the same time basarin et al 2016 revealed that the relationship between air ta and water temperature tw is very important because it shows how the temperature of a water body might respond to future changes in ta some adaptation strategies could be established in order to buffer undesirable effects of river warming basarin et al 2016 found that tw influences chemical and biochemical processes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion affects other physical properties of flowing waters and influences the life cycles of lotic biota the authors analyzed the mean monthly tw records of 3 gauging stations bezdan bogojevo and veliko gradište ta series from 2 meteorological stations sombor and veliko gradište were correlated with tw variations over the period 1950 2012 statistically significant warming trends were observed for annual and seasonal minimum and maximum tw at all investigated sites in terms of how safe serbian danube water is for bathing this was assessed by jovanović galović et al from august to september 2014 at five popular public danube beaches in vojvodina using physical chemical and bacteriological tests of water samples while no enterovirus material was found in any sample adenovirus and rotavirus genetic materials were detected in 60 and 31 samples respectively out of a total of 90 jovanović galović et al 2016 statistical analyses showed a significant positive correlation between adenovirus dna and total coliforms and faecal coliforms jovanović galović et al 2016 even when water sample quality levels were adequate for recreational use adenoviruses were detected in 75 of such samples jovanović galović et al 2016 the results indicated that using viral indicators in the analysis of recreational water could prove helpful to better assess public health safety this might be particularly relevant in areas where urban wastewater treatment is insufficient and where surface waters affected by wastewater are used for recreation jovanović galović et al 2016 a positive statistically significant correlation was obtained between danube adenovirus material and both water nitrate concentration and turbidity which are parameters related to faecal contamination jovanović galović et al 2016 to conclude danube wq in serbia improved between 1992 and 2006 and was classified as very good in 2009 fig 4 a lower wq has been noticed since 2010 at stations located in the upper section of the serbian danube stretch faecal pollution was recorded that same year as was a pollution event caused by organic substances linked to untreated or improperly treated urban wastewater and to local agricultural activity respectively in 2011 serbian danube wq was moderate and the same quality class was found in 2013 in the belgrade region fig 4 in 2014 adenoviruses were detected on five public danube beaches in vojvodina linked to faecal pollution fig 4 the viral indicators could be used for assessing public health safety of recreational waters regrettably serbia has one of the most polluted watercourses in europe vbc which connects danube and tisa rivers vbc had very bad wq near the settlement vrbas for ten years 2000 2009 and its water was deemed improper for irrigation and drainage as danube wq is influenced by the wq of its tributaries their water was analyzed and the results showed that between 2004 and 2013 drina river had the highest wq while juzna morava and tisa rivers had the lowest fortunately tisa wq improved from 2011 to 2016 was classified as good and very good and had a positive impact on danube wq in 2011 2012 pek river wq was classified into the 2nd class as high copper and sulphate values were recorded 3 3 danube wq tendencies in romania moving on to romania the studies showed that danube water pollution was higher on romanian territory especially in the lower danube sector pollution was caused by various factors including accidental industrial waste leakage deliberate release of pollutants spillage of oil products from storage tanks and pipelines use of agricultural pesticides and herbicides incorrect waste disposal solubilisation of atmospheric pollutants acid rains etc dumbrava and birghila 2009 apetrei et al 2019 iticescu et al 2019 a 2008 study which analysed danube river water samples collected from 5 sites in constanta county found the highest concentrations of 3 metallic ions chromium iron and copper which indicated that some of the water samples could be categorized in the 5th quality class fig 5 in samples collected in the winter season dumbrava and birghila 2009 from june to september 2010 monthly sampling and analyses from lower danube river water in the galati harbour area established the presence of total coliforms faecal coliforms and e coli in amounts that required the implementation of environmental securing measures to avoid the spread of communicable diseases on a scale that could result in water borne outbreaks in the local community engaged in water based domestic and industrial activities ajeagah et al 2012 the persistence of e coli during the sampling period confirmed the continuous faecal pollution of this medium ajeagah et al 2012 the high presence of organic pollutants combined with the presence of coliforms and e coli could be related to an accumulation of waste matter across the entire ecosystem due to the lack of wwtps for domestic and industrial discharges the high impact of human activities throughout the river basin and to difficulties in the natural operational self purification processes ajeagah et al 2012 in 2012 from july to october an improvement in danube wq was highlighted by computing macro invertebrate indices that indicated a good ecological status for danube at isaccea monitoring station ro14 stoica et al 2014 fig 5 this improvement of the romanian danube wq continued in the following years while the lower danube river km 375 km 175 wq monitoring program 2011 2014 presented moderate to slightly elevated values for most of the 41 quality indicators radu et al 2016 this gradually changed between winter 2013 and winter 2016 as well as during the following years apetrei et al 2019 iticescu et al 2019 in this period 18 parameters were measured upstream and downstream of galati city in 5 sampling points along the lower danube namely ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod n nh4 n no2 n no3 n total p po4 3 so4 2 cl fe total cr total pb2 ni2 mn2 zn2 as2 wq fell into the second category good and third category moderate iticescu et al 2019 fig 5 in 2016 2017 birghila et al 2017 studied the variation of fe ii and total iron concentration in poarta alba midia navodari channel pamnc a 32 7 km long artificial surface water body that connects the danube with the black sea the channel water is taken from the danube upstream of cernavoda town and discharged into the black sea at agigea results indicated a high iron concentration in surface water and a seasonal variation of iron concentration and speciation which can be correlated with the oxidable matter content as iron acts as an oxidizing agent in the presence of oxidable matter on the basis of total iron concentration pamnc water could be included in the fifth quality class the discharge of wastewaters from riverine settlements affects pamnc water quality which is very important for the chemical and ecological status of black sea coastal waters in 2018 wq in the lower danube area in all sampling points near galati city was classified in the second class fig 5 according to the romanian standard of surface wq and the eu water directive the analyzed parameters were ph tds total dissolved solids resistivity turbidity amounts of fe and no3 apetrei et al 2019 the findings of the open access romanian studies state that the wq of the lower danube river improved from 2008 when some of the water samples were categorized in the 5th quality class for chromium iron and copper to 2018 when the wq was classified in the second class namely good quality figs 5 6 between 2013 and 2016 the lower danube river wq was included in the second and third moderate quality categories figs 5 6 unfortunately this stretch of the danube river was affected by organic and faecal pollution in 2010 fig 6 pamnc which connects the danube with the black sea had bad wq in 2016 and 2017 and this could influence the chemical and ecological status of black sea coastal waters the below standard water quality in the channels that connect the danube river with the black sea may influence the latter s coastal ecosystems as it was proved by snigirova et al in 2018 snigirova et al 2021 who focused on the ukrainian black sea coast being affected by the 3rd and 4th water quality classes of the bystroe bystry navigation channel water 3 4 danube wq directions in slovakia the wq of the slovak danube river sector i e the slovak austrian slovak and slovak hungarian stretches changed considerably over the past decades holcík 2003 the danube entering slovak territory was heavily polluted in early 1970 as a consequence of both industrialization mainly the construction of chemical and petrochemical units and of the growing number of inhabitants in vast urban areas on both banks of the danube holcík 2003 wq deteriorated from the 3rd degree of purity beta mesosaprobic to the 4th degree alpha mesosaprobic holcík 2003 the self cleaning capability of the danube decreased considerably and the toxic effects of industrial wastewaters exceeded the limits deemed dangerous to human health and to certain organisms the most hazardous were the wastewaters resulting from petrochemical activities that contained considerable and ever growing amounts of oil holcík 2003 the construction of water purification stations in vienna schwechat and bratislava in the early 1980s substantially influenced and improved wq of the slovak danube segment holcík 2003 the increase in danube river pollution that characterized the 1955 1985 period has been brought to a halt and since that time an improvement in wq has been noticed holcík 2003 fish diversity in the danube s slovak sector was controlled by the inland delta that existed in this region until 1992 seventy six species were recorded in this river section over more than 100 years holcík 2003 while the increasing pollution levels until 1985 led to a decrease in the number of fish species the improvement in wq thereafter partially restored it according to slovak specialists the construction of the gabcíkovo river barrage system which became operational in october 1992 substantially lowered fish species and population richness and fish catch holcík 2003 before 1990 the danube wq in bratislava slovakia s capital was affected by pollution sources located in germany austria and the czech republic pekárová et al 2009 the long term trends of wq variables of the danube river at bratislava chl a ca ec so4 2 cl o2 bod5 n tot po4 p no3 n no2 n etc analyzed based on monthly measurements between 1991 and 2005 revealed that wq improved over that years pekárová et al 2009 the decline in pollutant concentrations was the result of the introduction of wwtps upstream of bratislava pekárová et al 2009 as a short conclusion for the slovak danube river sector the water pollution that defined the 1955 1985 period was halted and wq improved fig 7 3 5 hungarian danube wq trends in budapest the capital of hungary danube wq is high it improved over the past three decades as a result of the construction of communal wwtps and of the limited use of artificial agricultural fertilizers nagy kovács et al 2019 fig 8 suspended particulate matter spm loads in the danube river at göd 1668 river km about 20 km upstream of budapest analyzed between 2003 and 2012 have decreased by about 50 compared to previous years since 1990s which is most likely the result of the construction of hydropower plants on the upper german austrian slovakian stretches of the danube river tóth and bódis 2015 fig 8 3 6 the upper danube germany austria slovakia wq tendencies in the upper danube river southern germany the decline in fish catches has been observed since the early 1990 s grund et al 2010 between 2006 and 2010 a series of studies were conducted in order to identify the factors that could have generated this decline grund et al 2010 a considerable ecotoxicological impact of sediments at different locations along the upper danube river was detected by bioassays given its benthic lifestyle and exposure to sediments but also its decline in fish catches in the upper danube river the common barbel barbus barbus l was selected to be the test organism grund et al 2010 a severe disturbance of hepatic cell metabolism and an impaired health status of the barbel were observed at the contaminated sampling sites rottenacker and ehingen grund et al 2010 although a direct cause effect relationship between sediment contamination and ultrastructural alteration of the barbel could not be established it may be suggested based on toxicity assays that sediment bound xenobiotics could in part account for the hepatocellular changes grund et al 2010 many xenobiotics tended to accumulate in the liver which made this organ particularly sensitive in austria change patterns in the concentrations of total and soluble reactive phosphorus tp and srp and suspended sediments ss at different flow levels in the austrian danube between 1991 and 2013 were analyzed statistically and linked to point and diffuse emissions as well as to extreme hydrological events zoboli et al 2015 the danube was analyzed at its entrance into austrian territory from germany inflow and at its exit from austria outflow zoboli et al 2015 phosphorus retention essentially occurred through deposition and algae growth the stock generated was then exposed to remobilization during flood events when phosphorus peaks were transported downstream and exported to river banks and flooded areas zoboli et al 2015 srp contributed to the identification of point emission impacts as it was typically the prevalent phosphorus species in wwtp effluents zoboli et al 2015 ss provided further information on diffuse pathways as particulate bound phosphorus was the predominant species transported by storm dependent agricultural runoff and erosion processes zoboli et al 2015 the lower number of point discharges during the 1990s resulting from the efforts made by germany and austria translated into decreasing the tp and srp base flow concentrations during 1991 2013 but it did not lead to any changes in higher flow level concentrations nor in the annual transport of tp loads zoboli et al 2015 an acute and enduring decline in tp concentration which affected all flow levels occurred after a major 2002 flood it was once again visible during another major flood in 2013 which recorded lower tp concentrations than the previous event such a decline could not be linked to changes in point or diffuse emissions but as a result of the flood the river system experienced a considerable depletion of its in stream phosphorus stock and a reduced mobilization of tp rich sediments zoboli et al 2015 the upper danube basin germany austria slovakia extending from the danube source down to the gabcikovo reservoir near bratislava is also at risk of eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen availability udias et al 2016 nitrogen losses in the form of nitrate n no3 come from point and diffuse pollution sources acknowledging that over fertilization is a well known issue in the upper danube a proper management of mineral fertilization could lead to important environmental benefits without affecting economic farming income udias et al 2016 in upper danube basin countries the high input of organic nitrogen from manure would indeed allow the reduction of mineral inputs with limited negative effects on crop yields assuming that a correct management of manure would be put in place udias et al 2016 therefore in the upper danube basin wq is affected by sediment bound xenobiotics that generated a decline in fish catches and by eutrophication fig 9 4 conclusions since the early 1970s the danube water regime has changed because of the construction of water reservoirs dams and hydropower plants which significantly regulated its flow between 1960 and 1990 nitrogen discharge into the danube basin has increased about fivefold whereas phosphate has doubled due to growing anthropogenic inputs over the past 50 years the different industries urban development agriculture and hydrotechnical activities increased the pressure on the danube and generated notable negative changes in wq most recently reductions in nutrient loads were observed which are linked to political economic and wq management changes that occurred in european countries nevertheless the upper danube basin is still at risk of eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen availability agricultural runoff and erosion processes table 4 even if danube wq is currently on an overall upward trend the river still shows signs of degradation mainly organic pollution downstream of major cities in some important tributaries as well as in the anthropic channels that connect the danube with tisa or the black sea as a result of discharge of untreated or poorly treated wastewater table 4 improperly treated and untreated wastewater released from wwtps is also the main source of emerging organic contaminants found in the danube river and its tributaries and of sediment bound xenobiotics found in the upper danube basin table 4 the impact of wastewater discharges has been clearly shown by marked increases in microbial faecal pollution downstream of major towns and cities microbiological contamination from faecal pollution by anthropogenic sources is considered to be a crucial problem throughout the drb table 4 posing a threat to all types of water uses human faecal pollution was identified as the primary pollution source along the entire river while animal faecal pollution was found to be of minor importance certain specific areas polluted with substances listed as a priority in the european wfd as well as with newly emerging contaminants table 4 require urgent measures the results of this review can be used as a basis for further monitoring investigations and environmental protection actions on the danube but also for regional trans danube cooperation in light of the danube wq security all danube countries are engaged in a committed fight against water pollution and have the full support of icpdr the danube commission and of eu environmental entities if they do not win the danube and its basin s rivers risk failing to achieve a good ecological and chemical status by 2021 mainly due to the high organic and nutrient pollution from point sources and diffuse sources and to hazardous substances the fight for danube s water purity continues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
