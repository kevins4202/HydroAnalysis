21645,considering the top end platform surge induced by periodic wave the encountered flow field of marine risers under the actual marine environment is approximate to a combined sheared and sheared oscillatory flow which is non uniform in both time and spatial domains a published time domain force decomposition model is proposed to predict the riser s nonlinear dynamic response under non uniform combined unsteady flows a 90 m flexible riser is chosen as the simulated object and a large amount of the combined flow cases with different oscillation periods and combined ratios are designed with the fundamental study on a steady sheared flow case the structural dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows are investigated systematically the overall dynamic response presents travel wave pattern and the high frequency response is easier to be excited for the riser s top and bottom segments some time sharing response characteristics like amplitude modulation frequency transition and mode jumps are captured and they are affected by the flow field parameters significantly under the long oscillation period cases the intermittent dynamic response follows the accordant periodicity with the current velocity while under the short oscillation period cases the unstable structural vibration occurs persistently without clear regularity the combined ratio also influences the rms displacement excited frequency bandwidth and travel wave propagation velocity evidently associated with viv mechanism analysis the individual response characteristics under different flow field parameter combinations are explained reasonably keywords nonlinear dynamic response numerical analysis marine risers vortex induced vibration non uniform combined unsteady flow 1 introduction nonlinear dynamic response of marine risers has recently received the increasing attention by ocean engineering especially under the situation that subsea oil and gas exploitation is spreading to deeper sea periodic vortex sheds around marine risers when ocean current flows over resulting in the complicated hydrodynamic forces and secondary vibration i e vortex induced vibration viv of slender flexible structures the encouraged flow field by the riser is exactly one of the most crucial causes of its nonlinear dynamic response fig 1 is the simplified sketch of platform riser seabed system under the actual marine environment the riser is connected to the floating platform at top end and fixed with seabed wellhead at bottom the background current profile could be approximately deemed as linear sheared flow with the wave excitation the surge motion of the floating platform is easy to be excited which drives the riser s top end to experience the concomitant oscillation movement marked with the black dotted lines the riser s oscillation movement fades along the axial direction due to the displacement constraint at bottom the influence of the riser s concomitant oscillation induced by platform surge on the riser s dynamic response could be equivalent to an extra sheared oscillatory flow field excitation therefore the encountered flow field of the riser under complicated marine environment is approximate to a combined sheared and sheared oscillatory flow which is non uniform in both time and spatial domains experiments and numerical simulations are two main approaches to achieve deeper understanding of the riser s viv at present liu et al 2020 the typical experimental investigations could be classified into free vibration test blevins and coughran 2009 gu et al 2020 forced vibration test gopalkrishnan 1993 zheng 2014 and model tests lie and kaasen 2006 han et al 2017 experiments could obtain reliable measurements and intuitive phenomena but usually cost a lot more researches devote to such an issue with different numerical models among which computational fluid dynamic cfd methods rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2019 nikoo et al 2019 and semi empirical models are common the semi empirical models could be further divided into two types of wake oscillator model gao et al 2017 qu and metrikine 2020 and force decomposition model wang et al 2013 respectively most of the existing researches focus on the steady like uniform sheared or stepped flow cases the riser s nonlinear dynamic analysis under unsteady flow is still in its infancy fu et al 2014 and ren et al 2019 carried out the laboratory experiments of a 4 m riser s viv under oscillatory flow and indicated that the structural dynamic response presents some time sharing characteristics evidently wang et al 2018 evaluated the viv of a steel catenary riser in steady current and vessel motion induced oscillatory current by experimental investigation there are also several numerical investigations on oscillatory flow cases with diverse simulation methods chang and isherwood 2003 zhao et al 2012 thorsen et al 2016 pearcey et al 2017 fu et al 2018 lu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 and deng 2014 predicted the riser s viv response under combined uniform and oscillatory flow with two dimensional slice theory and cfd technique although the unsteady flow cases have begun to be noticed the relevant researches just deal with the pure oscillatory flow or simple uniform combined flow temporarily there is still few concern about the complicated combined unsteady flow case mentioned in fig 1 although the spatial non uniformness of the incoming flow has been widely recognized to affect the riser s dynamic response significantly this paper adopts a time domain force decomposition model to predict the marine riser s viv under non uniform combined unsteady flow hereinafter referred to as non uniform combined flow the structural nonlinear dynamic response characteristics are investigated systematically and the effects of different flow field parameters are discussed associated with viv mechanism analysis the individual response characteristics under non uniform combined flow are explained reasonably 2 numerical model and methodology the adopted time domain force decomposition model by this paper originates from yuan et al 2018a cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the numerical model where x axis is parallel with flow velocity y axis is perpendicular to incoming flow direction and z axis is along the axial direction of the cylinder as shown in fig 1 this paper at present only focuses on the cross flow dynamic response 2 1 viv hydrodynamic force model the cross flow hydrodynamic force f h y d r o is written as eq 1 decomposed into three force components i e excitation force f v damping force f d and inertia force f m i e the first second and third terms on the right side respectively 1 f h y d r o f v f d f m 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t c f a d f d v t y t π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 where c v is the excitation force coefficient a is the cylinder s response amplitude d is the cylinder diameter f is the cylinder s response frequency v is the instantaneous combined flow velocity t is the time ρ f is the fluid density c f is the hydrodynamic damping coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient which is assumed as a constant 1 0 in this paper hydrodynamic force coefficients c v and c f change with response amplitude a and frequency f as functions of time fig 2 is the excitation force coefficient contour originated from the cylinder forced vibration tests gopalkrishnan 1993 the thick orange line marks the important boundary between excitation and damping zones among the damping zone or outside the experimental data range excitation force coefficient will be negative and transfer to hydrodynamic damping force strouhal number is a non dimensional hydrodynamic parameter and can be expressed as f s d v where f s is the vortex shedding frequency strouhal number of the forced vibration experiments is 0 193 a and f are the most crucial variables to obtain hydrodynamic forces based on finite element method fem the cylinder is divided into a large amount of beam elements structure segments along its axial direction the cylinder s displacement y and velocity v at every node and time t will be extracted at each time step to describe the real time a and f as expressed by eq 2 2 a y j y i 2 f 1 2 t j t i where y i y j t i t j are the displacement and time of the adjacent two time points i and j with local response velocity v 0 2 2 lock in judgement criterion lock in is the most significant characteristic of viv according to the recent experimental research by zheng 2014 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is set as the lock in region in this paper which needs to be corrected by eq 3 for the difference of strouhal number between actual and test circumstances 3 f r s t t e s t f r s t a c t u a l where f r is the non dimensional frequency f r f d v if the non dimensional response frequency is located within the excitation bandwidth lock in occurs the cylinder element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to f r 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient as shown in fig 2 here f r 0 17 also needs to be corrected by eq 3 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v this treatment method maybe a little overestimates the excitation force while the validation against experiments under lots of different cases proves that the adopted numerical model could give reasonable prediction results the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force is always in phase with the local velocity of the cylinder the control loop is a regulator system consisting of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase differences between the local velocity of the cylinder and the excitation force at lock in appear as a step function to the regulator system the phase difference will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time then the phase locked loops pll remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero when c v is negative i e the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth hydrodynamic damping will act on the cylinder and viv dominant frequency is regarded equal to response frequency the negative c v is calculated by fig 2 and then transferred to hydrodynamic damping coefficient c f with eq 4 4 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 t d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical nonlinear damping model proposed by venugopal 1996 will be adopted where the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 2 3 structural dynamic response solution as far as small displacement is concerned which is generally true in the viv case of the flexible cylinder with a large aspect ratio of length to diameter the cylinder can be deemed as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of motion in cross flow direction can be expressed as eq 5 5 m π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 c s c f a d f d v t y t e i 4 y z 4 z t e z t y z 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t where m is the mass per unit length of the cylinder c s is the structural damping coefficient which can be expressed as c s 4 π m f ξ ξ is the structural damping ratio e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia t e is the effective axial tension the adopted numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis eq 5 is solved with the hilber hughes taylor hht method hilber et al 1977 eq 6 shows how the positions and velocities update at each time step and the time discrete momentum equation is expressed in eq 7 6 y t δ t y t δ t y t δ t 2 1 2 β y t 2 β y t δ t 2 y t δ t y t δ t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t 7 r t α δ t f t δ t e x t m y t δ t c y t α δ t f i n t y t α δ t y t α δ t 1 α y t α y t δ t y t α δ t 1 α y t α y t δ t where f ext and f int are the external and internal forces in the whole system r is the force residuals when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameter α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 002 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency this means there are at least 500 steps during each vibration period of the cylinder which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment causes no change in the predictions eq 5 is discretized in space by using fem and the structural kinetic equation can be rewritten as eq 8 8 m s m a y c s c f y k a k b y f e x c where m s and m a are the structural and added mass matrices c s and c f are the structural and hydrodynamic damping matrices k a is the additional lateral stiffness matrix provided by effective axial tension and k b is the bending stiffness matrix determined by cylinder inherent properties f e x c is the excitation force vector and y is a vector containing nodal translations and rotations associated with eq 7 the force residuals vector r t α δ t in hht method is expressed in eq 9 9 r t α δ t m s m a y t δ t 1 α g t δ t α g t where g is an internal state vector which can be expressed as g f e x c c s c f y to better demonstrate the adopted numerical approach the flow chart within each time step of the nonlinear dynamic analysis for marine risers is drawn in fig 3 2 4 validation against experimental measurements since there seems still no comparable experimental investigations on marine risers under non uniform combined unsteady flows this section respectively compares the predicted results with experimental measurements under sheared flow and oscillatory flow cases so that the availability of the adopted numerical model for non uniform combined unsteady flows could be proved 1 sheared flow case since sheared flow is typically non uniform which means the local current velocity at different axial locations of the riser is unequal and the dynamic response of different riser sections inevitably presents quite different response patterns the 90 m riser model in lie and kaasen 2006 is chosen as the simulated object here the main parameters of the riser model are listed in table 1 fig 4 compares the rms displacement and curvature envelops along the riser between the predicted results and experimental measurements under the linearly sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s where v top is the top end current velocity the predicted overall dynamic response including the rms displacement and curvature envelops shows a good agreement with the experimental observations and the structural response along the riser model is dominated by the 11th mode in general the adopted numerical model is verified reasonable to handle such non uniform flow case 2 oscillatory flow case the published test data of a 4 m riser under oscillatory flow by fu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the performance of the adopted numerical model the main parameters of the flexible cylinder model are listed in table 2 when fluid oscillates periodically in time domain the motion equation can be described in eq 10 10 a t a m sin 2 π t f t v t a m 2 π t f cos 2 π t f t v m cos 2 π t f t where a m and v m are the maximum oscillation amplitude and oscillation velocity t f is the oscillation period keulegan carpenter kc number is another key parameter to describe a certain oscillatory flow which can be expressed as eq 11 reduced velocity is one of the most important parameters of viv under steady flows it can be written as v r n v f n d where f n is the nth structural natural frequency in still water by assuming c a 1 0 the maximum reduced velocity for oscillatory flow cases is defined as eq 12 11 k c v m t f d 2 π a m d 12 v r 1 m v m f 1 d 2 π a m t f 1 d k c t f 1 two representative cases in table 3 with high and small kc numbers are simulated fig 5 and fig 6 respectively present the dynamic response comparison at midpoint z 2 m of the cylinder between predicted left and test right results the top rows are displacement time histories and the bottom ones are the strain wavelet contour plots with mother wavelet of morlet wavelet for high kc number case i e case o1 intermittent and periodic viv could be found evidently in the predicted and test displacement time histories during a certain oscillation period because there are two time segments for flow velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude would modulate slightly like a shape of mountain peak twice frequency transition can also be captured in the predicted and test wavelet contour plots there are also two obvious transition process during a certain oscillation period the predicted varying processes and maximum values of response amplitude as well as frequency both show good agreement with test results for small kc number case i e case o2 slight amplitude modulation could also be observed according to the predicted and test results but it should be distinguished from high kc number case amplitude fluctuates in time domain without evident regularity which is more likely to be caused by unstable vibration of the riser rather than the periodic pattern of flow velocity in general the response amplitude keeps relatively constant and time history is quite like the sinusoidal shape under uniform flow both predicted and test results show that response frequency also basically keeps unchanged with time and the comparable values are approximate this time domain prediction method has actually been validated well with some published experimental measurements under oscillatory flow cases and time varying axial tension cases in yuan et al 2018a and yuan et al 2018b respectively here just briefly presents its performance under one sheared flow case and two representative oscillatory flow cases more details could be found in yuan et al 2018a generally the adopted numerical model is believed able to give the reasonable prediction results under the sheared flow and non uniform combined flow cases 3 response characteristics under sheared flow case as the basis of the subsequent investigation to know the viv features under pure sheared flow at first is necessary the same 90 m riser model simulated in section 2 4 continues to be chosen as the research object apart from the comparisons with experimental results this paper selects three representative monitoring locations to further investigate the viv response at the riser s top middle and bottom regions respectively fig 7 is the predicted viv response of the riser under the sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s where v top is the current velocity at top left and middle are the time histories of response displacement and frequency and right is the corresponding frequency spectra z l of row 1 3 is 0 833 0 500 and 0 167 respectively time frequency distribution plots are obtained by continuous wavelet transform cwt technique with mother wavelet of morlet wavelet amplitude spectra are based on fast fourier transform fft method the shapes of displacement time histories at different riser locations are obviously different during the same time interval the time history of the riser s middle segment z l 0 500 has smaller half wave number than the top z l 0 833 and bottom z l 0 167 segments displacement amplitude slightly modulates in time domain while viv is still persistent according to the wavelet analysis plots there are stable response energy concentrating at multiple frequency components and every frequency is excited discontinuously the strongest frequency component changes with the variation of time and mode jump can be evidently captured as marked with dark dotted ellipses although response energy all appear within 1 5 hz 3 hz the time frequency distributions of the riser s different segments present some differences associated with the response frequency spectra different riser segments have identical excited frequency bandwidth but different energy strength allocation as well as unequal response peak frequency the respective peak frequencies are marked by red dotted squares the strongest frequency component of the riser s middle segment 1 88 hz is lower than the corresponding values of the top and bottom segments 2 78 hz under sheared flow cases the local current velocity is relatively high for the top segment and the excited frequency by viv is basically proportional to current velocity therefore the higher frequency components are easier to be excited than the riser s middle segment while for the bottom segment the local bending stiffness reduces to the smallest since the local axial tension linearly decreases from top to bottom due to the structural gravity although the local current velocity is low the vibrational energy will transfer from top to bottom in the manner of travelling wave which will be described in detail as follows making higher frequencies also easier to be excited at the bottom than the middle segment fig 8 gives the temporal spatial distributions of response displacement along the riser and the time histories of main excited modal weights under the sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s the most significant dynamic response characteristic under sheared flow is travelling wave as shown by inclined black arrows response energy transfers from top to bottom with time varying similar phenomenon was also captured by the experimental research of a 152 4 m riser model in vandiver et al 2009 the current velocity was designed to increase from riser s top to bottom and the experimental measurements indicated that the travelling wave propagates along the riser upwards thus it could be concluded that response energy tends to transfer along the riser s axial direction from high velocity region to low velocity region the time histories of main excited modal weights also prove the existence of mode jumps with the maximum modal weight corresponding to different mode at different time points mode 12 mode 14 dominate the riser s dynamic response by turn and the modal weight allocation follows a certain periodicity according to the modal weight time histories persistent viv exactly exists and the maximum modal weight of each mode basically keeps constant 4 response characteristics under non uniform combined flow cases this paper describes a specific non uniform combined flow by eq 13 with three controlled parameters i e the top current velocity of the background sheared flow v ste top and the top maximum current velocity v osc top as well as oscillation period t f of the sheared oscillatory flow r is the combined ratio of the non uniform combined flow representing the proportion of the unsteady flow component in the combined flow r v osc top v ste top 13 v z t v ste top z l v osc top z l sin 2 π t f t z l v ste top r sin 2 π t f t 4 1 simulated cases kc number is usually used to describe an oscillatory flow however when an oscillatory flow is defined by its instantaneous velocity i e v t v m sin 2 π t t f kc number is actually not an independent controlled parameter but determined by both oscillation period and maximum oscillation velocity k c v m t f d if keeping v m constant the different dynamic response characteristics with diverse kc numbers are in fact owing to the difference of the oscillation period t f thus a more independent controlled parameter t f is selected to design the simulated cases instead of kc number the steady flow component of the combined flow mainly determines the fundamental excited frequency and mode having little influence on the time sharing response characteristics therefore v ste top is fixed as 0 54 m s in this paper in this way v osc top can be controlled by adjusting r 12 cases of the same riser model in section 3 are designed to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows 4 oscillation periods from short to long i e 4s 8s 16s and 32s are arranged 3 combined ratios i e 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 cover the low medium and high combined ratio situations the parameter selections of the simulated cases are listed in table 4 each row can be defined as a group to discuss the combined ratio effect with a constant t f for the oscillation period effect the series of cases with case no equal to m 3n n 0 1 2 3 m ranges from 1 to 3 is available and each series has the same r but different t f 4 2 response characteristic investigation fig 9 gives the viv response of the riser under a typical non uniform combined flow case with r 1 0 and t f 32s the descriptions of each sub picture are in accordance with fig 7 there are visible increase and decrease processes in the displacement time histories and the amplitude modulation is more violent than the sheared flow case the displacement response has obvious periodicity and the similar time varying segments repeats twice during the time interval of 116s 180s i e two flow oscillation periods as marked with the pink dotted lines the riser s viv is intermittent and the displacement is nearly equal to zero within several time segments from the wavelet analysis plots the identical periodicity is captured as well i e the time frequency distribution of each flow oscillation period is approximate mode jumps still exists and have the broader transition range than fig 7 compared with the sheared flow case the amplitude spectrum under non uniform combined flow case is denser the energy strength concentrating at each frequency becomes weaker and the excited frequency bandwidth broadens from 1 5 hz 3 hz to 0 hz 5 hz since the flow field still has spatial non uniformness the structural local dynamic response also presents difference for the middle segment of the riser the strongest energy concentrates at 2 09 hz while the corresponding values for the top and bottom segments are 3 05 hz and 2 55 hz respectively both higher than the middle segment 4 3 oscillation period influence to further reveal the effects of different flow field parameters on the structural overall dynamic response figs 10 13 give the temporal spatial distributions of response displacement and time histories of main excited modal weights under four representative non uniform combined flow cases where fig 10 denotes r 0 5 and t f 32s fig 11 denotes r 1 5 and t f 32s fig 12 denotes r 0 5 and t f 4s fig 13 denotes r 1 5 and t f 4s since the structural dynamic response under the non uniform combined flow cases with long period presents evident periodicity in fig 9 here just shows the predicted result during single complete period for fig 10 and fig 11 where t f 32s compared between figs 10 and 12 or figs 11 and 13 i e keeping r fixed and changing t f the oscillation period of non uniform combined flow field has a significant influence on viv response characteristics under the long period cases the riser s overall dynamic response follows travel wave pattern and accompanying with obvious high frequency response the maximum displacement reaches 0 018 m when t 128s while there is approximately no displacement response near t 144s the time histories of main excited modal weight show that more modes participate in viv under the non uniform combined flow cases with t f 32s than the sheared flow case the extra sheared oscillatory flow makes the higher and lower modes near the fundamental response mode possible to be excited and the relationship between the modal weights of different orders turns more complicated besides the jump range of dominant modal order at different time points broadens under the short period cases the overall viv still presents travel wave phenomenon with the oscillation period of flow field decreasing several new response characteristics appear among the displacement time spatial distributions during the whole time interval of 44s 76s i e eight flow oscillation periods shown in figs 12 and 13 the structural response is not periodic any more and presents unstable viv occurs persistently and is mainly dominated by some low order modes from the modal weight time histories the main excited modal orders are clearly lower than the sheared flow and long period cases but the modal weights are relatively larger the rms displacement envelops along the riser and the response amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint under the non uniform combined flows with r 0 5 are shown in fig 14 with the oscillation period of flow field increasing from 4s to 32s rms displacement gradually decreases and the envelop manifests more wave crests which means the dominant modal order turns higher the amplitude spectra show that the longer flow oscillation period leads to broader excited frequency bandwidth and weaker energy strength concentrating at peak frequencies 4 4 combined ratio influence the combined ratio of flow field also affects the structural response characteristics significantly associated with figs 10 and 11 or figs 12 and 13 t f is kept constant and r changes compared with the small combined ration cases the displacement time spatial distribution under the large combined ratio cases modulates more violently i e the time sharing features of viv are clearer and the structural dynamic response presents more unstable another effect of the combined ratio is that it influences the travel wave propagation the propagation velocity of travel wave is defined as v t w l t b o t t t o p in this paper where l is the riser length t b o t t t o p is the time interval for the travel wave propagating from top to bottom t b o t t t o p is marked by the black arrow lines at different time points in figs 8 and 10 13 under the sheared flow case v tw basically keeps constant with time varying approximate to 38 30 m s however v tw changes visibly in time domain for the non uniform combined flow cases under the two cases with t f 32s the maximum and minimum of t b o t t t o p are 2 38s and 2 24s when r 0 5 while the corresponding values respectively become 2 42s and 2 20s when r 1 5 it means with r increasing from 0 5 to 1 5 the maximum travel wave velocity increases from 40 18 m s to 40 91 m s and the minimum velocity decreases from 37 82 m s to 37 19 m s i e the velocity variation range δ v t w broadens from 2 36 m s to 3 72 m s for the two cases with t f 4s the variation of r also make δ v t w increase from 0 56 m s to 0 58 m s the difference of travel wave velocity in time domain is proportional to the combined ratio of flow field from the time histories of main excited modal weight the excited modal orders are relatively lower under the large combined ratio cases and the low modes generally have larger modal weights than the excited high ones for example under the condition where t f 32s the largest modal weight corresponds to mode 10 when r 0 5 while it turns to mode 8 and has larger magnitude when r 1 5 fig 15 gives the rms displacement envelops along the riser and the response amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint under the non uniform combined flows with t f 32s compared with fig 14 the effect of combined ratio on displacement envelops and amplitude spectra is not as significant as that of oscillation period whereas the variation trends like rms displacement decreasing and high frequency response appearing with r increasing are still easy to be captured the increase of r also broadens the excited frequency bandwidth by viv and makes amplitude spectra denser 5 dynamic mechanism analysis this section would discuss the essential reasons for the riser s dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows with viv mechanism analysis according to eq 10 the instantaneous current profile of the simulated non uniform combined flows in this paper always follows linearly sheared distribution therefore the viv response under combined flows is indeed supposed to present travel wave pattern and the high frequency response should be easier to be excited for riser s top and bottom segments than its middle one the relevant explanations have been given in section 3 5 1 oscillation period effect long oscillation period of flow field means slowly changing velocity which makes the vortex around the riser s surface able to shed as completely as it does under steady flow conditions in this case viv response is stable during each oscillation period the different nonlinear dynamic response would be excited corresponding to the time varying velocity and direction of the encountered flow field that s why the amplitude modulations frequency transitions and mode jumps are easy to be captured within a long time interval viv presents obvious periodicity accordant with the regular variation of flow field when oscillation period of flow field is short flow field changes rapidly making the boundary layer separation at the rear of the riser not obvious any more so the fluid viscosity effect on structural response would be not as significant as long oscillation period situations which also means the hydrodynamic damping cannot work normally so the intermittent viv only appears under long oscillation period cases rather than short oscillation period ones with t f increasing the reduction effect of hydrodynamic damping on the riser s viv would gradually fade so the shorter t f tends to cause larger rms displacement as shown in fig 14 besides although δt f turns larger for t f increasing from 4s to 32s the variation span of rms displacement between the adjacent cases becomes smaller especially for the cases with t f 16s and 32s the displacement envelops along the riser are approximate that is because when t f is long enough vortices are able to shed from the riser completely as they do under steady flows the further increase of t f will not enhance the reduction effect of hydrodynamic damping any more for the short oscillation period cases the instantaneous current velocity is also able to reach the high velocity region where the high frequency viv response should be excited however the rapid variation of flow field makes the time interval when the riser locates in high velocity region too short to form the corresponding high frequency response stably so the excited frequency bandwidth is narrow and dominant modal order is low when t f is short since the response energy allocates to less frequency components the modal weight of each order enlarges clearly under the intensively varying flow field with short oscillation period new changes are willing to take place before viv reaching stable state so unstable dynamic response exists persistently without clear periodicity as long oscillation period cases 5 2 combined ratio effect larger combined ratio of non uniform combined flow brings larger percentage of sheared oscillatory flow to combined flow which also means the time sharing features of flow field are more obvious under the large combined ratio cases the sheared slope of the instantaneous current velocity profile changes intensively in time domain leading to the broad variation range of travel wave velocity since the variation range of current velocity broadens with r increasing and the encountered current velocity of the riser determines viv dominant frequency directly the broader frequency bandwidth including some high frequency components are excited correspondingly as shown in fig 15 when t f is fixed larger combined ratio reflects as faster changing velocity of flow field which is detrimental to accumulate stable viv response therefore the rms displacement envelop for r 1 5 is slightly smaller than that for r 0 5 the current velocity time histories of the combined flows with different combined ratios are presented in fig 16 as marked by the blue dotted line when the combined ratio is large enough r 1 0 the encountered flow field of the riser would reverse within the latter half oscillation period and the current velocity no longer decreases but increases oppositely in this case the reverse flow would additionally excite several low modes due to its relatively small velocity therefore when r increases from 0 5 to 1 5 although the broader excited frequency bandwidth by viv is detrimental to increase the weight of each mode the modal weights of the low modes e g mode 8 in fig 11 still increase oppositely which means when r is large enough for the flow to reverse some low mode response may strengthen 6 conclusions based on a published and validated time domain force decomposition model the nonlinear dynamic response of a slender flexible riser under non uniform combined flows are investigated systematically the influence laws of the flow field s oscillation period and combined ratio on the riser s viv response are revealed and the presented time shearing response characteristics are explained with viv mechanism analysis the obtained conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the riser s overall dynamic response presents travel wave pattern under non uniform combined flows and the vibration energy propagates along the axial direction from high velocity region to low velocity region the high frequency response is easier to be excited by viv for the riser s top and bottom segments than its middle segment 2 under the non uniform combined flow cases with long oscillation period the structural dynamic response follows periodic variation in time domain accordant with the current velocity some time sharing response characteristics like intermittent viv and mode jumps are captured clearly under the short oscillation period cases viv presents unstable and not periodic any more with the increase of oscillation period rms response displacement decreases and dominant modal order rises longer oscillation period brings broader excited frequency bandwidth but the response energy concentrating at peak frequencies weakens 3 with the combined ratio of the non uniform combined flow increasing more modes participate in the riser s viv and the variation range of travel wave velocity broadens at the same time rms displacement decreases and more frequency components are excited by viv accompanying with the high order modal response gradually appearing large combined ratio may make the modal weights of some low order modes enlarge the nonlinear dynamic response analysis of marine risers under complicated unsteady flows is still a very challenging research frontier this paper attempts to carry out a preliminary investigation on the viv response characteristics under the non uniform combined unsteady flow the obtained conclusions could make contributions to achieve a deeper understanding of the riser s dynamic response under the actual marine environment further research work on the relevant experimental investigations is needed in the future credit

21645,considering the top end platform surge induced by periodic wave the encountered flow field of marine risers under the actual marine environment is approximate to a combined sheared and sheared oscillatory flow which is non uniform in both time and spatial domains a published time domain force decomposition model is proposed to predict the riser s nonlinear dynamic response under non uniform combined unsteady flows a 90 m flexible riser is chosen as the simulated object and a large amount of the combined flow cases with different oscillation periods and combined ratios are designed with the fundamental study on a steady sheared flow case the structural dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows are investigated systematically the overall dynamic response presents travel wave pattern and the high frequency response is easier to be excited for the riser s top and bottom segments some time sharing response characteristics like amplitude modulation frequency transition and mode jumps are captured and they are affected by the flow field parameters significantly under the long oscillation period cases the intermittent dynamic response follows the accordant periodicity with the current velocity while under the short oscillation period cases the unstable structural vibration occurs persistently without clear regularity the combined ratio also influences the rms displacement excited frequency bandwidth and travel wave propagation velocity evidently associated with viv mechanism analysis the individual response characteristics under different flow field parameter combinations are explained reasonably keywords nonlinear dynamic response numerical analysis marine risers vortex induced vibration non uniform combined unsteady flow 1 introduction nonlinear dynamic response of marine risers has recently received the increasing attention by ocean engineering especially under the situation that subsea oil and gas exploitation is spreading to deeper sea periodic vortex sheds around marine risers when ocean current flows over resulting in the complicated hydrodynamic forces and secondary vibration i e vortex induced vibration viv of slender flexible structures the encouraged flow field by the riser is exactly one of the most crucial causes of its nonlinear dynamic response fig 1 is the simplified sketch of platform riser seabed system under the actual marine environment the riser is connected to the floating platform at top end and fixed with seabed wellhead at bottom the background current profile could be approximately deemed as linear sheared flow with the wave excitation the surge motion of the floating platform is easy to be excited which drives the riser s top end to experience the concomitant oscillation movement marked with the black dotted lines the riser s oscillation movement fades along the axial direction due to the displacement constraint at bottom the influence of the riser s concomitant oscillation induced by platform surge on the riser s dynamic response could be equivalent to an extra sheared oscillatory flow field excitation therefore the encountered flow field of the riser under complicated marine environment is approximate to a combined sheared and sheared oscillatory flow which is non uniform in both time and spatial domains experiments and numerical simulations are two main approaches to achieve deeper understanding of the riser s viv at present liu et al 2020 the typical experimental investigations could be classified into free vibration test blevins and coughran 2009 gu et al 2020 forced vibration test gopalkrishnan 1993 zheng 2014 and model tests lie and kaasen 2006 han et al 2017 experiments could obtain reliable measurements and intuitive phenomena but usually cost a lot more researches devote to such an issue with different numerical models among which computational fluid dynamic cfd methods rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2019 nikoo et al 2019 and semi empirical models are common the semi empirical models could be further divided into two types of wake oscillator model gao et al 2017 qu and metrikine 2020 and force decomposition model wang et al 2013 respectively most of the existing researches focus on the steady like uniform sheared or stepped flow cases the riser s nonlinear dynamic analysis under unsteady flow is still in its infancy fu et al 2014 and ren et al 2019 carried out the laboratory experiments of a 4 m riser s viv under oscillatory flow and indicated that the structural dynamic response presents some time sharing characteristics evidently wang et al 2018 evaluated the viv of a steel catenary riser in steady current and vessel motion induced oscillatory current by experimental investigation there are also several numerical investigations on oscillatory flow cases with diverse simulation methods chang and isherwood 2003 zhao et al 2012 thorsen et al 2016 pearcey et al 2017 fu et al 2018 lu et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 and deng 2014 predicted the riser s viv response under combined uniform and oscillatory flow with two dimensional slice theory and cfd technique although the unsteady flow cases have begun to be noticed the relevant researches just deal with the pure oscillatory flow or simple uniform combined flow temporarily there is still few concern about the complicated combined unsteady flow case mentioned in fig 1 although the spatial non uniformness of the incoming flow has been widely recognized to affect the riser s dynamic response significantly this paper adopts a time domain force decomposition model to predict the marine riser s viv under non uniform combined unsteady flow hereinafter referred to as non uniform combined flow the structural nonlinear dynamic response characteristics are investigated systematically and the effects of different flow field parameters are discussed associated with viv mechanism analysis the individual response characteristics under non uniform combined flow are explained reasonably 2 numerical model and methodology the adopted time domain force decomposition model by this paper originates from yuan et al 2018a cartesian coordinate system is used to describe the numerical model where x axis is parallel with flow velocity y axis is perpendicular to incoming flow direction and z axis is along the axial direction of the cylinder as shown in fig 1 this paper at present only focuses on the cross flow dynamic response 2 1 viv hydrodynamic force model the cross flow hydrodynamic force f h y d r o is written as eq 1 decomposed into three force components i e excitation force f v damping force f d and inertia force f m i e the first second and third terms on the right side respectively 1 f h y d r o f v f d f m 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t c f a d f d v t y t π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 where c v is the excitation force coefficient a is the cylinder s response amplitude d is the cylinder diameter f is the cylinder s response frequency v is the instantaneous combined flow velocity t is the time ρ f is the fluid density c f is the hydrodynamic damping coefficient c a is the added mass coefficient which is assumed as a constant 1 0 in this paper hydrodynamic force coefficients c v and c f change with response amplitude a and frequency f as functions of time fig 2 is the excitation force coefficient contour originated from the cylinder forced vibration tests gopalkrishnan 1993 the thick orange line marks the important boundary between excitation and damping zones among the damping zone or outside the experimental data range excitation force coefficient will be negative and transfer to hydrodynamic damping force strouhal number is a non dimensional hydrodynamic parameter and can be expressed as f s d v where f s is the vortex shedding frequency strouhal number of the forced vibration experiments is 0 193 a and f are the most crucial variables to obtain hydrodynamic forces based on finite element method fem the cylinder is divided into a large amount of beam elements structure segments along its axial direction the cylinder s displacement y and velocity v at every node and time t will be extracted at each time step to describe the real time a and f as expressed by eq 2 2 a y j y i 2 f 1 2 t j t i where y i y j t i t j are the displacement and time of the adjacent two time points i and j with local response velocity v 0 2 2 lock in judgement criterion lock in is the most significant characteristic of viv according to the recent experimental research by zheng 2014 the non dimensional frequency range of 0 125 0 25 is set as the lock in region in this paper which needs to be corrected by eq 3 for the difference of strouhal number between actual and test circumstances 3 f r s t t e s t f r s t a c t u a l where f r is the non dimensional frequency f r f d v if the non dimensional response frequency is located within the excitation bandwidth lock in occurs the cylinder element will be synchronized onto the structural natural frequency closest to f r 0 17 where corresponds to the largest excitation force coefficient as shown in fig 2 here f r 0 17 also needs to be corrected by eq 3 the lock in natural frequency is regarded as viv dominant frequency to calculate excitation force coefficient c v this treatment method maybe a little overestimates the excitation force while the validation against experiments under lots of different cases proves that the adopted numerical model could give reasonable prediction results the second order digital control loop in grant et al 2000 is adopted to guarantee the excitation force is always in phase with the local velocity of the cylinder the control loop is a regulator system consisting of a phase error detector and a second order tracker the phase differences between the local velocity of the cylinder and the excitation force at lock in appear as a step function to the regulator system the phase difference will be gradually adjusted down to zero over a period of time then the phase locked loops pll remains active to keep the phase difference equal to zero when c v is negative i e the non dimensional response frequency is outside the excitation bandwidth hydrodynamic damping will act on the cylinder and viv dominant frequency is regarded equal to response frequency the negative c v is calculated by fig 2 and then transferred to hydrodynamic damping coefficient c f with eq 4 4 c f c v a d f d v t ρ f v 2 t d 4 π a f outside the experimental data range the empirical nonlinear damping model proposed by venugopal 1996 will be adopted where the empirical coefficients c hf c sw and c lf are recommended taking 0 18 0 25 and 0 2 2 3 structural dynamic response solution as far as small displacement is concerned which is generally true in the viv case of the flexible cylinder with a large aspect ratio of length to diameter the cylinder can be deemed as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the euler bernoulli beam hypothesis the governing differential equation of motion in cross flow direction can be expressed as eq 5 5 m π 4 c a ρ f d 2 2 y t 2 c s c f a d f d v t y t e i 4 y z 4 z t e z t y z 1 2 c v a d f d v t ρ f d v t v t cos 2 π f t where m is the mass per unit length of the cylinder c s is the structural damping coefficient which can be expressed as c s 4 π m f ξ ξ is the structural damping ratio e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia t e is the effective axial tension the adopted numerical model is based on direct integration dynamic analysis eq 5 is solved with the hilber hughes taylor hht method hilber et al 1977 eq 6 shows how the positions and velocities update at each time step and the time discrete momentum equation is expressed in eq 7 6 y t δ t y t δ t y t δ t 2 1 2 β y t 2 β y t δ t 2 y t δ t y t δ t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t 7 r t α δ t f t δ t e x t m y t δ t c y t α δ t f i n t y t α δ t y t α δ t 1 α y t α y t δ t y t α δ t 1 α y t α y t δ t where f ext and f int are the external and internal forces in the whole system r is the force residuals when α 1 3 0 β 1 α 2 4 and γ 1 2 α 2 hht method is unconditionally stable automatic convergence checks are applied to the force residuals with standard parameter α 0 05 the stable time increment is selected as 0 002 f max where f max is the maximum expected fundamental frequency this means there are at least 500 steps during each vibration period of the cylinder which has been found to be sufficient i e reducing the time increment causes no change in the predictions eq 5 is discretized in space by using fem and the structural kinetic equation can be rewritten as eq 8 8 m s m a y c s c f y k a k b y f e x c where m s and m a are the structural and added mass matrices c s and c f are the structural and hydrodynamic damping matrices k a is the additional lateral stiffness matrix provided by effective axial tension and k b is the bending stiffness matrix determined by cylinder inherent properties f e x c is the excitation force vector and y is a vector containing nodal translations and rotations associated with eq 7 the force residuals vector r t α δ t in hht method is expressed in eq 9 9 r t α δ t m s m a y t δ t 1 α g t δ t α g t where g is an internal state vector which can be expressed as g f e x c c s c f y to better demonstrate the adopted numerical approach the flow chart within each time step of the nonlinear dynamic analysis for marine risers is drawn in fig 3 2 4 validation against experimental measurements since there seems still no comparable experimental investigations on marine risers under non uniform combined unsteady flows this section respectively compares the predicted results with experimental measurements under sheared flow and oscillatory flow cases so that the availability of the adopted numerical model for non uniform combined unsteady flows could be proved 1 sheared flow case since sheared flow is typically non uniform which means the local current velocity at different axial locations of the riser is unequal and the dynamic response of different riser sections inevitably presents quite different response patterns the 90 m riser model in lie and kaasen 2006 is chosen as the simulated object here the main parameters of the riser model are listed in table 1 fig 4 compares the rms displacement and curvature envelops along the riser between the predicted results and experimental measurements under the linearly sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s where v top is the top end current velocity the predicted overall dynamic response including the rms displacement and curvature envelops shows a good agreement with the experimental observations and the structural response along the riser model is dominated by the 11th mode in general the adopted numerical model is verified reasonable to handle such non uniform flow case 2 oscillatory flow case the published test data of a 4 m riser under oscillatory flow by fu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the performance of the adopted numerical model the main parameters of the flexible cylinder model are listed in table 2 when fluid oscillates periodically in time domain the motion equation can be described in eq 10 10 a t a m sin 2 π t f t v t a m 2 π t f cos 2 π t f t v m cos 2 π t f t where a m and v m are the maximum oscillation amplitude and oscillation velocity t f is the oscillation period keulegan carpenter kc number is another key parameter to describe a certain oscillatory flow which can be expressed as eq 11 reduced velocity is one of the most important parameters of viv under steady flows it can be written as v r n v f n d where f n is the nth structural natural frequency in still water by assuming c a 1 0 the maximum reduced velocity for oscillatory flow cases is defined as eq 12 11 k c v m t f d 2 π a m d 12 v r 1 m v m f 1 d 2 π a m t f 1 d k c t f 1 two representative cases in table 3 with high and small kc numbers are simulated fig 5 and fig 6 respectively present the dynamic response comparison at midpoint z 2 m of the cylinder between predicted left and test right results the top rows are displacement time histories and the bottom ones are the strain wavelet contour plots with mother wavelet of morlet wavelet for high kc number case i e case o1 intermittent and periodic viv could be found evidently in the predicted and test displacement time histories during a certain oscillation period because there are two time segments for flow velocity to increase and decrease the response amplitude would modulate slightly like a shape of mountain peak twice frequency transition can also be captured in the predicted and test wavelet contour plots there are also two obvious transition process during a certain oscillation period the predicted varying processes and maximum values of response amplitude as well as frequency both show good agreement with test results for small kc number case i e case o2 slight amplitude modulation could also be observed according to the predicted and test results but it should be distinguished from high kc number case amplitude fluctuates in time domain without evident regularity which is more likely to be caused by unstable vibration of the riser rather than the periodic pattern of flow velocity in general the response amplitude keeps relatively constant and time history is quite like the sinusoidal shape under uniform flow both predicted and test results show that response frequency also basically keeps unchanged with time and the comparable values are approximate this time domain prediction method has actually been validated well with some published experimental measurements under oscillatory flow cases and time varying axial tension cases in yuan et al 2018a and yuan et al 2018b respectively here just briefly presents its performance under one sheared flow case and two representative oscillatory flow cases more details could be found in yuan et al 2018a generally the adopted numerical model is believed able to give the reasonable prediction results under the sheared flow and non uniform combined flow cases 3 response characteristics under sheared flow case as the basis of the subsequent investigation to know the viv features under pure sheared flow at first is necessary the same 90 m riser model simulated in section 2 4 continues to be chosen as the research object apart from the comparisons with experimental results this paper selects three representative monitoring locations to further investigate the viv response at the riser s top middle and bottom regions respectively fig 7 is the predicted viv response of the riser under the sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s where v top is the current velocity at top left and middle are the time histories of response displacement and frequency and right is the corresponding frequency spectra z l of row 1 3 is 0 833 0 500 and 0 167 respectively time frequency distribution plots are obtained by continuous wavelet transform cwt technique with mother wavelet of morlet wavelet amplitude spectra are based on fast fourier transform fft method the shapes of displacement time histories at different riser locations are obviously different during the same time interval the time history of the riser s middle segment z l 0 500 has smaller half wave number than the top z l 0 833 and bottom z l 0 167 segments displacement amplitude slightly modulates in time domain while viv is still persistent according to the wavelet analysis plots there are stable response energy concentrating at multiple frequency components and every frequency is excited discontinuously the strongest frequency component changes with the variation of time and mode jump can be evidently captured as marked with dark dotted ellipses although response energy all appear within 1 5 hz 3 hz the time frequency distributions of the riser s different segments present some differences associated with the response frequency spectra different riser segments have identical excited frequency bandwidth but different energy strength allocation as well as unequal response peak frequency the respective peak frequencies are marked by red dotted squares the strongest frequency component of the riser s middle segment 1 88 hz is lower than the corresponding values of the top and bottom segments 2 78 hz under sheared flow cases the local current velocity is relatively high for the top segment and the excited frequency by viv is basically proportional to current velocity therefore the higher frequency components are easier to be excited than the riser s middle segment while for the bottom segment the local bending stiffness reduces to the smallest since the local axial tension linearly decreases from top to bottom due to the structural gravity although the local current velocity is low the vibrational energy will transfer from top to bottom in the manner of travelling wave which will be described in detail as follows making higher frequencies also easier to be excited at the bottom than the middle segment fig 8 gives the temporal spatial distributions of response displacement along the riser and the time histories of main excited modal weights under the sheared flow case with v top 0 54 m s the most significant dynamic response characteristic under sheared flow is travelling wave as shown by inclined black arrows response energy transfers from top to bottom with time varying similar phenomenon was also captured by the experimental research of a 152 4 m riser model in vandiver et al 2009 the current velocity was designed to increase from riser s top to bottom and the experimental measurements indicated that the travelling wave propagates along the riser upwards thus it could be concluded that response energy tends to transfer along the riser s axial direction from high velocity region to low velocity region the time histories of main excited modal weights also prove the existence of mode jumps with the maximum modal weight corresponding to different mode at different time points mode 12 mode 14 dominate the riser s dynamic response by turn and the modal weight allocation follows a certain periodicity according to the modal weight time histories persistent viv exactly exists and the maximum modal weight of each mode basically keeps constant 4 response characteristics under non uniform combined flow cases this paper describes a specific non uniform combined flow by eq 13 with three controlled parameters i e the top current velocity of the background sheared flow v ste top and the top maximum current velocity v osc top as well as oscillation period t f of the sheared oscillatory flow r is the combined ratio of the non uniform combined flow representing the proportion of the unsteady flow component in the combined flow r v osc top v ste top 13 v z t v ste top z l v osc top z l sin 2 π t f t z l v ste top r sin 2 π t f t 4 1 simulated cases kc number is usually used to describe an oscillatory flow however when an oscillatory flow is defined by its instantaneous velocity i e v t v m sin 2 π t t f kc number is actually not an independent controlled parameter but determined by both oscillation period and maximum oscillation velocity k c v m t f d if keeping v m constant the different dynamic response characteristics with diverse kc numbers are in fact owing to the difference of the oscillation period t f thus a more independent controlled parameter t f is selected to design the simulated cases instead of kc number the steady flow component of the combined flow mainly determines the fundamental excited frequency and mode having little influence on the time sharing response characteristics therefore v ste top is fixed as 0 54 m s in this paper in this way v osc top can be controlled by adjusting r 12 cases of the same riser model in section 3 are designed to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows 4 oscillation periods from short to long i e 4s 8s 16s and 32s are arranged 3 combined ratios i e 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 cover the low medium and high combined ratio situations the parameter selections of the simulated cases are listed in table 4 each row can be defined as a group to discuss the combined ratio effect with a constant t f for the oscillation period effect the series of cases with case no equal to m 3n n 0 1 2 3 m ranges from 1 to 3 is available and each series has the same r but different t f 4 2 response characteristic investigation fig 9 gives the viv response of the riser under a typical non uniform combined flow case with r 1 0 and t f 32s the descriptions of each sub picture are in accordance with fig 7 there are visible increase and decrease processes in the displacement time histories and the amplitude modulation is more violent than the sheared flow case the displacement response has obvious periodicity and the similar time varying segments repeats twice during the time interval of 116s 180s i e two flow oscillation periods as marked with the pink dotted lines the riser s viv is intermittent and the displacement is nearly equal to zero within several time segments from the wavelet analysis plots the identical periodicity is captured as well i e the time frequency distribution of each flow oscillation period is approximate mode jumps still exists and have the broader transition range than fig 7 compared with the sheared flow case the amplitude spectrum under non uniform combined flow case is denser the energy strength concentrating at each frequency becomes weaker and the excited frequency bandwidth broadens from 1 5 hz 3 hz to 0 hz 5 hz since the flow field still has spatial non uniformness the structural local dynamic response also presents difference for the middle segment of the riser the strongest energy concentrates at 2 09 hz while the corresponding values for the top and bottom segments are 3 05 hz and 2 55 hz respectively both higher than the middle segment 4 3 oscillation period influence to further reveal the effects of different flow field parameters on the structural overall dynamic response figs 10 13 give the temporal spatial distributions of response displacement and time histories of main excited modal weights under four representative non uniform combined flow cases where fig 10 denotes r 0 5 and t f 32s fig 11 denotes r 1 5 and t f 32s fig 12 denotes r 0 5 and t f 4s fig 13 denotes r 1 5 and t f 4s since the structural dynamic response under the non uniform combined flow cases with long period presents evident periodicity in fig 9 here just shows the predicted result during single complete period for fig 10 and fig 11 where t f 32s compared between figs 10 and 12 or figs 11 and 13 i e keeping r fixed and changing t f the oscillation period of non uniform combined flow field has a significant influence on viv response characteristics under the long period cases the riser s overall dynamic response follows travel wave pattern and accompanying with obvious high frequency response the maximum displacement reaches 0 018 m when t 128s while there is approximately no displacement response near t 144s the time histories of main excited modal weight show that more modes participate in viv under the non uniform combined flow cases with t f 32s than the sheared flow case the extra sheared oscillatory flow makes the higher and lower modes near the fundamental response mode possible to be excited and the relationship between the modal weights of different orders turns more complicated besides the jump range of dominant modal order at different time points broadens under the short period cases the overall viv still presents travel wave phenomenon with the oscillation period of flow field decreasing several new response characteristics appear among the displacement time spatial distributions during the whole time interval of 44s 76s i e eight flow oscillation periods shown in figs 12 and 13 the structural response is not periodic any more and presents unstable viv occurs persistently and is mainly dominated by some low order modes from the modal weight time histories the main excited modal orders are clearly lower than the sheared flow and long period cases but the modal weights are relatively larger the rms displacement envelops along the riser and the response amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint under the non uniform combined flows with r 0 5 are shown in fig 14 with the oscillation period of flow field increasing from 4s to 32s rms displacement gradually decreases and the envelop manifests more wave crests which means the dominant modal order turns higher the amplitude spectra show that the longer flow oscillation period leads to broader excited frequency bandwidth and weaker energy strength concentrating at peak frequencies 4 4 combined ratio influence the combined ratio of flow field also affects the structural response characteristics significantly associated with figs 10 and 11 or figs 12 and 13 t f is kept constant and r changes compared with the small combined ration cases the displacement time spatial distribution under the large combined ratio cases modulates more violently i e the time sharing features of viv are clearer and the structural dynamic response presents more unstable another effect of the combined ratio is that it influences the travel wave propagation the propagation velocity of travel wave is defined as v t w l t b o t t t o p in this paper where l is the riser length t b o t t t o p is the time interval for the travel wave propagating from top to bottom t b o t t t o p is marked by the black arrow lines at different time points in figs 8 and 10 13 under the sheared flow case v tw basically keeps constant with time varying approximate to 38 30 m s however v tw changes visibly in time domain for the non uniform combined flow cases under the two cases with t f 32s the maximum and minimum of t b o t t t o p are 2 38s and 2 24s when r 0 5 while the corresponding values respectively become 2 42s and 2 20s when r 1 5 it means with r increasing from 0 5 to 1 5 the maximum travel wave velocity increases from 40 18 m s to 40 91 m s and the minimum velocity decreases from 37 82 m s to 37 19 m s i e the velocity variation range δ v t w broadens from 2 36 m s to 3 72 m s for the two cases with t f 4s the variation of r also make δ v t w increase from 0 56 m s to 0 58 m s the difference of travel wave velocity in time domain is proportional to the combined ratio of flow field from the time histories of main excited modal weight the excited modal orders are relatively lower under the large combined ratio cases and the low modes generally have larger modal weights than the excited high ones for example under the condition where t f 32s the largest modal weight corresponds to mode 10 when r 0 5 while it turns to mode 8 and has larger magnitude when r 1 5 fig 15 gives the rms displacement envelops along the riser and the response amplitude spectra at the riser s midpoint under the non uniform combined flows with t f 32s compared with fig 14 the effect of combined ratio on displacement envelops and amplitude spectra is not as significant as that of oscillation period whereas the variation trends like rms displacement decreasing and high frequency response appearing with r increasing are still easy to be captured the increase of r also broadens the excited frequency bandwidth by viv and makes amplitude spectra denser 5 dynamic mechanism analysis this section would discuss the essential reasons for the riser s dynamic response characteristics under non uniform combined flows with viv mechanism analysis according to eq 10 the instantaneous current profile of the simulated non uniform combined flows in this paper always follows linearly sheared distribution therefore the viv response under combined flows is indeed supposed to present travel wave pattern and the high frequency response should be easier to be excited for riser s top and bottom segments than its middle one the relevant explanations have been given in section 3 5 1 oscillation period effect long oscillation period of flow field means slowly changing velocity which makes the vortex around the riser s surface able to shed as completely as it does under steady flow conditions in this case viv response is stable during each oscillation period the different nonlinear dynamic response would be excited corresponding to the time varying velocity and direction of the encountered flow field that s why the amplitude modulations frequency transitions and mode jumps are easy to be captured within a long time interval viv presents obvious periodicity accordant with the regular variation of flow field when oscillation period of flow field is short flow field changes rapidly making the boundary layer separation at the rear of the riser not obvious any more so the fluid viscosity effect on structural response would be not as significant as long oscillation period situations which also means the hydrodynamic damping cannot work normally so the intermittent viv only appears under long oscillation period cases rather than short oscillation period ones with t f increasing the reduction effect of hydrodynamic damping on the riser s viv would gradually fade so the shorter t f tends to cause larger rms displacement as shown in fig 14 besides although δt f turns larger for t f increasing from 4s to 32s the variation span of rms displacement between the adjacent cases becomes smaller especially for the cases with t f 16s and 32s the displacement envelops along the riser are approximate that is because when t f is long enough vortices are able to shed from the riser completely as they do under steady flows the further increase of t f will not enhance the reduction effect of hydrodynamic damping any more for the short oscillation period cases the instantaneous current velocity is also able to reach the high velocity region where the high frequency viv response should be excited however the rapid variation of flow field makes the time interval when the riser locates in high velocity region too short to form the corresponding high frequency response stably so the excited frequency bandwidth is narrow and dominant modal order is low when t f is short since the response energy allocates to less frequency components the modal weight of each order enlarges clearly under the intensively varying flow field with short oscillation period new changes are willing to take place before viv reaching stable state so unstable dynamic response exists persistently without clear periodicity as long oscillation period cases 5 2 combined ratio effect larger combined ratio of non uniform combined flow brings larger percentage of sheared oscillatory flow to combined flow which also means the time sharing features of flow field are more obvious under the large combined ratio cases the sheared slope of the instantaneous current velocity profile changes intensively in time domain leading to the broad variation range of travel wave velocity since the variation range of current velocity broadens with r increasing and the encountered current velocity of the riser determines viv dominant frequency directly the broader frequency bandwidth including some high frequency components are excited correspondingly as shown in fig 15 when t f is fixed larger combined ratio reflects as faster changing velocity of flow field which is detrimental to accumulate stable viv response therefore the rms displacement envelop for r 1 5 is slightly smaller than that for r 0 5 the current velocity time histories of the combined flows with different combined ratios are presented in fig 16 as marked by the blue dotted line when the combined ratio is large enough r 1 0 the encountered flow field of the riser would reverse within the latter half oscillation period and the current velocity no longer decreases but increases oppositely in this case the reverse flow would additionally excite several low modes due to its relatively small velocity therefore when r increases from 0 5 to 1 5 although the broader excited frequency bandwidth by viv is detrimental to increase the weight of each mode the modal weights of the low modes e g mode 8 in fig 11 still increase oppositely which means when r is large enough for the flow to reverse some low mode response may strengthen 6 conclusions based on a published and validated time domain force decomposition model the nonlinear dynamic response of a slender flexible riser under non uniform combined flows are investigated systematically the influence laws of the flow field s oscillation period and combined ratio on the riser s viv response are revealed and the presented time shearing response characteristics are explained with viv mechanism analysis the obtained conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the riser s overall dynamic response presents travel wave pattern under non uniform combined flows and the vibration energy propagates along the axial direction from high velocity region to low velocity region the high frequency response is easier to be excited by viv for the riser s top and bottom segments than its middle segment 2 under the non uniform combined flow cases with long oscillation period the structural dynamic response follows periodic variation in time domain accordant with the current velocity some time sharing response characteristics like intermittent viv and mode jumps are captured clearly under the short oscillation period cases viv presents unstable and not periodic any more with the increase of oscillation period rms response displacement decreases and dominant modal order rises longer oscillation period brings broader excited frequency bandwidth but the response energy concentrating at peak frequencies weakens 3 with the combined ratio of the non uniform combined flow increasing more modes participate in the riser s viv and the variation range of travel wave velocity broadens at the same time rms displacement decreases and more frequency components are excited by viv accompanying with the high order modal response gradually appearing large combined ratio may make the modal weights of some low order modes enlarge the nonlinear dynamic response analysis of marine risers under complicated unsteady flows is still a very challenging research frontier this paper attempts to carry out a preliminary investigation on the viv response characteristics under the non uniform combined unsteady flow the obtained conclusions could make contributions to achieve a deeper understanding of the riser s dynamic response under the actual marine environment further research work on the relevant experimental investigations is needed in the future credit

study found that the local scour shape of a usaf is different from that of a monopile foundation its maximum scour depth appears downstream behind the usaf and the anchoring structure effectively blocks the scour in front of the usaf the shallower water depth the higher wave height and the faster flow velocity result in a more intense scour when kc 7 and u cw 0 7 the maximum scour depth of the usaf increases with increasing kc number and u cw keywords usaf numerical simulations different hydraulic conditions wave current action keulegan carpenter number flow 3d 1 introduction with increasing demands for clean energy offshore wind power has been flourishing globally during the past two decades to date different types of foundations such as monopiles tripods gravity based structures jackets and suction anchor foundations saf have been adopted by the offshore wind industry dolores esteban et al 2015 yagci et al 2017 in response to more complex marine conditions various new foundations are emerging such as the hybrid skirted foundation which can effectively improve basic horizontal bearing capacity and reduce side shift bienen et al 2012 and the wide shallow composite bucket foundation cbf which offers stronger stability against overturning and more suitability for soft soils liu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 based on skirted foundations the authors research group designed a new foundation type called the umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf li et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the usaf added anchor branches with small holes to the external skirt which are intended to enhance the bearing capacity and scour protections during the process of sinking the anchor the anchor branches gradually expand until they are parallel to the seabed accompanying the implantation of the external skirt and bearing various static and dynamic loads together the sinking mechanism and bearing capacity characteristics have been explored by model tests yang et al 2018 the existence of the foundation will change the flow patterns and enhance the turbulence around the foundation under the combined forces of waves and currents leading to substantial flow changes as shown in fig 2 previous studies have found that these changes mainly consist of 1 horseshoe vortices forming in front of the foundation 2 vortex shedding behind the foundation 3 streamlines contracting at the sides of the foundation and 4 counter rotating vortices forming at the lee wake further downstream of the pile these factors lead to an increase in the local sediment transport capacity and will result in local scour around the foundation which can seriously affect the stability and safety of an owt therefore studying the mechanism and prevention of local scour around foundations under the combined forces of waves and currents is critical to the development of offshore wind power due to the complexity of the site conditions it is difficult to study the scour mechanism through field tests most scholars have studied the partial local scour around foundations through indoor model tests 1 local scour under currents or waves only sumer and fredsøe 1992 2001 carried out a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the scour process their results determined that the streamline compression at the side of the pile and the horseshoe vortex occurring in front of the pile are the critical factors of scour induced by steady flows while the vortex shedding at the back of the pile is a key factor for scour attributed to wave action in addition the scour is found to depend mainly on the kc keulegan carpenter number diffraction parameter cylinder diameter d wave length l roughness of the pile and reynolds number baglio et al 2001 measured the maximum scour depth and the position of the maximum scour toe around a pile under oscillating flow using a model experiment method and zhou et al 2004 studied local scour under irregular waves using an experimental method in which some parameters such as the wave period wave height water depth and sediment grain size were involved in their experiments debnath and chaudhuri 2010 conducted a series of physical models to discuss the effects of the clay content water content bed shear strength and pier froude number on the maximum scour depth a further investigation was proposed by them to investigate the effects of sand clay mixtures and suspended sediment concentration on local scour dey et al 2011 debnath and chaudhuri 2011 2 local scour under currents and waves combinations in severe shallow water environments currents and waves usually exist at the same time which may make the scour response around the foundation more complicated than that caused by only currents or waves in comprehensive model experiments sumer and fredsøe 2001 2002 compared the local scour process around piles with different diameters under currents and waves the scour depth was found to be a function of the orbit velocity near the bed u cw u c u c u m and the kc number in which u c undisturbed current velocity at the distance y d 2 from the bed representing the near bed current velocity and u m maximum value of the undisturbed orbital velocity at the sea bottom just above the wave boundary layer rudolph and bos 2006 performed laboratory tests that considered in the influence of low kc numbers on local scour the experimental results showed that superimposed current can increase the scour depth induced by waves in low kc number conditions in addition petersen et al 2012 used a physical model test to indicate that the scour time scale is governed by three parameters namely u cw kc and the shields number an assessment of the influence of pore pressure on scour development in combined waves and currents was studied by qi and gao 2014 in addition to monopile foundations local scour around other types of foundations such as tripod structures stahlmann 2013 bucket foundations stroescu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 cylindrical structures with non uniform geometries tavouktsoglou et al 2017 twin piles liang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 qi et al 2019 pile groups solaimani et al 2017 and submerged piles with both circular and square cross sections yao et al 2018 have been investigated by physical modelling experiments most studies have shown that the occurrence of local scour can be exacerbated under combined currents and waves than under currents or waves alone 3 other factors in recent years more complex factors have been considered in the study of scour around foundations including tidal flow induced scour mcgovern and ilic 2014 schendel et al 2018 ma et al 2018a b tsunami induced scour larsen et al 2018 the mechanism of secondary scour around scour protections petersen et al 2015 and the effect of foundation vibrations on local scour guan et al 2019 which have been studied by the majority of scholars the above studies provide references for simulating the scour around foundations in more realistic environments with the development of computer technology and the reduction of cost numerical simulation methods are now widely used the initial work of scour numerical simulation was initiated and developed by many scholars e g olsen and kjellesvig 1998 tseng et al 2000 and roulund et al 2005 in these studies the three dimensional steady flow around a vertical cylinder was calculated by solving the navier stokes equations the simulated steady flow field was coupled with morphological calculations to simulate clear water scour with the continuous development of software and the application of new approaches numerical simulation studies at scour are more detailed and precise liu and garcia 2008 implemented a three dimensional model to simulate the local scour around a pile under wave action alone they tracked the water free surface by the volume of fluid vof method and captured the water sediment interface by the moving mesh method zhao et al 2010 investigated local scour around a submerged vertical circular cylinder subjected to currents alone by coupling rans equations with a bed morphological model based on the theory of sumer and other scour depth variation studies over time harris et al 2010 proposed a new step time scour depth model which is applicable to both clean water and live bed scour bihs and olsen 2011 analysis the scour at an abutment by numerical simulation and found that numerical simulation results can be improved by reducing the bed shear stress on the sloping bed the danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 method simulated scour at a foundation based on fluid dynamics calculations and predefined flush rates nielsen et al 2013 used the k ω turbulent model to simulate the turbulent flow field using flow 3d software comparing the results of the model test and numerical simulation it was found that the fluid velocity distribution shear stress distribution and scour protections layer settlement were consistent while there were significant differences between the scour protections layer surface and the free fluid interface kim et al 2014 employed a large eddy simulation les to simulate instantaneous turbulent flow and interpret the features of the scour process and bed topography around twin piles zhang et al 2017 established a set of three dimensional numerical models of three adjacent piles and the influence of pile spacing arrangement on scour depth and patterns was discussed ma et al 2018a b simulated both global and local scour around a tripod foundation by proposing a simplified model and examined the fatigue limit state fls serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls in two different scour condition in recent years the open source cfd model reef3d has emerged as a simulated scour method though cfd ahmad et al 2015 studied the scour around a non slender cylinder at lower kc numbers and the results showed that the sediment deposition and scour depth increase with the kc number larsen et al 2017 developed a practical model for predicting the scour development caused by tsunami waves by approximating the tsunami induced flow as a time varying current ahmad et al 2018 implemented a sand slide algorithm and modified the bed shear stress on a sloping bed in reef3d for a more realistic calculation of scour and bed deposition moreover it is worth noting that artificial intelligence ai approaches have developed rapidly in the recent decade and have been applied to predict local scour processes around owt foundation moreover it is worth noting that artificial intelligence ai approaches have developed rapidly in the recent decade and have been applied to predict local scour processes around owt foundation azimi et al 2017 and ebtehaj et al 2018 used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and an extreme learning machine elm framework to predict the scour depth of pile groups respectively the results indicated that the anfis presents better validations for measured datasets and lower errors than empirical equations najafzadeh et al 2013 used the levenberg marquardt lm method in the training stage to develop group method of data handling network gmdh lm for scour prediction then najafzadeh et al 2015 2017 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2015 and homaei and najafzadeh 2020 simulated scour at pile groups and bridge pier through a neuro fuzzy based group method of data handling nf gmdh which was developed using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and gravitational search algorithm gsa the results indicated that nf gmdh models could provide more accurate predictions than those obtained using model tree and traditional equations these studies provide a strong theoretical basis for investigating the scour around a usaf under combined currents and waves forces in this paper the local scour characteristics of usaf under the coupled forces of waves and currents are analysed the second section establishes the numerical simulation including the application of governing equations and the setting of boundary conditions the third section verifies the numerical model by setting up an indoor flume test the fourth part analyses the scour characteristics of the usaf under different water conditions including different water depths wave heights flow velocities kc numbers and u cw this study provides a theoretical basis for the development of this new type of suction anchor and provides a reference for the scour protections study of offshore foundation 2 numerical method the 3d flow simulation of the scour around the usaf was performed using flow 3d v11 0 3 flow3d 2013 flow 3d is a cfd code for solving full 3d transient navier stokes equations using a finite volume finite difference method in a fixed euler grid which has the advantages of flexibility and functional flow of porous media the fluid free surface is described by the fluid volume method vof and all models are described by the area porosity and volume favortm the details of the model have been described by hirt and sicilian 1985 hirt 1993 and liu and garcia 2008 the favor method and the vof method eliminate the need for additional cells to capture complex geometric regions and track the free water surface of these regions which can significantly reduce computation time 2 1 theoretical model this section describes the theoretical models used in the study nielsen et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 have described the implementation of these models including a detailed description of the numerical aspects such as computational domain numerical schemes and solver therefore only a brief introduction about theoretical model will be made in the following description 1 governing equations of the flow the rans equations enclosed by the rng k ε turbulence model are used as the governing equations for the incompressible viscous fluid motion around three adjacent piles the equations of motion of the fluid

model involves four sediment transport mechanisms including entrainment deposition bed load transport and suspended load transport the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is proposed by mastbergen

suspended sediment mass concentration of species i 2 2 boundary conditions 1 specified velocity condition the flow velocity is set by the speed boundary condition the elevation of the fluid can be set at the boundary and the flow velocity distribution in the model is evenly distributed in the cross section the lateral velocity v and the vertical velocity w at the entrance are 0 and the horizontal velocity u can be specified the similar flow conditions of the flow velocity u the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent energy dissipation rate ω at the inlet are calculated according to the constant uniform flow of the open channel 2 wave boundary linear waves can be generated at the boundary of the model as shown in fig 3 the model used in this study is based on airy linear wave theory the linear wave enters the calculation area from the end of the flat bottom sink the input properties of the linear wave include the wavelength l of the linear wave the amplitude a the angular frequency ω and the period t 2π l there is also a uniform unidirectional flow in the presence of linear waves which is the basis of the study of wave current coupling in this study the undisturbed velocity component u of the wave propagation direction is constant 3 outflow condition outflow boundary conditions can be used for free surfaces as well as for compressible and incompressible fluids at the exit of the model n 0 while the newman boundary condition is applied to all parameters 4 symmetry condition since the number of grids in this study is very large the selection of symmetric boundaries is an effective way to improve the simulation efficiency and shorten the calculation time under symmetric boundary conditions the newman boundary condition can be used to solve the vertical flow velocity v the lateral flow velocity w and the horizontal flow velocity u it is also possible to calculate the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent energy dissipation rate ω 5 walls u v w 0 for rough boundaries the neumann condition k n 0 is satisfied at the wall where n is perpendicular to the wall 2 3 application of the model the research in this paper is based on flow 3d software to establish a three dimensional scour model the specific solution method and governing equations are as described above the model includes the usaf model with upper steel tube structure a sandy seabed a baffle and the elimination band to ensure that the wave exit does not cause a strong wave reflection that could to affect the simulation results the calculation area is lengthened appropriately and the slope elimination band is increased the model mesh is divided into three parts the band forming grid the structure segment grid and the elimination band grid as shown in fig 4 to improve the calculation efficiency and shorten the calculation time the number of grids should be controlled so a nested grid is used to divide the overall model the grid size are referenced by nielsen et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 and all the results shown in this article are run by optimal settings among them in the 1 40 model simulation for model verification which will be introduced in section 3 the encryption range is 0 25 m 0 25 m the minimum size of the three part grid is set to 0 03 0 009 0 06 and the total number of grids is 921 763 in the original size model simulation used to simulate scour under real sea conditions which will be introduced in section 4 the encryption range is 10 m 10 m the minimum size of the three part grid is set to 1 2 0 24 2 4 and the total number of grids is 4 253 845 this approach not only controls the total number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation in the setting of the time step because the fllow 3d uses an automatic time step to ensure the best stability and calculation time only the initial time step needs to be entered in the simulation the specific parameters are shown in table 1 1 1 and table 2 it should be noted that in this article the author ignores the effects of flume blockage the verification part of the model will be introduced in the third section of the experimental test section 2 4 numerical simulation group settings the experimental set up comprises an original group r0 and three control groups r1 r4 r5 r8 r9 r12 to explore the scour development mode scour characteristics and scour distribution range of usaf under real world and real current wave conditions the author further explored the effects of different current velocities water depths and wave heights on the erosion process and results the specific numerical simulation work schedule is shown in table 3 3 experimental study since a usaf is a new type of suction anchor foundation there is no corresponding experimental test therefore the author sets the scour test and compares the test results with the numerical model results to verify the accuracy and rationality of the numerical model 3 1 test equipment and parameters the experimental tests were carried out in the wave flume at a coastal engineering environment lab ocean university of china the test equipment mainly consisted of three parts as shown in fig 5 1 current generating system the author independently designed a two way pump circulation flow device and a rectangular guide groove with length width height 0 2 m 0 48 m 0 1 m was arranged on both sides of the model sand groove flushing section the two way water pump was connected through a water pipe and as the water was pumped the circulating wave flow effect of the water flowing from one side of the water inlet side was achieved 2 wave generating system the main body of the wave generating system was a push plate wave making device at the right end of the flume by changing the axial length of the wave making plate and changing the pushing frequency of the wave making plate linear waves of different periods and different wave heights were produced the leftmost end of the trough was provided with a depletion band composed of gravel and fibre which stabilised the water flow and effectively eliminated wave reflection 3 data collection system the main body of the data collection system consisted of an ultrasonic topographer surveying meter a wg 55 capacitor voltage type wave height meter and an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter to collect test parameters such as soil elevation wave height and flow velocity the test parameters are shown in table 1 1 40 and table 4 among them the critical shields parameter θ cr and shields parameter θ are calculated by eqs 10 and 11 the model of usaf and wave current flume are shown in fig 6 3 2 test procedure before the test the soil in the tank was levelled to a thickness of 0 6 m and then the usaf model was vertically inserted into the silt to ensure that the top surface of the usaf and the anchor branch were flush with the silt surface then water was injected until the designated water depth was reached the standing time was set to 24 h so that the test soil could reach the consolidation state required for the study to realistically simulate a seabed the soil was fully saturated during the entire test process after standing a grid was measured on the whole model the grid size was 1 cm 1 cm and three survey lines a b and c were arranged as shown in fig 7 the topography before scour was measured with an ultrasonic topography instrument and the elevations of each measurement point were recorded during the course of the experiment a stable water flow was initially created by the current generating system and then a wave was created by the wave generating system an adv flow meter was used to monitor the flow field in real time during the wave and flow stages the flow meter was fixed at a position approximately 5 m from the usaf main cylinder that is d 2 from the mud surface every 2 h the wave and flow was paused the elevation of the measurement point was measured and the scour depth value for each time period was recorded when the scour test reached three consecutive measurements of a small difference in scour depth it was determined that the scavenging equilibrium stage had been reached and this was regarded as the end of the experiment the experiment ran for a total of 18 h ultrasonic topography probe position 2 5 cm below the water surface was used to measure the soil deposition and scour depth around the umbrella suction anchor the elevation data of each measurement point were recorded and corrected based on actual observations it should be noted here that due to the limitations of the flume this scour test θ θ cr adhered to a clean water scour regime 3 3 test analysis due to the large number of test data points only the test data of a certain test point a x 0 07 m y 0 15 m and test line b y 0 10m are compared with the digital simulation results the scour depth s d is dimensionless the value of steel pipe d is negative a negative value indicates the scour depth and a positive value indicates the deposition height by comparing the time course of scour development between the numerical simulation and the model test as shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the scour development mode at measurement point a1 is similar and has experienced three stages of rapid scour slow scour and scour equilibrium the time to reach scour equilibrium condition in the numerical simulation 15 h is slightly shorter than the time to reach the scour equilibrium in the scour test 18 h this may be because the wave and current generation must be stopped during each measurement in the test however the scour process of the numerical simulation is continuous the maximum scour depth 0 0124 m is similar to the test maximum scour depth 0 0116 m with a difference of 6 9 from the section scour results under the coupled effects of wave and current as shown in fig 8b the opposite phenomenon of scour occurs at part of survey line b1 such as between x 0 02 m 0 05 m and x 0 125 m 0 15 m this is because the scour depth was measured at intervals of 1 cm in the experiment and the scour depth at the other points was obtained by interpolation and fitting in the numerical simulation the cells are finely divided and the data measurements are more continuous which may cause some data to be opposite even so for the maximum scour depth position at the survey line the two results are consistent appearing on both sides of the skirt in summary the scour results simulated by this model are similar to the test results which verifies that the model is reasonable and reliable therefore we can consider that the model can better simulate the scour process of the umbrella suction anchor and can be used for further scour research under real sea conditions 4 analysis to determine the scour mechanism of the usaf under waves and currents the author first analysed the simulation results of the exhibitor group r0 to obtain the flow field changes and scour patterns around the usaf then the influences of different hydraulic conditions and dimensionless parameters kc and u cw on scour were analysed for different groups r1 r4 r5 r8 and r9 r12 among them s is the maximum scour depth at the last moment around the usaf and the dimensionless parameter s d d 4 m is used for analysis the selection range around the usaf is 45 m 30 m x 15 30 m y 15 15 m rectangular area it is worth noting that because the purpose of this study is to analyse the unique basic scour characteristics of a usaf to ensure calculation efficiency the total simulation time selected is 3000 s which means that there may be a state where the scour equilibrium condition is not reached in the r0 r12 groups and further research is needed on the scour phenomenon after reaching the equilibrium conditions 4 1 scour characteristics fig 9 and 10 show longitudinal cross sectional views of the velocity vector around the usaf at t 50 s and t 2000 s at the beginning of scour because the pile blocked the flow the velocity in front of the pile decreased and a vertical downward flow acceleration occurred as the simulation progressed the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile and the streamline compression on the side of the pile could be clearly seen which caused the increase in bed shear stress and the formation of smaller scour pits in front of the usaf the wake vortex behind the pile developed rapidly and fell off and a narrow and large scour pit appeared on the downstream side it can be seen that some anchor branches behind the pile were exposed fig 11 shows the distribution of the plane velocity at different times at the same water depth the time is selected as the first wave when the crest and trough are close to usaf the water depth is chosen to be z 11 4 m 0 2 m above the top of the usaf this is because it is below the crest and trough and there is no air surface which can accurately reflect the change in flow velocity from fig 11 it can be clearly seen that the flow velocity before the usaf was reduced and the streamline accelerated on the usaf side when the crest approached the usaf the flow velocity around the usaf was distributed in a positive direction and obvious streamline compression zones appeared on both sides of the usaf structure as shown in figure a when the trough contacted the usaf a large area of negative flow velocity appeared upstream of the structure and the reverse movement of the water mass point also appeared near the tube skirt downstream of the structure as shown in figure b until the wave approached the usaf as shown in figure c the negative velocity region upstream of the structure was rapidly compressed and the water mass point started to move forward within this range there was only a negative range with negative velocity however a large area of reduced flow velocity appeared downstream of the structure which resulted in strong turbulence and scour so a narrow scour pit appeared downstream of the axis it then began to reciprocate under the action of waves fig 12 shows the time evolution of scour development around the usaf in the first 500 s the scour depth around the usaf increased rapidly and the sediment particles between the anchor branches were first picked up and moved to a position at an angle of approximately 45 after the pile a narrow scour pit appeared behind the anchor which was caused by the wake vortex behind the usaf within 500 s 1000 s the scour between the anchor branches and after the pile increased and the scour on the outside of the anchor branches was small a small part of the sediment carried by the water flow fell on the upstream side of the usaf but most of it was transported to the downstream side of the usaf visible sedimentary mounds were formed in front of the pile on both sides of 45 in front of the pile and on both sides of 45 behind the pile from 1000 s to 2000 s the scour rate decreased and the pile side siltation continued to form a piece which reflected that the wake vortex became weaker with the development of scour which caused lower stratum shear stress once the shear stress of the bed was less than the critical shear stress the grains on the surface of the bed were not removed and absorbed into the suspension as a result scour hole scale and scour depth may no longer develop as researched by roulund et al 2005 relative to the initial state of bed stress the bed shear stress decreases with the development of scour holes and causes the scour rate to decay with time finally at t 3000 s the scour tended to be in equilibrium on the whole the usaf formed a local scour around the axis and it was distributed axially and symmetrically some downstream side skirts were exposed the scour deposition range was approximately 70 30 m a small scour pit was formed between each anchor branch the maximum scour depth 1 59 m was located behind the usaf and the maximum siltation 0 55 m was located on the downstream sides of the usaf near the edge of the sink the current study is different from the studies by kawata and tsuchiya 1988 nishizawa and sawamoto 1988 and zhang et al 2017 for vertical cylindrical structures the maximum scour depth under the actions of wave and current appeared on the upstream side of the pile there may be two reasons for the different scour patterns 1 under the current circumstances the horseshoe vortex had not developed or was weak first the kc of r0 is small 4 244 as kobayashi and oda 1994 sumer and fredsøe 2001 and ahmad et al 2015 concluded vortex shedding at a smaller kc number is obviously the main mechanism that causes single pile scour kc 30 when kc was less than 6 no horseshoe vortex was found second the thickness of the wave boundary layer can be considered relatively thin and may be too thin to generate a powerful horseshoe shaped vortex on the upstream side of the pile and the windward vortex is the main driving force of the pulling force therefore the weak or non existent horseshoe vortex in front of the pile did not cause a larger scour pit on the upstream side and the largest scour appeared on the downstream side because of the larger vortex shedding 2 it is reasonable to assume that the presence of anchor branches inhibited the occurrence of scour in front of the usaf compared with the single pile the additional anchoring branch structure prevented the initiation of sediment and may have reduced the fluidity of the sediment around the usaf in addition considering the potential influence of the anchor branch structure on the water flow it can be predicted that the development of usaf scour is significantly different from single pile scour chen and li 2018 and yu et al 2019 studied the scour of vertical cylinders kc 16 9 u cw 0 44 and composite bucket foundations cbfs kc 0 281 respectively and found a long and narrow scour pit behind the pile in addition we observed the existence of horseshoe vortices in the flow field diagram therefore the two reasons are combined the author believe that the anchor branch structure indeed inhibits the initiation of sediment before the pile thereby suppressing the scour in front of the usaf however due to the lack of a systematic quantitative observation of the flow structure around the pile in this study this interpretation may require further verification from fig 14 in the next section we can obtain the change in the maximum scour depth of the r0 pile circle with time and the entire scour process can be divided into three parts a 0 750 s rapid scour process b 750 2500 s slow flushing process c 2500 3000 s scour equilibrium conditions stage this is the same as the scour process studied by many scholars and will not be repeated here 4 2 influence of water depth the effect of water depth h on scour depth is more complicated on the one hand the increase in water depth h can increase the scour depth within a certain range h 3 6d which will further increase the scour depth such as found in the study of raudkivi and ettema 1983 and breusers and raudkivi 1991 on the other hand the increase in water depth under the action of waves alone will reduce the impact of waves on the bottom bed thereby slowing down scour such as in the study of wells 1970 therefore under the effect of wave current coupling the effect of water depth on scour results needs to be analysed based on the dimensionless parameter relative water depth h d or h l under the current research conditions d 4 m h 4 m t 8 6 s u 1 m s for h 1 5d 3 5d the author choose the dimensionless relative water depth h l to study the influence of water depth on scour it is worth noting that it is assumed here that the water depth will not greatly affect the change in the bed shear stress the shallow water wavelength formula is 13 l t g t the calculated h l values of r0 r4 are 0 09 0 11 0 12 0 13 and 0 14 fig 13 shows that the relative water depth has little effect on the morphology of usaf scour the soil scour around the usaf is symmetrically distributed under the four conditions the maximum scour depth appears on the downstream side and the maximum deposition depth appears on both sides of the back of the usaf in the group with a relatively small water depth the tail vortex increased under the action of waves because the wave elements are the same the relative wave height increases and the wave force increases so the scour range is wider fig 14 shows the scour depth time history curve at the last moment although the relative speed u cw increases slightly with increasing relative water depth the speed of the water mass point on the bottom surface decreases rapidly the energy of the water flow decreases and the sediment movement becomes relatively weak which leads to a slower scour development rate and the maximum scour depth also decreases 4 3 influence of wave height fig 15 shows the scour patterns at the last moment of different wave heights it can be seen from the figure that the wave height has a significant effect on the scour patterns as the wave height increases although the relative velocity u cw decreases slightly the velocity of the water particle at the bottom surface increases rapidly and the kc number increases higher wave activity will cause greater bed shear stress at the bed as a result the scour pits between the anchor branches become larger and the narrow scour pit on the downstream side becomes larger until it develops to the entire sink sea floor in addition the increase in wave height strengthens the energy of the water flow which leads to more sediment starting around the usaf and a higher suspended sediment concentration this not only increases the rate of mass transport but also increases the net rate of sediment transport the sediment outside the branch continues to be deposited and eventually forms a triangle shaped distribution at the maximum deposition point as a result more sediment was deposited in front of the usaf and downstream of the anchor branch and a triangle shaped distribution pattern was formed at the maximum deposition point a usaf consists of thin round piles d l 0 05 0 2 and sumer and fredsøe 2001 also made the same conclusion when observing single pile scour in the time chart of fig 16 we found that the increase in wave height not only increased the maximum scour depth but also accelerated the development rate of the scour the higher the wave height the earlier it reached a state close to the equilibrium condition while the r5 group did not reach equilibrium condition 4 4 influence of flow rate fig 17 shows the scour patterns at the last moment of different flow rates the impact of the flow rate on scour is very significant as the flow rate increases the scour characteristics also change at u 0 3 m s the scour is concentrated between the anchor branches and a large area of scour downstream of the sink may be the reason for the nested grid setting with the increase in the flow velocity the turbulence of the flow increased resulting in an increase in the bed shear stress the maximum scour depth and scour range also increased and siltation occurred in front of the usaf as the flow velocity continues to increase the anchor branches of the usaf upstream are covered with mud and sand and a large and narrow scour pit has appeared around the downstream tube skirt the maximum scour depth is closer to the usaf and siltation has also occurred on the sides and back of the narrow scour pit because the excessive water current transports the suspended matter to further locations fig 18 shows that the scour depth of each group increases with increasing of the flow velocity and the scour development law is consistent with the pile obviously the increase in the flow velocity also accelerates the scour process as welzel et al 2019 concluded the scour process and its spatial development around the structure depend on the flow conditions that is whether the flow is dominated by current or waves in this set of tests on the one hand the increase in the flow velocity is reflected in the increase in the hydrodynamic force and the conclusion is that the larger the flow velocity is the deeper the obtained scour on the other hand the pattern can be simplified as the flow changes from current based to wave based so there are great differences in scour patterns because the scour under wave and current is affected by various types of coupling it is necessary to further analyse the influence of dimensionless parameters such as kc and u cw 4 5 influence of kc and u cw under both waves and currents the dimensionless parameter kc keulegan carpenter is a control parameter for the generation and development of vortices around a cylindrical structure and its relative velocity ucw is an important factor affecting the scour around the pile 14 k c u m t d 15 u c w u c u c u m where u c is the velocity of the water flow at a depth of d 2 in this study the inlet velocity u u c u m is the maximum velocity of the water mass above the boundary layer of the bottom wave which is a function of wave height and water depth t is the wave period and d is the diameter of the pile the kc range for each group in this study was 2 7 and the u cw range was 0 1 0 6 figure 19 shows the relationship between the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth and kc for different u cw values fig 20 compares the above results with those of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer 2013 and qi and gao 2014 previous studies have suggested that for fixed u cw s d increases with increasing kc for different u cw under different curve rules s d increases as kc increases and these curves approach asymptotic values as kc increases the current results are consistent with previous conclusions that the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth s d generally increases with increasing kc for a usaf in the case of kc 10 and u cw 0 55 this scour depth increases with the increase in kc number and it is not even affected by u cw this may be because at low kc numbers the increase in u cw reduces the critical number of horseshoe vortices which is conducive to the formation of horseshoe vortices sumer et al 1997 but as explained above the anchoring structure of a usaf inhibits the scour effect of horseshoe vortices therefore there is a greater correlation between the scour depth and the kc number than the scour depth and u cw welzel et al 2019 reached similar conclusions when studying the jacket structure figure 21 shows the change in relative scour depth with u cw here five test points r0 r9 r10 r11 r12 with kc 4 244 are selected and compared with data from sumer and fredsøe 2001 rudolph and bos 2006 qi and gao 2014 schendel 2018 chen and li 2018 and yu et al 2019 it can be concluded from the figure that for fixed kc the s d of usaf increases with the increase in u cw which means that the usaf has the same relationship between u cw and scour depth as the pile foundation however under a similar kc 3 5 4 5 the growth rate of the usaf s d with u cw is obviously smaller it can be explained as compared to monopiles the usaf foundation with anchor branch structure is less affected by the current and thus has a better effect on scour protections this slower growth trend is the same as yu s new base cbf although it is a study conducted at low kc 0 2 less than 0 5 5 conclusion in this study a three dimensional numerical model was established for investigating the local scour around umbrella suction anchor foundations with different hydraulic conditions under both current and wave conditions based on the numerical results presented the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the numerical model used the vof model to study the effect of free surfaces and the rng k ε turbulence model was used to simulate the flow field the results showed that the local scour characteristics and process of the usaf can be well described 2 the local scour shape of the usaf was very different from that of the pile foundation the maximum scour depth appeared at the narrow scour hole downstream the maximum deposition height appeared at both sides 45 downstream and a small scour hole was formed between the anchor branches 3 the usaf local scour was affected by different hydraulic conditions similar to the pile foundation the shallower water depth the higher wave height and the faster flow velocity result in a more intense scour among parameters the flow velocity had a more significant effect on the scour pattern 4 the dimensionless parameters kc and u cw were important factors determining the scour under the coupled forces wave and current compared with the pile foundation the maximum scour depth of the usaf was less affected by the changes in kc and u cw that is a usaf with anchor branches can more effectively perform scour protections 5 these studies provided a data basis for the promotion of this new type of foundation and its unique anchor branches also provided a reference for the scour protections of other wind power foundation however this numerical study lacked a quantitative description of bed shear and hydrodynamic response so the mechanism of usaf scour needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement peng yu conceptualization methodology software investigation validation writing original draft ruigeng hu

21646,an umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf is a new foundation type used for offshore wind turbines in this paper a three dimensional numerical model was established in flow 3d to study the local scour characteristics under the coupled effects of waves and currents rans equations closed with an rng k ε turbulence model were established for simulating the flow field around pile groups the simulation results were compared with a 1 40 model test and showed good agreement then the effects of different hydraulic conditions and dimensionless parameters such as water depth wave height velocity keulegan carpenter number kc and the ratio of relative wave current velocity u cw on the maximum scour depth were considered in detail and compared with the results of other scholars this study found that the local scour shape of a usaf is different from that of a monopile foundation its maximum scour depth appears downstream behind the usaf and the anchoring structure effectively blocks the scour in front of the usaf the shallower water depth the higher wave height and the faster flow velocity result in a more intense scour when kc 7 and u cw 0 7 the maximum scour depth of the usaf increases with increasing kc number and u cw keywords usaf numerical simulations different hydraulic conditions wave current action keulegan carpenter number flow 3d 1 introduction with increasing demands for clean energy offshore wind power has been flourishing globally during the past two decades to date different types of foundations such as monopiles tripods gravity based structures jackets and suction anchor foundations saf have been adopted by the offshore wind industry dolores esteban et al 2015 yagci et al 2017 in response to more complex marine conditions various new foundations are emerging such as the hybrid skirted foundation which can effectively improve basic horizontal bearing capacity and reduce side shift bienen et al 2012 and the wide shallow composite bucket foundation cbf which offers stronger stability against overturning and more suitability for soft soils liu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 based on skirted foundations the authors research group designed a new foundation type called the umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf li et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the usaf added anchor branches with small holes to the external skirt which are intended to enhance the bearing capacity and scour protections during the process of sinking the anchor the anchor branches gradually expand until they are parallel to the seabed accompanying the implantation of the external skirt and bearing various static and dynamic loads together the sinking mechanism and bearing capacity characteristics have been explored by model tests yang et al 2018 the existence of the foundation will change the flow patterns and enhance the turbulence around the foundation under the combined forces of waves and currents leading to substantial flow changes as shown in fig 2 previous studies have found that these changes mainly consist of 1 horseshoe vortices forming in front of the foundation 2 vortex shedding behind the foundation 3 streamlines contracting at the sides of the foundation and 4 counter rotating vortices forming at the lee wake further downstream of the pile these factors lead to an increase in the local sediment transport capacity and will result in local scour around the foundation which can seriously affect the stability and safety of an owt therefore studying the mechanism and prevention of local scour around foundations under the combined forces of waves and currents is critical to the development of offshore wind power due to the complexity of the site conditions it is difficult to study the scour mechanism through field tests most scholars have studied the partial local scour around foundations through indoor model tests 1 local scour under currents or waves only sumer and fredsøe 1992 2001 carried out a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the scour process their results determined that the streamline compression at the side of the pile and the horseshoe vortex occurring in front of the pile are the critical factors of scour induced by steady flows while the vortex shedding at the back of the pile is a key factor for scour attributed to wave action in addition the scour is found to depend mainly on the kc keulegan carpenter number diffraction parameter cylinder diameter d wave length l roughness of the pile and reynolds number baglio et al 2001 measured the maximum scour depth and the position of the maximum scour toe around a pile under oscillating flow using a model experiment method and zhou et al 2004 studied local scour under irregular waves using an experimental method in which some parameters such as the wave period wave height water depth and sediment grain size were involved in their experiments debnath and chaudhuri 2010 conducted a series of physical models to discuss the effects of the clay content water content bed shear strength and pier froude number on the maximum scour depth a further investigation was proposed by them to investigate the effects of sand clay mixtures and suspended sediment concentration on local scour dey et al 2011 debnath and chaudhuri 2011 2 local scour under currents and waves combinations in severe shallow water environments currents and waves usually exist at the same time which may make the scour response around the foundation more complicated than that caused by only currents or waves in comprehensive model experiments sumer and fredsøe 2001 2002 compared the local scour process around piles with different diameters under currents and waves the scour depth was found to be a function of the orbit velocity near the bed u cw u c u c u m and the kc number in which u c undisturbed current velocity at the distance y d 2 from the bed representing the near bed current velocity and u m maximum value of the undisturbed orbital velocity at the sea bottom just above the wave boundary layer rudolph and bos 2006 performed laboratory tests that considered in the influence of low kc numbers on local scour the experimental results showed that superimposed current can increase the scour depth induced by waves in low kc number conditions in addition petersen et al 2012 used a physical model test to indicate that the scour time scale is governed by three parameters namely u cw kc and the shields number an assessment of the influence of pore pressure on scour development in combined waves and currents was studied by qi and gao 2014 in addition to monopile foundations local scour around other types of foundations such as tripod structures stahlmann 2013 bucket foundations stroescu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 cylindrical structures with non uniform geometries tavouktsoglou et al 2017 twin piles liang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 qi et al 2019 pile groups solaimani et al 2017 and submerged piles with both circular and square cross sections yao et al 2018 have been investigated by physical modelling experiments most studies have shown that the occurrence of local scour can be exacerbated under combined currents and waves than under currents or waves alone 3 other factors in recent years more complex factors have been considered in the study of scour around foundations including tidal flow induced scour mcgovern and ilic 2014 schendel et al 2018 ma et al 2018a b tsunami induced scour larsen et al 2018 the mechanism of secondary scour around scour protections petersen et al 2015 and the effect of foundation vibrations on local scour guan et al 2019 which have been studied by the majority of scholars the above studies provide references for simulating the scour around foundations in more realistic environments with the development of computer technology and the reduction of cost numerical simulation methods are now widely used the initial work of scour numerical simulation was initiated and developed by many scholars e g olsen and kjellesvig 1998 tseng et al 2000 and roulund et al 2005 in these studies the three dimensional steady flow around a vertical cylinder was calculated by solving the navier stokes equations the simulated steady flow field was coupled with morphological calculations to simulate clear water scour with the continuous development of software and the application of new approaches numerical simulation studies at scour are more detailed and precise liu and garcia 2008 implemented a three dimensional model to simulate the local scour around a pile under wave action alone they tracked the water free surface by the volume of fluid vof method and captured the water sediment interface by the moving mesh method zhao et al 2010 investigated local scour around a submerged vertical circular cylinder subjected to currents alone by coupling rans equations with a bed morphological model based on the theory of sumer and other scour depth variation studies over time harris et al 2010 proposed a new step time scour depth model which is applicable to both clean water and live bed scour bihs and olsen 2011 analysis the scour at an abutment by numerical simulation and found that numerical simulation results can be improved by reducing the bed shear stress on the sloping bed the danish hydraulic institute dhi 2012 method simulated scour at a foundation based on fluid dynamics calculations and predefined flush rates nielsen et al 2013 used the k ω turbulent model to simulate the turbulent flow field using flow 3d software comparing the results of the model test and numerical simulation it was found that the fluid velocity distribution shear stress distribution and scour protections layer settlement were consistent while there were significant differences between the scour protections layer surface and the free fluid interface kim et al 2014 employed a large eddy simulation les to simulate instantaneous turbulent flow and interpret the features of the scour process and bed topography around twin piles zhang et al 2017 established a set of three dimensional numerical models of three adjacent piles and the influence of pile spacing arrangement on scour depth and patterns was discussed ma et al 2018a b simulated both global and local scour around a tripod foundation by proposing a simplified model and examined the fatigue limit state fls serviceability limit state sls and ultimate limit state uls in two different scour condition in recent years the open source cfd model reef3d has emerged as a simulated scour method though cfd ahmad et al 2015 studied the scour around a non slender cylinder at lower kc numbers and the results showed that the sediment deposition and scour depth increase with the kc number larsen et al 2017 developed a practical model for predicting the scour development caused by tsunami waves by approximating the tsunami induced flow as a time varying current ahmad et al 2018 implemented a sand slide algorithm and modified the bed shear stress on a sloping bed in reef3d for a more realistic calculation of scour and bed deposition moreover it is worth noting that artificial intelligence ai approaches have developed rapidly in the recent decade and have been applied to predict local scour processes around owt foundation moreover it is worth noting that artificial intelligence ai approaches have developed rapidly in the recent decade and have been applied to predict local scour processes around owt foundation azimi et al 2017 and ebtehaj et al 2018 used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and an extreme learning machine elm framework to predict the scour depth of pile groups respectively the results indicated that the anfis presents better validations for measured datasets and lower errors than empirical equations najafzadeh et al 2013 used the levenberg marquardt lm method in the training stage to develop group method of data handling network gmdh lm for scour prediction then najafzadeh et al 2015 2017 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2015 and homaei and najafzadeh 2020 simulated scour at pile groups and bridge pier through a neuro fuzzy based group method of data handling nf gmdh which was developed using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and gravitational search algorithm gsa the results indicated that nf gmdh models could provide more accurate predictions than those obtained using model tree and traditional equations these studies provide a strong theoretical basis for investigating the scour around a usaf under combined currents and waves forces in this paper the local scour characteristics of usaf under the coupled forces of waves and currents are analysed the second section establishes the numerical simulation including the application of governing equations and the setting of boundary conditions the third section verifies the numerical model by setting up an indoor flume test the fourth part analyses the scour characteristics of the usaf under different water conditions including different water depths wave heights flow velocities kc numbers and u cw this study provides a theoretical basis for the development of this new type of suction anchor and provides a reference for the scour protections study of offshore foundation 2 numerical method the 3d flow simulation of the scour around the usaf was performed using flow 3d v11 0 3 flow3d 2013 flow 3d is a cfd code for solving full 3d transient navier stokes equations using a finite volume finite difference method in a fixed euler grid which has the advantages of flexibility and functional flow of porous media the fluid free surface is described by the fluid volume method vof and all models are described by the area porosity and volume favortm the details of the model have been described by hirt and sicilian 1985 hirt 1993 and liu and garcia 2008 the favor method and the vof method eliminate the need for additional cells to capture complex geometric regions and track the free water surface of these regions which can significantly reduce computation time 2 1 theoretical model this section describes the theoretical models used in the study nielsen et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 have described the implementation of these models including a detailed description of the numerical aspects such as computational domain numerical schemes and solver therefore only a brief introduction about theoretical model will be made in the following description 1 governing equations of the flow the rans equations enclosed by the rng k ε turbulence model are used as the governing equations for the incompressible viscous fluid motion around three adjacent piles the equations of motion of the fluid

model involves four sediment transport mechanisms including entrainment deposition bed load transport and suspended load transport the entrainment lift velocity of sediment is proposed by mastbergen and van den berg 2003 6 u l i f t i α i n s d 0 3 θ i θ c r i 1 5 g d i p i p f p f where α i is the entrainment parameter d is the dimensionless diameter of the sediment n s is the outward point

suspended sediment mass concentration of species i 2 2 boundary conditions 1 specified velocity condition the flow velocity is set by the speed boundary condition the elevation of the fluid can be set at the boundary and the flow velocity distribution in the model is evenly distributed in the cross section the lateral velocity v and the vertical velocity w at the entrance are 0 and the horizontal velocity u can be specified the similar flow conditions of the flow velocity u the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent energy dissipation rate ω at the inlet are calculated according to the constant uniform flow of the open channel 2 wave boundary linear waves can be generated at the boundary of the model as shown in fig 3 the model used in this study is based on airy linear wave theory the linear wave enters the calculation area from the end of the flat bottom sink the input properties of the linear wave include the wavelength l of the linear wave the amplitude a the angular frequency ω and the period t 2π l there is also a uniform unidirectional flow in the presence of linear waves which is the basis of the study of wave current coupling in this study the undisturbed velocity component u of the wave propagation direction is constant 3 outflow condition outflow boundary conditions can be used for free surfaces as well as for compressible and incompressible fluids at the exit of the model n 0 while the newman boundary condition is applied to all parameters 4 symmetry condition since the number of grids in this study is very large the selection of symmetric boundaries is an effective way to improve the simulation efficiency and shorten the calculation time under symmetric boundary conditions the newman boundary condition can be used to solve the vertical flow velocity v the lateral flow velocity w and the horizontal flow velocity u it is also possible to calculate the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent energy dissipation rate ω 5 walls u v w 0 for rough boundaries the neumann condition k n 0 is satisfied at the wall where n is perpendicular to the wall 2 3 application of the model the research in this paper is based on flow 3d software to establish a three dimensional scour model the specific solution method and governing equations are as described above the model includes the usaf model with upper steel tube structure a sandy seabed a baffle and the elimination band to ensure that the wave exit does not cause a strong wave reflection that could to affect the simulation results the calculation area is lengthened appropriately and the slope elimination band is increased the model mesh is divided into three parts the band forming grid the structure segment grid and the elimination band grid as shown in fig 4 to improve the calculation efficiency and shorten the calculation time the number of grids should be controlled so a nested grid is used to divide the overall model the grid size are referenced by nielsen et al 2013 and zhang et al 2017 and all the results shown in this article are run by optimal settings among them in the 1 40 model simulation for model verification which will be introduced in section 3 the encryption range is 0 25 m 0 25 m the minimum size of the three part grid is set to 0 03 0 009 0 06 and the total number of grids is 921 763 in the original size model simulation used to simulate scour under real sea conditions which will be introduced in section 4 the encryption range is 10 m 10 m the minimum size of the three part grid is set to 1 2 0 24 2 4 and the total number of grids is 4 253 845 this approach not only controls the total number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation in the setting of the time step because the fllow 3d uses an automatic time step to ensure the best stability and calculation time only the initial time step needs to be entered in the simulation the specific parameters are shown in table 1 1 1 and table 2 it should be noted that in this article the author ignores the effects of flume blockage the verification part of the model will be introduced in the third section of the experimental test section 2 4 numerical simulation group settings the experimental set up comprises an original group r0 and three control groups r1 r4 r5 r8 r9 r12 to explore the scour development mode scour characteristics and scour distribution range of usaf under real world and real current wave conditions the author further explored the effects of different current velocities water depths and wave heights on the erosion process and results the specific numerical simulation work schedule is shown in table 3 3 experimental study since a usaf is a new type of suction anchor foundation there is no corresponding experimental test therefore the author sets the scour test and compares the test results with the numerical model results to verify the accuracy and rationality of the numerical model 3 1 test equipment and parameters the experimental tests were carried out in the wave flume at a coastal engineering environment lab ocean university of china the test equipment mainly consisted of three parts as shown in fig 5 1 current generating system the author independently designed a two way pump circulation flow device and a rectangular guide groove with length width height 0 2 m 0 48 m 0 1 m was arranged on both sides of the model sand groove flushing section the two way water pump was connected through a water pipe and as the water was pumped the circulating wave flow effect of the water flowing from one side of the water inlet side was achieved 2 wave generating system the main body of the wave generating system was a push plate wave making device at the right end of the flume by changing the axial length of the wave making plate and changing the pushing frequency of the wave making plate linear waves of different periods and different wave heights were produced the leftmost end of the trough was provided with a depletion band composed of gravel and fibre which stabilised the water flow and effectively eliminated wave reflection 3 data collection system the main body of the data collection system consisted of an ultrasonic topographer surveying meter a wg 55 capacitor voltage type wave height meter and an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter to collect test parameters such as soil elevation wave height and flow velocity the test parameters are shown in table 1 1 40 and table 4 among them the critical shields parameter θ cr and shields parameter θ are calculated by eqs 10 and 11 the model of usaf and wave current flume are shown in fig 6 3 2 test procedure before the test the soil in the tank was levelled to a thickness of 0 6 m and then the usaf model was vertically inserted into the silt to ensure that the top surface of the usaf and the anchor branch were flush with the silt surface then water was injected until the designated water depth was reached the standing time was set to 24 h so that the test soil could reach the consolidation state required for the study to realistically simulate a seabed the soil was fully saturated during the entire test process after standing a grid was measured on the whole model the grid size was 1 cm 1 cm and three survey lines a b and c were arranged as shown in fig 7 the topography before scour was measured with an ultrasonic topography instrument and the elevations of each measurement point were recorded during the course of the experiment a stable water flow was initially created by the current generating system and then a wave was created by the wave generating system an adv flow meter was used to monitor the flow field in real time during the wave and flow stages the flow meter was fixed at a position approximately 5 m from the usaf main cylinder that is d 2 from the mud surface every 2 h the wave and flow was paused the elevation of the measurement point was measured and the scour depth value for each time period was recorded when the scour test reached three consecutive measurements of a small difference in scour depth it was determined that the scavenging equilibrium stage had been reached and this was regarded as the end of the experiment the experiment ran for a total of 18 h ultrasonic topography probe position 2 5 cm below the water surface was used to measure the soil deposition and scour depth around the umbrella suction anchor the elevation data of each measurement point were recorded and corrected based on actual observations it should be noted here that due to the limitations of the flume this scour test θ θ cr adhered to a clean water scour regime 3 3 test analysis due to the large number of test data points only the test data of a certain test point a x 0 07 m y 0 15 m and test line b y 0 10m are compared with the digital simulation results the scour depth s d is dimensionless the value of steel pipe d is negative a negative value indicates the scour depth and a positive value indicates the deposition height by comparing the time course of scour development between the numerical simulation and the model test as shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the scour development mode at measurement point a1 is similar and has experienced three stages of rapid scour slow scour and scour equilibrium the time to reach scour equilibrium condition in the numerical simulation 15 h is slightly shorter than the time to reach the scour equilibrium in the scour test 18 h this may be because the wave and current generation must be stopped during each measurement in the test however the scour process of the numerical simulation is continuous the maximum scour depth 0 0124 m is similar to the test maximum scour depth 0 0116 m with a difference of 6 9 from the section scour results under the coupled effects of wave and current as shown in fig 8b the opposite phenomenon of scour occurs at part of survey line b1 such as between x 0 02 m 0 05 m and x 0 125 m 0 15 m this is because the scour depth was measured at intervals of 1 cm in the experiment and the scour depth at the other points was obtained by interpolation and fitting in the numerical simulation the cells are finely divided and the data measurements are more continuous which may cause some data to be opposite even so for the maximum scour depth position at the survey line the two results are consistent appearing on both sides of the skirt in summary the scour results simulated by this model are similar to the test results which verifies that the model is reasonable and reliable therefore we can consider that the model can better simulate the scour process of the umbrella suction anchor and can be used for further scour research under real sea conditions 4 analysis to determine the scour mechanism of the usaf under waves and currents the author first analysed the simulation results of the exhibitor group r0 to obtain the flow field changes and scour patterns around the usaf then the influences of different hydraulic conditions and dimensionless parameters kc and u cw on scour were analysed for different groups r1 r4 r5 r8 and r9 r12 among them s is the maximum scour depth at the last moment around the usaf and the dimensionless parameter s d d 4 m is used for analysis the selection range around the usaf is 45 m 30 m x 15 30 m y 15 15 m rectangular area it is worth noting that because the purpose of this study is to analyse the unique basic scour characteristics of a usaf to ensure calculation efficiency the total simulation time selected is 3000 s which means that there may be a state where the scour equilibrium condition is not reached in the r0 r12 groups and further research is needed on the scour phenomenon after reaching the equilibrium conditions 4 1 scour characteristics fig 9 and 10 show longitudinal cross sectional views of the velocity vector around the usaf at t 50 s and t 2000 s at the beginning of scour because the pile blocked the flow the velocity in front of the pile decreased and a vertical downward flow acceleration occurred as the simulation progressed the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile and the streamline compression on the side of the pile could be clearly seen which caused the increase in bed shear stress and the formation of smaller scour pits in front of the usaf the wake vortex behind the pile developed rapidly and fell off and a narrow and large scour pit appeared on the downstream side it can be seen that some anchor branches behind the pile were exposed fig 11 shows the distribution of the plane velocity at different times at the same water depth the time is selected as the first wave when the crest and trough are close to usaf the water depth is chosen to be z 11 4 m 0 2 m above the top of the usaf this is because it is below the crest and trough and there is no air surface which can accurately reflect the change in flow velocity from fig 11 it can be clearly seen that the flow velocity before the usaf was reduced and the streamline accelerated on the usaf side when the crest approached the usaf the flow velocity around the usaf was distributed in a positive direction and obvious streamline compression zones appeared on both sides of the usaf structure as shown in figure a when the trough contacted the usaf a large area of negative flow velocity appeared upstream of the structure and the reverse movement of the water mass point also appeared near the tube skirt downstream of the structure as shown in figure b until the wave approached the usaf as shown in figure c the negative velocity region upstream of the structure was rapidly compressed and the water mass point started to move forward within this range there was only a negative range with negative velocity however a large area of reduced flow velocity appeared downstream of the structure which resulted in strong turbulence and scour so a narrow scour pit appeared downstream of the axis it then began to reciprocate under the action of waves fig 12 shows the time evolution of scour development around the usaf in the first 500 s the scour depth around the usaf increased rapidly and the sediment particles between the anchor branches were first picked up and moved to a position at an angle of approximately 45 after the pile a narrow scour pit appeared behind the anchor which was caused by the wake vortex behind the usaf within 500 s 1000 s the scour between the anchor branches and after the pile increased and the scour on the outside of the anchor branches was small a small part of the sediment carried by the water flow fell on the upstream side of the usaf but most of it was transported to the downstream side of the usaf visible sedimentary mounds were formed in front of the pile on both sides of 45 in front of the pile and on both sides of 45 behind the pile from 1000 s to 2000 s the scour rate decreased and the pile side siltation continued to form a piece which reflected that the wake vortex became weaker with the development of scour which caused lower stratum shear stress once the shear stress of the bed was less than the critical shear stress the grains on the surface of the bed were not removed and absorbed into the suspension as a result scour hole scale and scour depth may no longer develop as researched by roulund et al 2005 relative to the initial state of bed stress the bed shear stress decreases with the development of scour holes and causes the scour rate to decay with time finally at t 3000 s the scour tended to be in equilibrium on the whole the usaf formed a local scour around the axis and it was distributed axially and symmetrically some downstream side skirts were exposed the scour deposition range was approximately 70 30 m a small scour pit was formed between each anchor branch the maximum scour depth 1 59 m was located behind the usaf and the maximum siltation 0 55 m was located on the downstream sides of the usaf near the edge of the sink the current study is different from the studies by kawata and tsuchiya 1988 nishizawa and sawamoto 1988 and zhang et al 2017 for vertical cylindrical structures the maximum scour depth under the actions of wave and current appeared on the upstream side of the pile there may be two reasons for the different scour patterns 1 under the current circumstances the horseshoe vortex had not developed or was weak first the kc of r0 is small 4 244 as kobayashi and oda 1994 sumer and fredsøe 2001 and ahmad et al 2015 concluded vortex shedding at a smaller kc number is obviously the main mechanism that causes single pile scour kc 30 when kc was less than 6 no horseshoe vortex was found second the thickness of the wave boundary layer can be considered relatively thin and may be too thin to generate a powerful horseshoe shaped vortex on the upstream side of the pile and the windward vortex is the main driving force of the pulling force therefore the weak or non existent horseshoe vortex in front of the pile did not cause a larger scour pit on the upstream side and the largest scour appeared on the downstream side because of the larger vortex shedding 2 it is reasonable to assume that the presence of anchor branches inhibited the occurrence of scour in front of the usaf compared with the single pile the additional anchoring branch structure prevented the initiation of sediment and may have reduced the fluidity of the sediment around the usaf in addition considering the potential influence of the anchor branch structure on the water flow it can be predicted that the development of usaf scour is significantly different from single pile scour chen and li 2018 and yu et al 2019 studied the scour of vertical cylinders kc 16 9 u cw 0 44 and composite bucket foundations cbfs kc 0 281 respectively and found a long and narrow scour pit behind the pile in addition we observed the existence of horseshoe vortices in the flow field diagram therefore the two reasons are combined the author believe that the anchor branch structure indeed inhibits the initiation of sediment before the pile thereby suppressing the scour in front of the usaf however due to the lack of a systematic quantitative observation of the flow structure around the pile in this study this interpretation may require further verification from fig 14 in the next section we can obtain the change in the maximum scour depth of the r0 pile circle with time and the entire scour process can be divided into three parts a 0 750 s rapid scour process b 750 2500 s slow flushing process c 2500 3000 s scour equilibrium conditions stage this is the same as the scour process studied by many scholars and will not be repeated here 4 2 influence of water depth the effect of water depth h on scour depth is more complicated on the one hand the increase in water depth h can increase the scour depth within a certain range h 3 6d which will further increase the scour depth such as found in the study of raudkivi and ettema 1983 and breusers and raudkivi 1991 on the other hand the increase in water depth under the action of waves alone will reduce the impact of waves on the bottom bed thereby slowing down scour such as in the study of wells 1970 therefore under the effect of wave current coupling the effect of water depth on scour results needs to be analysed based on the dimensionless parameter relative water depth h d or h l under the current research conditions d 4 m h 4 m t 8 6 s u 1 m s for h 1 5d 3 5d the author choose the dimensionless relative water depth h l to study the influence of water depth on scour it is worth noting that it is assumed here that the water depth will not greatly affect the change in the bed shear stress the shallow water wavelength formula is 13 l t g t the calculated h l values of r0 r4 are 0 09 0 11 0 12 0 13 and 0 14 fig 13 shows that the relative water depth has little effect on the morphology of usaf scour the soil scour around the usaf is symmetrically distributed under the four conditions the maximum scour depth appears on the downstream side and the maximum deposition depth appears on both sides of the back of the usaf in the group with a relatively small water depth the tail vortex increased under the action of waves because the wave elements are the same the relative wave height increases and the wave force increases so the scour range is wider fig 14 shows the scour depth time history curve at the last moment although the relative speed u cw increases slightly with increasing relative water depth the speed of the water mass point on the bottom surface decreases rapidly the energy of the water flow decreases and the sediment movement becomes relatively weak which leads to a slower scour development rate and the maximum scour depth also decreases 4 3 influence of wave height fig 15 shows the scour patterns at the last moment of different wave heights it can be seen from the figure that the wave height has a significant effect on the scour patterns as the wave height increases although the relative velocity u cw decreases slightly the velocity of the water particle at the bottom surface increases rapidly and the kc number increases higher wave activity will cause greater bed shear stress at the bed as a result the scour pits between the anchor branches become larger and the narrow scour pit on the downstream side becomes larger until it develops to the entire sink sea floor in addition the increase in wave height strengthens the energy of the water flow which leads to more sediment starting around the usaf and a higher suspended sediment concentration this not only increases the rate of mass transport but also increases the net rate of sediment transport the sediment outside the branch continues to be deposited and eventually forms a triangle shaped distribution at the maximum deposition point as a result more sediment was deposited in front of the usaf and downstream of the anchor branch and a triangle shaped distribution pattern was formed at the maximum deposition point a usaf consists of thin round piles d l 0 05 0 2 and sumer and fredsøe 2001 also made the same conclusion when observing single pile scour in the time chart of fig 16 we found that the increase in wave height not only increased the maximum scour depth but also accelerated the development rate of the scour the higher the wave height the earlier it reached a state close to the equilibrium condition while the r5 group did not reach equilibrium condition 4 4 influence of flow rate fig 17 shows the scour patterns at the last moment of different flow rates the impact of the flow rate on scour is very significant as the flow rate increases the scour characteristics also change at u 0 3 m s the scour is concentrated between the anchor branches and a large area of scour downstream of the sink may be the reason for the nested grid setting with the increase in the flow velocity the turbulence of the flow increased resulting in an increase in the bed shear stress the maximum scour depth and scour range also increased and siltation occurred in front of the usaf as the flow velocity continues to increase the anchor branches of the usaf upstream are covered with mud and sand and a large and narrow scour pit has appeared around the downstream tube skirt the maximum scour depth is closer to the usaf and siltation has also occurred on the sides and back of the narrow scour pit because the excessive water current transports the suspended matter to further locations fig 18 shows that the scour depth of each group increases with increasing of the flow velocity and the scour development law is consistent with the pile obviously the increase in the flow velocity also accelerates the scour process as welzel et al 2019 concluded the scour process and its spatial development around the structure depend on the flow conditions that is whether the flow is dominated by current or waves in this set of tests on the one hand the increase in the flow velocity is reflected in the increase in the hydrodynamic force and the conclusion is that the larger the flow velocity is the deeper the obtained scour on the other hand the pattern can be simplified as the flow changes from current based to wave based so there are great differences in scour patterns because the scour under wave and current is affected by various types of coupling it is necessary to further analyse the influence of dimensionless parameters such as kc and u cw 4 5 influence of kc and u cw under both waves and currents the dimensionless parameter kc keulegan carpenter is a control parameter for the generation and development of vortices around a cylindrical structure and its relative velocity ucw is an important factor affecting the scour around the pile 14 k c u m t d 15 u c w u c u c u m where u c is the velocity of the water flow at a depth of d 2 in this study the inlet velocity u u c u m is the maximum velocity of the water mass above the boundary layer of the bottom wave which is a function of wave height and water depth t is the wave period and d is the diameter of the pile the kc range for each group in this study was 2 7 and the u cw range was 0 1 0 6 figure 19 shows the relationship between the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth and kc for different u cw values fig 20 compares the above results with those of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer 2013 and qi and gao 2014 previous studies have suggested that for fixed u cw s d increases with increasing kc for different u cw under different curve rules s d increases as kc increases and these curves approach asymptotic values as kc increases the current results are consistent with previous conclusions that the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth s d generally increases with increasing kc for a usaf in the case of kc 10 and u cw 0 55 this scour depth increases with the increase in kc number and it is not even affected by u cw this may be because at low kc numbers the increase in u cw reduces the critical number of horseshoe vortices which is conducive to the formation of horseshoe vortices sumer et al 1997 but as explained above the anchoring structure of a usaf inhibits the scour effect of horseshoe vortices therefore there is a greater correlation between the scour depth and the kc number than the scour depth and u cw welzel et al 2019 reached similar conclusions when studying the jacket structure figure 21 shows the change in relative scour depth with u cw here five test points r0 r9 r10 r11 r12 with kc 4 244 are selected and compared with data from sumer and fredsøe 2001 rudolph and bos 2006 qi and gao 2014 schendel 2018 chen and li 2018 and yu et al 2019 it can be concluded from the figure that for fixed kc the s d of usaf increases with the increase in u cw which means that the usaf has the same relationship between u cw and scour depth as the pile foundation however under a similar kc 3 5 4 5 the growth rate of the usaf s d with u cw is obviously smaller it can be explained as compared to monopiles the usaf foundation with anchor branch structure is less affected by the current and thus has a better effect on scour protections this slower growth trend is the same as yu s new base cbf although it is a study conducted at low kc 0 2 less than 0 5 5 conclusion in this study a three dimensional numerical model was established for investigating the local scour around umbrella suction anchor foundations with different hydraulic conditions under both current and wave conditions based on the numerical results presented the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the numerical model used the vof model to study the effect of free surfaces and the rng k ε turbulence model was used to simulate the flow field the results showed that the local scour characteristics and process of the usaf can be well described 2 the local scour shape of the usaf was very different from that of the pile foundation the maximum scour depth appeared at the narrow scour hole downstream the maximum deposition height appeared at both sides 45 downstream and a small scour hole was formed between the anchor branches 3 the usaf local scour was affected by different hydraulic conditions similar to the pile foundation the shallower water depth the higher wave height and the faster flow velocity result in a more intense scour among parameters the flow velocity had a more significant effect on the scour pattern 4 the dimensionless parameters kc and u cw were important factors determining the scour under the coupled forces wave and current compared with the pile foundation the maximum scour depth of the usaf was less affected by the changes in kc and u cw that is a usaf with anchor branches can more effectively perform scour protections 5 these studies provided a data basis for the promotion of this new type of foundation and its unique anchor branches also provided a reference for the scour protections of other wind power foundation however this numerical study lacked a quantitative description of bed shear and hydrodynamic response so the mechanism of usaf scour needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement peng yu conceptualization methodology software investigation validation writing original draft ruigeng hu

21647,the surface of the bridge pier is divided into upstream surface and downstream surface the tsunami force characteristics and generation mechanisms for regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers as well as pressure distribution and flow field around piers are discussed results show that the upstream surface of the diamond pier is most beneficial to reduce water blocking effect and to lower runup at the stagnation point which ultimately reduces the tsunami force on the upstream surface before tsunami bore reaches the downstream surface downstream surface of the circular pier is most beneficial for two branches of tsunami bore flow back and run up on the downstream surface which generates larger negative tsunami force on downstream surface larger earlier and ultimately makes entire tsunami force on circular pier smaller after tsunami bore reaches the downstream surface based on which a new type pier is invented by combining the upstream surface of diamond pier and downstream surface of circular pier together further the mitigation effect of new type pier is validated and the mitigation mechanism is explored among circular pier and the three piers of new type n60 is proven to the best to reduce tsunami force keywords anti tsunami design bridge pier tsunami force generation mechanism computational fluid dynamics cfd flow field 1 introduction tsunami is a natural phenomenon with extremely destructive power which induces serious damages to coastal infrastructures such as residential houses bridges and breakwaters etc two catastrophic tsunamis have happened since the 21st century i e the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami about 200 000 people were killed or missing in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and lots of coastal bridges were swept away in the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the maximum run up height of tsunami bore was larger than 30 m ghobarah et al 2006 pointed out that the tsunami has a great impact and damage on the coastal structures and the damage degree is affected by the factors such as wave speed wave height etc it s impossible to prevent the generation of tsunami but the optimization to the coastal structures can be performed to minimize the destruction caused by tsunami as key nodes of road network coastal bridges play an important role in the post disaster life rescue and reconstruction therefore it s necessary to study anti tsunami optimization of the coastal bridges the characteristics of tsunami bore tsunami force calculation methods on superstructures have been studied widely by many scholars xu et al 2015 and xu et al 2016 studied the solitary wave induced forces on superstructures of costal bridges yeh 1991 studied the propagation process of tsunami and found that tsunami wave beaks at the coast and changes into tsunami bore in this process the turbulence accumulated in the front of the bore and produced by momentum exchange between tsunami bore and initially quiescent water generates extremely destructive energy wu et al 2018 reported that the dam break waves or tsunami waves are different from solitary waves or regular waves because tsunami waves transmit both mass and energy chanson 2005 compared the theoretical solution of the free surface profile of the dam break wave with the surge data of banda aceh in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that they are in good agreement nouri 2008 conducted an analysis of the tsunami bore at phuket island thailand in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that the tsunami bore is similar to the dam breaking wave propagating on the dry horizontal bed in many respects therefore tsunami waves were generated by dam break method when studying the impact force of tsunami on coastal structures by a large number of scholars such as palermo et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 zhang et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 kihara et al 2015 chen et al 2018 another way is also usually used to simulate tsunami bores in laboratory tests or in numerical simulations that is generating a solitary wave by wave maker in the wave flume or in the wave basin and the solitary wave breaks and transforms into bores at the slope because of the shoaling effect this way has been employed by lukkunaprasit et al 2008 thomas and cox 2012 wang et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 etc but the dam break way is more convenient to generate tsunami bore therefore it will be employed in this study the tsunami forces on different bridge piers under different conditions i e different incoming bore height and downstream initial water depth as well as flow field around piers have been investigated widely arnason et al 2009 used the dam break method to simulate the tsunami bore in water flume and the tsunami forces on the circular square and diamond columns were studied it was found that when the incoming bore height gradually increases the gradient of bore front is slow and the initial impact force on square column becomes smaller than that of the quasi steady state however for the diamond column there is no large initial impact force in addition it is also found that the resistance coefficient of the circular cylinder is larger than the value in the steady open channel flow literature which is expected to be caused by the change of the flow separation points around the circular column due to the blockage al faesly et al 2012 found that the downstream initial conditions dry or wet bed of the flume have an influence on the initial impact force of the structure the initial impact force is greater under the dry bed condition in addition the influencing parameters of mitigation wall i e the height the degree of inclination and the distance to the structure on the force and bending moment of the structure were studied in detail gomez gesteira and dalrymple 2004 used the sph method to simulate the impact of the dam break wave on the square column and the characteristics of the dam break wave with and without the water in the downstream were analyzed results show the profiles of bore front under two downstream initial conditions are obviously different and the local force distribution along the height of column is also different to be exact the position of the maximum local force without the downstream initial water is lower than that with the downstream initial water st germain et al 2012 a also employed dam break method to analyze the tsunami force on square column it is found that there is a large spike of pressure at the lower part of the upstream surface of square column under the dry bed condition but it is not found under the wet bed condition st germain et al 2012 b reproduced their own physical experiments by numerical method sph and found that the peak of the tsunami force occurred in advance with the increase of the upstream impoundment depth shafiei et al 2016 simulated the impact of tsunami waves with different incident angles on the columns in the physical experiment flume by rotating square columns and the tsunami force and pressure on square columns were studied it is pointed out that the fluctuation of pressure during the quasi steady state may be caused by air trapped or vibration of the structure nistor et al 2009 simulated the impact of tsunami on the structure in the experimental flume by dam break method it is found that the pressure distribution along the height of the circular column caused by the initial impact of tsunami bore is close to a triangle shafiei et al 2018 experimentally studied the pressure characteristics on a cylinder under tsunami bore impact and found that the strength of the bore does not affect the overall pattern of the pressure distribution in addition it is also found that the impulsive pressure would occur within 30 of the center angle of the circle from the frontal section of the cylinder to the left and right sides in general the existing literatures mainly investigated the tsunami force on circular square and diamond piers the angle between adjacent edges is 90 note that the research of the tsunami force and generation mechanism on piers of other cross sections such as the diamond piers whose angle between adjacent edges is not 90 and the combined section piers is very rare besides to the best of our knowledge there is no study to optimize the cross sections of piers to mitigate tsunami force which implies the optimization design of bridge pier to mitigate tsunami force is at an early stage of development however in order to obtain better airfoil shapes the optimization of airfoil has been widely investigated in aerospace engineering the aim of airfoil optimization is to make the drag coefficient smaller to make the lift coefficient larger and to make the wake more uniformity etc the more parameters are used to describe an airfoil shape the more potential airfoils are contained in the design space wu et al 2019 therefore a variety of aerodynamic shape parametric methods have been developed and applied to aerodynamic shape optimization such as parametric section parsec method and its developed methods sripawadkul et al 2010 the hicks henne function methods li et al 1998 class shape function transformation cst methods derksen and rogalsky 2010 etc many airfoil shape families have been developed in the past hundred years the optimization method of airfoil may be employed to optimize the bridge pier however the airfoil shape may not be used directly in the bridge pier shape design because of the differences between these two structures firstly the tsunami bore has the flow field different from that of atmosphere which generate forces on bridge pier with different characteristics from airfoil secondly the aim of bridge pier optimization is to decrease the in line force coefficient i e drag force coefficient for airfoil because when impacted by tsunami bore the in line force dominates and the lift force is relatively smaller thirdly the cross sections of piers are simple ordinarily such as circular rectangular diamond round ended and taper end but the airfoil is composed of sophisticated curves or curved surfaces in real practice it s difficult and costly to build piers with sophisticated shapes further if these sophisticated curved surfaces are used in bridge pier cracks around the sharp corners of the curved surfaces would generate due to the stress concentration because the bridge piers are ordinarily made of concrete which is a kind of brittle hard material therefore it s necessary to study the optimization of bridge pier shape from the combination of the simple shapes already being at present however it cannot be denied that with the development of construction technique and with the reduction of the construction cost those complicated curved surface would be used in the bridge pier design in the future in this study the bridge piers standing in the estuaries of rivers are studied these bridge piers suffer higher risk of damage from tsunami bores propagating inland than that from floods flowing into ocean the characteristics and generation mechanisms of tsunami forces on upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces of regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers are compared and studied elaborately considering the upstream surface of diamond pier is able to reduce the impinging force on the upstream surface and the downstream surface of circular pier is able to increase the negative tsunami force on the downstream surface which ultimately can reduce the entire tsunami force on pier a new type pier is developed by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and downstream surface of the circular pier together further among the new type piers n60 is proved to be the best to reduce tsunami force the new kind of pier proposed in this study is novel it is composed of the simple shapes and could be constructed with regular building material by using regular construction techniques in real practice 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 basic equations a well established finite volume commercial software named ansys fluent is used to calculate the

experimental data of arnason et al 2009 is used to validate the numerical model in this study in detail the tank used in the experiment is of 16 6 m length 0 6 m width and 0 45 m height the gate is 5 9 m from the upstream end wall and the experimental model column was placed 5 2 m downstream of the gate shown in fig 1 a the gate was lifted by a pneumatic pump within 0 2 s which is less than the criteria proposed by lauber and hager 1998 indicating that the gate was removed quickly enough and the influence of the gate to the break bore can be ignored a numerical water flume dam break flume and bridge pier model column with exactly the same dimensions with that of the physical experiment were built shown in fig 1 b and the physical experimental case with impounding water depth 0 25 m the downstream initial water depth 0 02 m and the diameter of the column 0 14 m was used to validate the numerical model with the case sharing the same parameters however there is no gate in the numerical model and the impounding water begins to fall at the beginning i e at t 0 more detailed introduction about the experiment please refer to arnason et al 2009 ansys icem is employed to generate grids and the grid independence was verified by generating three different kind of mesh size case i e the coarse middle and fine mesh cases the specific parameters of the three mesh cases are shown in table 1 the sketch of the numerical water flume and bridge pier as well as the middle size meshes around the pier are shown in fig 1 b in the numerical model the flume bottom the left right upstream and downstream sidewalls of flume as well as the surface of the pier are set as stationary wall boundary conditions i e the wall boundaries themselves are stationary and on the wall boundaries the flow velocity in the normal direction is zero and the top of the flume is set as pressure outlet boundary condition the densities of water and air are set as 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and their dynamic viscosities are set as 1 003 10 3 kg m s and 1 7894 10 5 kg m s respectively the gravitational acceleration is set as 9 81 m s 2 a monitoring point p with the coordinates x 11 1 m y 0 3 m z 0 046 m is set to monitor the water depth and velocity which are then compared with that of experimental values by arnason et al 2009 as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively results show both the middle mesh and the fine mesh cases are capable of predicating water depth and velocity very well when compared with the physical experimental values however the water depth and velocity predicted by coarse mesh case deviate from that of physical experiment values obviously further the tsunami forces in line force only on bridge pier obtained by the physical experiment and numerical simulation are compared in fig 4 which shows tsunami forces estimated by the middle and the fine mesh cases agree considerably well with the experimental values by arnason et al 2009 and the accuracy of the coarse mesh case is relatively poorer generally the middle and the fine mesh cases not only predict the flow field i e water depth and velocity very well but also predict the tsunami force considerably well considering the fine mesh case consumes at least twice cpu time of the middle mesh case therefore the middle size mesh generation scheme will be used in this study and above validation also implies that the turbulence model boundary conditions and relating parameter settings etc in ansys fluent are correct and can be used with confidence in the following simulations 3 case introduction the ordinary size of piers in real practice is 1 m 3 m and the piers with size 2 m are selected as prototypes in order to compare with the physical experimental data scheduled to conduct in the near future a scale ratio 1 50 length ratio is used to scale down the prototype piers namely the size of the model piers is d 4 cm altogether three regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers the angle α between the two upstream plane surface is 75 are modeled and shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively in which the solid lines represent the upstream surfaces and the dashed lines represent the downstream surfaces and the angles of the four special points on the surfaces of the piers are also defined as shown in fig 5 i e the left point 0 360 the stagnation point 90 the right point 180 and the rear point 270 note that the scale effect is inevitable when the tsunami forces on the scaled down model are scaled up in this study the scale effect is assumed to affect the tsunami forces on piers equally namely the scale effect does not change the order of tsunami force amplitudes of the piers the exact influence of scale effect requires further elaborate investigation in future the case in this study is named as h h 0 in which h h 2 h 0 indicates incoming bore height and h 0 indicates downstream initial water depth h 2 is incoming wave height relative to flume bottom as shown in fig 6 for each pier three cases are conducted i e the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 in these cases h 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm respectively representing the 2 m 3m and 4 m incoming wave height in real practice while h 0 2 cm representing the 1 m initial water depth in real practice in fig 6 h 1 is the impounding water depth and h is the distance of a point on cylinder surface to the flume bottom wei et al 2015 studied the influence of block effect on tsunami force on bridge pier numerically results show that when the flume width is larger than 7 5 times of the side length of the square pier the block effect can be ignored in this study the flume width is set as 8 times of the width of the upstream surfaces of the piers specifically speaking the flume width is 0 32 m because the width of the upstream surfaces of the piers is 0 04 m therefore the numerical water flume is set as 17 m long 0 32 m wide and 0 45 m deep the length of flume of impounding water is 6 m and all the most front points stagnation points of piers are placed at the same position i e 12 m from the upstream sidewall of the flume as shown in fig 6 when a tsunami bore impacts the downstream sidewall of the flume it will be reflected and flow upstream before the reflected bore arrives at the pier model the computation stops because the reflected bore and the resulting force are not concerned in this study 4 characteristics and generation mechanisms of tsunami forces on the regular piers as representatives the tsunami force characteristics and generation mechanisms of the regular piers i e the square circular and diamond piers in the case 4 2 will be analyzed elaborately the in line tsunami forces f on the entire surface or on the upstream surface or on the downstream surface are nondimensionalized as tsunami force coefficients c f f 0 5 ρ h 2 d u 2 in which ρ h 2 d and u are the density of water the submerged depth of pier the width of the pier perpendicular to the tsunami bore and the depth averaged velocity of the tsunami bore respectively note that the tsunami force mentioned in this study is the in line force acting on piers also called drag force in some references and the tsunami force perpendicular to the flow direction also called lift force in some reference is extremely small and not studied here but will be briefly discussed later the comparison of the tsunami force coefficients for the entire surfaces the upstream surfaces and the downstream surfaces between the three regular piers are shown in fig 7 before the tsunami bore arrives at the upstream surfaces of piers i e t t 0 the entire tsunami forces on piers are basically zero so c f of the entire surface is zero as shown in fig 7 because both the upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces suffer static pressure of the initial water which results in tsunami forces on upstream and downstream surfaces with the same amplitudes but opposite directions i e c f of the upstream surfaces is positive and c f of the downstream surface is negative when t 0 t t 1 the impinging forces on upstream surfaces increase sharply but the negative forces on downstream surfaces is almost unchanged because downstream surfaces only suffer static pressure of initial water therefore c f of the upstream surfaces increases sharply c f of the downstream surfaces changes slightly and c f of the entire tsunami force increases also sharply but relatively slower than that of the upstream surfaces the runups of tsunami bores around the three regular piers at t 5 64 s are shown in fig 8 further the runup heights on the upstream surfaces of the three regular piers are compared quantitatively in fig 9 in figs 8 and 9 the runups at the upstream surfaces of the rectangular pier and the diamond pier respectively are the largest and smallest this is mainly because the upstream surface of square pier is completely perpendicular to the propagation direction of tsunami bore the normal of upstream surface is opposite to propagation direction of tsunami playing a great blocking effect to tsunami bore which should be responsible for the largest runup and impinging pressure on upstream surfaces for the circular pier only the normal of the stagnation point the most upstream point i e the point at θ 90 is opposite to flow direction then the normal of the upstream surface gradually becomes perpendicular to the flow direction at the left side the point at θ 0 and the right side the point at θ 180 of the circular pier where the tsunami bore can flow forward almost without blocking effect therefore for the circular pier the runup at the stagnation point is the highest and gradually decreases when θ decreases to 0 on the left upstream surface and when θ increases to 180 on the right upstream surface as shown in fig 8 b and in fig 9 as to the diamond pier only the normal at stagnation point of the upstream surfaces θ 90 is opposite to the flow direction and the normal downstream the stagnation point is inclined to the flow direction playing weak blocking effect to the tsunami bore than that of the circular pier therefore the runup at the stagnation point of the diamond pier is lower than that of the circular pier however the runup decreases from the stagnation point firstly and then gradually increases on the upstream surface because the normal of the upstream surface keeps unchanged and the blocking effect accumulates along the upstream surface gradually as shown in fig 8 c and in fig 9 the tsunami force on upstream surfaces f u can be calculated as f u p cos β d s in which p is the total pressure on the micro face d s β is the angle between direction of pressure p and propagation direction of tsunami bore for the square pier the pressure direction is the same as the propagation direction of the tsunami bore i e β 0 and cos β 1 integral of p on the upstream surface of the square cylinder completely contributes to the in line tsunami force for the circular pier the angle between the pressure direction and tsunami bore propagation direction changes from 0 at the stagnation point to 90 at the left and right sides of the surface namely 0 β 90 the y component of the force on the left upstream surface cancels out that on the right upstream surface for the diamond pier the angle between the pressure direction and the tsunami bore propagation direction is about 53 the y components of the forces on the left upstream surface and the right upstream surface also cancel each other out fig 10 shows the comparison of the total pressure distribution on the perimeters between the three regular piers at t 5 64 s it can be observed that among the three regular piers the total pressure on the upstream surface of the square cylinder is the largest almost at any height and the total pressure on the diamond pier is generally the smallest which agrees with the runup height of tsunami bore on the upstream surface considering the influences of both β and p the tsunami force on the square pier is the largest when t 0 t t 1 because both cos β and p are the largest among the three regular piers and the tsunami force on the diamond pier is the smallest because of the smallest p and relative smaller value of cos β further the increasing rate of the coefficient of the tsunami force on the diamond pier is smaller than the other two piers when t 0 t t 1 as shown in fig 7 indicating a slower and smoother increase of impinging force on the diamond pier generally before the tsunami flow impinges the downstream surface of the pier tsunami force coefficient on the diamond pier is the smallest and also with a smallest increasing rate therefore among the three regular piers the diamond pier is the best for depressing tsunami force in this stage when t t 1 the runups on the upstream surfaces of the three piers continue to increase slowly and the tsunami forces on the upstream surfaces increase slowly and smoothly too the tsunami bore has already flowed around the upstream surfaces and begin to run up on the downstream surfaces therefore the tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces begin to increase gradually as shown in fig 7 because of the difference between the upstream surfaces of the three regular piers the two branches of the flow split by the upstream surface of the pier runs up at different height on the downstream surfaces which results in different tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces for the circular pier the normals at the intersection points the points at θ 0 and 180 between the upstream and the downstream surfaces are perpendicular to flow direction providing a smooth and continuous normal transition from the upstream to the downstream surfaces which is extremely beneficial for the tsunami bore branches to flow along the downstream surface then to converge at the rear point the point at θ 270 of the pier than the diamond and the square piers as shown in fig 11 b comparison between fig 11 a b and c indicates the runup height on the downstream surface of the circular pier is larger than that of the square and diamond piers qualitatively further the runup heights on the downstream surfaces of the circular square and diamond piers are compared quantitatively and shown in fig 12 which agrees with the comparison results obtained in fig 11 correspondingly the total pressure on the downstream surfaces of the circular pier is the largest as shown in fig 13 in which the total pressure distribution on the perimeters of the three regular piers at t 5 7 s are compared therefore the negative tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces of the circular pier increases quickly results in an obvious decrease of the entire tsunami force coefficient and ultimately makes the entire tsunami force coefficient on the circular pier to be the smallest when t t 1 as shown in fig 7 note that the direction of tsunami force on the downstream surfaces is opposite to the tsunami bore propagation direction generally the runups on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have no obvious difference but obviously lower than that of the circular pier as shown in fig 12 consequently the total pressures on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have less difference but smaller than that on the circular pier as shown in fig 13 but the tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have obvious difference because of β the angle between the pressure direction on downstream surface and tsunami bore propagation direction i e cos β for the square pier is larger than that of the diamond pier so tsunami force coefficient of the downstream surface of the diamond pier is almost stable when t 1 t 5 8 s but it increases obviously for the square pier as shown in fig 7 noting that the tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surfaces of the square pier is still far larger than that of the diamond and circular piers in this period therefore the entire tsunami force coefficient on the square pier is the largest generally the shape of the downstream surface of the circular pier namely semi circle is most beneficial for the reattachment of the tsunami bore than the diamond and square piers which can provide the largest negative tsunami force on the downstream surface to cancel out the positive tsunami force on the upstream surface finally making entire tsunami force as well as entire tsunami force coefficient to be the smallest among the three piers in fact when the incoming bore height increases i e in the cases 6 2 and 8 2 the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of circular pier show similar advantages of reducing entire tsunami bore force as they behave in the case 4 2 so analysis on the cases 6 2 and 8 2 is omitted here for brevity 5 analysis of tsunami force on the new type pier 5 1 design of the new type pier through analysis of characteristics and generation mechanism of tsunami forces on the three regular piers we obtained conclusion that the diamond and circular piers have advantages in reducing tsunami force in the periods respectively before and after tsunami bore runs up on the downstream surfaces of the piers based on which a new type pier can be made up by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of the circular pier as shown in fig 14 note that the upstream line segments are tangential to the arc the angle of upstream plane surfaces α is expected to influence tsunami force on the new type pier therefore three piers of new type named as n60 n75 and n90 with α 60 75 and 90 respectively are investigated in this section the piers with even smaller α values are not involved because the sharp edge of concrete pier is prone to crack due to the concentration of stresses also the tip shaped pier with angle smaller than 60 is rarely constructed in real practice as in the previous section the downstream initial water depth keeps as 2 cm and the incoming tsunami bore height is also set as 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm 5 2 validation of the mitigation effect of the new type piers among the regular piers discussed in the section 4 approximately the circular pier has smallest tsunami force coefficient as shown in fig 7 that s may be one of reason why the circular piers are most widely used in river bridges the circular pier will be employed to compare with the new type piers to validate the advantages of the new type piers in reducing tsunami force just as shown in fig 15 in which the entire tsunami force f e is also nondimensionalized as the entire tsunami force coefficient c fe it can be observed that generally the new type piers have smaller tsunami force coefficients in the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 no matter during the impinging stage or after the impinging stage further the tsunami force coefficient increases with α i e c n 60 fe c n 75 fe c n 90 fe and c n 60 fe is remarkably smaller than c n 75 fe and c n 90 fe when the tsunami bore height increases for example in the case 8 2 see fig 15 c in other words n60 pier is the best of all to reduce tsunami force in order to analyze the mitigation of tsunami force coefficient of the new type piers quantitatively two variables are defined as m 100 c f e m a x c c f e m a x n c f e m a x c n 100 c f e a v e c c f e a v e n c f e a v e c in which m is the tsunami force coefficient decreasing rate in the impinging stage i e t 0 t t 2 in which t 0 is the instant when the tsunami bore arrives at the upstream surfaces and t 2 is the instant when the tsunami bore front leaves the piers t 2 is marked in fig 15 c f e m a x c and c f e m a x n are the maximum tsunami force coefficients of the circular pier and the new type piers respectively in the impinging stage n is the tsunami force coefficient decreasing rate during the quasi stable stage c f e a v e c and c f e a v e n are the time averaged tsunami force coefficients of the circular and new type piers respectively in the quasi stable stage the description of the quasi stable stage can refer to the studies by yang et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 in this stage the tsunami force almost keeps stable and the time intervals of the quasi stable stages for the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 could be estimated approximately as 7 10 s 6 9 s and 5 8 s respectively as shown in fig 15 note that the tsunami force time histories generated by the reflected bore from the downstream sidewall of the flume are not drawn in fig 15 the m and n values in each case as well as the maximum value c f e m a x of the tsunami force during the impinging stage and the averaged value c f e a v e of the tsunami force in the quasi stable stage are listed in table 2 it can be observed that m is larger than n when the incoming bore height is smaller i e in the case 4 2 indicating the new type pier can mitigate the impinging force in the impinging stage more obviously than the averaged tsunami force in the quasi stable stage with increase of the incoming wave height i e in the cases 6 2 and 8 2 m is smaller than n indicating the new type piers can mitigate the averaged tsunami force even more than the impinging force also it can be observed that m and n increase with the decrease of α i e the new type pier n60 performs best of all to be more exact compared with the circular pier n60 can reduce the maximum impinging force coefficient 19 in the case 6 2 and can reduce the averaged tsunami force coefficient 42 1 in the quasi stable stage in the case 8 2 therefore the new type pier can effectively reduce the tsunami force coefficients and the smaller α the larger decreasing rate 5 3 mechanism analysis of the tsunami force mitigation on the new type pier the tsunami forces coefficients on the upstream surfaces and the downstream surfaces on the piers will be discussed respectively to investigate the mechanism of tsunami force mitigation comparison of tsunami force coefficient time histories of the upstream surfaces between the circular pier and the new type piers are shown in fig 16 in which the tsunami force coefficients of the upstream surfaces of the piers increase sharply in the impinging stage and increase gradually after the impinging stage compared with the circular pier decrease of the tsunami force coefficient of the upstream surfaces of the new type piers in the lower incoming bore height case i e in the case 4 2 in fig 16 a is smaller than that in the larger incoming bore height case i e the case 6 2 in fig 16 b especially in the case 8 2 the tsunami force coefficient of the upstream surface of n60 is considerably smaller than that of n75 n90 and the circular pier as shown in fig 16 c it can also be observed that the tsunami force coefficient difference between the new type piers increases with the increase of the incoming wave height among the three new type piers tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface of n60 is the smallest no matter in the impinging stage or after the impinging stage tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces of the circular and the new type piers are compared in fig 17 by comparing figs 16 and 17 it can be observed that in each case the tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface is larger than that on the downstream surface when the tsunami bore height is smaller i e in the case 4 2 the tsunami force coefficient difference on downstream surfaces of piers is not obvious with increase of the tsunami bore height i e in the case 6 2 the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surface of the circular pier is a little bit larger than that of the new type piers when 5 3 s t 8 3 s and in the case 8 2 the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surface of the circular pier is generally smaller than that of the new type piers therefore for the smaller bore height cases i e the cases 4 2 and 6 2 the upstream surfaces of the new type piers dominate the decreasing rate of entire tsunami force coefficient because the decrease of tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surfaces is much larger than tsunami force coefficient increase on the downstream surfaces for the larger bore height case i e the case 8 2 both the upstream and downstream surfaces dominate the decreasing rate of the entire tsunami force coefficient because both the tsunami force coefficient decrease on the upstream surfaces and tsunami force coefficient increase on the downstream surfaces are remarkable especially for n60 pier as shown in figs 16 c and fig 17 c respectively comparison between fig 17 a b and c shows the times history curves of tsunami force coefficients on downstream surfaces in the lower bore height cases i e the cases 4 2 and 6 2 are smoother than those in the larger bore height case i e the case 8 2 the fluctuations of time history curves of tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces in fig 17 c are responsible for the fluctuations of the entire tsunami bore forces in fig 15 c and the fluctuations in tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces deserve further investigation when t t 2 for example t 6 725 s the runups of tsunami bores around the circular and the new type piers in the case 6 2 are qualitatively shown in fig 18 further the comparison of runup heights on the surfaces of the circular and the new type piers are quantitatively compared in fig 19 when α 60 runup at the stagnation point of n60 is the smallest among the four piers and the runup gradually increases to the maximum along the upstream surface and then decreases along the downstream surface as shown in fig 18 a and 19 when α 75 runup at the stagnation point of n75 becomes relatively larger and the runup increases to the maximum relatively more sharply as shown in fig 18 b and 19 when α 90 runup at the stagnation point of n90 is larger than that of n60 and n75 but smaller than that of circular pier and the runup sharply increases to the maximum just behind the stagnation point then decreases gradually along the upstream and downstream surfaces as shown in fig 18 c and 19 and runup at the stagnation point of circular pier is the largest and decreases along the upstream surface and downstream surface gradually compared with other piers the runup on the upstream surface of n60 is the lowest which is one of the reason responsible for the smallest tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface fig 20 shows the vorticity contours on x y section plane at h 7 cm at t 6 725 s in the case 6 2 when the incoming tsunami bore height is smaller i e the case 6 2 the upstream surface generally has relatively weaker influence on the flow field however the difference of vorticity fields behind the piers caused by the difference of the upstream surfaces is still observed a relative obvious vortex generates behind the circular pier and the much weaker vortexes generate behind the new type piers among which vortex behind n60 is the weakest as shown in fig 20 these vortexes generate low pressure areas behind the piers as shown in fig 21 note that the reference pressure is set as the standard atmospheric pressure in this study therefore the pressure at and around the vortex core is negative indicating the pressure is slightly lower than the standard atmospheric pressure the magnitude of pressure is in reverse proportion to the vortex intensity i e the higher vortex intensity the lower pressure at the vortex center the low pressure area makes the total pressure at the position around θ 270 on the downstream surface lower than that of adjacent positions as shown in fig 22 c when the incoming bore height is small no obvious vortex shedding happens therefore no fluctuations of tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces are observed when the incoming bore height is larger i e the case 8 2 the runup of tsunami bore around the piers are similar as those when the incoming bore height is smaller i e the case 6 2 but the upstream surface will bring remarkable influence to the flow field behind the pier vorticity contours on x y section plane at h 7 cm at t 4 137 s in the case 8 2 are shown in fig 23 two relatively weaker vortexes symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis generate behind n60 as shown in fig 23 a which introduces two smaller low pressure areas behind the downstream surfaces as shown in fig 24 a the low pressure areas ultimately induces lower but positive pressure at the positions around θ 230 and 310 as shown in fig 25 c because these two weaker vortexes don t shed at present t 4 137 s therefore there are no obvious fluctuations in the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces of n60 as shown in fig 17 c however with the increase of α i e n75 pier the vortexes become stronger and begin to shed alternately as shown in fig 23 b which introduces two alternating negative pressure areas behind n75 as shown in fig 24 b therefore the total pressure at the position around θ 320 of the downstream surface of n75 is negative as shown in fig 25 c similarly two even stronger alternately shedding vortexes generate behind both n90 and circular piers as shown in fig 23 c and d respectively resulting in even larger and stronger negative pressure areas behind n90 and the circular piers as shown in fig 24 c and d respectively because at present t 4 137 s one vortex has not completely shed and another vortex has almost grown up two negative pressure areas with different intensity exert strong effect on downstream surface resulting negative pressure and low positive pressure generate around θ 315 and θ 225 respectively on n90 and negative pressure and low positive pressure generate around θ 225 and θ 315 respectively on the circular piers as shown in fig 25 c because these vortex are three dimensional and the induced negative pressure on downstream surface changes with height h for example at h 10 cm the total pressures at points around θ 225 and θ 315 are negative and with almost the same values as shown in fig 25 d fig 25 also demonstrates that the negative total pressure does not appear on the whole submerged depth of downstream surfaces for example it does not appear at h 1 cm 4 cm 12 cm and 14 cm because with the increase of submerged depth positive static pressure increases gradually but the influence of low pressure areas or negative pressure areas distributes non uniformly which makes total pressure to be negative at some specific heights only at t 4 55 s the vortexes behind n60 almost keep stable and there is no fluctuation in tsunami force coefficient on downstream surface but the vortexes behind n75 n90 and circular piers shed alternatively introducing fluctuation in tsunami force coefficient on downstream surfaces as shown in fig 17 c simultaneously the negative pressure on some positions of downstream surfaces of n75 n90 and circular piers generates suction forces in line with tsunami bore propagation direction resulting a smaller negative tsunami force coefficient on downstream surface as shown in fig 17 c and then larger entire tsunami force coefficient on n75 n90 and circular piers as shown in fig 15 c however with time goes on the vortex status behind the new type and circular piers may change because of the strongly turbulent flow near the downstream surfaces for example at t 7 0 s the vortexes behind n60 are shedding which makes tsunami force coefficient of n60 fluctuate at t 6 3 s and at t 7 7 s the vortexes behind n75 and n90 respectively almost stop shedding which makes the tsunami force coefficients of n75 and n90 almost stop fluctuating as shown in fig 17 c the negative pressure on n75 and n90 simultaneously becomes weaker so the negative force on the downstream surfaces of n75 and n90 increases the increase of negative force on downstream surfaces of n75 and n90 makes their entire forces slightly smaller or larger than that on n60 note that at t 6 3 s and t 7 7 s the positive force on the upstream surfaces of n60 is much smaller than that of n75 and n90 respectively therefore among the four piers the upstream surface of n60 is the best to generate weaker vortex or to delay the vortex shedding to generate larger and more stable negative force on the downstream surface which makes a great contribute to make the entire tsunami force coefficient on n60 to be the smallest 6 discussion 6 1 tsunami forces on the piers with same cross section area as we know the block effect influences the tsunami force on bridge pier significantly therefore the tsunami forces on the piers of different kinds used to compare the resistance ability to tsunami bore should be measured under the same block ratio i e the ratio of width of the upstream surface of pier to the flume width only one numerical flume of 17 m long 0 32 m wide and 0 45 m deep was built in this study so the widths of the upstream surfaces of the piers of different kinds were set the same i e d 4 cm then the piers of different kinds i e the square circular and diamond piers have different cross section areas as shown in tab 3 when the three piers have the same width the square pier has the largest cross section area and the diamond pier has the smallest cross section area when design a bridge pier in real practice the bearing capacity of pier is mainly determined by the cross section area in other words the same bearing capacity requires the same cross section area but not requires the same width of the pier whether the conclusions obtained in the section 4 are still viable requires further investigation assuming the three piers have the same cross section area i e s 0 0016 m 2 then the width of each pier d is calculated and listed in the last column in table 3 according to the tsunami force coefficients of the entire surface the upstream and downstream surfaces of each pier in fig 7 the entire tsunami force the tsunami forces on the upstream and downstream surfaces of each pier in the case 4 2 respectively can be calculated based on f 0 5 c f ρ h 2 d u 2 and shown in fig 26 fig 26 shows when t 0 t t 1 among the three piers the diamond pier has the smallest tsunami force on the upstream surface and therefore has smallest entire tsunami force noting that the three piers have almost the same tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces when t t 1 among the three piers the circular pier has the smallest tsunami force on the upstream surface and largest negative tsunami force on the downstream surface undoubtedly the circular pier has the smallest entire tsunami force the results obtained here comply with that obtained in fig 7 in the section 4 which also implies among the three piers with the same bearing capacity the combination of the diamond and circular pier is an innovation way to reduce tsunami force effectively the same doubt exits in the comparison in the section 5 in which the three new type piers are proven to be able to reduce tsunami force and n60 is proven to be the best of the three the cross section areas are listed in table 4 when the circular pier and the three new type piers have the same width i e d 0 04 m it could be observed that the n60 pier has the largest cross section area and the circular pier has the smallest cross section area it can be deduced that when these piers have the same cross section area n60 should have the smallest width and the circular pier should have the largest width assuming the piers having the same area s 0 001256 m 2 the widths d of the circular and the three new type piers are listed in the last column in table 4 which justifies the deduction similarly the tsunami forces on the upstream surfaces downstream surfaces and entire surfaces on the circular and the three new type piers can be calculated as f 0 5 c f ρ h 2 d u 2 and shown in fig 27 the comparisons of the tsunami forces between the circular and new type piers on the upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces are shown in fig 28 and fig 29 respectively generally figs 27 figs 28 and 29 respectively are similar as their corresponding figures of tsunami force coefficients i e figs 15 figs 16 and 17 therefore the discussion about their characteristics is omitted here for brevity the section 5 has proven that the tsunami force coefficient of the circular pier is larger than that of the new type piers and table 4 shows when they have the same cross section area the piers with widths from large to small are circular n90 n75 and n60 therefore the gaps between the tsunami force time history curves of the circular and new type piers are larger than that of the tsunami force coefficients straightforwardly when having the same cross section area n60 performs better in reducing tsunami force than n60 does when having the same width therefore when assuming the piers have the same cross section area i e the same bearing capacity in bridge design n60 is the best of the three new type piers in reducing the tsunami force 6 2 lift force basically the lift force the tsunami force perpendicular to the propagation direction of the tsunami bore on bridge pier is generated by the pressure difference between the left and right side surfaces of the pier the bridge piers are symmetric with the centerlines parallel with the tsunami bore propagation direction and the pressure difference is mainly resulted from the alternate vortex shedding the square pier is thought to generate vortex shedding easiest and most intensively among the piers involved in this study therefore the comparison of the drag force the in line tsunami force in this study and the lift force on the square pier is shown in fig 30 it shows that the peak value of the lift force is about 0 351 n which is less than 10 of the peak value of the drag force i e 5 839 n the lift force is thought to play extremely weak role in destroying the bridge piers therefore it is not discussed in this study however as to the slender cylinders suffering water flow with large velocity the lift force caused by alternate vortex shedding and the resulting vibration of the cylinder namely viv should receive close attentions 6 3 essence of problems the flow field of tsunami bore is characterized as a fast moving bore front and the relatively stable water flow behind these characteristics could be found in the water depth and velocity time histories as shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively in which when the tsunami bore front arrives the water depth increases suddenly and the velocity increase sharply to the peak value after the tsunami bore front leaves the water depth increases slowly and the velocity almost keeps constant the aim of the bridge pier optimization is to reduce the impinging force introduced by the tsunami bore front in the impinging stage and also to reduce the current force after the bore front past i e the quasi stable stage the ordinarily used streamline body for example a body with sphere shape head and tip end like a raindrop may not be valid to reduce the impinging force induced by tsunami bore front the impinging force is closely related to the upstream surface shape and the current force is related to both the shapes of upstream and downstream surfaces because the current force is determined by the pressure difference on upstream and downstream surfaces assuming water is inviscid and incompressible the bernoulli s equation i e eq 6 could be used to explain the essence of impinging force reduce on the upstream surface of the diamond pier approximately 6 p 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g h 0 c o n s t a n t in which p is the pressure ρ is the density of water v is the velocity and h 0 is the elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration compared with the blunt body i e the square and circular piers in this study the sharp angle of the upstream surface of the diamond pier has smaller blockage and is able to allow tsunami bore flow around the pier fluently with larger velocity and the runup on the upstream surfaces is smaller as shown in fig 31 the upstream surface of the square pier is perpendicular to the tsunami bore direction and has larger blockage resulting larger runup and smaller velocity when flowing around the pier according to eq 6 the larger velocity in front of the upstream surface indicates the smaller pressure on the upstream surface also the smaller runup results in smaller static pressure therefore the total pressure on the upstream surface of the diamond pier is the smallest among the three piers as shown in fig 10 ordinarily the direction of the pressure on the blunt body surface has a smaller angle β with the flow direction for example the pressure direction on the upstream surface of the square pier is the same as the tsunami bore direction making the integration of pressure on the upstream surfaces generate larger force because of larger value of cos β vice versa the upstream surface of the diamond pier has larger angle between pressure direction and tsunami bore direction resulting smaller value of cos β and smaller force on the pier when the angle between the upstream plane surfaces is shaper i e α is smaller the smaller impinging force on the pier that s the reason why n60 is better than n75 and n90 in the quasi stable stage the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream surfaces dominate for the circular pier the surface normal changes continuously and smoothly from the upstream surface to the downstream surface which is much beneficial for body fitted flow i e beneficial for the two split tsunami bore branches flowing along the downstream surface and converging at the rear point therefore the runup on the downstream surface of the circular pier is larger and the resulting pressure is larger as shown in fig 32 which generates a larger negative force to makes the entire tsunami force smaller in the quasi stable stage in the new type piers the upstream plane surfaces are designed to be tangent with the arc to provide continuous and smooth transition of the surface normal which facilitates the development of the runup on the downstream surface 7 conclusions the surfaces of the regular piers i e the square circular and diamond piers are divided into upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces then the pressure tsunami force runup on the surfaces as well as flow fields around the piers are investigated elaborately to explore the generation mechanisms of tsunami force results show 1 before the tsunami bore runs up on the downstream surface the entire tsunami force is dominated by the tsunami force on the upstream surface because the downstream surface only suffers static pressure of the initial water during this period the upstream surface of diamond pier is most beneficial to reduce water blocking effect and to lower runup at the stagnation point which ultimately makes the entire tsunami force on diamond pier to be the smallest of all 2 after the tsunami bore runs up on downstream surface the entire tsunami force is dominated by both tsunami forces on upstream and downstream surfaces during this period the downstream surface of the circular pier is most beneficial for the two branches of tsunami bore flow back and run up on the downstream surface which generates larger negative tsunami force on the downstream surface sooner and ultimately makes entire tsunami force on the circular pier to be the smallest of all based on which a new type pier is invented by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of the circular pier together then mitigation effect of the new type pier is further validated and the tsunami force mitigation mechanism is discussed results show 3 the new type piers can obviously reduce tsunami force 4 with the increase of incoming bore height the new type pier has better mitigation effect 5 with decrease of α angle between upstream plane surfaces the mitigation effect becomes better n60 is the best of the three new type piers 6 when the incoming wave height is small no obvious vortex sheds and tsunami force almost has no fluctuations when the incoming wave height is large vortexes shed alternatively and tsunami force has fluctuations vortexes generate low or negative pressure areas which induces lower or negative total pressure at some heights of the downstream surfaces and results in smaller negative forces and ultimately results in larger entire tsunami force on piers 7 among the circular pier and the three piers of new type n60 is the best to generate weaker vortex and to delay the vortex shedding to generate larger and more stable negative force on the downstream surface which makes a great contribute to make the entire tsunami force on n60 to be the smallest the new type pier proposed in this study is composed of the simple shapes i e plane and cylindrical surface which is

21647,the surface of the bridge pier is divided into upstream surface and downstream surface the tsunami force characteristics and generation mechanisms for regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers as well as pressure distribution and flow field around piers are discussed results show that the upstream surface of the diamond pier is most beneficial to reduce water blocking effect and to lower runup at the stagnation point which ultimately reduces the tsunami force on the upstream surface before tsunami bore reaches the downstream surface downstream surface of the circular pier is most beneficial for two branches of tsunami bore flow back and run up on the downstream surface which generates larger negative tsunami force on downstream surface larger earlier and ultimately makes entire tsunami force on circular pier smaller after tsunami bore reaches the downstream surface based on which a new type pier is invented by combining the upstream surface of diamond pier and downstream surface of circular pier together further the mitigation effect of new type pier is validated and the mitigation mechanism is explored among circular pier and the three piers of new type n60 is proven to the best to reduce tsunami force keywords anti tsunami design bridge pier tsunami force generation mechanism computational fluid dynamics cfd flow field 1 introduction tsunami is a natural phenomenon with extremely destructive power which induces serious damages to coastal infrastructures such as residential houses bridges and breakwaters etc two catastrophic tsunamis have happened since the 21st century i e the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami about 200 000 people were killed or missing in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and lots of coastal bridges were swept away in the 2011 japan tohoku tsunami the maximum run up height of tsunami bore was larger than 30 m ghobarah et al 2006 pointed out that the tsunami has a great impact and damage on the coastal structures and the damage degree is affected by the factors such as wave speed wave height etc it s impossible to prevent the generation of tsunami but the optimization to the coastal structures can be performed to minimize the destruction caused by tsunami as key nodes of road network coastal bridges play an important role in the post disaster life rescue and reconstruction therefore it s necessary to study anti tsunami optimization of the coastal bridges the characteristics of tsunami bore tsunami force calculation methods on superstructures have been studied widely by many scholars xu et al 2015 and xu et al 2016 studied the solitary wave induced forces on superstructures of costal bridges yeh 1991 studied the propagation process of tsunami and found that tsunami wave beaks at the coast and changes into tsunami bore in this process the turbulence accumulated in the front of the bore and produced by momentum exchange between tsunami bore and initially quiescent water generates extremely destructive energy wu et al 2018 reported that the dam break waves or tsunami waves are different from solitary waves or regular waves because tsunami waves transmit both mass and energy chanson 2005 compared the theoretical solution of the free surface profile of the dam break wave with the surge data of banda aceh in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that they are in good agreement nouri 2008 conducted an analysis of the tsunami bore at phuket island thailand in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that the tsunami bore is similar to the dam breaking wave propagating on the dry horizontal bed in many respects therefore tsunami waves were generated by dam break method when studying the impact force of tsunami on coastal structures by a large number of scholars such as palermo et al 2009 triatmadja and nurhasanah 2012 zhang et al 2012 rahman et al 2014 kihara et al 2015 chen et al 2018 another way is also usually used to simulate tsunami bores in laboratory tests or in numerical simulations that is generating a solitary wave by wave maker in the wave flume or in the wave basin and the solitary wave breaks and transforms into bores at the slope because of the shoaling effect this way has been employed by lukkunaprasit et al 2008 thomas and cox 2012 wang et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 etc but the dam break way is more convenient to generate tsunami bore therefore it will be employed in this study the tsunami forces on different bridge piers under different conditions i e different incoming bore height and downstream initial water depth as well as flow field around piers have been investigated widely arnason et al 2009 used the dam break method to simulate the tsunami bore in water flume and the tsunami forces on the circular square and diamond columns were studied it was found that when the incoming bore height gradually increases the gradient of bore front is slow and the initial impact force on square column becomes smaller than that of the quasi steady state however for the diamond column there is no large initial impact force in addition it is also found that the resistance coefficient of the circular cylinder is larger than the value in the steady open channel flow literature which is expected to be caused by the change of the flow separation points around the circular column due to the blockage al faesly et al 2012 found that the downstream initial conditions dry or wet bed of the flume have an influence on the initial impact force of the structure the initial impact force is greater under the dry bed condition in addition the influencing parameters of mitigation wall i e the height the degree of inclination and the distance to the structure on the force and bending moment of the structure were studied in detail gomez gesteira and dalrymple 2004 used the sph method to simulate the impact of the dam break wave on the square column and the characteristics of the dam break wave with and without the water in the downstream were analyzed results show the profiles of bore front under two downstream initial conditions are obviously different and the local force distribution along the height of column is also different to be exact the position of the maximum local force without the downstream initial water is lower than that with the downstream initial water st germain et al 2012 a also employed dam break method to analyze the tsunami force on square column it is found that there is a large spike of pressure at the lower part of the upstream surface of square column under the dry bed condition but it is not found under the wet bed condition st germain et al 2012 b reproduced their own physical experiments by numerical method sph and found that the peak of the tsunami force occurred in advance with the increase of the upstream impoundment depth shafiei et al 2016 simulated the impact of tsunami waves with different incident angles on the columns in the physical experiment flume by rotating square columns and the tsunami force and pressure on square columns were studied it is pointed out that the fluctuation of pressure during the quasi steady state may be caused by air trapped or vibration of the structure nistor et al 2009 simulated the impact of tsunami on the structure in the experimental flume by dam break method it is found that the pressure distribution along the height of the circular column caused by the initial impact of tsunami bore is close to a triangle shafiei et al 2018 experimentally studied the pressure characteristics on a cylinder under tsunami bore impact and found that the strength of the bore does not affect the overall pattern of the pressure distribution in addition it is also found that the impulsive pressure would occur within 30 of the center angle of the circle from the frontal section of the cylinder to the left and right sides in general the existing literatures mainly investigated the tsunami force on circular square and diamond piers the angle between adjacent edges is 90 note that the research of the tsunami force and generation mechanism on piers of other cross sections such as the diamond piers whose angle between adjacent edges is not 90 and the combined section piers is very rare besides to the best of our knowledge there is no study to optimize the cross sections of piers to mitigate tsunami force which implies the optimization design of bridge pier to mitigate tsunami force is at an early stage of development however in order to obtain better airfoil shapes the optimization of airfoil has been widely investigated in aerospace engineering the aim of airfoil optimization is to make the drag coefficient smaller to make the lift coefficient larger and to make the wake more uniformity etc the more parameters are used to describe an airfoil shape the more potential airfoils are contained in the design space wu et al 2019 therefore a variety of aerodynamic shape parametric methods have been developed and applied to aerodynamic shape optimization such as parametric section parsec method and its developed methods sripawadkul et al 2010 the hicks henne function methods li et al 1998 class shape function transformation cst methods derksen and rogalsky 2010 etc many airfoil shape families have been developed in the past hundred years the optimization method of airfoil may be employed to optimize the bridge pier however the airfoil shape may not be used directly in the bridge pier shape design because of the differences between these two structures firstly the tsunami bore has the flow field different from that of atmosphere which generate forces on bridge pier with different characteristics from airfoil secondly the aim of bridge pier optimization is to decrease the in line force coefficient i e drag force coefficient for airfoil because when impacted by tsunami bore the in line force dominates and the lift force is relatively smaller thirdly the cross sections of piers are simple ordinarily such as circular rectangular diamond round ended and taper end but the airfoil is composed of sophisticated curves or curved surfaces in real practice it s difficult and costly to build piers with sophisticated shapes further if these sophisticated curved surfaces are used in bridge pier cracks around the sharp corners of the curved surfaces would generate due to the stress concentration because the bridge piers are ordinarily made of concrete which is a kind of brittle hard material therefore it s necessary to study the optimization of bridge pier shape from the combination of the simple shapes already being at present however it cannot be denied that with the development of construction technique and with the reduction of the construction cost those complicated curved surface would be used in the bridge pier design in the future in this study the bridge piers standing in the estuaries of rivers are studied these bridge piers suffer higher risk of damage from tsunami bores propagating inland than that from floods flowing into ocean the characteristics and generation mechanisms of tsunami forces on upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces of regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers are compared and studied elaborately considering the upstream surface of diamond pier is able to reduce the impinging force on the upstream surface and the downstream surface of circular pier is able to increase the negative tsunami force on the downstream surface which ultimately can reduce the entire tsunami force on pier a new type pier is developed by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and downstream surface of the circular pier together further among the new type piers n60 is proved to be the best to reduce tsunami force the new kind of pier proposed in this study is novel it is composed of the simple shapes and could be constructed with regular building material by using regular construction techniques in real practice 2 numerical model and validation 2 1 basic equations a well established finite volume commercial software named ansys fluent is used to calculate the

into v i v i v i v i is the velocity fluctuation p is time averaged pressure ρ is the density of fluid and μ is the dynamic viscosity the computational domain consists of water and air and vof method is employed to trace the water surface height as dam break bore will deform and break intensively during their generation and propagation progress especially when interacting with piers so rgn k ε

are dynamic viscosity and density of fluid respectively the size of the most inner cell d s is twice of z and y is set as 30 in this study 2 2 validation of the numerical model the physical experimental data of arnason et al 2009 is used to validate the numerical model in this study in detail the tank used in the experiment is of 16 6 m length 0 6 m width and 0 45 m height the gate is 5 9 m from the upstream end wall and the experimental model column was placed 5 2 m downstream of the gate shown in fig 1 a the gate was lifted by a pneumatic pump within 0 2 s which is less than the criteria proposed by lauber and hager 1998 indicating that the gate was removed quickly enough and the influence of the gate to the break bore can be ignored a numerical water flume dam break flume and bridge pier model column with exactly the same dimensions with that of the physical experiment were built shown in fig 1 b and the physical experimental case with impounding water depth 0 25 m the downstream initial water depth 0 02 m and the diameter of the column 0 14 m was used to validate the numerical model with the case sharing the same parameters however there is no gate in the numerical model and the impounding water begins to fall at the beginning i e at t 0 more detailed introduction about the experiment please refer to arnason et al 2009 ansys icem is employed to generate grids and the grid independence was verified by generating three different kind of mesh size case i e the coarse middle and fine mesh cases the specific parameters of the three mesh cases are shown in table 1 the sketch of the numerical water flume and bridge pier as well as the middle size meshes around the pier are shown in fig 1 b in the numerical model the flume bottom the left right upstream and downstream sidewalls of flume as well as the surface of the pier are set as stationary wall boundary conditions i e the wall boundaries themselves are stationary and on the wall boundaries the flow velocity in the normal direction is zero and the top of the flume is set as pressure outlet boundary condition the densities of water and air are set as 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and their dynamic viscosities are set as 1 003 10 3 kg m s and 1 7894 10 5 kg m s respectively the gravitational acceleration is set as 9 81 m s 2 a monitoring point p with the coordinates x 11 1 m y 0 3 m z 0 046 m is set to monitor the water depth and velocity which are then compared with that of experimental values by arnason et al 2009 as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively results show both the middle mesh and the fine mesh cases are capable of predicating water depth and velocity very well when compared with the physical experimental values however the water depth and velocity predicted by coarse mesh case deviate from that of physical experiment values obviously further the tsunami forces in line force only on bridge pier obtained by the physical experiment and numerical simulation are compared in fig 4 which shows tsunami forces estimated by the middle and the fine mesh cases agree considerably well with the experimental values by arnason et al 2009 and the accuracy of the coarse mesh case is relatively poorer generally the middle and the fine mesh cases not only predict the flow field i e water depth and velocity very well but also predict the tsunami force considerably well considering the fine mesh case consumes at least twice cpu time of the middle mesh case therefore the middle size mesh generation scheme will be used in this study and above validation also implies that the turbulence model boundary conditions and relating parameter settings etc in ansys fluent are correct and can be used with confidence in the following simulations 3 case introduction the ordinary size of piers in real practice is 1 m 3 m and the piers with size 2 m are selected as prototypes in order to compare with the physical experimental data scheduled to conduct in the near future a scale ratio 1 50 length ratio is used to scale down the prototype piers namely the size of the model piers is d 4 cm altogether three regular piers i e square circular and diamond piers the angle α between the two upstream plane surface is 75 are modeled and shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively in which the solid lines represent the upstream surfaces and the dashed lines represent the downstream surfaces and the angles of the four special points on the surfaces of the piers are also defined as shown in fig 5 i e the left point 0 360 the stagnation point 90 the right point 180 and the rear point 270 note that the scale effect is inevitable when the tsunami forces on the scaled down model are scaled up in this study the scale effect is assumed to affect the tsunami forces on piers equally namely the scale effect does not change the order of tsunami force amplitudes of the piers the exact influence of scale effect requires further elaborate investigation in future the case in this study is named as h h 0 in which h h 2 h 0 indicates incoming bore height and h 0 indicates downstream initial water depth h 2 is incoming wave height relative to flume bottom as shown in fig 6 for each pier three cases are conducted i e the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 in these cases h 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm respectively representing the 2 m 3m and 4 m incoming wave height in real practice while h 0 2 cm representing the 1 m initial water depth in real practice in fig 6 h 1 is the impounding water depth and h is the distance of a point on cylinder surface to the flume bottom wei et al 2015 studied the influence of block effect on tsunami force on bridge pier numerically results show that when the flume width is larger than 7 5 times of the side length of the square pier the block effect can be ignored in this study the flume width is set as 8 times of the width of the upstream surfaces of the piers specifically speaking the flume width is 0 32 m because the width of the upstream surfaces of the piers is 0 04 m therefore the numerical water flume is set as 17 m long 0 32 m wide and 0 45 m deep the length of flume of impounding water is 6 m and all the most front points stagnation points of piers are placed at the same position i e 12 m from the upstream sidewall of the flume as shown in fig 6 when a tsunami bore impacts the downstream sidewall of the flume it will be reflected and flow upstream before the reflected bore arrives at the pier model the computation stops because the reflected bore and the resulting force are not concerned in this study 4 characteristics and generation mechanisms of tsunami forces on the regular piers as representatives the tsunami force characteristics and generation mechanisms of the regular piers i e the square circular and diamond piers in the case 4 2 will be analyzed elaborately the in line tsunami forces f on the entire surface or on the upstream surface or on the downstream surface are nondimensionalized as tsunami force coefficients c f f 0 5 ρ h 2 d u 2 in which ρ h 2 d and u are the density of water the submerged depth of pier the width of the pier perpendicular to the tsunami bore and the depth averaged velocity of the tsunami bore respectively note that the tsunami force mentioned in this study is the in line force acting on piers also called drag force in some references and the tsunami force perpendicular to the flow direction also called lift force in some reference is extremely small and not studied here but will be briefly discussed later the comparison of the tsunami force coefficients for the entire surfaces the upstream surfaces and the downstream surfaces between the three regular piers are shown in fig 7 before the tsunami bore arrives at the upstream surfaces of piers i e t t 0 the entire tsunami forces on piers are basically zero so c f of the entire surface is zero as shown in fig 7 because both the upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces suffer static pressure of the initial water which results in tsunami forces on upstream and downstream surfaces with the same amplitudes but opposite directions i e c f of the upstream surfaces is positive and c f of the downstream surface is negative when t 0 t t 1 the impinging forces on upstream surfaces increase sharply but the negative forces on downstream surfaces is almost unchanged because downstream surfaces only suffer static pressure of initial water therefore c f of the upstream surfaces increases sharply c f of the downstream surfaces changes slightly and c f of the entire tsunami force increases also sharply but relatively slower than that of the upstream surfaces the runups of tsunami bores around the three regular piers at t 5 64 s are shown in fig 8 further the runup heights on the upstream surfaces of the three regular piers are compared quantitatively in fig 9 in figs 8 and 9 the runups at the upstream surfaces of the rectangular pier and the diamond pier respectively are the largest and smallest this is mainly because the upstream surface of square pier is completely perpendicular to the propagation direction of tsunami bore the normal of upstream surface is opposite to propagation direction of tsunami playing a great blocking effect to tsunami bore which should be responsible for the largest runup and impinging pressure on upstream surfaces for the circular pier only the normal of the stagnation point the most upstream point i e the point at θ 90 is opposite to flow direction then the normal of the upstream surface gradually becomes perpendicular to the flow direction at the left side the point at θ 0 and the right side the point at θ 180 of the circular pier where the tsunami bore can flow forward almost without blocking effect therefore for the circular pier the runup at the stagnation point is the highest and gradually decreases when θ decreases to 0 on the left upstream surface and when θ increases to 180 on the right upstream surface as shown in fig 8 b and in fig 9 as to the diamond pier only the normal at stagnation point of the upstream surfaces θ 90 is opposite to the flow direction and the normal downstream the stagnation point is inclined to the flow direction playing weak blocking effect to the tsunami bore than that of the circular pier therefore the runup at the stagnation point of the diamond pier is lower than that of the circular pier however the runup decreases from the stagnation point firstly and then gradually increases on the upstream surface because the normal of the upstream surface keeps unchanged and the blocking effect accumulates along the upstream surface gradually as shown in fig 8 c and in fig 9 the tsunami force on upstream surfaces f u can be calculated as f u p cos β d s in which p is the total pressure on the micro face d s β is the angle between direction of pressure p and propagation direction of tsunami bore for the square pier the pressure direction is the same as the propagation direction of the tsunami bore i e β 0 and cos β 1 integral of p on the upstream surface of the square cylinder completely contributes to the in line tsunami force for the circular pier the angle between the pressure direction and tsunami bore propagation direction changes from 0 at the stagnation point to 90 at the left and right sides of the surface namely 0 β 90 the y component of the force on the left upstream surface cancels out that on the right upstream surface for the diamond pier the angle between the pressure direction and the tsunami bore propagation direction is about 53 the y components of the forces on the left upstream surface and the right upstream surface also cancel each other out fig 10 shows the comparison of the total pressure distribution on the perimeters between the three regular piers at t 5 64 s it can be observed that among the three regular piers the total pressure on the upstream surface of the square cylinder is the largest almost at any height and the total pressure on the diamond pier is generally the smallest which agrees with the runup height of tsunami bore on the upstream surface considering the influences of both β and p the tsunami force on the square pier is the largest when t 0 t t 1 because both cos β and p are the largest among the three regular piers and the tsunami force on the diamond pier is the smallest because of the smallest p and relative smaller value of cos β further the increasing rate of the coefficient of the tsunami force on the diamond pier is smaller than the other two piers when t 0 t t 1 as shown in fig 7 indicating a slower and smoother increase of impinging force on the diamond pier generally before the tsunami flow impinges the downstream surface of the pier tsunami force coefficient on the diamond pier is the smallest and also with a smallest increasing rate therefore among the three regular piers the diamond pier is the best for depressing tsunami force in this stage when t t 1 the runups on the upstream surfaces of the three piers continue to increase slowly and the tsunami forces on the upstream surfaces increase slowly and smoothly too the tsunami bore has already flowed around the upstream surfaces and begin to run up on the downstream surfaces therefore the tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces begin to increase gradually as shown in fig 7 because of the difference between the upstream surfaces of the three regular piers the two branches of the flow split by the upstream surface of the pier runs up at different height on the downstream surfaces which results in different tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces for the circular pier the normals at the intersection points the points at θ 0 and 180 between the upstream and the downstream surfaces are perpendicular to flow direction providing a smooth and continuous normal transition from the upstream to the downstream surfaces which is extremely beneficial for the tsunami bore branches to flow along the downstream surface then to converge at the rear point the point at θ 270 of the pier than the diamond and the square piers as shown in fig 11 b comparison between fig 11 a b and c indicates the runup height on the downstream surface of the circular pier is larger than that of the square and diamond piers qualitatively further the runup heights on the downstream surfaces of the circular square and diamond piers are compared quantitatively and shown in fig 12 which agrees with the comparison results obtained in fig 11 correspondingly the total pressure on the downstream surfaces of the circular pier is the largest as shown in fig 13 in which the total pressure distribution on the perimeters of the three regular piers at t 5 7 s are compared therefore the negative tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces of the circular pier increases quickly results in an obvious decrease of the entire tsunami force coefficient and ultimately makes the entire tsunami force coefficient on the circular pier to be the smallest when t t 1 as shown in fig 7 note that the direction of tsunami force on the downstream surfaces is opposite to the tsunami bore propagation direction generally the runups on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have no obvious difference but obviously lower than that of the circular pier as shown in fig 12 consequently the total pressures on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have less difference but smaller than that on the circular pier as shown in fig 13 but the tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces of the square and diamond piers have obvious difference because of β the angle between the pressure direction on downstream surface and tsunami bore propagation direction i e cos β for the square pier is larger than that of the diamond pier so tsunami force coefficient of the downstream surface of the diamond pier is almost stable when t 1 t 5 8 s but it increases obviously for the square pier as shown in fig 7 noting that the tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surfaces of the square pier is still far larger than that of the diamond and circular piers in this period therefore the entire tsunami force coefficient on the square pier is the largest generally the shape of the downstream surface of the circular pier namely semi circle is most beneficial for the reattachment of the tsunami bore than the diamond and square piers which can provide the largest negative tsunami force on the downstream surface to cancel out the positive tsunami force on the upstream surface finally making entire tsunami force as well as entire tsunami force coefficient to be the smallest among the three piers in fact when the incoming bore height increases i e in the cases 6 2 and 8 2 the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of circular pier show similar advantages of reducing entire tsunami bore force as they behave in the case 4 2 so analysis on the cases 6 2 and 8 2 is omitted here for brevity 5 analysis of tsunami force on the new type pier 5 1 design of the new type pier through analysis of characteristics and generation mechanism of tsunami forces on the three regular piers we obtained conclusion that the diamond and circular piers have advantages in reducing tsunami force in the periods respectively before and after tsunami bore runs up on the downstream surfaces of the piers based on which a new type pier can be made up by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of the circular pier as shown in fig 14 note that the upstream line segments are tangential to the arc the angle of upstream plane surfaces α is expected to influence tsunami force on the new type pier therefore three piers of new type named as n60 n75 and n90 with α 60 75 and 90 respectively are investigated in this section the piers with even smaller α values are not involved because the sharp edge of concrete pier is prone to crack due to the concentration of stresses also the tip shaped pier with angle smaller than 60 is rarely constructed in real practice as in the previous section the downstream initial water depth keeps as 2 cm and the incoming tsunami bore height is also set as 4 cm 6 cm and 8 cm 5 2 validation of the mitigation effect of the new type piers among the regular piers discussed in the section 4 approximately the circular pier has smallest tsunami force coefficient as shown in fig 7 that s may be one of reason why the circular piers are most widely used in river bridges the circular pier will be employed to compare with the new type piers to validate the advantages of the new type piers in reducing tsunami force just as shown in fig 15 in which the entire tsunami force f e is also nondimensionalized as the entire tsunami force coefficient c fe it can be observed that generally the new type piers have smaller tsunami force coefficients in the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 no matter during the impinging stage or after the impinging stage further the tsunami force coefficient increases with α i e c n 60 fe c n 75 fe c n 90 fe and c n 60 fe is remarkably smaller than c n 75 fe and c n 90 fe when the tsunami bore height increases for example in the case 8 2 see fig 15 c in other words n60 pier is the best of all to reduce tsunami force in order to analyze the mitigation of tsunami force coefficient of the new type piers quantitatively two variables are defined as m 100 c f e m a x c c f e m a x n c f e m a x c n 100 c f e a v e c c f e a v e n c f e a v e c in which m is the tsunami force coefficient decreasing rate in the impinging stage i e t 0 t t 2 in which t 0 is the instant when the tsunami bore arrives at the upstream surfaces and t 2 is the instant when the tsunami bore front leaves the piers t 2 is marked in fig 15 c f e m a x c and c f e m a x n are the maximum tsunami force coefficients of the circular pier and the new type piers respectively in the impinging stage n is the tsunami force coefficient decreasing rate during the quasi stable stage c f e a v e c and c f e a v e n are the time averaged tsunami force coefficients of the circular and new type piers respectively in the quasi stable stage the description of the quasi stable stage can refer to the studies by yang et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 in this stage the tsunami force almost keeps stable and the time intervals of the quasi stable stages for the cases 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 could be estimated approximately as 7 10 s 6 9 s and 5 8 s respectively as shown in fig 15 note that the tsunami force time histories generated by the reflected bore from the downstream sidewall of the flume are not drawn in fig 15 the m and n values in each case as well as the maximum value c f e m a x of the tsunami force during the impinging stage and the averaged value c f e a v e of the tsunami force in the quasi stable stage are listed in table 2 it can be observed that m is larger than n when the incoming bore height is smaller i e in the case 4 2 indicating the new type pier can mitigate the impinging force in the impinging stage more obviously than the averaged tsunami force in the quasi stable stage with increase of the incoming wave height i e in the cases 6 2 and 8 2 m is smaller than n indicating the new type piers can mitigate the averaged tsunami force even more than the impinging force also it can be observed that m and n increase with the decrease of α i e the new type pier n60 performs best of all to be more exact compared with the circular pier n60 can reduce the maximum impinging force coefficient 19 in the case 6 2 and can reduce the averaged tsunami force coefficient 42 1 in the quasi stable stage in the case 8 2 therefore the new type pier can effectively reduce the tsunami force coefficients and the smaller α the larger decreasing rate 5 3 mechanism analysis of the tsunami force mitigation on the new type pier the tsunami forces coefficients on the upstream surfaces and the downstream surfaces on the piers will be discussed respectively to investigate the mechanism of tsunami force mitigation comparison of tsunami force coefficient time histories of the upstream surfaces between the circular pier and the new type piers are shown in fig 16 in which the tsunami force coefficients of the upstream surfaces of the piers increase sharply in the impinging stage and increase gradually after the impinging stage compared with the circular pier decrease of the tsunami force coefficient of the upstream surfaces of the new type piers in the lower incoming bore height case i e in the case 4 2 in fig 16 a is smaller than that in the larger incoming bore height case i e the case 6 2 in fig 16 b especially in the case 8 2 the tsunami force coefficient of the upstream surface of n60 is considerably smaller than that of n75 n90 and the circular pier as shown in fig 16 c it can also be observed that the tsunami force coefficient difference between the new type piers increases with the increase of the incoming wave height among the three new type piers tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface of n60 is the smallest no matter in the impinging stage or after the impinging stage tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces of the circular and the new type piers are compared in fig 17 by comparing figs 16 and 17 it can be observed that in each case the tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface is larger than that on the downstream surface when the tsunami bore height is smaller i e in the case 4 2 the tsunami force coefficient difference on downstream surfaces of piers is not obvious with increase of the tsunami bore height i e in the case 6 2 the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surface of the circular pier is a little bit larger than that of the new type piers when 5 3 s t 8 3 s and in the case 8 2 the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surface of the circular pier is generally smaller than that of the new type piers therefore for the smaller bore height cases i e the cases 4 2 and 6 2 the upstream surfaces of the new type piers dominate the decreasing rate of entire tsunami force coefficient because the decrease of tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surfaces is much larger than tsunami force coefficient increase on the downstream surfaces for the larger bore height case i e the case 8 2 both the upstream and downstream surfaces dominate the decreasing rate of the entire tsunami force coefficient because both the tsunami force coefficient decrease on the upstream surfaces and tsunami force coefficient increase on the downstream surfaces are remarkable especially for n60 pier as shown in figs 16 c and fig 17 c respectively comparison between fig 17 a b and c shows the times history curves of tsunami force coefficients on downstream surfaces in the lower bore height cases i e the cases 4 2 and 6 2 are smoother than those in the larger bore height case i e the case 8 2 the fluctuations of time history curves of tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces in fig 17 c are responsible for the fluctuations of the entire tsunami bore forces in fig 15 c and the fluctuations in tsunami force coefficients on the downstream surfaces deserve further investigation when t t 2 for example t 6 725 s the runups of tsunami bores around the circular and the new type piers in the case 6 2 are qualitatively shown in fig 18 further the comparison of runup heights on the surfaces of the circular and the new type piers are quantitatively compared in fig 19 when α 60 runup at the stagnation point of n60 is the smallest among the four piers and the runup gradually increases to the maximum along the upstream surface and then decreases along the downstream surface as shown in fig 18 a and 19 when α 75 runup at the stagnation point of n75 becomes relatively larger and the runup increases to the maximum relatively more sharply as shown in fig 18 b and 19 when α 90 runup at the stagnation point of n90 is larger than that of n60 and n75 but smaller than that of circular pier and the runup sharply increases to the maximum just behind the stagnation point then decreases gradually along the upstream and downstream surfaces as shown in fig 18 c and 19 and runup at the stagnation point of circular pier is the largest and decreases along the upstream surface and downstream surface gradually compared with other piers the runup on the upstream surface of n60 is the lowest which is one of the reason responsible for the smallest tsunami force coefficient on the upstream surface fig 20 shows the vorticity contours on x y section plane at h 7 cm at t 6 725 s in the case 6 2 when the incoming tsunami bore height is smaller i e the case 6 2 the upstream surface generally has relatively weaker influence on the flow field however the difference of vorticity fields behind the piers caused by the difference of the upstream surfaces is still observed a relative obvious vortex generates behind the circular pier and the much weaker vortexes generate behind the new type piers among which vortex behind n60 is the weakest as shown in fig 20 these vortexes generate low pressure areas behind the piers as shown in fig 21 note that the reference pressure is set as the standard atmospheric pressure in this study therefore the pressure at and around the vortex core is negative indicating the pressure is slightly lower than the standard atmospheric pressure the magnitude of pressure is in reverse proportion to the vortex intensity i e the higher vortex intensity the lower pressure at the vortex center the low pressure area makes the total pressure at the position around θ 270 on the downstream surface lower than that of adjacent positions as shown in fig 22 c when the incoming bore height is small no obvious vortex shedding happens therefore no fluctuations of tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces are observed when the incoming bore height is larger i e the case 8 2 the runup of tsunami bore around the piers are similar as those when the incoming bore height is smaller i e the case 6 2 but the upstream surface will bring remarkable influence to the flow field behind the pier vorticity contours on x y section plane at h 7 cm at t 4 137 s in the case 8 2 are shown in fig 23 two relatively weaker vortexes symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis generate behind n60 as shown in fig 23 a which introduces two smaller low pressure areas behind the downstream surfaces as shown in fig 24 a the low pressure areas ultimately induces lower but positive pressure at the positions around θ 230 and 310 as shown in fig 25 c because these two weaker vortexes don t shed at present t 4 137 s therefore there are no obvious fluctuations in the tsunami force coefficient on the downstream surfaces of n60 as shown in fig 17 c however with the increase of α i e n75 pier the vortexes become stronger and begin to shed alternately as shown in fig 23 b which introduces two alternating negative pressure areas behind n75 as shown in fig 24 b therefore the total pressure at the position around θ 320 of the downstream surface of n75 is negative as shown in fig 25 c similarly two even stronger alternately shedding vortexes generate behind both n90 and circular piers as shown in fig 23 c and d respectively resulting in even larger and stronger negative pressure areas behind n90 and the circular piers as shown in fig 24 c and d respectively because at present t 4 137 s one vortex has not completely shed and another vortex has almost grown up two negative pressure areas with different intensity exert strong effect on downstream surface resulting negative pressure and low positive pressure generate around θ 315 and θ 225 respectively on n90 and negative pressure and low positive pressure generate around θ 225 and θ 315 respectively on the circular piers as shown in fig 25 c because these vortex are three dimensional and the induced negative pressure on downstream surface changes with height h for example at h 10 cm the total pressures at points around θ 225 and θ 315 are negative and with almost the same values as shown in fig 25 d fig 25 also demonstrates that the negative total pressure does not appear on the whole submerged depth of downstream surfaces for example it does not appear at h 1 cm 4 cm 12 cm and 14 cm because with the increase of submerged depth positive static pressure increases gradually but the influence of low pressure areas or negative pressure areas distributes non uniformly which makes total pressure to be negative at some specific heights only at t 4 55 s the vortexes behind n60 almost keep stable and there is no fluctuation in tsunami force coefficient on downstream surface but the vortexes behind n75 n90 and circular piers shed alternatively introducing fluctuation in tsunami force coefficient on downstream surfaces as shown in fig 17 c simultaneously the negative pressure on some positions of downstream surfaces of n75 n90 and circular piers generates suction forces in line with tsunami bore propagation direction resulting a smaller negative tsunami force coefficient on downstream surface as shown in fig 17 c and then larger entire tsunami force coefficient on n75 n90 and circular piers as shown in fig 15 c however with time goes on the vortex status behind the new type and circular piers may change because of the strongly turbulent flow near the downstream surfaces for example at t 7 0 s the vortexes behind n60 are shedding which makes tsunami force coefficient of n60 fluctuate at t 6 3 s and at t 7 7 s the vortexes behind n75 and n90 respectively almost stop shedding which makes the tsunami force coefficients of n75 and n90 almost stop fluctuating as shown in fig 17 c the negative pressure on n75 and n90 simultaneously becomes weaker so the negative force on the downstream surfaces of n75 and n90 increases the increase of negative force on downstream surfaces of n75 and n90 makes their entire forces slightly smaller or larger than that on n60 note that at t 6 3 s and t 7 7 s the positive force on the upstream surfaces of n60 is much smaller than that of n75 and n90 respectively therefore among the four piers the upstream surface of n60 is the best to generate weaker vortex or to delay the vortex shedding to generate larger and more stable negative force on the downstream surface which makes a great contribute to make the entire tsunami force coefficient on n60 to be the smallest 6 discussion 6 1 tsunami forces on the piers with same cross section area as we know the block effect influences the tsunami force on bridge pier significantly therefore the tsunami forces on the piers of different kinds used to compare the resistance ability to tsunami bore should be measured under the same block ratio i e the ratio of width of the upstream surface of pier to the flume width only one numerical flume of 17 m long 0 32 m wide and 0 45 m deep was built in this study so the widths of the upstream surfaces of the piers of different kinds were set the same i e d 4 cm then the piers of different kinds i e the square circular and diamond piers have different cross section areas as shown in tab 3 when the three piers have the same width the square pier has the largest cross section area and the diamond pier has the smallest cross section area when design a bridge pier in real practice the bearing capacity of pier is mainly determined by the cross section area in other words the same bearing capacity requires the same cross section area but not requires the same width of the pier whether the conclusions obtained in the section 4 are still viable requires further investigation assuming the three piers have the same cross section area i e s 0 0016 m 2 then the width of each pier d is calculated and listed in the last column in table 3 according to the tsunami force coefficients of the entire surface the upstream and downstream surfaces of each pier in fig 7 the entire tsunami force the tsunami forces on the upstream and downstream surfaces of each pier in the case 4 2 respectively can be calculated based on f 0 5 c f ρ h 2 d u 2 and shown in fig 26 fig 26 shows when t 0 t t 1 among the three piers the diamond pier has the smallest tsunami force on the upstream surface and therefore has smallest entire tsunami force noting that the three piers have almost the same tsunami forces on the downstream surfaces when t t 1 among the three piers the circular pier has the smallest tsunami force on the upstream surface and largest negative tsunami force on the downstream surface undoubtedly the circular pier has the smallest entire tsunami force the results obtained here comply with that obtained in fig 7 in the section 4 which also implies among the three piers with the same bearing capacity the combination of the diamond and circular pier is an innovation way to reduce tsunami force effectively the same doubt exits in the comparison in the section 5 in which the three new type piers are proven to be able to reduce tsunami force and n60 is proven to be the best of the three the cross section areas are listed in table 4 when the circular pier and the three new type piers have the same width i e d 0 04 m it could be observed that the n60 pier has the largest cross section area and the circular pier has the smallest cross section area it can be deduced that when these piers have the same cross section area n60 should have the smallest width and the circular pier should have the largest width assuming the piers having the same area s 0 001256 m 2 the widths d of the circular and the three new type piers are listed in the last column in table 4 which justifies the deduction similarly the tsunami forces on the upstream surfaces downstream surfaces and entire surfaces on the circular and the three new type piers can be calculated as f 0 5 c f ρ h 2 d u 2 and shown in fig 27 the comparisons of the tsunami forces between the circular and new type piers on the upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces are shown in fig 28 and fig 29 respectively generally figs 27 figs 28 and 29 respectively are similar as their corresponding figures of tsunami force coefficients i e figs 15 figs 16 and 17 therefore the discussion about their characteristics is omitted here for brevity the section 5 has proven that the tsunami force coefficient of the circular pier is larger than that of the new type piers and table 4 shows when they have the same cross section area the piers with widths from large to small are circular n90 n75 and n60 therefore the gaps between the tsunami force time history curves of the circular and new type piers are larger than that of the tsunami force coefficients straightforwardly when having the same cross section area n60 performs better in reducing tsunami force than n60 does when having the same width therefore when assuming the piers have the same cross section area i e the same bearing capacity in bridge design n60 is the best of the three new type piers in reducing the tsunami force 6 2 lift force basically the lift force the tsunami force perpendicular to the propagation direction of the tsunami bore on bridge pier is generated by the pressure difference between the left and right side surfaces of the pier the bridge piers are symmetric with the centerlines parallel with the tsunami bore propagation direction and the pressure difference is mainly resulted from the alternate vortex shedding the square pier is thought to generate vortex shedding easiest and most intensively among the piers involved in this study therefore the comparison of the drag force the in line tsunami force in this study and the lift force on the square pier is shown in fig 30 it shows that the peak value of the lift force is about 0 351 n which is less than 10 of the peak value of the drag force i e 5 839 n the lift force is thought to play extremely weak role in destroying the bridge piers therefore it is not discussed in this study however as to the slender cylinders suffering water flow with large velocity the lift force caused by alternate vortex shedding and the resulting vibration of the cylinder namely viv should receive close attentions 6 3 essence of problems the flow field of tsunami bore is characterized as a fast moving bore front and the relatively stable water flow behind these characteristics could be found in the water depth and velocity time histories as shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively in which when the tsunami bore front arrives the water depth increases suddenly and the velocity increase sharply to the peak value after the tsunami bore front leaves the water depth increases slowly and the velocity almost keeps constant the aim of the bridge pier optimization is to reduce the impinging force introduced by the tsunami bore front in the impinging stage and also to reduce the current force after the bore front past i e the quasi stable stage the ordinarily used streamline body for example a body with sphere shape head and tip end like a raindrop may not be valid to reduce the impinging force induced by tsunami bore front the impinging force is closely related to the upstream surface shape and the current force is related to both the shapes of upstream and downstream surfaces because the current force is determined by the pressure difference on upstream and downstream surfaces assuming water is inviscid and incompressible the bernoulli s equation i e eq 6 could be used to explain the essence of impinging force reduce on the upstream surface of the diamond pier approximately 6 p 1 2 ρ v 2 ρ g h 0 c o n s t a n t in which p is the pressure ρ is the density of water v is the velocity and h 0 is the elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration compared with the blunt body i e the square and circular piers in this study the sharp angle of the upstream surface of the diamond pier has smaller blockage and is able to allow tsunami bore flow around the pier fluently with larger velocity and the runup on the upstream surfaces is smaller as shown in fig 31 the upstream surface of the square pier is perpendicular to the tsunami bore direction and has larger blockage resulting larger runup and smaller velocity when flowing around the pier according to eq 6 the larger velocity in front of the upstream surface indicates the smaller pressure on the upstream surface also the smaller runup results in smaller static pressure therefore the total pressure on the upstream surface of the diamond pier is the smallest among the three piers as shown in fig 10 ordinarily the direction of the pressure on the blunt body surface has a smaller angle β with the flow direction for example the pressure direction on the upstream surface of the square pier is the same as the tsunami bore direction making the integration of pressure on the upstream surfaces generate larger force because of larger value of cos β vice versa the upstream surface of the diamond pier has larger angle between pressure direction and tsunami bore direction resulting smaller value of cos β and smaller force on the pier when the angle between the upstream plane surfaces is shaper i e α is smaller the smaller impinging force on the pier that s the reason why n60 is better than n75 and n90 in the quasi stable stage the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream surfaces dominate for the circular pier the surface normal changes continuously and smoothly from the upstream surface to the downstream surface which is much beneficial for body fitted flow i e beneficial for the two split tsunami bore branches flowing along the downstream surface and converging at the rear point therefore the runup on the downstream surface of the circular pier is larger and the resulting pressure is larger as shown in fig 32 which generates a larger negative force to makes the entire tsunami force smaller in the quasi stable stage in the new type piers the upstream plane surfaces are designed to be tangent with the arc to provide continuous and smooth transition of the surface normal which facilitates the development of the runup on the downstream surface 7 conclusions the surfaces of the regular piers i e the square circular and diamond piers are divided into upstream surfaces and downstream surfaces then the pressure tsunami force runup on the surfaces as well as flow fields around the piers are investigated elaborately to explore the generation mechanisms of tsunami force results show 1 before the tsunami bore runs up on the downstream surface the entire tsunami force is dominated by the tsunami force on the upstream surface because the downstream surface only suffers static pressure of the initial water during this period the upstream surface of diamond pier is most beneficial to reduce water blocking effect and to lower runup at the stagnation point which ultimately makes the entire tsunami force on diamond pier to be the smallest of all 2 after the tsunami bore runs up on downstream surface the entire tsunami force is dominated by both tsunami forces on upstream and downstream surfaces during this period the downstream surface of the circular pier is most beneficial for the two branches of tsunami bore flow back and run up on the downstream surface which generates larger negative tsunami force on the downstream surface sooner and ultimately makes entire tsunami force on the circular pier to be the smallest of all based on which a new type pier is invented by combining the upstream surface of the diamond pier and the downstream surface of the circular pier together then mitigation effect of the new type pier is further validated and the tsunami force mitigation mechanism is discussed results show 3 the new type piers can obviously reduce tsunami force 4 with the increase of incoming bore height the new type pier has better mitigation effect 5 with decrease of α angle between upstream plane surfaces the mitigation effect becomes better n60 is the best of the three new type piers 6 when the incoming wave height is small no obvious vortex sheds and tsunami force almost has no fluctuations when the incoming wave height is large vortexes shed alternatively and tsunami force has fluctuations vortexes generate low or negative pressure areas which induces lower or negative total pressure at some heights of the downstream surfaces and results in smaller negative forces and ultimately results in larger entire tsunami force on piers 7 among the circular pier and the three piers of new type n60 is the best to generate weaker vortex and to delay the vortex shedding to generate larger and more stable negative force on the downstream surface which makes a great contribute to make the entire tsunami force on n60 to be the smallest the new type pier proposed in this study is composed of the simple shapes i e plane and cylindrical surface which is convenient to be constructed using regular building materials and regular construction techniques at low construction cost in real practice credit authorship contribution statement wanli yang

21648,in this study the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines with imperfections subjected to external pressure are studied using finite element fe method first the fe model of the imperfect thick walled pipe is built and validated by experimental results from other publications then different collapse responses are obtained by using the validated fe model the collapse modes are analyzed and the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response is proposed the effects of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure are discussed finally a new collapse pressure formula which includes both the ovality and thickness variation is presented the comparisons of collapse pressures from the proposed formula fe model and dnvgl st f101 are performed it is found dnvgl st f101 underestimates the collapse pressure when the diameter to thickness ratio dtr is less than 20 in addition the errors of collapse pressures predicted by dnvgl st f101 are unstable while the proposed formula can provide a pretty well prediction of collapse pressure for thick walled subsea pipelines and the error is stable keywords collapse pressure collapse mode thick walled pipes ovality thickness eccentricity 1 introduction subsea pipelines are widely used in offshore oil and gas industry for transportation of the hydrocarbons with the depletion of the offshore hydrocarbons the development of deepwater oil and gas has become the frontier of hydrocarbon production nowadays this poses significant challenges for the design of subsea pipelines bruschi et al 2015 teixeira et al 2019 one of the challenges is collapse which occurs in a pipeline if the external pressure is larger than its critical pressure as a failure form collapse will not only produce enormous economic loss but also result in large catastrophe to the ocean environment and ecosystem system drumond et al 2018 therefore collapse is a key issue which should be considered in the design of thick walled subsea pipelines many literatures have been published in the past 40 years with regard to the collapse of pipes for thin walled pipes the collapse often occurs in the elastic range of the pipe material and it is also called local buckling timoshenko and gere 1961 proposed the critical pressure formula for perfect thin walled subsea pipelines subjected to external pressure 1 p e 2 e 1 ν 2 t d 0 3 where p e is the elastic buckling pressure e and v are the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio respectively d 0 and t are mean diameter and wall thickness of the pipe respectively yeh and kyriakides 1986 pointed out that the above formula overestimates the collapse pressure when the diameter to thickness ratio dtr is less than 35 they proved that the smaller the dtr the larger the deviation between the real collapse pressure and that calculated from eq 1 this discrepancy is caused by the fact that the collapse occurs in the plastic range of the pipe material for thick walled pipes therefore elastic assumption cannot be used for this situation the collapse pressure of a thick walled pipe is affected by many factors such as dtr initial geometrical imperfections kyriakides and babcock 1981 yeh and kyriakides 1986 1988 dyau and kyriakides 1993 corradi et al 2005 dvorkin and toscano 2014 material properties kyriakides and babcock 1981 verner et al 1985 yeh and kyriakides 1986 1988 the anisotropy of the yield stress he et al 2014 and residual stress induced by manufacturing process ju and kyriakides 1991 kyriakides et al 1994 estefen 1999 in addition some investigators found the collapse pressure is also associated with the combined loads of external pressure tension bending moment corona and kyriakides 1988 bai et al 1997 as well as the load path yu et al 2019 kyriakides and babcock 1981 proposed the 2 dimensional 2d ring model to analyze the large deflection collapse of an inelastic inextensional ring under external pressure using similar method yeh and kyriakides 1986 studied the collapse of thick walled pipes and found if the cross section parameters of a pipe are invariable along the pipe axis the collapse of the pipe subjected to external pressure can be simplified as the collapse of a ring by line load normal to its surface thereafter many theoretical studies on the collapse of subsea pipelines were based on the 2d ring model fatt 1999 vasilikis and karamanos 2009 xue and fatt 2002 2005 yan et al 2015 one limitation of the above theoretical method is that it is not easy to build a theoretical model for the collapse of thick walled pipes considering all the factors mentioned above with the development of computer hardware the finite element fe method has been commonly used to study the collapse of defected thick walled pipes ong et al 1992 studied the collapse failure of a pipe with local dents by fe method and experimental tests and found fe method is suitable to analyze the collapse response of the imperfect subsea pipelines netto 2009 2010 studied the collapse of pipes with corrosion defects by fe analysis and experimental tests and proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of a pipe with narrow and long corrosion defects yan et al 2016 studied the collapse of the partly corroded pipe using fe method and 2d ring model fan et al 2017 investigated the effect of axial length parameters of ovality on the collapse pressure and proposed a formula to assess their influences on the collapse pressure of subsea pipelines wang et al 2018 studied the collapse pressure of random corroded pipes using 3 dimensional 3d nonlinear fe models the standard dnv os f101 2012 provides a formula to determine the collapse pressure of a subsea pipeline under external pressure which is on the basis of the method originally proposed by haagsma and schaap 1981 the formula is 2 p c p e p c 2 p p 2 p c p e p p f 0 d t 3 p p 2 σ y t d 4 f 0 d max d min d where p c is the collapse pressure d is the outer diameter of the pipeline p p is the plastic resistance capacity which is calculated from eq 3 f 0 denotes the ovality of a pipe which is calculated from eq 4 and σ y denotes the yield stress the standard dnv os f101 2012 is now replaced by the new standard dnvgl st f101 2017 but the above formula is not changed although the above formula is used for designing offshore pipelines some researchers kyriakides and corona 2007 he et al 2014 bruschi et al 2015 found it cannot precisely predict the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines especially for those with small dtr he et al 2014 proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines the dtr ovality elastic plastic material properties yield stress anisotropy are considered in their formula while the wall thickness variation is not considered however the ovality and thickness variation coexist and interact in practical engineering kyriakides and corona 2007 the formula to determine the collapse pressure of a thick walled subsea pipeline including both ovality and wall thickness variation has not been reported yet in addition the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the wall thickness variation affecting the collapse response is not clear this paper studied the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines by using fe method the ovality the thickness eccentricity and the orientation of thickness eccentricity are all considered in the fe analyses different collapse modes are obtained and discussed the mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse mode is proposed based on the work of he et al 2014 the collapse pressure formula which includes both the ovality and thickness variation parameters is proposed for thick walled subsea pipelines subjected to external pressure the proposed formula shows a pretty good accuracy 2 numerical model 2 1 fe model a thick walled pipe with length of 2l was considered only half of the pipe was selected because of the symmetry of the pipe as shown in fig 1 fe models were developed within the framework of the nonlinear fe code abaqus abaqus 2014 the geometrical parameters of the pipe analyzed by netto et al 2007 were used as shown in table 1 according to the collapse experimental tests yeh and kyriakides 1986 kyriakides et al 1984 and numerical simulations sakakibara et al 2008 bastola et al 2014 the pipe length does not affect the accuracy of the collapse pressure if it is greater than ten times the pipe diameter in the proposed fe model the half length of the pipe l was taken ten times the pipe diameter the pipe was modeled by eight node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r according to the mesh sensitivity analyses from netto et al 2007 4 uniform elements in the thick direction 60 uniform elements in the hoop direction and 50 uniform elements in the longitudinal direction are enough to get a relatively accurate result therefore the pipe was discretized by 12000 elements totally to show the deformation of the pipe in the collapse response set four points a b c and d at top bottom left and right of the outer diameter in the plane of z l respectively as shown in fig 2 symmetry boundary conditions were applied at one end plane z l while fixed boundary conditions were applied at the other end plane z 0 before loading the cross section of the pipe has initial geometrical imperfections in the forms of ovality and wall thickness variation they were all introduced to the present fe model as shown in fig 3 the ovality is defined as yeh and kyriakides 1986 verner et al 1985 he et al 2014 netto et al 2007 5 δ 0 d max d min d max d min where δ 0 is the ovality d max and d min are the maximum and the minimum outer diameters of the pipe respectively see fig 3 a although the ovalities in different sections along the axial direction of the pipe are usually different fan et al 2017 it was assumed that the ovality is a uniform constant over the length of the pipe in this study to simplify the problem the same assumption was also made by park and kyriakides 1996 and sakakibara et al 2008 the ovality was modeled as radial deformation of a localized buckling mode from intact pipe it is written as dyau and kyriakides 1993 6 w 0 δ 0 r cos 2 θ where w 0 is the radial displacement taking the outward direction as positive r is the mean radius of the circle and θ is polar angle as shown in fig 4 a it can be seen that the ovality of the pipe can be modeled by an ellipse with the semi major axis of r 1 δ 0 and the semi minor axis of r 1 δ 0 respectively the mean radius of the ellipse r θ can be expressed as 7 r θ r 1 δ 0 cos 2 θ the wall thickness variation was represented by thickness eccentricity of the pipe see fig 3 b which is defined as yeh and kyriakides 1986 netto et al 2007 8 ξ t max t min t max t min where ξ denotes the thickness eccentricity and t max and t min are the maximum and the minimum wall thicknesses respectively according to kyriakides and corona 2007 the wall thickness variations often do not change significantly over a length of ten times the pipe diameter therefore the thickness eccentricity was assumed to be a uniform constant over the length of the pipe and the thickness eccentricity model proposed by yeh and kyriakides 1986 was used in this study the variation of the wall thickness in y direction can be expressed as 9 t θ t 1 δ 0 t sin θ where t θ is the wall thickness of the pipe in radial direction and δ 0 is the thickness variation parameter as shown in fig 4 b in this case the wall thickness variation parameter δ 0 and the thickness eccentricity follow the following relationship 10 δ 0 ξ t therefore the thickness eccentricity was implemented by modeling the pipe s cross section as two non concentric circles with the distance of δ 0 between them to analyze the effect of the thickness eccentricity orientation on the collapse response two types of combinations for the ovality and the thickness eccentricity with constant ovality orientation in horizontal direction were considered in this study as shown in fig 5 one is that the largest thickness variation coincides with the minor axis of the ellipse which is called the thickness eccentricity in y direction tey as shown in fig 5 a the other is that the largest thickness variation coincides with the major axis of the ellipse which is called the thickness eccentricity in x direction tex as shown in fig 5 b the ovality is varied from 0 01 to 1 while the thickness eccentricity is varied from 0 to 50 it was assumed that the pipe material follows elastic plastic model and the plastic material behavior follows j2 flow theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening ramberg osgood model was used to represent the stress strain response which is expressed as park and kyriakides 1996 11 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ y n 1 where ε and σ are the strain and stress respectively n is the hardening parameter two steps were used to analyze the model in the first step a small external pressure of 100pa was applied on the outside of the pipe to get an initial balance in the second step the external pressure of 100 mpa was applied on the pipe collapse would occur in this step because the collapse response of the thick walled pipe is an unstable nonlinear problem riks method modified arc length method was used here to follow the loading history zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 it must be noted that a self contact should be built in the internal surface of the pipe to avoid passing through in late stage of the collapse 2 2 validation of the fe model the experimental tests carried out by netto et al 2007 and kyriakides and corona 2007 were used to validate the proposed fe models in netto s small scale experimental tests they performed collapse pressure tests for eleven steel specimens including one intact pipe and ten pipes with induced defects the intact steel pipe was selected to compare with the fe model the material for the intact steel pipe is aisi 1020 the geometrical and material parameters for the intact steel pipe are listed in the first group no 1 in table 2 kyriakides and corona 2007 conducted collapse pressure tests for thirteen specimens among them four groups of pipes with the yield stress anisotropy of 1 0 were selected for comparison with the proposed fe models the geometrical and material parameters for the four specimens are also listed in table 2 they are numbered from no 2 to 5 the materials for test specimens from no 2 to 4 and no 5 are ss 304 steel and x65 steel respectively the collapse pressures from netto et al 2007 kyriakides and corona 2007 and the present fe models are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from the present fe models agree well with those obtained from netto et al 2007 and kyriakides and corona 2007 the absolute differences between the fe models and the experimental tests are no more than 1 48 mpa and the relative differences between them are no more than 4 27 this shows the accuracy of the present fe model 3 results and discussions the collapse responses of the pipes were successfully analyzed using the proposed fe models the collapse mode and collapse pressure are analyzed as follows 3 1 collapse mode fig 6 shows a typical collapse response which corresponds to the pipe with δ0 0 01 and ξ 0 fig 6 a shows the contours for the stress and deformation of the pipe right after collapse the middle and final stages of the pipe after collapse are shown in fig 6 b and c respectively fig 6 d shows the curves of pressure versus displacement in y direction for the marked points a and b the plateau in fig 6 d is collapse pressure which corresponds to fig 6 a the typical collapse response agrees well with the results from palmer and martin 1975 dyau and kyriakides 1993 netto et al 2007 from fig 6 it is obvious that when the collapse occurs the maximum stress 312 3 mpa has exceeded the yield stress 287 mpa therefore the collapse occurs in plastic range of the pipe material because of the ovality effect the top and bottom of the pipe move toward the pipe center and the left and right move away from the pipe center under external pressure finally the top touches the bottom of the pipe the final configuration of the pipe is symmetrical about both the x axis and y axis this collapse mode is called mode in this study for the pipe with tey when the ovality is small and the thickness eccentricity is large for instance δ0 0 01 and ξ 20 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 7 the collapse response in this configuration is quite different from the typical collapse response after collapse the top moves largely while the bottom almost does not move under the same external pressure as shown in fig 7 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the y axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the x axis as shown in fig 7 c this is called mode u for this type in this study the collapse process is clearly shown by the pressure versus displacement curves see fig 7 d this mode is caused by the combination of weak ovality effect and strong thickness eccentricity effect for the pipe with tey when the ovality is large and the thickness eccentricity is small for instance δ0 1 and ξ 10 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 8 this collapse response in this configuration is similar to the typical collapse response the difference between them is that after collapse the top moves a larger displacement while the bottom moves a smaller displacement for this configuration as shown in fig 8 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the y axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the x axis as shown in fig 8 c fig 8 d clearly shows the collapse process by the pressure versus displacement curves for marked points a and b this mode is also called mode in this study and it is clear that this mode is resulted from the combination of strong ovality effect and weak thickness eccentricity effect for the pipe with tex when the ovality is small and the thickness eccentricity is large for example δ0 0 01 and ξ 20 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 9 it is observed that the location of the maximum stress is at the rightmost point d of the pipe right after collapse as shown in fig 9 a it is different from the case with tey the right of the pipe moves a large distance in x direction while the left almost does not move under the same external pressure as shown in fig 9 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the x axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the y axis as shown in fig 9 c the collapse process is clearly shown by the pressure versus displacement curves for the marked points c and d see fig 9 d this collapse mode is called mode c in this study it is clear that the mode c is the combination of weak ovality effect strong thickness eccentricity effect and the thickness eccentricity orientation for the pipe with tex when the ovality is large and the thickness eccentricity is small for instance δ0 1 and ξ 10 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 10 different from the above case after collapse both the left and right move a large distance the collapse configuration of the pipe in middle stage looks like a pear as shown in fig 10 b finally the top portion touches the bottom portion the displacement of the rightmost point d is larger than that of the leftmost point c of the pipe as shown in fig 10 d the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the x axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the y axis as shown in fig 10 c this collapse mode is called mode p in this study the mode p is caused by the combination of strong ovality effect weak thickness eccentricity effect and thickness eccentricity orientation to reveal the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response the collapse modes for pipes with tey and tex are listed in table 3 fig 11 illustrates the collapse mode distribution for the pipes with tey to clearly show the boundary analyses are carried out on additional 27 fe models with thickness eccentricity of 13 14 and 15 fig 12 shows the collapse mode distribution for the pipes with tex in figs 11 and 12 every grid point corresponds to a mode of the pipe with the specific combination of the ovality and thickness eccentricity the red circle represents the mode u fig 11 or c fig 12 and the blue box represents the mode fig 11 or p fig 12 from the above analysis it can be seen that the ovality effect is to make the pipe flat the final collapse configuration is mode or p while the thickness eccentricity effect is to make the pipe settlement the final collapse configuration is mode u or c for a pipe with an arbitrary combination of ovality and thickness eccentricity the ovality and thickness eccentricity interact against each other the final collapse configuration depends on their values from fig 11 or 12 it can be seen that the region meshed by ovality and thickness eccentricity is divided into two parts by a distinct boundary curve in the left region the ovality effect is predominant and the final collapse configuration is mode or p on the contrary the thickness eccentricity effect is predominant in the right region and the final collapse configuration is mode u or c the boundary curve means the ovality effect is basically identical to the thickness eccentricity effect for the pipes with tey and tex the boundary curves can be roughly expressed as ξ 0 14 and δ0 0 0045ξ 0 00035 0 respectively in summary there exists a boundary curve in the eccentricity ovality plane that divides the region into two parts the final collapse mode is dominated by ovality in one part and it is dominated by thickness eccentricity in the other part 3 2 collapse pressure the collapse pressures of the pipes with tey are listed in table 4 fig 13 shows the collapse pressure versus the ovality curves for the pipes with different thickness eccentricities it is observed that the collapse pressure decreases as the ovality rises a smaller ovality corresponds to a larger collapse pressure meanwhile a smaller thickness eccentricity corresponds to a larger collapses pressure drop when the ovality varies for instance when the thickness eccentricities are 5 and 50 the collapse pressures drop 8 48 mpa and 3 44 mpa as the ovality increases from 0 01 to 1 respectively this implies that when the thickness eccentricity is small the collapse pressure is strongly influenced by the ovality fig 14 presents the collapse pressure versus the thickness eccentricity in y direction curves for the pipes with different ovalities it can be seen that the collapse pressure decreases as the thickness eccentricity rises a smaller thickness eccentricity corresponds to a larger collapse pressure meanwhile a smaller ovality corresponds to a larger collapses pressure drop when thickness eccentricity changes for instance when the ovalities are 0 01 and 1 the collapse pressures drop 19 11 mpa and 13 8 mpa as the thickness eccentricity changes from 0 to 50 respectively this implies that when ovality is small the thickness eccentricity has an obvious influence on the collapse pressure comparing figs 14 and 13 it can be seen that the rate of change of collapse pressure with respect to ovality defined as δ p c δ δ 0 is much larger than that with respect to thickness eccentricity defined as δ p c δ ξ for instance when the thickness eccentricity equals 0 and the ovality changes from 0 5 to 1 δ δ 0 0 5 the change of collapse pressure δ p c 1 is 3 73 mpa and the rate of change of collapse pressure with respect to ovality is 746 00 when the ovality keeps 0 5 and the thickness eccentricity varies from 0 to 20 δ δ 0 20 the change of collapse pressure δ p c 2 is 3 65 mpa which is quite close to δ p c 1 and the change rate of collapse pressure with respect to eccentricity is 18 25 therefore compared with ovality the influence of thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure of a pipe is much less however the value of thickness eccentricity is often much larger than the ovality in practical engineering so it still needs to develop a collapse pressure formula which includes the ovality and the thickness eccentricity including the orientation first of all the effect of the orientation of the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure should be discussed the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex are also listed in table 4 figs 15 and 16 show the collapse pressure versus ovality curves and the collapse pressure versus thickness eccentricity curves for the pipes with tex dashed line respectively for comparison the collapse pressure versus ovality curves and the collapse pressure versus thickness eccentricity curves for the pipes with tey solid line are also plotted in figs 15 and 16 respectively it is observed that the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex are all slightly larger than those with tey under the same combination of ovality and thickness eccentricity the pipes with tey and tex are the worst and the best cases respectively therefore the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex and tey form the upper and lower limits of the collapse pressure for the pipe with the thickness eccentricity in arbitrary direction table 5 lists the difference between the collapse pressure of the pipe with tex and that with tey it can be seen that the maximum difference between them is 1 25 mpa this result is in agreement with similar observations made by yeh and kyriakides 1986 the influence of the orientation of the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure of a pipe is very limited in other words the orientation of the thickness eccentricity is not critical and can be neglected it is enough to consider the worst case tey in the design of thick walled subsea pipelines to develop a relationship between the collapse pressure and the thickness eccentricity and ovality the collapse pressure of a pipe with both eccentricity and ovality p ceo is normalized by the collapse pressure of the pipe without eccentricity p co with assuming y direction as critical direction table 6 lists the normalized collapse pressures for the pipes with ovality from 0 01 to 1 and eccentricity from 0 to 50 fig 17 presents the normalized collapse pressure versus the thickness eccentricity curves to clearly show the data points fig 17 only shows curves for the pipes with ovality 0 01 0 1 and 1 the curves corresponding to ovality 0 01 and 1 form the lower and upper boundaries of the normalized collapse pressure it can be seen that the collapse pressure reduced by 0 5 1 for ξ 0 5 it reduced by 2 1 3 8 for ξ 0 10 by 8 2 12 1 for ξ 0 20 by 21 9 17 0 for ξ 0 30 by 32 6 27 5 for ξ 0 40 and by 43 3 39 0 for ξ 0 50 it is obvious that the normalized collapse pressure is a function of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity from fig 17 it is found that if the ovality is fixed power model is available to express the relationship between the normalized collapse pressure and the thickness eccentricity from data analysis the normalized collapse pressure can be expressed as follows 12 p c e o p c o a ξ b 1 f δ 0 where a and b are coefficients which need to determine fig 18 shows the normalized collapse pressure versus the ovality curves it can be seen that if the thickness eccentricity is fixed linear model is available to express the relationship between the normalized collapse pressure and the ovality combining the above relationship the normalized collapse pressure can be expressed as follows 13 p c e o p c o a ξ b 1 c δ 0 d where c and d are coefficients that need to determine nonlinear regression method is adopted to determine the above unknown coefficients by multiply regression analysis it shows that the correlation coefficient of the fitting curve surface is 99 48 the fitting plot is shown in fig 19 the values for these unknown coefficients are obtained a 1 283 b 1 600 c 3 016 d 0 987 therefore the collapse pressure of a thick walled subsea pipeline with the ovality and the thickness eccentricity can be determined by 14 p c e o 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 p c o he et al 2014 proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of a thick walled pipe with ovality as follows 15 p c o h e 1 478 d t 0 611 σ y s e 0 379 2 436 2 δ 0 0 047 d t 0 094 σ y s e 0 049 p p where p co he denotes the collapse pressure calculated from he s formula in which the thickness eccentricity is not considered s denotes the anisotropy of the yield stress which can be expressed as he et al 2014 16 s σ 0 a σ 0 c where σ 0a and σ 0c are the yield stresses in the axial and circumferential directions respectively for the above configurations the collapse pressures calculated from he s formula eq 15 are listed in table 7 for comparison the collapse pressures of the pipes without thickness eccentricity p co from this study are also listed in table 7 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from he s formula have a large error when the ovality is less than 0 1 that is because he s formula is available for the pipes with ovality from 0 1 to 1 fig 20 plots the normalized collapse pressure p co p co he versus the ovality curve according to fig 20 we use the following formula to modify he s formula and extend its application range 17 p c o p c o h e 946 δ 0 2 5 432 δ 0 0 9526 0 2 δ 0 1 0 0 0691 δ 0 0 176 1 167 0 01 δ 0 0 2 in this way the relationship between p co and p co he is built combining the modified he s formula and eq 14 the collapse pressure for a thick walled pipe with the ovality and thickness eccentricity is obtained 18 p c e o 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 946 δ 0 2 5 432 δ 0 0 9526 p c o h e 0 2 δ 0 1 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 0 0691 δ 0 0 176 1 167 p c o h e 0 01 δ 0 0 2 it should be noted that the above equation is available for ovality 0 01 1 and thickness eccentricity 0 50 3 3 validation of the present formula a subsea pipeline in practice netto et al 2007 is considered here to validate the present formula eq 18 the material for the pipeline is api x65 grade steel the material parameters are listed in table 8 the stress strain response for the material follows the ramberg osgood model with hardening parameter of 9 65 the outer diameter is 406 4 mm and the original wall thickness is 12 7 mm let the wall thicknesses vary from 12 70 mm to 40 64 mm and the dtr changes from 32 to 10 as shown in table 9 when the subsea pipeline has different combinations of ovality and thickness eccentricity the collapse pressures calculated from the proposed formula eq 18 fe model and dnvgl st f101 are listed in table 9 in the first 10 cases the ovality is in the range of 0 2 1 in the last 10 cases the ovality is in the range of 0 01 0 2 the comparison among them is presented in fig 21 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from the proposed formula agree well with those calculated from fe models no matter what the dtr ovality and thickness eccentricity are if selecting the fe results as the standard values the maximum relative error of collapse pressure calculated from the proposed formula is less than 4 5 this implies that the proposed formula can provide an accurate prediction for the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines in addition the relative errors of the collapse pressure calculated from the proposed formula are stable as shown in fig 22 from fig 21 it can also be seen that when the dtr is larger than 20 the collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are all greater than those calculated from the proposed formula and the fe models while when the dtr is less than 20 the collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are almost all smaller than those calculated from the proposed formula and the fe models as the dtr decreases the relative error of collapse pressure calculated from dnvgl st f101 increases the maximum relative error can reach 23 86 moreover the errors of collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are unstable see fig 22 a very large error will be produced see no 1 4 12 and 14 in table 9 if the thickness eccentricity is large this is because the thickness eccentricity parameter is not included in dnvgl st f101 4 conclusions this paper focuses on the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines with imperfections in the forms of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity the collapse modes are analyzed and the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response is presented the effects of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure are discussed a new collapse pressure formula is proposed which includes both the ovality and thickness variation comparisons of the collapse pressures calculated from the present formula fe model and dnvgl st f101 were carried out and discussed some important conclusions are obtained as follows 1 there exists a boundary curve in the eccentricity ovality plane that divides the region into two parts the final collapse mode is dominated by ovality in one part and dominated by thickness eccentricity in the other part when the thickness eccentricity is less than 10 ovality becomes dominate parameter and modes and p occur in the pipes with tex and tey respectively 2 for the pipes with tey and tex the boundary curves to distinguish different collapse modes can be roughly expressed as ξ 0 14 and δ0 0 0045ξ 0 00035 0 respectively 3 dnvgl st f101 underestimates the collapse pressure of a subsea pipeline when the dtr is less than 20 the errors of collapse pressures predicted by dnvgl st f101 are unstable and a very large error will be produced if the thickness eccentricity is large 4 the proposed formula can provide an accurate prediction for the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines and the error is stable credit authorship contribution statement xinhu zhang methodology software data

21648,in this study the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines with imperfections subjected to external pressure are studied using finite element fe method first the fe model of the imperfect thick walled pipe is built and validated by experimental results from other publications then different collapse responses are obtained by using the validated fe model the collapse modes are analyzed and the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response is proposed the effects of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure are discussed finally a new collapse pressure formula which includes both the ovality and thickness variation is presented the comparisons of collapse pressures from the proposed formula fe model and dnvgl st f101 are performed it is found dnvgl st f101 underestimates the collapse pressure when the diameter to thickness ratio dtr is less than 20 in addition the errors of collapse pressures predicted by dnvgl st f101 are unstable while the proposed formula can provide a pretty well prediction of collapse pressure for thick walled subsea pipelines and the error is stable keywords collapse pressure collapse mode thick walled pipes ovality thickness eccentricity 1 introduction subsea pipelines are widely used in offshore oil and gas industry for transportation of the hydrocarbons with the depletion of the offshore hydrocarbons the development of deepwater oil and gas has become the frontier of hydrocarbon production nowadays this poses significant challenges for the design of subsea pipelines bruschi et al 2015 teixeira et al 2019 one of the challenges is collapse which occurs in a pipeline if the external pressure is larger than its critical pressure as a failure form collapse will not only produce enormous economic loss but also result in large catastrophe to the ocean environment and ecosystem system drumond et al 2018 therefore collapse is a key issue which should be considered in the design of thick walled subsea pipelines many literatures have been published in the past 40 years with regard to the collapse of pipes for thin walled pipes the collapse often occurs in the elastic range of the pipe material and it is also called local buckling timoshenko and gere 1961 proposed the critical pressure formula for perfect thin walled subsea pipelines subjected to external pressure 1 p e 2 e 1 ν 2 t d 0 3 where p e is the elastic buckling pressure e and v are the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio respectively d 0 and t are mean diameter and wall thickness of the pipe respectively yeh and kyriakides 1986 pointed out that the above formula overestimates the collapse pressure when the diameter to thickness ratio dtr is less than 35 they proved that the smaller the dtr the larger the deviation between the real collapse pressure and that calculated from eq 1 this discrepancy is caused by the fact that the collapse occurs in the plastic range of the pipe material for thick walled pipes therefore elastic assumption cannot be used for this situation the collapse pressure of a thick walled pipe is affected by many factors such as dtr initial geometrical imperfections kyriakides and babcock 1981 yeh and kyriakides 1986 1988 dyau and kyriakides 1993 corradi et al 2005 dvorkin and toscano 2014 material properties kyriakides and babcock 1981 verner et al 1985 yeh and kyriakides 1986 1988 the anisotropy of the yield stress he et al 2014 and residual stress induced by manufacturing process ju and kyriakides 1991 kyriakides et al 1994 estefen 1999 in addition some investigators found the collapse pressure is also associated with the combined loads of external pressure tension bending moment corona and kyriakides 1988 bai et al 1997 as well as the load path yu et al 2019 kyriakides and babcock 1981 proposed the 2 dimensional 2d ring model to analyze the large deflection collapse of an inelastic inextensional ring under external pressure using similar method yeh and kyriakides 1986 studied the collapse of thick walled pipes and found if the cross section parameters of a pipe are invariable along the pipe axis the collapse of the pipe subjected to external pressure can be simplified as the collapse of a ring by line load normal to its surface thereafter many theoretical studies on the collapse of subsea pipelines were based on the 2d ring model fatt 1999 vasilikis and karamanos 2009 xue and fatt 2002 2005 yan et al 2015 one limitation of the above theoretical method is that it is not easy to build a theoretical model for the collapse of thick walled pipes considering all the factors mentioned above with the development of computer hardware the finite element fe method has been commonly used to study the collapse of defected thick walled pipes ong et al 1992 studied the collapse failure of a pipe with local dents by fe method and experimental tests and found fe method is suitable to analyze the collapse response of the imperfect subsea pipelines netto 2009 2010 studied the collapse of pipes with corrosion defects by fe analysis and experimental tests and proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of a pipe with narrow and long corrosion defects yan et al 2016 studied the collapse of the partly corroded pipe using fe method and 2d ring model fan et al 2017 investigated the effect of axial length parameters of ovality on the collapse pressure and proposed a formula to assess their influences on the collapse pressure of subsea pipelines wang et al 2018 studied the collapse pressure of random corroded pipes using 3 dimensional 3d nonlinear fe models the standard dnv os f101 2012 provides a formula to determine the collapse pressure of a subsea pipeline under external pressure which is on the basis of the method originally proposed by haagsma and schaap 1981 the formula is 2 p c p e p c 2 p p 2 p c p e p p f 0 d t 3 p p 2 σ y t d 4 f 0 d max d min d where p c is the collapse pressure d is the outer diameter of the pipeline p p is the plastic resistance capacity which is calculated from eq 3 f 0 denotes the ovality of a pipe which is calculated from eq 4 and σ y denotes the yield stress the standard dnv os f101 2012 is now replaced by the new standard dnvgl st f101 2017 but the above formula is not changed although the above formula is used for designing offshore pipelines some researchers kyriakides and corona 2007 he et al 2014 bruschi et al 2015 found it cannot precisely predict the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines especially for those with small dtr he et al 2014 proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines the dtr ovality elastic plastic material properties yield stress anisotropy are considered in their formula while the wall thickness variation is not considered however the ovality and thickness variation coexist and interact in practical engineering kyriakides and corona 2007 the formula to determine the collapse pressure of a thick walled subsea pipeline including both ovality and wall thickness variation has not been reported yet in addition the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the wall thickness variation affecting the collapse response is not clear this paper studied the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines by using fe method the ovality the thickness eccentricity and the orientation of thickness eccentricity are all considered in the fe analyses different collapse modes are obtained and discussed the mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse mode is proposed based on the work of he et al 2014 the collapse pressure formula which includes both the ovality and thickness variation parameters is proposed for thick walled subsea pipelines subjected to external pressure the proposed formula shows a pretty good accuracy 2 numerical model 2 1 fe model a thick walled pipe with length of 2l was considered only half of the pipe was selected because of the symmetry of the pipe as shown in fig 1 fe models were developed within the framework of the nonlinear fe code abaqus abaqus 2014 the geometrical parameters of the pipe analyzed by netto et al 2007 were used as shown in table 1 according to the collapse experimental tests yeh and kyriakides 1986 kyriakides et al 1984 and numerical simulations sakakibara et al 2008 bastola et al 2014 the pipe length does not affect the accuracy of the collapse pressure if it is greater than ten times the pipe diameter in the proposed fe model the half length of the pipe l was taken ten times the pipe diameter the pipe was modeled by eight node linear brick elements with reduced integration c3d8r according to the mesh sensitivity analyses from netto et al 2007 4 uniform elements in the thick direction 60 uniform elements in the hoop direction and 50 uniform elements in the longitudinal direction are enough to get a relatively accurate result therefore the pipe was discretized by 12000 elements totally to show the deformation of the pipe in the collapse response set four points a b c and d at top bottom left and right of the outer diameter in the plane of z l respectively as shown in fig 2 symmetry boundary conditions were applied at one end plane z l while fixed boundary conditions were applied at the other end plane z 0 before loading the cross section of the pipe has initial geometrical imperfections in the forms of ovality and wall thickness variation they were all introduced to the present fe model as shown in fig 3 the ovality is defined as yeh and kyriakides 1986 verner et al 1985 he et al 2014 netto et al 2007 5 δ 0 d max d min d max d min where δ 0 is the ovality d max and d min are the maximum and the minimum outer diameters of the pipe respectively see fig 3 a although the ovalities in different sections along the axial direction of the pipe are usually different fan et al 2017 it was assumed that the ovality is a uniform constant over the length of the pipe in this study to simplify the problem the same assumption was also made by park and kyriakides 1996 and sakakibara et al 2008 the ovality was modeled as radial deformation of a localized buckling mode from intact pipe it is written as dyau and kyriakides 1993 6 w 0 δ 0 r cos 2 θ where w 0 is the radial displacement taking the outward direction as positive r is the mean radius of the circle and θ is polar angle as shown in fig 4 a it can be seen that the ovality of the pipe can be modeled by an ellipse with the semi major axis of r 1 δ 0 and the semi minor axis of r 1 δ 0 respectively the mean radius of the ellipse r θ can be expressed as 7 r θ r 1 δ 0 cos 2 θ the wall thickness variation was represented by thickness eccentricity of the pipe see fig 3 b which is defined as yeh and kyriakides 1986 netto et al 2007 8 ξ t max t min t max t min where ξ denotes the thickness eccentricity and t max and t min are the maximum and the minimum wall thicknesses respectively according to kyriakides and corona 2007 the wall thickness variations often do not change significantly over a length of ten times the pipe diameter therefore the thickness eccentricity was assumed to be a uniform constant over the length of the pipe and the thickness eccentricity model proposed by yeh and kyriakides 1986 was used in this study the variation of the wall thickness in y direction can be expressed as 9 t θ t 1 δ 0 t sin θ where t θ is the wall thickness of the pipe in radial direction and δ 0 is the thickness variation parameter as shown in fig 4 b in this case the wall thickness variation parameter δ 0 and the thickness eccentricity follow the following relationship 10 δ 0 ξ t therefore the thickness eccentricity was implemented by modeling the pipe s cross section as two non concentric circles with the distance of δ 0 between them to analyze the effect of the thickness eccentricity orientation on the collapse response two types of combinations for the ovality and the thickness eccentricity with constant ovality orientation in horizontal direction were considered in this study as shown in fig 5 one is that the largest thickness variation coincides with the minor axis of the ellipse which is called the thickness eccentricity in y direction tey as shown in fig 5 a the other is that the largest thickness variation coincides with the major axis of the ellipse which is called the thickness eccentricity in x direction tex as shown in fig 5 b the ovality is varied from 0 01 to 1 while the thickness eccentricity is varied from 0 to 50 it was assumed that the pipe material follows elastic plastic model and the plastic material behavior follows j2 flow theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening ramberg osgood model was used to represent the stress strain response which is expressed as park and kyriakides 1996 11 ε σ e 1 3 7 σ σ y n 1 where ε and σ are the strain and stress respectively n is the hardening parameter two steps were used to analyze the model in the first step a small external pressure of 100pa was applied on the outside of the pipe to get an initial balance in the second step the external pressure of 100 mpa was applied on the pipe collapse would occur in this step because the collapse response of the thick walled pipe is an unstable nonlinear problem riks method modified arc length method was used here to follow the loading history zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 it must be noted that a self contact should be built in the internal surface of the pipe to avoid passing through in late stage of the collapse 2 2 validation of the fe model the experimental tests carried out by netto et al 2007 and kyriakides and corona 2007 were used to validate the proposed fe models in netto s small scale experimental tests they performed collapse pressure tests for eleven steel specimens including one intact pipe and ten pipes with induced defects the intact steel pipe was selected to compare with the fe model the material for the intact steel pipe is aisi 1020 the geometrical and material parameters for the intact steel pipe are listed in the first group no 1 in table 2 kyriakides and corona 2007 conducted collapse pressure tests for thirteen specimens among them four groups of pipes with the yield stress anisotropy of 1 0 were selected for comparison with the proposed fe models the geometrical and material parameters for the four specimens are also listed in table 2 they are numbered from no 2 to 5 the materials for test specimens from no 2 to 4 and no 5 are ss 304 steel and x65 steel respectively the collapse pressures from netto et al 2007 kyriakides and corona 2007 and the present fe models are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from the present fe models agree well with those obtained from netto et al 2007 and kyriakides and corona 2007 the absolute differences between the fe models and the experimental tests are no more than 1 48 mpa and the relative differences between them are no more than 4 27 this shows the accuracy of the present fe model 3 results and discussions the collapse responses of the pipes were successfully analyzed using the proposed fe models the collapse mode and collapse pressure are analyzed as follows 3 1 collapse mode fig 6 shows a typical collapse response which corresponds to the pipe with δ0 0 01 and ξ 0 fig 6 a shows the contours for the stress and deformation of the pipe right after collapse the middle and final stages of the pipe after collapse are shown in fig 6 b and c respectively fig 6 d shows the curves of pressure versus displacement in y direction for the marked points a and b the plateau in fig 6 d is collapse pressure which corresponds to fig 6 a the typical collapse response agrees well with the results from palmer and martin 1975 dyau and kyriakides 1993 netto et al 2007 from fig 6 it is obvious that when the collapse occurs the maximum stress 312 3 mpa has exceeded the yield stress 287 mpa therefore the collapse occurs in plastic range of the pipe material because of the ovality effect the top and bottom of the pipe move toward the pipe center and the left and right move away from the pipe center under external pressure finally the top touches the bottom of the pipe the final configuration of the pipe is symmetrical about both the x axis and y axis this collapse mode is called mode in this study for the pipe with tey when the ovality is small and the thickness eccentricity is large for instance δ0 0 01 and ξ 20 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 7 the collapse response in this configuration is quite different from the typical collapse response after collapse the top moves largely while the bottom almost does not move under the same external pressure as shown in fig 7 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the y axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the x axis as shown in fig 7 c this is called mode u for this type in this study the collapse process is clearly shown by the pressure versus displacement curves see fig 7 d this mode is caused by the combination of weak ovality effect and strong thickness eccentricity effect for the pipe with tey when the ovality is large and the thickness eccentricity is small for instance δ0 1 and ξ 10 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 8 this collapse response in this configuration is similar to the typical collapse response the difference between them is that after collapse the top moves a larger displacement while the bottom moves a smaller displacement for this configuration as shown in fig 8 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the y axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the x axis as shown in fig 8 c fig 8 d clearly shows the collapse process by the pressure versus displacement curves for marked points a and b this mode is also called mode in this study and it is clear that this mode is resulted from the combination of strong ovality effect and weak thickness eccentricity effect for the pipe with tex when the ovality is small and the thickness eccentricity is large for example δ0 0 01 and ξ 20 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 9 it is observed that the location of the maximum stress is at the rightmost point d of the pipe right after collapse as shown in fig 9 a it is different from the case with tey the right of the pipe moves a large distance in x direction while the left almost does not move under the same external pressure as shown in fig 9 b the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the x axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the y axis as shown in fig 9 c the collapse process is clearly shown by the pressure versus displacement curves for the marked points c and d see fig 9 d this collapse mode is called mode c in this study it is clear that the mode c is the combination of weak ovality effect strong thickness eccentricity effect and the thickness eccentricity orientation for the pipe with tex when the ovality is large and the thickness eccentricity is small for instance δ0 1 and ξ 10 the corresponding collapse response is illustrated in fig 10 different from the above case after collapse both the left and right move a large distance the collapse configuration of the pipe in middle stage looks like a pear as shown in fig 10 b finally the top portion touches the bottom portion the displacement of the rightmost point d is larger than that of the leftmost point c of the pipe as shown in fig 10 d the final collapse mode is symmetrical about the x axis while it is nonsymmetrical about the y axis as shown in fig 10 c this collapse mode is called mode p in this study the mode p is caused by the combination of strong ovality effect weak thickness eccentricity effect and thickness eccentricity orientation to reveal the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response the collapse modes for pipes with tey and tex are listed in table 3 fig 11 illustrates the collapse mode distribution for the pipes with tey to clearly show the boundary analyses are carried out on additional 27 fe models with thickness eccentricity of 13 14 and 15 fig 12 shows the collapse mode distribution for the pipes with tex in figs 11 and 12 every grid point corresponds to a mode of the pipe with the specific combination of the ovality and thickness eccentricity the red circle represents the mode u fig 11 or c fig 12 and the blue box represents the mode fig 11 or p fig 12 from the above analysis it can be seen that the ovality effect is to make the pipe flat the final collapse configuration is mode or p while the thickness eccentricity effect is to make the pipe settlement the final collapse configuration is mode u or c for a pipe with an arbitrary combination of ovality and thickness eccentricity the ovality and thickness eccentricity interact against each other the final collapse configuration depends on their values from fig 11 or 12 it can be seen that the region meshed by ovality and thickness eccentricity is divided into two parts by a distinct boundary curve in the left region the ovality effect is predominant and the final collapse configuration is mode or p on the contrary the thickness eccentricity effect is predominant in the right region and the final collapse configuration is mode u or c the boundary curve means the ovality effect is basically identical to the thickness eccentricity effect for the pipes with tey and tex the boundary curves can be roughly expressed as ξ 0 14 and δ0 0 0045ξ 0 00035 0 respectively in summary there exists a boundary curve in the eccentricity ovality plane that divides the region into two parts the final collapse mode is dominated by ovality in one part and it is dominated by thickness eccentricity in the other part 3 2 collapse pressure the collapse pressures of the pipes with tey are listed in table 4 fig 13 shows the collapse pressure versus the ovality curves for the pipes with different thickness eccentricities it is observed that the collapse pressure decreases as the ovality rises a smaller ovality corresponds to a larger collapse pressure meanwhile a smaller thickness eccentricity corresponds to a larger collapses pressure drop when the ovality varies for instance when the thickness eccentricities are 5 and 50 the collapse pressures drop 8 48 mpa and 3 44 mpa as the ovality increases from 0 01 to 1 respectively this implies that when the thickness eccentricity is small the collapse pressure is strongly influenced by the ovality fig 14 presents the collapse pressure versus the thickness eccentricity in y direction curves for the pipes with different ovalities it can be seen that the collapse pressure decreases as the thickness eccentricity rises a smaller thickness eccentricity corresponds to a larger collapse pressure meanwhile a smaller ovality corresponds to a larger collapses pressure drop when thickness eccentricity changes for instance when the ovalities are 0 01 and 1 the collapse pressures drop 19 11 mpa and 13 8 mpa as the thickness eccentricity changes from 0 to 50 respectively this implies that when ovality is small the thickness eccentricity has an obvious influence on the collapse pressure comparing figs 14 and 13 it can be seen that the rate of change of collapse pressure with respect to ovality defined as δ p c δ δ 0 is much larger than that with respect to thickness eccentricity defined as δ p c δ ξ for instance when the thickness eccentricity equals 0 and the ovality changes from 0 5 to 1 δ δ 0 0 5 the change of collapse pressure δ p c 1 is 3 73 mpa and the rate of change of collapse pressure with respect to ovality is 746 00 when the ovality keeps 0 5 and the thickness eccentricity varies from 0 to 20 δ δ 0 20 the change of collapse pressure δ p c 2 is 3 65 mpa which is quite close to δ p c 1 and the change rate of collapse pressure with respect to eccentricity is 18 25 therefore compared with ovality the influence of thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure of a pipe is much less however the value of thickness eccentricity is often much larger than the ovality in practical engineering so it still needs to develop a collapse pressure formula which includes the ovality and the thickness eccentricity including the orientation first of all the effect of the orientation of the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure should be discussed the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex are also listed in table 4 figs 15 and 16 show the collapse pressure versus ovality curves and the collapse pressure versus thickness eccentricity curves for the pipes with tex dashed line respectively for comparison the collapse pressure versus ovality curves and the collapse pressure versus thickness eccentricity curves for the pipes with tey solid line are also plotted in figs 15 and 16 respectively it is observed that the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex are all slightly larger than those with tey under the same combination of ovality and thickness eccentricity the pipes with tey and tex are the worst and the best cases respectively therefore the collapse pressures of the pipes with tex and tey form the upper and lower limits of the collapse pressure for the pipe with the thickness eccentricity in arbitrary direction table 5 lists the difference between the collapse pressure of the pipe with tex and that with tey it can be seen that the maximum difference between them is 1 25 mpa this result is in agreement with similar observations made by yeh and kyriakides 1986 the influence of the orientation of the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure of a pipe is very limited in other words the orientation of the thickness eccentricity is not critical and can be neglected it is enough to consider the worst case tey in the design of thick walled subsea pipelines to develop a relationship between the collapse pressure and the thickness eccentricity and ovality the collapse pressure of a pipe with both eccentricity and ovality p ceo is normalized by the collapse pressure of the pipe without eccentricity p co with assuming y direction as critical direction table 6 lists the normalized collapse pressures for the pipes with ovality from 0 01 to 1 and eccentricity from 0 to 50 fig 17 presents the normalized collapse pressure versus the thickness eccentricity curves to clearly show the data points fig 17 only shows curves for the pipes with ovality 0 01 0 1 and 1 the curves corresponding to ovality 0 01 and 1 form the lower and upper boundaries of the normalized collapse pressure it can be seen that the collapse pressure reduced by 0 5 1 for ξ 0 5 it reduced by 2 1 3 8 for ξ 0 10 by 8 2 12 1 for ξ 0 20 by 21 9 17 0 for ξ 0 30 by 32 6 27 5 for ξ 0 40 and by 43 3 39 0 for ξ 0 50 it is obvious that the normalized collapse pressure is a function of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity from fig 17 it is found that if the ovality is fixed power model is available to express the relationship between the normalized collapse pressure and the thickness eccentricity from data analysis the normalized collapse pressure can be expressed as follows 12 p c e o p c o a ξ b 1 f δ 0 where a and b are coefficients which need to determine fig 18 shows the normalized collapse pressure versus the ovality curves it can be seen that if the thickness eccentricity is fixed linear model is available to express the relationship between the normalized collapse pressure and the ovality combining the above relationship the normalized collapse pressure can be expressed as follows 13 p c e o p c o a ξ b 1 c δ 0 d where c and d are coefficients that need to determine nonlinear regression method is adopted to determine the above unknown coefficients by multiply regression analysis it shows that the correlation coefficient of the fitting curve surface is 99 48 the fitting plot is shown in fig 19 the values for these unknown coefficients are obtained a 1 283 b 1 600 c 3 016 d 0 987 therefore the collapse pressure of a thick walled subsea pipeline with the ovality and the thickness eccentricity can be determined by 14 p c e o 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 p c o he et al 2014 proposed a formula to predict the collapse pressure of a thick walled pipe with ovality as follows 15 p c o h e 1 478 d t 0 611 σ y s e 0 379 2 436 2 δ 0 0 047 d t 0 094 σ y s e 0 049 p p where p co he denotes the collapse pressure calculated from he s formula in which the thickness eccentricity is not considered s denotes the anisotropy of the yield stress which can be expressed as he et al 2014 16 s σ 0 a σ 0 c where σ 0a and σ 0c are the yield stresses in the axial and circumferential directions respectively for the above configurations the collapse pressures calculated from he s formula eq 15 are listed in table 7 for comparison the collapse pressures of the pipes without thickness eccentricity p co from this study are also listed in table 7 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from he s formula have a large error when the ovality is less than 0 1 that is because he s formula is available for the pipes with ovality from 0 1 to 1 fig 20 plots the normalized collapse pressure p co p co he versus the ovality curve according to fig 20 we use the following formula to modify he s formula and extend its application range 17 p c o p c o h e 946 δ 0 2 5 432 δ 0 0 9526 0 2 δ 0 1 0 0 0691 δ 0 0 176 1 167 0 01 δ 0 0 2 in this way the relationship between p co and p co he is built combining the modified he s formula and eq 14 the collapse pressure for a thick walled pipe with the ovality and thickness eccentricity is obtained 18 p c e o 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 946 δ 0 2 5 432 δ 0 0 9526 p c o h e 0 2 δ 0 1 1 1 283 ξ 8 5 3 016 δ 0 0 987 0 0691 δ 0 0 176 1 167 p c o h e 0 01 δ 0 0 2 it should be noted that the above equation is available for ovality 0 01 1 and thickness eccentricity 0 50 3 3 validation of the present formula a subsea pipeline in practice netto et al 2007 is considered here to validate the present formula eq 18 the material for the pipeline is api x65 grade steel the material parameters are listed in table 8 the stress strain response for the material follows the ramberg osgood model with hardening parameter of 9 65 the outer diameter is 406 4 mm and the original wall thickness is 12 7 mm let the wall thicknesses vary from 12 70 mm to 40 64 mm and the dtr changes from 32 to 10 as shown in table 9 when the subsea pipeline has different combinations of ovality and thickness eccentricity the collapse pressures calculated from the proposed formula eq 18 fe model and dnvgl st f101 are listed in table 9 in the first 10 cases the ovality is in the range of 0 2 1 in the last 10 cases the ovality is in the range of 0 01 0 2 the comparison among them is presented in fig 21 it can be seen that the collapse pressures calculated from the proposed formula agree well with those calculated from fe models no matter what the dtr ovality and thickness eccentricity are if selecting the fe results as the standard values the maximum relative error of collapse pressure calculated from the proposed formula is less than 4 5 this implies that the proposed formula can provide an accurate prediction for the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines in addition the relative errors of the collapse pressure calculated from the proposed formula are stable as shown in fig 22 from fig 21 it can also be seen that when the dtr is larger than 20 the collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are all greater than those calculated from the proposed formula and the fe models while when the dtr is less than 20 the collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are almost all smaller than those calculated from the proposed formula and the fe models as the dtr decreases the relative error of collapse pressure calculated from dnvgl st f101 increases the maximum relative error can reach 23 86 moreover the errors of collapse pressures calculated from dnvgl st f101 are unstable see fig 22 a very large error will be produced see no 1 4 12 and 14 in table 9 if the thickness eccentricity is large this is because the thickness eccentricity parameter is not included in dnvgl st f101 4 conclusions this paper focuses on the collapse responses of thick walled subsea pipelines with imperfections in the forms of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity the collapse modes are analyzed and the interaction mechanism of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity affecting the collapse response is presented the effects of the ovality and the thickness eccentricity on the collapse pressure are discussed a new collapse pressure formula is proposed which includes both the ovality and thickness variation comparisons of the collapse pressures calculated from the present formula fe model and dnvgl st f101 were carried out and discussed some important conclusions are obtained as follows 1 there exists a boundary curve in the eccentricity ovality plane that divides the region into two parts the final collapse mode is dominated by ovality in one part and dominated by thickness eccentricity in the other part when the thickness eccentricity is less than 10 ovality becomes dominate parameter and modes and p occur in the pipes with tex and tey respectively 2 for the pipes with tey and tex the boundary curves to distinguish different collapse modes can be roughly expressed as ξ 0 14 and δ0 0 0045ξ 0 00035 0 respectively 3 dnvgl st f101 underestimates the collapse pressure of a subsea pipeline when the dtr is less than 20 the errors of collapse pressures predicted by dnvgl st f101 are unstable and a very large error will be produced if the thickness eccentricity is large 4 the proposed formula can provide an accurate prediction for the collapse pressure of thick walled subsea pipelines and the error is stable credit authorship contribution statement xinhu zhang methodology software data

21649,this paper presents general procedures to generate loading histories for fatigue strength assessment of offshore structures based on a storm model and seasonal wave data using hindcast wave data of 11 years at one point in the north atlantic ocean the relations among the storm duration storm crest and the number of levels in a storm are formulated and the statistics of storm duration are obtained one year including four seasons is chosen as the reference period of the loading history based on the generated loading histories fatigue crack propagation analyses are performed on a tubular t joint using a fatigue crack growth model considering the load interaction and r ratio effect the crack size uncertainty caused by randomly generated loading histories is investigated the proposed procedures can lead to a good agreement with the observed significant wave height distribution the generated loading histories result in median crack growth curves comparing with those from measured wave data the crack size is subjected to considerable uncertainty after a period of crack propagation ignoring the load interaction effect leads to faster crack growth which may be the most convenient way to achieve a conservative fatigue crack propagation analysis using only one generated load history keywords storm model variable storm duration seasonal wave data fatigue crack propagation offshore structures 1 introduction fatigue failure is one of the most significant failure modes for marine structures which are subjected to complex loading histories during their service life to predict their fatigue lives and verify the fatigue strength it is significant to appropriately model the complex and random fatigue loading e g garbatov et al 2011 in practice the fatigue loading is generally described as a stress range distribution and thus the load sequence effect is ignored however experimental evidence indicates that the fatigue strength is considerably influenced by the load sequence which is of equal importance compared with other factors such as the calculation of stress concentration factors scfs and the choice of stress life curves cui et al 2011 it is well known that the widely used fatigue life prediction approaches based on the cumulative fatigue damage cfd theory cannot consider the load sequence effect and the crack size information therefore the fatigue crack propagation fcp theory is applied to overcome these deficiencies cui 2003 wang and cui 2009 the crack growth rate curves determined by experiments can reflect the fundamental fatigue property of the material being tested the fcp model e g paris law is then established to estimate the crack growth rate under various loading conditions the fatigue life of a structural component with an initial crack is predicted in a cycle by cycle manner over the past few decades many models have been proposed to estimate the crack growth rate wheeler 1972 newman 1981 mcevily et al 1999 sadananda et al 2001 okawa and sumi 2008 sumi and inoue 2011 huang et al 2008 cui et al 2011 chen et al 2012 their capabilities to explain various fatigue phenomena observed in tests have been demonstrated and validated by comparing with experimental results on a wide range of materials when using the fcp based approaches the primary problem is that the actual load time history is unknown and thus the load sequence effect cannot be appropriately considered for marine structures the long term wave induced fatigue load is model by a two parameter weibull distribution guedes soares and moan 1991 which is used to describe the stress range distribution the scale and shape parameter of the distribution can be determined by the spectral fatigue analysis guedes soares et al 2003 garbatov et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 or by empirical formula and values recommended by classification societies this description of the fatigue load is not the load time history but the crack propagation analyses can still be performed based on the stress range distribution the effective stress approach thayamballi et al 1984 or weight average crack growth rate dong et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2018 can be used apparently the load sequence and interaction effects are ignored in the analyses on the other hand the long term stress range series can be randomly generated following the weibull distribution leading to pseudo loading histories which are composed by a series of the maximum and minimum stresses determined based on the stress range however different samples and sequences of stress ranges can be obtained using the same distribution and the predicted fatigue life of a considered structure varies significantly cui et al 2011 it is far from satisfactory as the more realistic loading history is still undetermined it is necessary to present loading history generation models that can approximate the real structural fatigue loading history consisting of rough and calm seas baxevani et al 2009 proposed a stochastic wave model called spatio temporal model which can simulate significant wave height h w sequence with satellite wave data the load sequence was then determined using the obtained h w sequence this model was adopted to assess the fatigue strength of ship structural component mao et al 2010 2013 de gracia et al 2016 the spatio temporal model could be easily used for extreme prediction of sea conditions both along arbitrary ship routes and at the fixed locations however it does not contain the configuration feature of storms which can be observed from the measurements another load sequence generation model called storm model has been proposed and developed over the last two decades tomita et al 1995 kawabe 2002 kawabe et al 2003 prasetyo et al 2012 prasetyo 2013 tomita et al 1995 presented the 1st generation of the storm model based on the wave data collected from 38 ships that sailed in the north pacific ocean and 11 ships in the japan indian ocean over a period of 14 years basically ocean conditions were classified into either storms or calm seas storms were modelled as crescendo and decrescendo amplitude waveform of individual wave height h w and calm seas were modelled as time independent random waveform these two conditions randomly occur during the ships lifetime comparing with the spatio temporal model the storm profile is clearly defined the 1st generation storm model was further developed by kawabe 2002 and kawabe et al 2003 in three main aspects 1 the storm waveforms were described by significant wave height h w sequences instead of h w 2 the waveforms were determined so that h w s frequency distribution in a storm was similar to the tail of h w s long term distribution 3 the correlation between h w and mean wave period t z was taken into account it was called the 2nd generation storm model in the 1st and 2nd generation models it was assumed that storm duration remains unchanged in the analyzed sea areas 3 5 days for the north pacific ocean and the north atlantic ocean this assumption is not consistent with the real ocean condition where the duration varies for different storms it may deteriorate the accuracy of fatigue life estimation prasetyo et al 2012 and prasetyo 2013 developed the 3rd generation storm model based on the japan weather association jwa s hindcast wave data where the variation of storm durations was considered the load sequence experienced by marine structures can be approximately described by the existing storm models the fatigue loading is composed of different storms and calm seas both of which randomly occur during the design life the predicted fatigue life is subjected to uncertainty which is evaluated using many calculation results obtained under different simulations apparently the evaluation is always time consuming to save the computational time it is preferred to determine a fixed sequence of storms and calm seas which can be considered as the design load time history for the fatigue life prediction li and cui 2014 2016 proposed a procedure to generate the standardized load time histories slhs for marine structures where the worst loading history identified from all possible permutations of storms which results in the shortest fatigue life was chosen as the slh calm seas were not specifically located in the slh since they have much less effect on the crack growth than storms the slh was determined based on the 1st generation of the storm model and the storm duration was assumed to be a constant the slh covers a representative fraction a reference period of the design life rather than the total design life which makes the procedure of storm sequence determination much easier than in the whole lifetime one year is selected as the reference period for marine structures because a similar wave environment may take place every year the determined slh within the reference period is repeated several times in fatigue tests or numerical simulations until final failure occurs or the anticipated design life is covered one limitation of the study is that all the storm profiles were generated using the average wave scatter diagram wsd which means a single wsd for all different seasons it can lead to unrealistic storm profiles and storm sequences within one year e g severe storms may occur in calm seasons besides if the amount of all possible storm sequences within the reference period is significant it is impossible to evaluate all the possible sequences for example if there are 14 storms experienced by an offshore platform within one year the number of all possible storm sequences is 8 7e10 14 13 2 1 to overcome these limitations li and guedes soares 2017 presented an improved procedure to generate the slhs for offshore structures by using seasonal wsds instead of the average one based on the 2nd generation storm model separating one year into four seasons and performing the analysis within one season can reduce the number of possible storm sequences since the number of storms in one season is lower than in one year furthermore it can lead to more realistic loading histories for fcp assessment in the present study the hindcast wave data at one point in the north atlantic ocean over 11 years is analyzed and the storms are generated on a seasonal basis to make the storm profile generation more convenient the relations among the storm duration storm crest and the number of levels in a storm are formulated the statistical characteristics of the storm duration are obtained the randomly generated loading history leads to uncertain crack growth to achieve a relatively conservative fcp analyses the uncertainty of the crack size after a period of crack propagation is investigated the fcp analyses are performed for a tubular t joint with an initial surface crack using the model proposed by huang and moan 2007 2008 which considers the r ratio and load interaction effects 2 loading history generation 2 1 sea state sequence determination 2 1 1 wave data collection the wave data should be collected in the sea area where the considered offshore structure is expected to operate a short term sea state can be described by the significant wave height h w and mean wave period t z from a long term observation of the sea state both parameters are recorded divided into classes and the corresponding probability of each pair is written in a matrix i e wsd which is the most commonly used to describe the wave environment for marine structures according to the wsd the occurrence probability of each sea state h w t z can be estimated and even fitted by a joint distribution ferreira and guedes soares 2002 dong et al 2013 lucas and guedes soares 2015 in the present study the long term sea state for each season i e seasonal wsd in the studied sea area are needed to generate the load time history 2 1 2 storm profile in each season the mean value of h w h w mean and occurrence probability of each sea state h w t z can be obtained according to the seasonal wsd a threshold related to h w mean is used to divide storms and calm seas for example if the threshold is chosen as 2h w mean in calm seas the maximum h w is 2h w mean storms are classified according to the maximum h w in each storm h w max storm which ranges from 2h w mean 1 m to the extreme value of h w h w ext assuming the h w is an integer in each storm the crescendo and decrescendo waveform starts from h w min 1 h w max storm j end and is modelled as shown in fig 1 li and guedes soares 2017 it can be seen that in one storm j represents the levels of h w j end indicates the number of levels and n ss is the number of sea states that can be obtained as follows 1 n ss d h o u r i ob h o u r where d is the duration of a storm hour and i ob is the observation interval of sea state data hour which means a sea state stays unchanged during this short period then the total number of sea states in each season can be given as 2 n total season 0 25 y e a r 365 d a y 24 h o u r i ob h o u r the h w ext is determined as the h w happened once in the season which implies 1 n total season 1 f h w ext where f is the cumulative distribution function of h w in the previous work li and guedes soares 2017 d was assumed to be 3 5 days 84 h for all the storms and j end was determined based on the n ss and the distribution of h w which was assumed to be a weibull distribution prasetyo 2013 however a statistical analysis of the 11 year 1991 2001 hindcast wave data pilar et al 2008 campos and guedes soares 2016 with i ob 3 h at one point 28on 41ow in the north atlantic ocean as produced in the hipocas project guedes soares 2008 indicates that the h w distribution is more appropriately described by a lognormal distribution in fact while the weibull distribution is more appropriate to deal with the extreme values of wave data the log normal fits better the bulk of the data and thus is more appropriate to fatigue loading guedes soares and henriques 1996 guedes soares and scotto 2011 fig 2 shows the h w histogram in oct dec of 11 years along with the lognormal and weibull distributions fitted by using the maximum likelihood method apparently the former distribution is more reasonable for the present case in the present study both d and j end are considered to be variable for different storms to find the relations between these parameters the 11 year wave data is analyzed fig 3 shows how to extract j end and d in the history of h w in the figure a storm is simplified as an equivalent triangular which has a certain period where h w 2h w mean and the local maximum of h w is defined as h w max which is the crest of a storm the storm duration d is determined as t e t b where t e is the time of the local minimum which appears just after the triangular occurs and t b is the time of local minimum just before the triangular occurs for the number of levels in a storm j end h w max mean h w min 1 h w min 2 assuming the minimum step of h w is 1 m all the storms within 11 years each of which represents with h w max j d j j end j j 1 2 3 can be extracted by analyzing these data the relation between h w max and j end is established as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that j end generally increases with the h w max furthermore their relation can be fitted by the least square method as 3 j end 0 012 h w max 2 0 6596 h w max 2 3876 where the unit of h w max is meter the j end in each storm can be determined if the corresponding h w max is identified in the study of prasetyo 2013 the storm duration was assumed to be normally distributed regardless of the sea area but the parameters of the normal distribution were ocean dependent for the wave data analyzed in the present study the storm duration distribution is assumed to be lognormally distributed the storm duration determined from the observed wave data is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the fitted lognormal distribution is in a good agreement with the observation besides the lognormal distribution does not allow the occurrence of negative values which satisfies the physical meaning of d therefore this type of distribution is employed to describe the storm duration uncertainty the storm durations are classified into different groups according to the number of levels of the storm and statistical analyses are performed within these groups the mean value and coefficient of variation cov of d as a function of j end are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the relation between j end and the mean value of d is approximately linear and can be expressed as 4 μ 8 5954 j end 33 808 where μ is the mean value of d hour there is no apparent relation between j end and cov of d therefore a constant cov of 0 4 is assumed here to describe the uncertainty of storm duration for each storm j end can be determined using equation 3 and its duration represented by a lognormal distribution with a mean value determined by equation 4 and a cov of 0 4 can be obtained by random number generation as shown in fig 1 the repeat number of h w in each level n j is determined so that the frequency distribution of n j is similar to its long term probability distribution as follows 5 n 1 int n ss p ex h w max storm 1 n 2 int n ss p ex h w max storm 1 n 1 n 3 int n ss p ex h w max storm 2 n 1 n 2 where p ex is the long term exceedance probability of h w the summation of n j should be equal to n ss the probability distribution of h w in calm seas p calm h w is a truncated lognormal distribution where the probability of h w 2h w mean is 0 the total number of calm sea states in one season is determined by n total season n ss the h w in a calm sea is determined by random number generation based on p calm h w 2 1 3 assessment of storm number let n i be the occurrence number of the i th class storm in one season then for the 1st severest class storm with h w max storm h w ext 6 n 1 n h w ext 1 for the 2nd class storm with h w max storm h w ext 1 m 7 n 2 n ext 1 n ext 1 where n ext 1 is the total occurrence number of sea states with h w h w ext 1 m n ext 1 is the number of sea states with h w h w ext 1 m that occurred in the 1st class storm by repeating this procedure the numbers of storms in all classes n i i 3 4 can be determined then the total number of all the storms in one season is given as 8 n storm season i 1 i end n i according to the total number of storms in one season the season is divided into some blocks making sure each block has one storm the number of calm sea states in these blocks is assumed to be identical since the calm sea states are more likely to have a low h w their location in the block may be not important thus the storm is assumed to be located in the middle of the block fig 7 shows an example if there are two storms in one season once h w is determined the mean wave period t z can be determined by random number generation using the conditional probability of t z given h w proposed by wan and shinkai 1995 9 p t z h w 1 2 π t z σ exp ln t z μ 2 2 σ 2 μ e ln t z h w σ 2 var ln t z h w where p t z h w is the conditional probability density for t z given h w the probability distribution of p t z h w can be obtained as 10 p h w t z p h w p t z h w thus the short term sea states in each block and the blocks in each season can be obtained 2 2 short term stress history when the short term sea state h w t z is determined the short term stress range distribution f δσ can be obtained by the following steps the heading angle of the studied structure is assumed according to the practical problem under consideration e g all heading model the wave energy spectrum is given by the pierson moskowitz spectrum 11 s η ω h w 2 4 π 2 π t z 4 ω 5 exp 1 π 2 π t z 4 ω 4 where ω is the wave frequency rad s the stress range response transfer function of the structural member analyzed h σ ω will be determined by performing wave load assessment and fem analyses e g guedes soares et al 2003 the stress response spectrum s σ ω e based on the linear model is obtained from the encountered wave spectrum s η ω e and stress transfer function h σ ω e 12 s σ ω e h σ ω e 2 s η ω e where ω e is the encountered wave frequency for each short term sea state the stress process can be assumed to be a zero mean narrow band gaussian process thus according to the random process theory the stress peak is rayleigh distributed the stress range is assumed to be twice the stress peak and the stress range distribution is 13 f δ σ 1 e x p δ σ 2 8 m 0 where m 0 is the zeroth moment of the stress response spectrum the total number of stress cycles associated with the short term sea state can be determined on the basis of the average zero up crossing rate which is given by 14 f 0 1 2 π m 2 m 0 where m 2 is the second moment of the stress response spectrum a sequence of stress ranges that follows the distribution can be obtained through random data generation each stress range represents a stress cycle whose maximum and minimum stress can be determined if the mean stress of the stress cycle is known connecting all the maximum and minimum stresses a pseudo stress history can be formed for the following fatigue crack propagation analyses 2 3 loading history in one year one year is recommended as the reference period when generating the fatigue loading history for offshore structures which have relatively fixed working locations because they experience a similar wave environment every year the h w distribution of each season is used to generate the storms and calm seas leading to the loading history in the season the loading histories of the four seasons occur sequentially in the year thus the determined loading history can avoid unrealistic storm profiles and storm sequences e g the winter storms occur in the summer the generated load time history within one year will be repeated until final failure occurs or the anticipated service life is covered shown in fig 8 note that some significant sea states are ignored in the generated loading history because the severest sea state h w ext is the sea state happened once in a season leading to non conservative results the sea state with a higher h w can be considered as the highest sea state of a storm and used to generate the storm according to the procedures introduced in section 2 1 2 these storms can be inserted into some random years within each season the sequence of storms blocks shows no regular pattern and is assumed to be random in the present study in a previous study li and guedes soares 2017 the storm sequence effect on the crack growth was investigated in one season among all the possible sequences the sequence with ascending storms resulted in the highest crack increments and recommended in fatigue crack analyses the reason was that after the storm the crack arrest occurs due to the overload retardation effect and postponing the most severe storm can postpone significant crack arrest however it is only a special case where the crack arrest due to storms is dominant a more general situation should be considered there are many uncertainty factors included in the loading history generation leading to various loading histories and crack growth conditions the above mentioned storm sequence is only one of these factors it is difficult to use only one generated load history to provide a conservative result the investigation on the crack growth uncertainties when using the generated load time history is necessary which is carried out in section 4 3 study case the study case analyzed here is a tubular t joint shown in fig 9 of an offshore platform assumed to be located in the point where the 11 year hindcast wave data is collected tubular t joints are widely used in offshore structures experimental results have shown that the saddle point is the fatigue prone location of the t joint under cyclic axial load acting on the brace in the present study a surface crack located at the saddle point with an initial crack depth a 3 5 mm and half crack length c 10 mm is considered for the fcp assessment the material of the t joint is 350wt steel the geometry of the tubular t joint is listed in table 1 if the sea state history data is available it can be directly used for the fcp analysis which can give the most accurate prediction the proposed storm model is mainly used when there is no measured sea state history data for some routes or fixed locations and only the seasonal wsd is available even though the study case uses the 11 year hindcast wave data to derive the loading history based on the proposed storm model the data is also used to verify the method presented in this paper as shown in this and the following sections thus the effectiveness of the proposed storm model can be demonstrated the loading history is generated according to the procedures introduced in section 2 based on the seasonal data of 11 years the h w distribution in each season is obtained fig 10 shows the relative frequency distributions of h w for the four seasons the environment in jan mar and oct dec is apparently more severe than apr jun and jul sept the calmest sea states appear in jul sept when storms with a high h w max storm rarely occur however if the load time history is generated based on a weight average h w distribution and the storms are assumed to occur randomly in the lifetime the generated load time history may be inconsistent with real situations besides the existing cracks should grow faster in the two severe weather seasons while slower in the other two seasons in practice only seasonal based analyses can achieve that crack growth trend the storm profiles are generated in each season the h w ext of the severest storm of the season is the h w occurred only once in the season the duration of the severest storm is obtained by random number generation according to the proposed probabilistic model of d the number of levels and the number of h w in each level of the storm are determined consequently the number of the next class storms is calculated using equation 7 all the storm profiles in the season are generated until the h w max storm of the storm is 2h w mean 1 m fig 11 shows the generated storm profiles of the two severe weather seasons the sea states in the two seasons are divided into storms and calm seas using 2h w mean whose values are 8 m and 7 m respectively the h w ext for the two seasons are 13 m leading to 5 and 6 classes storm it can be seen that a severe storm is more likely to have a long duration note that in the generated severe storm there is a spike in h w i e the number of sea states for the highest level of the storm is 1 and for some following levels is 0 the reason is that the storm duration is relatively small leading to zero n j calculated using equation 5 for these levels this may be inconsistent with the real situation of a storm where not only one high h w occurs the consequence is that the number of storms in one season is significantly high compared with the observed number of storms there are 16 storms generated in jan mar while the total observed number of storms is 198 for 11 years another inconsistency is that some storms with a h w max storm higher than 13 m cannot be generated using the above procedures however these storms may occur during the lifetime and ignoring them is not conservative for the fcp analysis these storms can be inserted into some random years the calm sea h w in each season is generated on the basis of the truncated h w distribution the total number of the calm sea states is calculated by subtracting the sea state number of all storms from n total season all the short term sea states are divided into blocks making sure each block has one storm the one year statistics of the generated h w is compared with the regressed h w distribution which is obtained from the observed 11 year data as shown in fig 12 the good agreement indicates the storm model can lead to a good fitting of the h w distribution the existing storm model is based on the average wave data which can also generate a sequence of short term sea states the resulting h w distribution is approximately the same as the one obtained using the proposed method as shown in fig 12 the main difference between the proposed method and the existing storm model is that the seasonal wave data instead of the average wave data is used the proposed method can simulate the variation of fatigue damage accumulation and crack propagation among various seasons the h w histories in one year that are simulated using the seasonal and average wave data respectively are shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that the one based on the seasonal wave data is more reasonable while the one based on the average wave data illustrates no significant seasonal differences the wave induced stress history is modelled according to equations 11 14 in fact the encounter wave angle is different in different seasons and subjected to uncertainty the stress transfer function depends on the encounter wave angle in the present study the main focus is given to loading history reproduction procedures and crack propagation analyses to simplify the stress history generation for the study case the encounter wave angle effect is neglected and a constant transfer function of 1 5 is assumed it is assumed that the joint only experience axial loading acting on its brace the stress transfer function is used to link the wave loading and the axial stress in the stress history generation using the storm model the mean stress affects the r ratio of stress cycles and consequently the fcp rate predictions therefore the static stress should also be accounted for in the stress history generation in fact the variation of the static stress on the ship structural component has been considered when using the 1st generation storm model tomita et al 2004 the static axial stress on the brace is assumed to be 0 2σ y where σ y is the yield stress of the material the axial stress range history in one year is shown in fig 13 b it can be seen that the modelled stress range history clearly shows seasonal differences 4 fatigue crack propagation analysis the surface crack propagation is calculated using the crack growth rate model proposed by huang and moan 2007 2008 in engineering practice the most widely used model is the paris law which ignores the r ratio effect and load interaction effect a model considering the r ratio effect on crack growth rate using equivalent stress intensity factor sif range as the crack driving force was proposed by huang and moan 2007 the load interaction effect on crack growth under variable amplitude loading is then considered in the further development of the model huang et al 2008 the crack growth retardation caused by overload and the effect of an underload that follows an overload i e reduced crack growth retardation effect are considered by the model the proposed model was validated using experimental fcp data under various overload underload and spectrum loadings the expression of the model is 15 da

depending on the material property and environment σ y is the yield stress of the material details of the model can be found in huang and moan 2007 2008 if m r m p 1 the two effects are neglected the parameters used in the model for 350wt steel are given in table 2 the residual stresses in welded joints may have a significant influence on the fcp a general approach to consider the residual stress effect is to calculate the residual stress intensity factor k res and the effective r ratio k min k res k max k res the crack driving force which is the δk eq0 for the fatigue crack growth model applied in the present study can be corrected using the effective r ratio zhang et al 2018 the k res is usually calculated using the weight function method which requires the residual stress distribution and the weight function for the welded joint under consideration dong et al 2018 2020 dong and guedes soares 2019 the residual stress effect is neglected since it is not the primary focus of the present study for a short term sea state a sequence of stress ranges which follow the distribution described by equation 13 can be obtained through random data generation each stress range represents a stress cycle whose maximum and minimum stress can be determined given that the mean stress is assumed to be 0 2σ y for the stress cycle the k max k min δk and r used in the above equations can be calculated on the basis of the sif solutions proposed by rhee et al 1991 for the surface crack at the saddle point of the tubular t joint the sifs can be calculated according to the parametric formulae proposed by rhee et al 1991 based on the dimension of the tubular t joint the crack shape of propagating surface cracks is assumed to be semi elliptical and the crack propagation analysis is performed considering only the deepest and surface points of the surface crack the fatigue failure is defined as a 0 5t or c 0 4d one of the objectives of the present study is to provide a relatively conservative fcp analyses to achieve this objective it is necessary to investigate the crack growth uncertainties when using the loading history generated based on the proposed storm model the crack propagation analyses are performed for the period of a short term sea state a block a season and a year respectively the crack size after the period can be obtained by a cycle by cycle analysis the obtained crack size uncertainties are assessed before performing the uncertainty assessment the fcp is analyzed based on the hindcast wave data the year of 1996 where the h w and t z for every 3 h are provided the worst storm of 11 years occurred in the year of 1996 the h w history is shown in fig 14 a the seasonal differences in wave environments are illustrated it can be seen that for almost all the storms the h w increases continuously leading to a triangle storm profile in contrast the generated profile for some severe storms shows a spike in h w further improvement of the storm model is necessary if a short term sea state characterized by h w and t z is given the corresponding stress range distribution can be determined a fatigue loading history can be obtained through random data generation based on the h w t z data 100 fatigue loading histories of the year are generated and processed using the above crack propagation model the results are shown in fig 14 b because the crack depth a reaches 0 5t the fatigue loading histories in the first three seasons and a short period of the fourth season are actually applied it can be seen that the crack growth is different in different seasons e g the fast crack growth in the beginning due to the severe storms and the low crack growth in the second and third season this trend is also illustrated for other years as shown in fig 18 even though the sea state sequence is given the crack size uncertainty is shown and increases with the crack propagation in each sea state an infinite number of load histories can be generated for the same distribution each history of the sea state is a sample of stress ranges in a random sequence different load histories lead to the crack size uncertainty which accumulated with the crack growth the crack size uncertainty caused by various fatigue loading history is called statistical uncertainty in the present study a sample of 1000 short term loading histories are simulated to evaluate the statistical uncertainty the number of simulations is determined by a convergent study where the cov of the crack size gradually converges with the increase of the number of simulations the statistical uncertainty is mainly caused by two factors various samples and various sequences to identify the main factor a sample is generated and the elements of the sample are arranged in random order for 1000 times also resulting in 1000 loading histories besides the elements in the sample are arranged in ascending and descending order to calculate the crack size thus the load sequence effect on the obtained crack size can be illustrated fig 15 a shows the statistical uncertainty and load sequence effect for h w 13 m t z 13 s the statistical uncertainty and load sequence effect for m p 1 ignoring the load interaction effect based on the above mentioned loading histories are also shown in the figure since the crack length and depth show similar trends only the crack depth results are shown it can be seen in fig 15 a that load histories generated using the same distribution lead to significantly different crack sizes regardless of the load interaction effect ignoring the load interaction effect leads to faster crack growth for a short term sea state the load sequence effect on the obtained crack size is not significant when the elements in the sample are in random order however arranging the elements in ascending and descending order result in extremely large and small crack sizes respectively the reason is that the ascending order avoids the overload retardation effect i e m p 1 while the descending order actives the effect after the first cycle the load sequence effect for m p 1 is negligible and the obtained crack sizes are almost the same as the result of the ascending order case it indicates that in a short term sea state if the load interaction effect is considered the load sequence effect is not the main reason for the statistical uncertainty and if the load interaction effect is ignored the statistical uncertainty is mainly caused by various samples instead of various sequences in engineering practice the crack propagation analyses are generally performed based on the effective stress approach thayamballi et al 1984 or weight average crack growth approach dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 which ignores the load interaction effect in the present study the weight average approach is also used to verify its performance the approach propagates the crack using a weight average growth rate caused by stress ranges following the rayleigh distribution f δσ 22 d a dn a 0 d a dn a δ σ f δ σ dδ σ a series of stress ranges and their probabilities of occurrence can be obtained through the discretization of the continuous stress range distribution for each stress range which represents a stress cycle the crack growth rate can be obtained only using equation 15 17 since the load interaction effect is ignored by the weight average approach the integration is then performed based on the discrete crack growth rates and their probabilities of occurrence in a short term sea state a cycle by cycle analysis is carried out to propagate the crack which implies that the integration has to be calculated for each cycle the obtained crack size is 3 554 mm which is very close to the mean crack size when the randomly generated loading histories are processed assuming m p 1 comparing with the crack sizes considering the load interaction effect the weight average crack growth approach can lead to a conservative result the approach is also performed for h w 8 m t z 10 s as shown in fig 15 b the same conclusions can be obtained which validate the approach in fig 15 b the statistical uncertainty analyses are performed for h w 8 m t z 10 s which is the median of t z given h w the t z uncertainty is further included and thus the crack size uncertainty increases besides if the encounter wave angle uncertainty is considered the crack size uncertainty would be more significant the blocks containing a storm with h w max storm 13 m occurred in jan mar are generated because the above analyses show that arranging the elements of a sample of stress ranges in ascending order results in an extremely large crack size the stress ranges in each sea state of the block may be deliberately arranged to achieve a conservative crack propagation analysis therefore 1000 randomly generated blocks with ascending stress ranges in each sea state along with the blocks with descending and random stress ranges in each sea state are processed to calculate the crack sizes a convergent cov of the crack size has been achieved at the number of simulations besides the blocks with random stress ranges in each sea state are also processed assuming m p 1 the results are shown in fig 16 the crack size uncertainty is induced by the calm sea state and storm duration uncertainty in addition to the statistical and t z uncertainty in each sea state in each simulation of the block loading history the calm sea state sequence and storm durations are different the mean crack sizes for the ascending and descending stress ranges in each sea state are close to another while the scatter of the crack size for the descending stress ranges in each sea state is slightly higher the deliberately arranged sequences result in slower crack growth than the random sequence it implies that the deliberately arranged stress ranges in each sea state leads to a non conservative result for a random sequence this conclusion is in accordance with experimental results schijve 2001 maljaars et al 2015 the random sequence apparently activates the crack growth retardation effects but the deliberately arranged sequences lead to more significant retardation effects the fatigue loading histories for the season of jan mar are considered and the storm sequence effect on the resulting crack size is evaluated the storms characterized by h w max storm in the season are arranged with ascending random and descending h w max storm for each condition 100 loading histories are generated and processed to calculate their corresponding crack sizes a convergent cov of the crack size has been achieved at the number of simulations the loading histories with random storm sequence are also processed assuming m p 1 the results are shown in fig 17 it can be seen from the figure that the storm sequence effect is not significant the reason may be that the difference between most of the generated storms in one season is not significant and the duration of high amplitude loads in the storm is limited which further reduces the difference the resulting crack sizes for the descending storm sequences are slightly larger than for ascending and random storm sequences the reason may be that the significant cycles can immediately propagate the crack and make the small cycles in the following loading history more effective if these small cycles occur before the significant cycles their effects may be limited due to the crack propagation threshold it should be noted that the above explanation ignores the load interaction effect the significant storm may result in crack arrest due to the overload retardation effect consequently postponing the significant storm i e ascending storm sequence maybe the most dangerous sequence it is believed that both mechanisms exist and the former is more significant for the studied case according to the above analyses the crack size is subjected to considerable uncertainty after some crack propagation which is caused by the statistical t z calm sea state storm duration and storm sequence uncertainty the one year crack growth curves for 100 simulations are shown in fig 18 the crack growth analysis using a single simulation is not a practical solution since it may lead to non conservative results ignoring the load sequence effect leads to faster crack growth which may be the most convenient way to achieve a conservative fcp analysis the overlap between the crack size scatters considering and ignoring the load interaction effect for the season is less than for the block as shown in figs 16 and 17 with the crack growth the crack size obtained assuming m p 1 and using only one generated load history will continuously away from the crack size scatter this point is shown in fig 18 the crack growth curves based on the hindcast wave data of each year are also shown in the figure even though the crack growth situations are different in different years the crack growth trends are similar and show seasonal differences which are predicted using the proposed storm model it implies the seasonal based analyses and the assumed one year reference period are reasonable comparing with these crack growth curves the reproduced loading histories provide median crack growth curves the curves with faster crack growth are mainly attributed to the existence of severe storms with a h w max storm higher than 13 m which are not included in the reproduced load histories in practice repeating the reproduced loading history within one year inserting these extreme storms into some random years and simultaneously ignoring the load interaction effect may result in a conservative crack growth analysis 5 conclusions a procedure to generate load time histories for fatigue strength assessment of offshore structures has been presented in this paper the crack size uncertainty after a period of crack propagation is investigated for a tubular t joint joint with an initial surface crack when using the generated load time histories the fcp model proposed by huang et al 2007 2008 are employed which considers the r ratio and load interaction effects the following conclusions can be established the relations among the storm duration storm crest and the number of levels in a storm are formulated the storm duration is modelled as a lognormally distributed random variable whose mean value linearly increases with the number of levels in a storm according to the hindcast wave data the h w distributions of the four seasons are different and the environment in jan mar and oct dec is more severe the fast crack growth in these two seasons and the low crack growth in the other two seasons are shown for almost every year the seasonal based analyses and the assumed one year reference period are reasonable the proposed storm model can lead to a good fit of the observed h w distribution however the generated profile for some severe storms shows a spike in h w which is inconsistent with the real situation besides the one year loading history ignores some significant sea states further improvement of the model is necessary even though the model has some shortcomings the reproduced loading histories provide median crack growth curves comparing with the crack growth curves obtained using the observed wave data for a given short term sea state where the stress range distribution is deterministic the uncertainty of the obtained crack size is mainly caused by various samples of stress ranges and arranging the stress ranges in a sample in ascending and descending order result in extremely large and small crack sizes respectively when considering a period with a series of short term sea states the deliberately arranged stress ranges in ascending or descending order in each sea state result in slower crack growth than in random order in the present study the effect of the storm sequence in a season on the crack size scatter is not significant the crack size is subjected to considerable uncertainty after some crack propagation which is caused by the statistical t z calm sea state storm duration and storm sequence uncertainty ignoring the load sequence effect leads to faster crack growth which may be the most convenient way to achieve a conservative fcp analysis using only one generated loading

offshore structures 1 introduction fatigue failure is one of the most significant failure modes for marine structures which are subjected to complex loading histories during their service life to predict their fatigue lives and verify the fatigue strength it is significant to appropriately model the complex and random fatigue loading e g garbatov et al 2011 in practice the fatigue loading is generally described as a stress range distribution and thus the load sequence effect is ignored however experimental evidence indicates that the fatigue strength is considerably influenced by the load sequence which is of equal importance compared with other factors such as the calculation of stress concentration factors scfs and the choice of stress life curves cui et al 2011 it is well known that the widely used fatigue life prediction approaches based on the cumulative fatigue damage cfd theory cannot consider the load sequence effect and the crack size information therefore the fatigue crack propagation fcp theory is applied to overcome these deficiencies cui 2003 wang and cui 2009 the crack growth rate curves determined by experiments can reflect the fundamental fatigue property of the material being tested the fcp model e g paris law is then established to estimate the crack growth rate under various loading conditions the fatigue life of a structural component with an initial crack is predicted in a cycle by cycle manner over the past few decades many models have been proposed to estimate the crack growth rate wheeler 1972 newman 1981 mcevily et al 1999 sadananda et al 2001 okawa and sumi 2008 sumi and inoue 2011 huang et al 2008 cui et al 2011 chen et al 2012 their capabilities to explain various fatigue phenomena observed in tests have been demonstrated and validated by comparing with experimental results on a wide range of materials when using the fcp based approaches the primary problem is that the actual load time history is unknown and thus the load sequence effect cannot be appropriately considered for marine structures the long term wave induced fatigue load is model by a two parameter weibull distribution guedes soares and moan 1991 which is used to describe the stress range distribution the scale and shape parameter of the distribution can be determined by the spectral fatigue analysis guedes soares et al 2003 garbatov et al 2010 nguyen et al 2013 or by empirical formula and values recommended by classification societies this description of the fatigue load is not the load time history but the crack propagation analyses can still be performed based on the stress range distribution the effective stress approach thayamballi et al 1984 or weight average crack growth rate dong et al 2018 2020 zhang et al 2018 can be used apparently the load sequence and interaction effects are ignored in the analyses on the other hand the long term stress range series can be randomly generated following the weibull distribution leading to pseudo loading histories which are composed by a series of the maximum and minimum stresses determined based on the stress range however different samples and sequences of stress ranges can be obtained using the same distribution and the predicted fatigue life of a considered structure varies significantly cui et al 2011 it is far from satisfactory as the more realistic loading history is still undetermined it is necessary to present loading history generation models that can approximate the real structural fatigue loading history consisting of rough and calm seas baxevani et al 2009 proposed a stochastic wave model called spatio temporal model which can simulate significant wave height h w sequence with satellite wave data the load sequence was then determined using the obtained h w sequence this model was adopted to assess the fatigue strength of ship structural component mao et al 2010 2013 de gracia et al 2016 the spatio temporal model could be easily used for extreme prediction of sea conditions both along arbitrary ship routes and at the fixed locations however it does not contain the configuration feature of storms which can be observed from the measurements another load sequence generation model called storm model has been proposed and developed over the last two decades tomita et al 1995 kawabe 2002 kawabe et al 2003 prasetyo et al 2012 prasetyo 2013 tomita et al 1995 presented the 1st generation of the storm model based on the wave data collected from 38 ships that sailed in the north pacific ocean and 11 ships in the japan indian ocean over a period of 14 years basically ocean conditions were classified into either storms or calm seas storms were modelled as crescendo and decrescendo amplitude waveform of individual wave height h w and calm seas were modelled as time independent random waveform these two conditions randomly occur during the ships lifetime comparing with the spatio temporal model the storm profile is clearly defined the 1st generation storm model was further developed by kawabe 2002 and kawabe et al 2003 in three main aspects 1 the storm waveforms were described by significant wave height h w sequences instead of h w 2 the waveforms were determined so that h w s frequency distribution in a storm was similar to the tail of h w s long term distribution 3 the correlation between h w and mean wave period t z was taken into account it was called the 2nd generation storm model in the 1st and 2nd generation models it was assumed that storm duration remains unchanged in the analyzed sea areas 3 5 days for the north pacific ocean and the north atlantic ocean this assumption is not consistent with the real ocean condition where the duration varies for different storms it may deteriorate the accuracy of fatigue life estimation prasetyo et al 2012 and prasetyo 2013 developed the 3rd generation storm model based on the japan weather association jwa s hindcast wave data where the variation of storm durations was considered the load sequence experienced by marine structures can be approximately described by the existing storm models the fatigue loading is composed of different storms and calm seas both of which randomly occur during the design life the predicted fatigue life is subjected to uncertainty which is evaluated using many calculation results obtained under different simulations apparently the evaluation is always time consuming to save the computational time it is preferred to determine a fixed sequence of storms and calm seas which can be considered as the design load time history for the fatigue life prediction li and cui 2014 2016 proposed a procedure to generate the standardized load time histories slhs for marine structures where the worst loading history identified from all possible permutations of storms which results in the shortest fatigue life was chosen as the slh calm seas were not specifically located in the slh since they have much less effect on the crack growth than storms the slh was determined based on the 1st generation of the storm model and the storm duration was assumed to be a constant the slh covers a representative fraction a reference period of the design life rather than the total design life which makes the procedure of storm sequence determination much easier than in the whole lifetime one year is selected as the reference period for marine structures because a similar wave environment may take place every year the determined slh within the reference period is repeated several times in fatigue tests or numerical simulations until final failure occurs or the anticipated design life is covered one limitation of the study is that all the storm profiles were generated using the average wave scatter diagram wsd which means a single wsd for all different seasons it can lead to unrealistic storm profiles and storm sequences within one year e g severe storms may occur in calm seasons besides if the amount of all possible storm sequences within the reference period is significant it is impossible to evaluate all the possible sequences for example if there are 14 storms experienced by an offshore platform within one year the number of all possible storm sequences is 8 7e10 14 13 2 1 to overcome these limitations li and guedes soares 2017 presented an improved procedure to generate the slhs for offshore structures by using seasonal wsds instead of the average one based on the 2nd generation storm model separating one year into four seasons and performing the analysis within one season can reduce the number of possible storm sequences since the number of storms in one season is lower than in one year furthermore it can lead to more realistic loading histories for fcp assessment in the present study the hindcast wave data at one point in the north atlantic ocean over 11 years is analyzed and the storms are generated on a seasonal basis to make the storm profile generation more convenient the relations among the storm duration storm crest and the number of levels in a storm are formulated the statistical characteristics of the storm duration are obtained the randomly generated loading history leads to uncertain crack growth to achieve a relatively conservative fcp analyses the uncertainty of the crack size after a period of crack propagation is investigated the fcp analyses are performed for a tubular t joint with an initial surface crack using the model proposed by huang and moan 2007 2008 which considers the r ratio and load interaction effects 2 loading history generation 2 1 sea state sequence determination 2 1 1 wave data collection the wave data should be collected in the sea area where the considered offshore structure is expected to operate a short term sea state can be described by the significant wave height h w and mean wave period t z from a long term observation of the sea state both parameters are recorded divided into classes and the corresponding probability of each pair is written in a matrix i e wsd which is the most commonly used to describe the wave environment for marine structures according to the wsd the occurrence probability of each sea state h w t z can be estimated and even fitted by a joint distribution ferreira and guedes soares 2002 dong et al 2013 lucas and guedes soares 2015 in the present study the long term sea state for each season i e seasonal wsd in the studied sea area are needed to generate the load time history 2 1 2 storm profile in each season the mean value of h w h w mean and occurrence probability of each sea state h w t z can be obtained according to the seasonal wsd a threshold related to h w mean is used to divide storms and calm seas for example if the threshold is chosen as 2h w mean in calm seas the maximum h w is 2h w mean storms are classified according to the maximum h w in each storm h w max storm which ranges from 2h w mean 1 m to the extreme value of h w h w ext assuming the h w is an integer in each storm the crescendo and decrescendo waveform starts from h w min 1 h w max storm j end and is modelled as shown in fig 1 li and guedes soares 2017 it can be seen that in one storm j represents the levels of h w j end indicates the number of levels and n ss is the number of sea states that can be obtained as follows 1 n ss d h o u r i ob h o u r where d is the duration of a storm hour and i ob is the observation interval of sea state data hour which means a sea state stays unchanged during this short period then the total number of sea states in each season can be given as 2 n total season 0 25 y e a r 365 d a y 24 h o u r i ob h o u r the h w ext is determined as the h w happened once in the season which implies 1 n total season 1 f h w ext where f is the cumulative distribution function of h w in the previous work li and guedes soares 2017 d was assumed to be 3 5 days 84 h for all the storms and j end was determined based on the n ss and the distribution of h w which was assumed to be a weibull distribution prasetyo 2013 however a statistical analysis of the 11 year 1991 2001 hindcast wave data pilar et al 2008 campos and guedes soares 2016 with i ob 3 h at one point 28on 41ow in the north atlantic ocean as produced in the hipocas project guedes soares 2008 indicates that the h w distribution is more appropriately described by a lognormal distribution in fact while the weibull distribution is more appropriate to deal with the extreme values of wave data the log normal fits better the bulk of the data and thus is more appropriate to fatigue loading guedes soares and henriques 1996 guedes soares and scotto 2011 fig 2 shows the h w histogram in oct dec of 11 years along with the lognormal and weibull distributions fitted by using the maximum likelihood method apparently the former distribution is more reasonable for the present case in the present study both d and j end are considered to be variable for different storms to find the relations between these parameters the 11 year wave data is analyzed fig 3 shows how to extract j end and d in the history of h w in the figure a storm is simplified as an equivalent triangular which has a certain period where h w 2h w mean and the local maximum of h w is defined as h w max which is the crest of a storm the storm duration d is determined as t e t b where t e is the time of the local minimum which appears just after the triangular occurs and t b is the time of local minimum just before the triangular occurs for the number of levels in a storm j end h w max mean h w min 1 h w min 2 assuming the minimum step of h w is 1 m all the storms within 11 years each of which represents with h w max j d j j end j j 1 2 3 can be extracted by analyzing these data the relation between h w max and j end is established as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that j end generally increases with the h w max furthermore their relation can be fitted by the least square method as 3 j end 0 012 h w max 2 0 6596 h w max 2 3876 where the unit of h w max is meter the j end in each storm can be determined if the corresponding h w max is identified in the study of prasetyo 2013 the storm duration was assumed to be normally distributed regardless of the sea area but the parameters of the normal distribution were ocean dependent for the wave data analyzed in the present study the storm duration distribution is assumed to be lognormally distributed the storm duration determined from the observed wave data is shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the fitted lognormal distribution is in a good agreement with the observation besides the lognormal distribution does not allow the occurrence of negative values which satisfies the physical meaning of d therefore this type of distribution is employed to describe the storm duration uncertainty the storm durations are classified into different groups according to the number of levels of the storm and statistical analyses are performed within these groups the mean value and coefficient of variation cov of d as a function of j end are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the relation between j end and the mean value of d is approximately linear and can be expressed as 4 μ 8 5954 j end 33 808 where μ is the mean value of d hour there is no apparent relation between j end and cov of d therefore a constant cov of 0 4 is assumed here to describe the uncertainty of storm duration for each storm j end can be determined using equation 3 and its duration represented by a lognormal distribution with a mean value determined by equation 4 and a cov of 0 4 can be obtained by random number generation as shown in fig 1 the repeat number of h w in each level n j is determined so that the frequency distribution of n j is similar to its long term probability distribution as follows 5 n 1 int n ss p ex h w max storm 1 n 2 int n ss p ex h w max storm 1 n 1 n 3 int n ss p ex h w max storm 2 n 1 n 2 where p ex is the long term exceedance probability of h w the summation of n j should be equal to n ss the probability distribution of h w in calm seas p calm h w is a truncated lognormal distribution where the probability of h w 2h w mean is 0 the total number of calm sea states in one season is determined by n total season n ss the h w in a calm sea is determined by random number generation based on p calm h w 2 1 3 assessment of storm number let n i be the occurrence number of the i th class storm in one season then for the 1st severest class storm with h w max storm h w ext 6 n 1 n h w ext 1 for the 2nd class storm with h w max storm h w ext 1 m 7 n 2 n ext 1 n ext 1 where n ext 1 is the total occurrence number of sea states with h w h w ext 1 m n ext 1 is the number of sea states with h w h w ext 1 m that occurred in the 1st class storm by repeating this procedure the numbers of storms in all classes n i i 3 4 can be determined then the total number of all the storms in one season is given as 8 n storm season i 1 i end n i according to the total number of storms in one season the season is divided into some blocks making sure each block has one storm the number of calm sea states in these blocks is assumed to be identical since the calm sea states are more likely to have a low h w their location in the block may be not important thus the storm is assumed to be located in the middle of the block fig 7 shows an example if there are two storms in one season once h w is determined the mean wave period t z can be determined by random number generation using the conditional probability of t z given h w proposed by wan and shinkai 1995 9 p t z h w 1 2 π t z σ exp ln t z μ 2 2 σ 2 μ e ln t z h w σ 2 var ln t z h w where p t z h w is the conditional probability density for t z given h w the probability distribution of p t z h w can be obtained as 10 p h w t z p h w p t z h w thus the short term sea states in each block and the blocks in each season can be obtained 2 2 short term stress history when the short term sea state h w t z is determined the short term stress range distribution f δσ can be obtained by the following steps the heading angle of the studied structure is assumed according to the practical problem under consideration e g all heading model the wave energy spectrum is given by the pierson moskowitz spectrum 11 s η ω h w 2 4 π 2 π t z 4 ω 5 exp 1 π 2 π t z 4 ω 4 where ω is the wave frequency rad s the stress range response transfer function of the structural member analyzed h σ ω will be determined by performing wave load assessment and fem analyses e g guedes soares et al 2003 the stress response spectrum s σ ω e based on the linear model is obtained from the encountered wave spectrum s η ω e and stress transfer function h σ ω e 12 s σ ω e h σ ω e 2 s η ω e where ω e is the encountered wave frequency for each short term sea state the stress process can be assumed to be a zero mean narrow band gaussian process thus according to the random process theory the stress peak is rayleigh distributed the stress range is assumed to be twice the stress peak and the stress range distribution is 13 f δ σ 1 e x p δ σ 2 8 m 0 where m 0 is the zeroth moment of the stress response spectrum the total number of stress cycles associated with the short term sea state can be determined on the basis of the average zero up crossing rate which is given by 14 f 0 1 2 π m 2 m 0 where m 2 is the second moment of the stress response spectrum a sequence of stress ranges that follows the distribution can be obtained through random data generation each stress range represents a stress cycle whose maximum and minimum stress can be determined if the mean stress of the stress cycle is known connecting all the maximum and minimum stresses a pseudo stress history can be formed for the following fatigue crack propagation analyses 2 3 loading history in one year one year is recommended as the reference period when generating the fatigue loading history for offshore structures which have relatively fixed working locations because they experience a similar wave environment every year the h w distribution of each season is used to generate the storms and calm seas leading to the loading history in the season the loading histories of the four seasons occur sequentially in the year thus the determined loading history can avoid unrealistic storm profiles and storm sequences e g the winter storms occur in the summer the generated load time history within one year will be repeated until final failure occurs or the anticipated service life is covered shown in fig 8 note that some significant sea states are ignored in the generated loading history because the severest sea state h w ext is the sea state happened once in a season leading to non conservative results the sea state with a higher h w can be considered as the highest sea state of a storm and used to generate the storm according to the procedures introduced in section 2 1 2 these storms can be inserted into some random years within each season the sequence of storms blocks shows no regular pattern and is assumed to be random in the present study in a previous study li and guedes soares 2017 the storm sequence effect on the crack growth was investigated in one season among all the possible sequences the sequence with ascending storms resulted in the highest crack increments and recommended in fatigue crack analyses the reason was that after the storm the crack arrest occurs due to the overload retardation effect and postponing the most severe storm can postpone significant crack arrest however it is only a special case where the crack arrest due to storms is dominant a more general situation should be considered there are many uncertainty factors included in the loading history generation leading to various loading histories and crack growth conditions the above mentioned storm sequence is only one of these factors it is difficult to use only one generated load history to provide a conservative result the investigation on the crack growth uncertainties when using the generated load time history is necessary which is carried out in section 4 3 study case the study case analyzed here is a tubular t joint shown in fig 9 of an offshore platform assumed to be located in the point where the 11 year hindcast wave data is collected tubular t joints are widely used in offshore structures experimental results have shown that the saddle point is the fatigue prone location of the t joint under cyclic axial load acting on the brace in the present study a surface crack located at the saddle point with an initial crack depth a 3 5 mm and half crack length c 10 mm is considered for the fcp assessment the material of the t joint is 350wt steel the geometry of the tubular t joint is listed in table 1 if the sea state history data is available it can be directly used for the fcp analysis which can give the most accurate prediction the proposed storm model is mainly used when there is no measured sea state history data for some routes or fixed locations and only the seasonal wsd is available even though the study case uses the 11 year hindcast wave data to derive the loading history based on the proposed storm model the data is also used to verify the method presented in this paper as shown in this and the following sections thus the effectiveness of the proposed storm model can be demonstrated the loading history is generated according to the procedures introduced in section 2 based on the seasonal data of 11 years the h w distribution in each season is obtained fig 10 shows the relative frequency distributions of h w for the four seasons the environment in jan mar and oct dec is apparently more severe than apr jun and jul sept the calmest sea states appear in jul sept when storms with a high h w max storm rarely occur however if the load time history is generated based on a weight average h w distribution and the storms are assumed to occur randomly in the lifetime the generated load time history may be inconsistent with real situations besides the existing cracks should grow faster in the two severe weather seasons while slower in the other two seasons in practice only seasonal based analyses can achieve that crack growth trend the storm profiles are generated in each season the h w ext of the severest storm of the season is the h w occurred only once in the season the duration of the severest storm is obtained by random number generation according to the proposed probabilistic model of d the number of levels and the number of h w in each level of the storm are determined consequently the number of the next class storms is calculated using equation 7 all the storm profiles in the season are generated until the h w max storm of the storm is 2h w mean 1 m fig 11 shows the generated storm profiles of the two severe weather seasons the sea states in the two seasons are divided into storms and calm seas using 2h w mean whose values are 8 m and 7 m respectively the h w ext for the two seasons are 13 m leading to 5 and 6 classes storm it can be seen that a severe storm is more likely to have a long duration note that in the generated severe storm there is a spike in h w i e the number of sea states for the highest level of the storm is 1 and for some following levels is 0 the reason is that the storm duration is relatively small leading to zero n j calculated using equation 5 for these levels this may be inconsistent with the real situation of a storm where not only one high h w occurs the consequence is that the number of storms in one season is significantly high compared with the observed number of storms there are 16 storms generated in jan mar while the total observed number of storms is 198 for 11 years another inconsistency is that some storms with a h w max storm higher than 13 m cannot be generated using the above procedures however these storms may occur during the lifetime and ignoring them is not conservative for the fcp analysis these storms can be inserted into some random years the calm sea h w in each season is generated on the basis of the truncated h w distribution the total number of the calm sea states is calculated by subtracting the sea state number of all storms from n total season all the short term sea states are divided into blocks making sure each block has one storm the one year statistics of the generated h w is compared with the regressed h w distribution which is obtained from the observed 11 year data as shown in fig 12 the good agreement indicates the storm model can lead to a good fitting of the h w distribution the existing storm model is based on the average wave data which can also generate a sequence of short term sea states the resulting h w distribution is approximately the same as the one obtained using the proposed method as shown in fig 12 the main difference between the proposed method and the existing storm model is that the seasonal wave data instead of the average wave data is used the proposed method can simulate the variation of fatigue damage accumulation and crack propagation among various seasons the h w histories in one year that are simulated using the seasonal and average wave data respectively are shown in fig 13 a it can be seen that the one based on the seasonal wave data is more reasonable while the one based on the average wave data illustrates no significant seasonal differences the wave induced stress history is modelled according to equations 11 14 in fact the encounter wave angle is different in different seasons and subjected to uncertainty the stress transfer function depends on the encounter wave angle in the present study the main focus is given to loading history reproduction procedures and crack propagation analyses to simplify the stress history generation for the study case the encounter wave angle effect is neglected and a constant transfer function of 1 5 is assumed it is assumed that the joint only experience axial loading acting on its brace the stress transfer function is used to link the wave loading and the axial stress in the stress history generation using the storm model the mean stress affects the r ratio of stress cycles and consequently the fcp rate predictions therefore the static stress should also be accounted for in the stress history generation in fact the variation of the static stress on the ship structural component has been considered when using the 1st generation storm model tomita et al 2004 the static axial stress on the brace is assumed to be 0 2σ y where σ y is the yield stress of the material the axial stress range history in one year is shown in fig 13 b it can be seen that the modelled stress range history clearly shows seasonal differences 4 fatigue crack propagation analysis the surface crack propagation is calculated using the crack growth rate model proposed by huang and moan 2007 2008 in engineering practice the most widely used model is the paris law which ignores the r ratio effect and load interaction effect a model considering the r ratio effect on crack growth rate using equivalent stress intensity factor sif range as the crack driving force was proposed by huang and moan 2007 the load interaction effect on crack growth under variable amplitude loading is then considered in the further development of the model huang et al 2008 the crack growth retardation caused by overload and the effect of an underload that follows an overload i e reduced crack growth retardation effect are considered by the model the proposed model was validated using experimental fcp data under various overload underload and spectrum loadings the expression of the model is 15 da

depending on the material property and environment σ y is the yield stress of the material details of the model can be found in huang and moan 2007 2008 if m r m p 1 the two effects are neglected the parameters used in the model for 350wt steel are given in table 2 the residual stresses in welded joints may have a significant influence on the fcp a general approach to consider the residual stress effect is to calculate the residual stress intensity factor k res and the effective r ratio k min k res k max k res the crack driving force which is the δk eq0 for the fatigue crack growth model applied in the present study can be corrected using the effective r ratio zhang et al 2018 the k res is usually calculated using the weight function method which requires the residual stress distribution and the weight function for the welded joint under consideration dong et al 2018 2020 dong and guedes soares 2019 the residual stress effect is neglected since it is not the primary focus of the present study for a short term sea state a sequence of stress ranges which follow the distribution described by equation 13 can be obtained through random data generation each stress range represents a stress cycle whose maximum and minimum stress can be determined given that the mean stress is assumed to be 0 2σ y for the stress cycle the k max k min δk and r used in the above equations can be calculated on the basis of the sif solutions proposed by rhee et al 1991 for the surface crack at the saddle point of the tubular t joint the sifs can be calculated according to the parametric formulae proposed by rhee et al 1991 based on the dimension of the tubular t joint the crack shape of propagating surface cracks is assumed to be semi elliptical and the crack propagation analysis is performed considering only the deepest and surface points of the surface crack the fatigue failure is defined as a 0 5t or c 0 4d one of the objectives of the present study is to provide a relatively conservative fcp analyses to achieve this objective it is necessary to investigate the crack growth uncertainties when using the loading history generated based on the proposed storm model the crack propagation analyses are performed for the period of a short term sea state a block a season and a year respectively the crack size after the period can be obtained by a cycle by cycle analysis the obtained crack size uncertainties are assessed before performing the uncertainty assessment the fcp is analyzed based on the hindcast wave data the year of 1996 where the h w and t z for every 3 h are provided the worst storm of 11 years occurred in the year of 1996 the h w history is shown in fig 14 a the seasonal differences in wave environments are illustrated it can be seen that for almost all the storms the h w increases continuously leading to a triangle storm profile in contrast the generated profile for some severe storms shows a spike in h w further improvement of the storm model is necessary if a short term sea state characterized by h w and t z is given the corresponding stress range distribution can be determined a fatigue loading history can be obtained through random data generation based on the h w t z data 100 fatigue loading histories of the year are generated and processed using the above crack propagation model the results are shown in fig 14 b because the crack depth a reaches 0 5t the fatigue loading histories in the first three seasons and a short period of the fourth season are actually applied it can be seen that the crack growth is different in different seasons e g the fast crack growth in the beginning due to the severe storms and the low crack growth in the second and third season this trend is also illustrated for other years as shown in fig 18 even though the sea state sequence is given the crack size uncertainty is shown and increases with the crack propagation in each sea state an infinite number of load histories can be generated for the same distribution each history of the sea state is a sample of stress ranges in a random sequence different load histories lead to the crack size uncertainty which accumulated with the crack growth the crack size uncertainty caused by various fatigue loading history is called statistical uncertainty in the present study a sample of 1000 short term loading histories are simulated to evaluate the statistical uncertainty the number of simulations is determined by a convergent study where the cov of the crack size gradually converges with the increase of the number of simulations the statistical uncertainty is mainly caused by two factors various samples and various sequences to identify the main factor a sample is generated and the elements of the sample are arranged in random order for 1000 times also resulting in 1000 loading histories besides the elements in the sample are arranged in ascending and descending order to calculate the crack size thus the load sequence effect on the obtained crack size can be illustrated fig 15 a shows the statistical uncertainty and load sequence effect for h w 13 m t z 13 s the statistical uncertainty and load sequence effect for m p 1 ignoring the load interaction effect based on the above mentioned loading histories are also shown in the figure since the crack length and depth show similar trends only the crack depth results are shown it can be seen in fig 15 a that load histories generated using the same distribution lead to significantly different crack sizes regardless of the load interaction effect ignoring the load interaction effect leads to faster crack growth for a short term sea state the load sequence effect on the obtained crack size is not significant when the elements in the sample are in random order however arranging the elements in ascending and descending order result in extremely large and small crack sizes respectively the reason is that the ascending order avoids the overload retardation effect i e m p 1 while the descending order actives the effect after the first cycle the load sequence effect for m p 1 is negligible and the obtained crack sizes are almost the same as the result of the ascending order case it indicates that in a short term sea state if the load interaction effect is considered the load sequence effect is not the main reason for the statistical uncertainty and if the load interaction effect is ignored the statistical uncertainty is mainly caused by various samples instead of various sequences in engineering practice the crack propagation analyses are generally performed based on the effective stress approach thayamballi et al 1984 or weight average crack growth approach dong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 which ignores the load interaction effect in the present study the weight average approach is also used to verify its performance the approach propagates the crack using a weight average growth rate caused by stress ranges following the rayleigh distribution f δσ 22 d a dn a 0 d a dn a δ σ f δ σ dδ σ a series of stress ranges and their probabilities of occurrence can be obtained through the discretization of the continuous stress range distribution for each stress range which represents a stress cycle the crack growth rate can be obtained only using equation 15 17 since the load interaction effect is ignored by the weight average approach the integration is then performed based on the discrete crack growth rates and their probabilities of occurrence in a short term sea state a cycle by cycle analysis is carried out to propagate the crack which implies that the integration has to be calculated for each cycle the obtained crack size is 3 554 mm which is very close to the mean crack size when the randomly generated loading histories are processed assuming m p 1 comparing with the crack sizes considering the load interaction effect the weight average crack growth approach can lead to a conservative result the approach is also performed for h w 8 m t z 10 s as shown in fig 15 b the same conclusions can be obtained which validate the approach in fig 15 b the statistical uncertainty analyses are performed for h w 8 m t z 10 s which is the median of t z given h w the t z uncertainty is further included and thus the crack size uncertainty increases besides if the encounter wave angle uncertainty is considered the crack size uncertainty would be more significant the blocks containing a storm with h w max storm 13 m occurred in jan mar are generated because the above analyses show that arranging the elements of a sample of stress ranges in ascending order results in an extremely large crack size the stress ranges in each sea state of the block may be deliberately arranged to achieve a conservative crack propagation analysis therefore 1000 randomly generated blocks with ascending stress ranges in each sea state along with the blocks with descending and random stress ranges in each sea state are processed to calculate the crack sizes a convergent cov of the crack size has been achieved at the number of simulations besides the blocks with random stress ranges in each sea state are also processed assuming m p 1 the results are shown in fig 16 the crack size uncertainty is induced by the calm sea state and storm duration uncertainty in addition to the statistical and t z uncertainty in each sea state in each simulation of the block loading history the calm sea state sequence and storm durations are different the mean crack sizes for the ascending and descending stress ranges in each sea state are close to another while the scatter of the crack size for the descending stress ranges in each sea state is slightly higher the deliberately arranged sequences result in slower crack growth than the random sequence it implies that the deliberately arranged stress ranges in each sea state leads to a non conservative result for a random sequence this conclusion is in accordance with experimental results schijve 2001 maljaars et al 2015 the random sequence apparently activates the crack growth retardation effects but the deliberately arranged sequences lead to more significant retardation effects the fatigue loading histories for the season of jan mar are considered and the storm sequence effect on the resulting crack size is evaluated the storms characterized by h w max storm in the season are arranged with ascending random and descending h w max storm for each condition 100 loading histories are generated and processed to calculate their corresponding crack sizes a convergent cov of the crack size has been achieved at the number of simulations the loading histories with random storm sequence are also processed assuming m p 1 the results are shown in fig 17 it can be seen from the figure that the storm sequence effect is not significant the reason may be that the difference between most of the generated storms in one season is not significant and the duration of high amplitude loads in the storm is limited which further reduces the difference the resulting crack sizes for the descending storm sequences are slightly larger than for ascending and random storm sequences the reason may be that the significant cycles can immediately propagate the crack and make the small cycles in the following loading history more effective if these small cycles occur before the significant cycles their effects may be limited due to the crack propagation threshold it should be noted that the above explanation ignores the load interaction effect the significant storm may result in crack arrest due to the overload retardation effect consequently postponing the significant storm i e ascending storm sequence maybe the most dangerous sequence it is believed that both mechanisms exist and the former is more significant for the studied case according to the above analyses the crack size is subjected to considerable uncertainty after some crack propagation which is caused by the statistical t z calm sea state storm duration and storm sequence uncertainty the one year crack growth curves for 100 simulations are shown in fig 18 the crack growth analysis using a single simulation is not a practical solution since it may lead to non conservative results ignoring the load sequence effect leads to faster crack growth which may be the most convenient way to achieve a conservative fcp analysis the overlap between the crack size scatters considering and ignoring the load interaction effect for the season is less than for the block as shown in figs 16 and 17 with the crack growth the crack size obtained assuming m p 1 and using only one generated load history will continuously away from the crack size scatter this point is shown in fig 18 the crack growth curves based on the hindcast wave data of each year are also shown in the figure even though the crack growth situations are different in different years the crack growth trends are similar and show seasonal differences which are predicted using the proposed storm model it implies the seasonal based analyses and the assumed one year reference period are reasonable comparing with these crack growth curves the reproduced loading histories provide median crack growth curves the curves with faster crack growth are mainly attributed to the existence of severe storms with a h w max storm higher than 13 m which are not included in the reproduced load histories in practice repeating the reproduced loading history within one year inserting these extreme storms into some random years and simultaneously ignoring the load interaction effect may result in a conservative crack growth analysis 5 conclusions a procedure to generate load time histories for fatigue strength assessment of offshore structures has been presented in this paper the crack size uncertainty after a period of crack propagation is investigated for a tubular t joint joint with an initial surface crack when using the generated load time histories the fcp model proposed by huang et al 2007 2008 are employed which considers the r ratio and load interaction effects the following conclusions can be established the relations among the storm duration storm crest and the number of levels in a storm are formulated the storm duration is modelled as a lognormally distributed random variable whose mean value linearly increases with the number of levels in a storm according to the hindcast wave data the h w distributions of the four seasons are different and the environment in jan mar and oct dec is more severe the fast crack growth in these two seasons and the low crack growth in the other two seasons are shown for almost every year the seasonal based analyses and the assumed one year reference period are reasonable the proposed storm model can lead to a good fit of the observed h w distribution however the generated profile for some severe storms shows a spike in h w which is inconsistent with the real situation besides the one year loading history ignores some significant sea states further improvement of the model is necessary even though the model has some shortcomings the reproduced loading histories provide median crack growth curves comparing with the crack growth curves obtained using the observed wave data for a given short term sea state where the stress range distribution is deterministic the uncertainty of the obtained crack size is mainly caused by various samples of stress ranges and arranging the stress ranges in a sample in ascending and descending order result in extremely large and small crack sizes respectively when considering a period with a series of short term sea states the deliberately arranged stress ranges in ascending or descending order in each sea state result in slower crack growth than in random order in the present study the effect of the storm sequence in a season on the crack size scatter is not significant the crack size is subjected to considerable uncertainty after some crack propagation which is caused by the statistical t z calm sea state storm duration and storm sequence uncertainty ignoring the load sequence effect leads to faster crack growth which may be the most convenient way to achieve a conservative fcp analysis using only one generated loading
