14835,radical and non radical oxidation pathways have been universally validated in transition metals tms oxides activated peroxymonosulfate pms processes however achieving high efficiency and selectivity of pms activation remains challenging due to the ambiguous tuning mechanism of tms sites on pms activation in thermodynamic scope herein we demonstrated that the exclusive pms oxidation pathways were regulated by d orbital electronic configuration of b sites in delafossites cubo2 for orange i degradation coiii 3d 6 for reactive oxygen species ross vs criii 3d 3 for electron transfer pathway the d orbital electronic configuration was identified to affect the orbital overlap extent between 3d of b sites and o 2p of pms which induced b sites offering different types of hybrid orbital to coordinate with o 2p of pms thereby forming the high spin complex cucoo2 pms or the low spin complex cucro2 pms on which basis pms was selectively dissociated to form ross or achieve electron transfer pathway as indicated by thermodynamic analysis a general rule was proposed that b sites of less than half filled 3d orbital tended to act as electron shuttle i e criii 3d 3 mniii 3d 4 interacting with pms to execute an electron transfer pathway for degrading orange i while b sites of between half filled and full filled 3d orbital preferred to be electron donator i e coiii 3d 6 feiii 3d 5 activating pms to generate ross these findings lay a foundation for the oriented design of tms based catalysts from the atomic level according to d orbital electronic configuration optimization as so to facilitate the achievement of pms aops with highly selective and efficient remediation of contaminants in water purification practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate transition metal d orbital electron configuration oxidation pathway tuning mechanism data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction heterogeneous advanced oxidation progresses aops employing peroxymonosulfate pms is one of the most efficient environmental purification technologies to meet the ever growing demand for clean water resources duan et al 2018a lee et al 2020 during such process various reactive oxygen species ross such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 are in situ generated by breaking peroxy oo bond in pms molecules via electron or energy transfer processes hodges et al 2018 qi et al 2022 the generated so4 e 0 2 6 3 1 vnhe or oh e 0 1 9 2 7 vnhe with high redox potentials will efficiently degrade and mineralize a broad spectrum of refractory organic contaminants li et al 2020 however the radical oxidation pathway is sensitive to environmental matrix e g natural organic matter and halogen ions which will quench the generated ross and form toxic by products clo3 bro3 posing secondary environmental risks recently non radical pathways including singlet oxygenation electron transfer processes and activated high valent metal regarded as the promising oxidation processes chen et al 2021 duan et al 2018b huang and zhang 2019 higher pms utilization efficiency and less susceptibility for the solution ph or background substances make non radical oxidation have more technical advantages in actual water treatment ren et al 2022 yao et al 2019 but these non radical reactions are moderate compared with the strongly oxidizing radical systems leading to insufficient mineralization of total organic carbons zhang et al 2021 therefore directional regulating the radical non radical pathway of pms activation by catalysts tailoring is of importance to improve the applicability of pms aops in different surrounding environments polyvalent transition metals tms with unfilled d orbits such as co mn fe cu etc are enabled to efficiently activate pms by electron transfer in redox cycle kohantorabi et al 2021 it is widely accepted that different tms sites can induce different ross and pms oxidation pathways fig s1 however the underlying relationship between tms sites and pms oxidation pathway remains unclear substantial effort has been devoted to revealing the intrinsic mechanism of pms activation by tms crystal form of tms sites 2h type vs 3r type was already revealed to have a decisive impact on the reactive species evolution in pms activation zhao et al 2019 in addition it was found that the covalency environment degree of tms sites co o vs mn o was essential to determine pms activation features guo et al 2021 meanwhile the structure around tms sites vacancy vs edges also tailors the radical non radical pathways of pms activation li et al 2022a wu et al 2021 although above mechanisms are all strongly related to the structural properties of bulk catalysts the intrinsic origin of the catalytic behavior i e the electronic property of tms governing the pms oxidation pathway is still unknown proposing a universal tuning mechanism related to the electronic properties of tms to explain the pms oxidation pathway is urgently in need of exploration which is also of significance for rational regulation of pms aops the d orbital electronic configuration is one of the most crucial chemical parameters related to the electronic properties of tms do and lee 2022 recent advances figured out that d orbital electronic configuration governed the decomposition behavior of oxygen containing substances in the field of catalysis i e oxygen reduction reaction water splitting sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 current literature of pms aops also displayed that specific d orbital electronic configuration of tms could induce exclusive pms oxidation pathway miao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 however they mainly focused on kinetic relationship between d orbital electronic configuration of individual tm site and pms catalytic activity in a particular catalytic system the in depth insight into the tuning mechanism of the d orbital electronic configuration of tms affecting the pms oxidation pathway from the thermodynamic view is still far from being understood it arouses many interesting questions i what is the difference in the pms oxidation pathway over tms sites with distinct d orbital electronic configuration thermodynamic behavior ii how the d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites induces the interface interaction between catalysts and pms i e adsorption coordination dissociation thermodynamic process iii what is the electron transfer behaviors affected by d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites during pms activation thermodynamic potential this work focused on delivering a full picture towards the tuning mechanism of d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites on regulating the pms oxidation pathway for pollutant remediation to achieve the goal we developed two copper delafossite cubo2 with b site cations of coiii 3d 6 and criii 3d 3 as typical catalysts to activate pms for orange i degradation distinct pms oxidation pathways were identified over cucoo2 and cucro2 the d orbital electronic configuration of b site metals co or cr was distinguished as the decisive factor in governing the pms oxidation pathway one step further the pms oxidation pathway discrepancy origin of d orbital electronic configuration in b site was fully deciphered based on the thermodynamic view of i the apparent interaction behaviors i e adsorption coordination dissociation and ii the inherent electron transfer behaviors i e electron donator electron shuttle finally the proposed tuning mechanism was well verified to function as a general rule via the identification of the pms oxidation pathway activated by cumno2 mn 3d 4 and cufeo2 fe 3d 5 this work paved a way for oriented design of on demand catalysts to precisely regulate pms oxidation pathways in the light of diverse actual water remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were used without any purification deionized di water was employed for preparing all solutions more details of chemicals could be noted in table s1 cubo2 was prepared using a similar hydrothermal method tong et al 2018 du et al 2018 typically 15 mmol cu no3 2 3h2o and 15 mmol co no3 2 6h2o or cr no3 2 9h2o mn no3 2 4h2o fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 70 ml di water after that 5 0 g naoh was added to the above solution and stirred for 20 min then the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave after the reaction was kept at 100 c for 24 h or 240 c for 60 h 160 c for 24 h 160 c for 24 h the produced precipitate was washed with di water and ethanol in sequence several times finally cucoo2 or cucro2 cumno2 cufeo2 powder was collected after drying in an oven at 80 c for 8 h 2 2 characterization the detailed characterization methods were described in text s1 2 3 evaluation of catalytic activity the performance of catalyst was assessed in a 500 ml beaker containing 5 mg l 1 oi at 25 2 c the ph value of reaction system was adjusted by 0 1 mmol l 1 naoh or hno3 solution in a typical procedure 500 ml of oi solution containing 0 05 g catalyst was firstly stirred for 30 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium a certain concentration of pms aqueous solution was then added to the above mentioned solution to start the oxidation reaction at predetermined time intervals 5 ml of water sample was withdrawn by a glass syringe and immediately quenched with sodium sulfite then it was filtrated through a glass fiber filter of 0 22 Î¼m pore size for analysis all batch experiments were conducted in triplicates for accuracy and reproducibility 2 4 analysis methods the concentration of oi was analyzed by a tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer china at a wavelength of 480 5 nm bisphenol a bpa phenol pn sulfamethoxazole smx and benzoic acid ba were measured via hplc agilent 1260 infinity ii usa with an agilent sb c18 column the hplc analytical methods were presented in table s2 total organic carbon toc was detected by a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 jena germany a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo china was used to measure ph values in solution the concentration of pms was determined by the kscn method wang et al 2014 the reactive oxygen species were detected by electron spin resonance esr bruker germany using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo 100 mm and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp 100 mm as spin trapping agents the calculation method of the contribution of ross was given in text s2 2 5 theoretical calculation methods to understand the selectivity towards ross or electron transfer pathway in the cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms system density functional theory dft calculations were employed using vienna ab initio simulation package vasp the specific procedures were included in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms activation on cucoo2 and cucro2 we observed that the typical 3r delafossites of cucoo2 jcpds 21 0256 and cucro2 jcpds 39 0247 were successfully prepared through a simple hydrothermal method fig s2 and their physicochemical properties were given in text s4 figs s2 to s5 cucoo2 and cucro2 exhibited much better catalytic properties to pms activation for orange i oi degradation than pms alone under optimization of reaction conditions figs 1 a and s6 notably though cucro2 showed a higher adsorption capacity towards oi 28 than that of cucoo2 due to its larger ssa fig s7 cucro2 and cucoo2 exhibited a comparative performance for pms activation with oi removal efficiency of 93 and 98 respectively it was also worth noting that cucoo2 pms presented a faster kinetic process kobs 0 221 min 1 and more effective toc removal rtoc 36 than the counterparts kobs 0 127 min 1 rtoc 18 of cucro2 pms figs 1a and s8 these results inferred that there were significant differences in oi degradation process in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms such a conclusion could be also verified by oi degradation efficiency in real water matrix domestic sewage or secondary effluent where cucro2 maintained excellent selectivity for oi removal roi 90 while a severe inhibition occurred in cucoo2 pms roi 50 fig 1b additionally it could be seen the obvious selective degradation of other pollutants between cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms fig s9 cucoo2 pms showed good degradation on bpa pn ba and smx with the values of 90 87 58 40 while pollutants containing electron donating groups bpa 58 pn 54 could be degraded more easily than others ba 3 smx 7 in cucro2 pms the obvious different reaction activation energy ea values 56 4 kj mol 1 of cucoo2 vs 13 6 kj mol 1 of cucro2 figs s10 and s11 seemed to be indicative of that the above phenomenon was induced by the differences in thermodynamic behavior of pms activation by cucoo2 and cucro2 which induced the different oxidation pathways radical or non radical for oi degradation jawad et al 2020 3 2 distinct oxidation pathways in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms the generation of reactive species e g ross catalyst pms complex determined the oxidation pathway in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms chemical quenching experiments and esr measurements were conducted to identify the reactive species in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms as shown in fig 2 a to c tba oh scavenger k oh tba 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 negligibly inhibited while meoh oh and so4 scavenger k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so 4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 caused a 42 reduction of oi degradation in cucoo2 pms fig 2a zhao et al 2020 however the characteristic esr signals from dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were both observed fig 2b implying that both oh and so4 were generated but only so4 involved in oi degradation for cucoo2 pms zhen et al 2021 in addition about 50 suppression of oi degradation was obtained when adding ffa 1o2 scavenger k 1 o 2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 in cucoo2 pms wu et al 2022 and a noticeable oi degradation enhancement was observed kobs 0 221 min 1 to kobs 0 286 min 1 fig s12a after replacing h2o with d2o to prolong the 1o2 lifetime yang et al 2022a indicating that 1o2 was also a major reactive species contributing to oi degradation in cucoo2 pms it was further supported by the fact that adding temp as the 1o2 trapping agent generated a more intensive esr signal of temp 1o2 in cucoo2 pms in comparison with that of pms alone and additionally enhanced with solvent exchange from h2o to d2o as well as decreased with oi addition fig 2c furthermore negligible influence of sod o2 scavenger addition on oi degradation and lack of obvious esr signal of dmpoo2 suggested that o2 was hardly involved in oi degradation fig s13 yang et al 2019 also the 1o2 was not formed by o2 intermediate but from pms decomposition by cucoo2 catalyzation in comparison no matter the addition of tba meoh ffa or sod had no adverse effect on oi degradation in the case of cucro2 pms fig 2a and there was no significant difference in oi removal using d2o as an alternative solvent fig s12b moreover dmpo or temp trapping esr did not show any obvious signal of adducts fig 2b and c these manifested that no ross were produced in cucro2 pms the experiment of ph effect indicated that oi removal in cucro2 pms was mainly carried out by the surface reaction where k oi of cucro2 pms system decreased from 99 to 50 as ph increased from 3 0 to 11 0 figs 2d and s14 it could be explained by ph dependent cucro2 surface charges phpzc cucro2 7 4 with the ph elevating the electrostatic repulsion between the cucro2 surface and hso5 became pronounced resulting in a lower effective activation of pms unexpectedly the highest k oi 0 221 min 1 in cucoo2 pms phpzc cucoo2 7 2 was obtained under neutral ph and a less effective against oi elimination under the initial acidic or alkaline condition which was a common phenomenon observed in radical dominant systems ren et al 2015 these results confirmed the hypothesis fig 1 that the oxidation pathway in cucro2 pms differed from cucoo2 pms oi degradation in cucro2 pms might mainly proceed via some other non radical pathways based on the surface oxidation process to provide deep insights into non radical pathways that occurred in cucro2 pms we further explored the electron transfer pathway that is the direct degradation of oi by the catalyst pms complex labeled pms as pms adsorption onto the catalyst is the initial step in the formation of pms in situ raman was conducted to investigate the interaction between cucro2 and pms as shown in figs s15 and s16 three peaks assigned to stretching vibrations of oo 883 cm 1 so4 2 961 cm 1 and so3 2 1080 cm 1 were clearly observed in the pms solution wei et al 2022 after the addition of cucro2 a newly strong peak located at 829 cm 1 appeared which was already indexed as metastable reactive peroxo species i e pms triggered by pms attaching onto the catalyst surface in previous studies si et al 2022 in addition when oi was added in cucro2 pms the pms and oo peaks markedly decreased or even disappeared these results demonstrated the fact that pms conversed into pms reactive species via intense surface interaction between pms and cucro2 and then contributed to the oi degradation in cucro2 pms for further validation the open circuit potential ocp was recorded in situ by using catalysts as electrodes fig s17 the origin potential of cucro2 rose rapidly from 0 16 v to 0 19 v and stabilized at 0 20 v upon pms addition and then continued to increase 0 74 v with the injection of oi such variation of ocp confirmed the process of generation of pms via the oxidation of the cucro2 surface by pms and subsequent occurrence of the electron transfer process between oi and the pms in cucro2 pms yang et al 2022b moreover the chronoamperometric i t curves presented the detailed electron transfer orientation fig 2e a faint negative current emerged after adding pms into cucro2 and a further boost of current density was correspondingly observed with the introduction of oi suggesting that oi directly donated electrons to pms to be oxidized with cucro2 as an electron channel to finish oi degradation by a dominant electron transfer non radical pathway xu et al 2023 compared to those in cucro2 pms the formation and consumption of pms were very inconspicuous along with that a drastic current jump fig 2e and continuous ocp increase fig s17 derived from massive electrons exchange between cucoo2 and pms for so4 and 1o2 production it was suggested the minor role of the electron transfer pathway in cucoo2 pms which was consistent with quenching experiments and esr results additionally the contribution of high valence metal oxo species for oi degradation in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms was also excluded by insignificantly adverse effects of dmso in quenching experiment fig s18 zheng et al 2020 comprehensively all these results validated that ross based so4 and 1o2 oxidation pathway was predominant for oi degradation in cucoo2 pms on the contrary the electron transfer pms pathway mainly contributed to oi degradation in cucro2 pms further calculation details in text s2 presented that the relative contributions of so4 and 1o2 species in the cucoo2 pms system were 46 and 42 respectively while oi degradation in the cucro2 pms system was all due to the electron transfer pathway fig 2f liang et al 2022 3 3 predominant active site in regulating pms oxidation pathway tuning the b site metal species co to cr in 3r delafossite cubo2 caused the pms oxidation pathway to shift from ros to pms dominant oxidation process indicating the predominant active site of cubo2 for regulating the pms oxidation pathway highly linked to the b site certainly it was inevitable that replacing b site metal could not only change one of the lattice elements in cubo2 but also altered the chemical state of neighboring coordinate elements namely cu and o among these which was the predominant active site for pms activation deserved further study generally o species fig s19 especially for oxygen vacancy 530 5 ev and surface hydroxyl groups 531 5 ev usually acted as electron donors or electron shuttles to activate pms wang et al 2022a however it was noted that purging n2 had a positive effect on oi degradation in both cucro2 pms and cucoo2 pms fig s20 which was absolutely contrary to the inhibitory effect of n2 in oxygen vacancy mediated pms activation system wu et al 2021 this was a typical phenomenon in the metal redox mediated pms activation process that the absence of o2 competing electron acceptors enabled more electrons to be transferred to pms for generating more reactive species with higher oxidation capacity besides there was any influence on oi degradation when using clo4 1 50 mmol l 1 to shield hydroxyl groups on catalysts in the cucoo2 pms or cucro2 pms fig s21 wang et al 2014 it could be deduced that o species were not the predominant active site in cucoo2 and cucro2 for pms activation which meant that metal species rather than o species in cubo2 contributed more to regulating the pms oxidation pathway theoretically the redox cycle and average oxidation states aos of metal species have a significant impact on the pms oxidation pathway we examined the specific valent state distribution of cu in the different delafossites fig s19b and table s4 the high resolution of cu 2p spectra showed the presence of both cui 931 9 ev and cuii 933 8 ev mi et al 2022 where the integrated areas of cui and cuii spectra in cucoo2 cui 71 2 cuii 28 8 and cucro2 cui 72 2 cuii 27 8 were similar suggesting the approximative aos for surface cu in addition of that negligible variation of cui cuii ratio after being used was observed in the redox cycle for both cucoo2 and cucro2 collectively excluding the role of cu in regulating the pms oxidation pathways furthermore similar and low pms adsorption energy e ads over cu sites on 012 plane of cucoo2 and cucro2 gave further confirmation fig s22 table s5 it was indicative of the predominant active site of co and cr in cubo2 for regulating the pms oxidation pathway which was preferably supported by their obviously different aos and variation of bii biii ratio after being used fig s19c wang et al 2022b liu et al 2020 however the in depth understanding of the thermodynamic process for b site metal co and cr on modulating the distinct pms oxidation pathways still needed more elaborate exploration 3 4 pms activation governed by d electronic configuration of tms sites during pms activation the thermodynamic interaction process between transition metals tms sites and pms including adsorption coordination and dissociation of pms critically governed the formation of pms or ross for pollutant oxidation specifically pms anions adsorbed on the surface of tms based catalysts to form precursor complexes then its o 2p orbital was coordinated to the d orbital of tms sites by Ï bonding to achieve an approximation of their spin state and orbital orientation further triggering electron transfer and driving pms dissociation via various radical or non radical pathways hosmane 2017 in these processes whether the adsorption coordination or dissociation of pms was close to the electronic configuration of tms thus the d orbital electronic configuration of b site metal played a decisive role in regulating the pms activation by cubo2 notably coiii and criii were provided with obvious distinct 3d orbital electron configurations the 3d subshells of coiii 3d 6 were between half filled and full filled whereas criii 3d 3 was less than half filled co or cr was located at the center of coo6 or cro6 octahedra in delafossite its d orbital could split into two energy levels groups i e eg and t2g in the category of crystal field theory stephanos and addison 2017 when pms adsorbed onto cubo2 eg orbital of b sites metal would overlap with o 2p of pms ligands the overlap degree determined the adsorption effect between cubo2 and pms which could be reflected by the partial density of states pdos analysis li et al 2022b as shown in figs 3 a and s23 the overlap of criii 3d states and o 2p states of pms was stronger than that of coiii 3d states and o 2p states the zero eg eg 0 filling of criii site presented with overly strong orbitals overlapping with o 2p of pms endowed cucro2 with strong adsorption force towards pms forming pms fig s15 while a high eg eg 2 filling of coiii hindered the overly strong pms adsorption causing obvious pms decomposition fig s16 guo et al 2021 besides the adsorption energy calculation also verified that pms anion was energetically preferred to be adsorbed by cr site over co site 2 64 ev vs 1 86 ev table s5 once adsorption the d orbital of b sites and o 2p of pms ligands were subsequently adjusted to achieve coordination developing the metastable intermediates of cubo2 pms the coordination behaviors between b sites co cr and pms were the decisive step for pms activation according to the valence bond theory b sites offered empty hybrid orbitals to accept lone pairs electrons of ligands to form the different spin complexes i e high spin complex or low spin complex stephanos and addison 2020 the high spin complex was formed when b sites provided the empty orbitals of the outermost valence electrons 4 s orbital to coordinate with pms whereas once partial unpaired electrons of b sites were paired up to release d orbitals the paired electrons of pms would occupy the inner empty d orbitals resulting in the low spin complex the state of spin complex determined the stability of metastable intermediates of cubo2 pms to explore the spin type of cubo2 pms complex the magnetic moments of b sites before and after reacting with pms were determined by performing temperature dependent magnetization measurements at h 1 koe under field cooling zfc fc conditions fig s24 the susceptibilities that originate from the magnetizations Ï m h abide by the curie weiss law Ï c t Î¸ where c is the curie constant the effective magnetic moment Î¼ eff 8 c Î¼ b can be calculated through the linear fitting of Ï 1 t fig 3b shen et al 2020 it could be seen that the Î¼eff value of co site enhanced from 0 87 to 1 18 Î¼b after reacting with pms this revealed that the electronic configuration of co 3d maintained a high spin state after coordinating with the oxygen donor ligand pms fig 3c in this case the paired electrons of o 2p in pms filled in the outer hybrid orbitals of coiii to coordinate with Ï bond forming the high spin complex cucoo2 pms in contrast the Î¼eff value of cucro2 decreased from 1 81 to 1 37 Î¼b due to the existence of unoccupied 3d orbital the paired electrons of o 2p in pms preferentially occupied inner 3d hybrid orbitals of criii to participate in Ï bonding thus forming the low spin complex cucro2 pms these were further verified by the results of solid esr spectra which were used to characterize unpaired electrons of catalysts fig 3d a sharp symmetric esr signal with a g factor of 1 993 was discerned in cucro2 sample corresponding to the criii suksabye et al 2009 besides a weak coiii signal was also identified for cucoo2 with a g factor of 2 094 weckhuysen et al 2000 after activating with pms an enhanced esr signal of coiii implied more unpaired electrons generating complex with the high spin state contrarily for cucro2 a significant decrease in the esr signal intensity signified that d orbital electrons of criii became paired releasing more empty d orbitals to coordinate with o 2p of pms thus forming the low spin complex in this way the low spin complex was endowed with more paired electrons in the orbital of coordinative cr o hso5 inducing the stable nature of cucro2 pms by contrast the orbital of coordinative co o hso5 contained relatively more unpaired electrons leading to cucoo2 pms being beneficial for dissociation to further give insight into the role of d orbital electronic configuration of b sites on tuning pms dissociation we monitored the variation of peroxy oo bond in pms hooso3 which was detected by in situ raman spectra as shown in fig s16 the intensity ratios of oo so4 2 and so3 2 so4 2 i e i o o i so 4 2 and i o o i so 3 2 clearly decreased after adding cucoo2 to pms solution suggesting the rapid cleavage of peroxy oo bond of pms on co sites and the excellent performance of cucoo2 for pms dissociation to generate so4 continue adding oi the characteristic vibration peak of oo in pms almost disappeared markedly different the value of i o o i so 4 2 showed a trivial change when pms and cucro2 mixed together while the characteristic vibration of oo appeared a red shifted 883 to 897 cm 1 this denoted the donation of electrons from cucro2 to pms and a prolonged peroxo oo bond hu et al 2019 further adding oi i o o i so 4 2 and i o o i so 3 2 greatly reduced confirming that oi promoted the cleavage of peroxo oo bond and drove the transformation of surface activated pms into so4 2 simultaneously liang et al 2021 considering that the feature of electronic configuration of co 3d 6 between half filled and full filled the resulting unpaired electrons in cucoo2 pms high spin complex facilely transferred to peroxo oo bond of pms such electron accumulation could make peroxo oo bond cleavage to generate so4 theoretical calculation clarified pms dissociation impacted by d orbital electronic configuration we established that the oo bond length l o o of pms hooso3 over cubo2 012 models adsorbed pms on b sites was stretched with longer oo bond compared with the origin pms with an l o o of 1 480 Ã¥ table s4 pms displayed a larger l o o value 2 168 Ã¥ on cucoo2 than that on cucro2 fig 4 a after interacting with co site activated pms more readily triggered spontaneous dissociation to generate ross via the single electron transfer on the contrary the cucro2 pms complex was more prone to form pms with a shorter oo bond l o o 1 505 Ã¥ to resist cleavage and provide paired electrons or empty orbitals for the electron shuttle during the electron transfer process likewise the experiments of pms decomposition were also lined with the above conclusions pms was continuously decomposed over time to generate ross i e so4 and 1o2 by cucoo2 in the absence of oi fig s25 instead the amount of pms rapidly consumed in the first 10 min and then reached the equilibrium in the cucro2 pms system meaning that pms was tightly confined on cucro2 to form pms rather than dissociation duan et al 2021 3 5 mechanism insight the above discussions focused on the apparent thermodynamic interaction process between b sites and pms governed by d orbital electron configuration in order to clarify the tuning mechanism of different b sites in delafossite on pms activation it was necessary to give an in depth insight into the inherent electron transfer feature driven by the thermodynamic potential of b sites metal on the activation of pms the molecular orbital mo energy levels of cubo2 were conducted to uncover the electron transfer ability fig 4b the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were the electron donator and acceptor orbital respectively zhao et al 2021 the d electrons in the b sites as the valence electrons dominated the homo energy level of cubo2 the homo of cucoo2 5 85 ev was higher than that of cucro2 5 56 ev denoting that cucoo2 was easier to donate electrons to pms it was also proved by the electron donating capacity edc of cubo2 which was quantified by the mediated electrochemical oxidation meo method fig 4c zhao et al 2020 by integrating the oxidation current response the insets of fig 4c it was obtained that cucoo2 showed a larger number of electrons transfer q than cucro2 0 82 vs 1 14 nmole zhang et al 2018 as calculated edc of cucoo2 were quantified as 0 82 nmole g 1 higher than 0 57 nmole g 1 of cucro2 fig 4c this further supported the superiority of cucoo2 as an ideal electron donator in pms activation which contributed to the participation of ross based oxidation pathway correspondingly the reductive capacity of cucoo2 was stronger than that of cucro2 in course of pms activation evidenced by the h2 tpr profile fig s26 sui et al 2014 cucoo2 was able to transfer more electrons to pms q pms 0 24 e compared to cucro2 q pms 0 10 e table s4 additionally the mo energy levels of pms and oi were further investigated to unravel the selective activation behavior of pms on b sites fig 4b the homo of oi 5 16 ev was more negative than the lumo of cucro2 4 73 ev implying that the electrons originating from oi could facilitate the migration of homo oi to the lumo cucro2 then the electrons localized at the homo in cucro2 5 56 ev were readily injected into the lumo of pms 1 38 ev initiating an electrophilic attack on the oo bond of pms similarly the electron transfer from oi to pms via cucoo2 was also energetically favorable shao et al 2021 however it was noted that the energy gap of cucro2 0 83 ev was narrower than cucoo2 1 73 ev illustrating that the electron of cucro2 was readily transferred from the lumo to homo eis results matched well with the computation results cucro2 exhibited superior electrical conductivity to help the effective electron transfer from pollutants to pms as affirmed by a smaller eis arc radius of cucro2 than that of cucoo2 fig s27 therefore cucro2 acted as an ideal electron shuttle which was more chemical reactivity for pms activation via the electron transfer pathways zhao et al 2021 to further elucidate the tuning mechanism of pms oxidation pathway driven by the thermodynamic potential of b sites with different d orbital electronic configurations the gibbs free energy Î´g diagram and their corresponding intermediate structures were calculated in fig 4d pms hso5 was first adsorbed onto the surface of the cucoo2 as hoso4 and coordinated with coiii to form intermediate coiii ooso3 step ii presenting an energy drop of 1 97 ev zhao et al 2021 afterward the oo bond in coiii ooso3 broken to spontaneously produce oh and so4 step iii which was endothermic with Î´g of 3 83 ev qi et al 2022 the Î´g for the formation of oh and so4 on coiii sites was much lower than criii sites 3 83 ev vs 2 21 ev this caused that coiii sites were more thermodynamically favorable for driving the formation of oh and so4 subsequently promoting the electron transfer to pms to evolve radicals while higher Î´g drove the formation of pms on criii sites wang et al 2022c based on the thermodynamic analysis it was easily speculated that the pms oxidation pathway was thermodynamically transferred from pms based non radical pathways to ross based radical pathways as d orbital electrons of b sites in delafossite shifted from less than half filled to between half filled and full filled in order to confirm the universal applicability of such conclusion we synthesized another two delafossites of cumno2 and cufeo2 fig s28 the 3d subshell of mniii 3d 4 was less than half filled while the 3d subshell of feiii 3d 5 was half filled noteworthy the cufeo2 pms system occurred ross dominated pathway i e so4 oh 1o2 but pms activation by cumno2 was mainly via the electron transfer pathway the above results highlighted the pivotal role of the d orbital electronic configuration of b sites co or cr in delafossite on regulating the distinct pms activation process and the corresponding tuning mechanism was depicted in fig 5 the less than half filled 3d orbital of criii 3d 3 facilitated to form strong overlap with the o 2p orbital of pms then resulted in strong adsorption interaction meanwhile the paired electron of o 2p of pms occupied the empty 3d orbital of criii thereby forming the stable low spin complex cucro2 pms in this regard pms was tightly confined on cucro2 to form shorter oo bonds rather than dissociation furthermore the narrow energy gap of cucro2 led it to serve as an electron shuttle to thermodynamically favorably meet the electron transfer pathway thus the electron transfer channels were established between the oi and pms with the existence of cucro2 and adsorbed pms quickly grabbed one electron from oi with the formation of so4 2 on the other hand the 3d subshell of coiii 3d 6 site was between half filled and full filled which impedimented strong adsorption between coiii and o atom of pms afterward coiii offered the empty orbital of the outermost valence electrons 4 s orbital to coordinate with o 2p of pms creating the high spin complex cucoo2 pms with more unpaired electrons these electrons cumulatively flowed toward the oo bond of pms making efficient pms dissociation also more d electrons of coiii enabled cucoo2 as a superior electron donator to thermodynamically favorably activate pms for ross generation by which oi molecules were directly degraded into intermediates co2 and h2o 4 conclusions in this work we identified an interesting phenomenon that the exclusive pms oxidation pathways occurred on delafossites with different b sites accordingly the d orbital electronic configuration of b sites coiii 3d 6 fe 3d 5 mn 3d 4 criii 3d 3 was firstly proved to act as the universal descriptor to regulate pms oxidation pathways based on the thermodynamic decipher of the apparent interaction process and the inherent electron transfer feature moreover a universal law was proposed that the b sites less than half filled 3d orbital interacted with pms to mainly execute an electron transfer pathway for oi removal conversely the b sites between half filled and full filled 3d orbital preferably activated pms to mainly evolve ross in the delafossite pms oi system our findings unambiguously unveiled the pivotal role of d orbital electronic configuration of tms in regulating pms oxidation pathways at the thermodynamic scale it provided a valuable strategy for the rational design of tms based catalysts and the precise regulation of pms oxidation pathways via the atomic level of d orbital electronic configuration optimization in the light of the practical wastewater treatment vital importantly the proposed d orbital electronic configuration mediated regulation idea could also function as a general prescription for other fenton like reactions beyond pms aops especially for those involving complex intermediate

14835,radical and non radical oxidation pathways have been universally validated in transition metals tms oxides activated peroxymonosulfate pms processes however achieving high efficiency and selectivity of pms activation remains challenging due to the ambiguous tuning mechanism of tms sites on pms activation in thermodynamic scope herein we demonstrated that the exclusive pms oxidation pathways were regulated by d orbital electronic configuration of b sites in delafossites cubo2 for orange i degradation coiii 3d 6 for reactive oxygen species ross vs criii 3d 3 for electron transfer pathway the d orbital electronic configuration was identified to affect the orbital overlap extent between 3d of b sites and o 2p of pms which induced b sites offering different types of hybrid orbital to coordinate with o 2p of pms thereby forming the high spin complex cucoo2 pms or the low spin complex cucro2 pms on which basis pms was selectively dissociated to form ross or achieve electron transfer pathway as indicated by thermodynamic analysis a general rule was proposed that b sites of less than half filled 3d orbital tended to act as electron shuttle i e criii 3d 3 mniii 3d 4 interacting with pms to execute an electron transfer pathway for degrading orange i while b sites of between half filled and full filled 3d orbital preferred to be electron donator i e coiii 3d 6 feiii 3d 5 activating pms to generate ross these findings lay a foundation for the oriented design of tms based catalysts from the atomic level according to d orbital electronic configuration

keywords peroxymonosulfate transition metal d orbital electron configuration oxidation pathway tuning mechanism data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction heterogeneous advanced oxidation progresses aops employing peroxymonosulfate pms is one of the most efficient environmental purification technologies to meet the ever growing demand for clean water resources duan et al 2018a lee et al 2020 during such process various reactive oxygen species ross such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 are in situ generated by breaking peroxy oo bond in pms molecules via electron or energy transfer processes hodges et al 2018 qi et al 2022 the generated so4 e 0 2 6 3 1 vnhe or oh e 0 1 9 2 7 vnhe with high redox potentials will efficiently degrade and mineralize a broad spectrum of refractory organic contaminants li et al 2020 however the radical oxidation pathway is sensitive to environmental matrix e g natural organic matter and halogen ions which will quench the generated ross and form toxic by products clo3 bro3 posing secondary environmental risks recently non radical pathways including singlet oxygenation electron transfer processes and activated high valent metal regarded as the promising oxidation processes chen et al 2021 duan et al 2018b huang and zhang 2019 higher pms utilization efficiency and less susceptibility for the solution ph or background substances make non radical oxidation have more technical advantages in actual water treatment ren et al 2022 yao et al 2019 but these non radical reactions are moderate compared with the strongly oxidizing radical systems leading to insufficient mineralization of total organic carbons zhang et al 2021 therefore directional regulating the radical non radical pathway of pms activation by catalysts tailoring is of importance to improve the applicability of pms aops in different surrounding environments polyvalent transition metals tms with unfilled d orbits such as co mn fe cu etc are enabled to efficiently activate pms by electron transfer in redox cycle kohantorabi et al 2021 it is widely accepted that different tms sites can induce different ross and pms oxidation pathways fig s1 however the underlying relationship between tms sites and pms oxidation pathway remains unclear substantial effort has been devoted to revealing the intrinsic mechanism of pms activation by tms crystal form of tms sites 2h type vs 3r type was already revealed to have a decisive impact on the reactive species evolution in pms activation zhao et al 2019 in addition it was found that the covalency environment degree of tms sites co o vs mn o was essential to determine pms activation features guo et al 2021 meanwhile the structure around tms sites vacancy vs edges also tailors the radical non radical pathways of pms activation li et al 2022a wu et al 2021 although above mechanisms are all strongly related to the structural properties of bulk catalysts the intrinsic origin of the catalytic behavior i e the electronic property of tms governing the pms oxidation pathway is still unknown proposing a universal tuning mechanism related to the electronic properties of tms to explain the pms oxidation pathway is urgently in need of exploration which is also of significance for rational regulation of pms aops the d orbital electronic configuration is one of the most crucial chemical parameters related to the electronic properties of tms do and lee 2022 recent advances figured out that d orbital electronic configuration governed the decomposition behavior of oxygen containing substances in the field of catalysis i e oxygen reduction reaction water splitting sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 current literature of pms aops also displayed that specific d orbital electronic configuration of tms could induce exclusive pms oxidation pathway miao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 however they mainly focused on kinetic relationship between d orbital electronic configuration of individual tm site and pms catalytic activity in a particular catalytic system the in depth insight into the tuning mechanism of the d orbital electronic configuration of tms affecting the pms oxidation pathway from the thermodynamic view is still far from being understood it arouses many interesting questions i what is the difference in the pms oxidation pathway over tms sites with distinct d orbital electronic configuration thermodynamic behavior ii how the d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites induces the interface interaction between catalysts and pms i e adsorption coordination dissociation thermodynamic process iii what is the electron transfer behaviors affected by d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites during pms activation thermodynamic potential this work focused on delivering a full picture towards the tuning mechanism of d orbital electronic configuration of tms sites on regulating the pms oxidation pathway for pollutant remediation to achieve the goal we developed two copper delafossite cubo2 with b site cations of coiii 3d 6 and criii 3d 3 as typical catalysts to activate pms for orange i degradation distinct pms oxidation pathways were identified over cucoo2 and cucro2 the d orbital electronic configuration of b site metals co or cr was distinguished as the decisive factor in governing the pms oxidation pathway one step further the pms oxidation pathway discrepancy origin of d orbital electronic configuration in b site was fully deciphered based on the thermodynamic view of i the apparent interaction behaviors i e adsorption coordination dissociation and ii the inherent electron transfer behaviors i e electron donator electron shuttle finally the proposed tuning mechanism was well verified to function as a general rule via the identification of the pms oxidation pathway activated by cumno2 mn 3d 4 and cufeo2 fe 3d 5 this work paved a way for oriented design of on demand catalysts to precisely regulate pms oxidation pathways in the light of diverse actual water remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were used without any purification deionized di water was employed for preparing all solutions more details of chemicals could be noted in table s1 cubo2 was prepared using a similar hydrothermal method tong et al 2018 du et al 2018 typically 15 mmol cu no3 2 3h2o and 15 mmol co no3 2 6h2o or cr no3 2 9h2o mn no3 2 4h2o fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 70 ml di water after that 5 0 g naoh was added to the above solution and stirred for 20 min then the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon lined autoclave after the reaction was kept at 100 c for 24 h or 240 c for 60 h 160 c for 24 h 160 c for 24 h the produced precipitate was washed with di water and ethanol in sequence several times finally cucoo2 or cucro2 cumno2 cufeo2 powder was collected after drying in an oven at 80 c for 8 h 2 2 characterization the detailed characterization methods were described in text s1 2 3 evaluation of catalytic activity the performance of catalyst was assessed in a 500 ml beaker containing 5 mg l 1 oi at 25 2 c the ph value of reaction system was adjusted by 0 1 mmol l 1 naoh or hno3 solution in a typical procedure 500 ml of oi solution containing 0 05 g catalyst was firstly stirred for 30 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium a certain concentration of pms aqueous solution was then added to the above mentioned solution to start the oxidation reaction at predetermined time intervals 5 ml of water sample was withdrawn by a glass syringe and immediately quenched with sodium sulfite then it was filtrated through a glass fiber filter of 0 22 Î¼m pore size for analysis all batch experiments were conducted in triplicates for accuracy and reproducibility 2 4 analysis methods the concentration of oi was analyzed by a tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer china at a wavelength of 480 5 nm bisphenol a bpa phenol pn sulfamethoxazole smx and benzoic acid ba were measured via hplc agilent 1260 infinity ii usa with an agilent sb c18 column the hplc analytical methods were presented in table s2 total organic carbon toc was detected by a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 jena germany a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo china was used to measure ph values in solution the concentration of pms was determined by the kscn method wang et al 2014 the reactive oxygen species were detected by electron spin resonance esr bruker germany using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo 100 mm and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp 100 mm as spin trapping agents the calculation method of the contribution of ross was given in text s2 2 5 theoretical calculation methods to understand the selectivity towards ross or electron transfer pathway in the cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms system density functional theory dft calculations were employed using vienna ab initio simulation package vasp the specific procedures were included in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 pms activation on cucoo2 and cucro2 we observed that the typical 3r delafossites of cucoo2 jcpds 21 0256 and cucro2 jcpds 39 0247 were successfully prepared through a simple hydrothermal method fig s2 and their physicochemical properties were given in text s4 figs s2 to s5 cucoo2 and cucro2 exhibited much better catalytic properties to pms activation for orange i oi degradation than pms alone under optimization of reaction conditions figs 1 a and s6 notably though cucro2 showed a higher adsorption capacity towards oi 28 than that of cucoo2 due to its larger ssa fig s7 cucro2 and cucoo2 exhibited a comparative performance for pms activation with oi removal efficiency of 93 and 98 respectively it was also worth noting that cucoo2 pms presented a faster kinetic process kobs 0 221 min 1 and more effective toc removal rtoc 36 than the counterparts kobs 0 127 min 1 rtoc 18 of cucro2 pms figs 1a and s8 these results inferred that there were significant differences in oi degradation process in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms such a conclusion could be also verified by oi degradation efficiency in real water matrix domestic sewage or secondary effluent where cucro2 maintained excellent selectivity for oi removal roi 90 while a severe inhibition occurred in cucoo2 pms roi 50 fig 1b additionally it could be seen the obvious selective degradation of other pollutants between cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms fig s9 cucoo2 pms showed good degradation on bpa pn ba and smx with the values of 90 87 58 40 while pollutants containing electron donating groups bpa 58 pn 54 could be degraded more easily than others ba 3 smx 7 in cucro2 pms the obvious different reaction activation energy ea values 56 4 kj mol 1 of cucoo2 vs 13 6 kj mol 1 of cucro2 figs s10 and s11 seemed to be indicative of that the above phenomenon was induced by the differences in thermodynamic behavior of pms activation by cucoo2 and cucro2 which induced the different oxidation pathways radical or non radical for oi degradation jawad et al 2020 3 2 distinct oxidation pathways in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms the generation of reactive species e g ross catalyst pms complex determined the oxidation pathway in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms chemical quenching experiments and esr measurements were conducted to identify the reactive species in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms as shown in fig 2 a to c tba oh scavenger k oh tba 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 negligibly inhibited while meoh oh and so4 scavenger k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k so 4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 caused a 42 reduction of oi degradation in cucoo2 pms fig 2a zhao et al 2020 however the characteristic esr signals from dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were both observed fig 2b implying that both oh and so4 were generated but only so4 involved in oi degradation for cucoo2 pms zhen et al 2021 in addition about 50 suppression of oi degradation was obtained when adding ffa 1o2 scavenger k 1 o 2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 in cucoo2 pms wu et al 2022 and a noticeable oi degradation enhancement was observed kobs 0 221 min 1 to kobs 0 286 min 1 fig s12a after replacing h2o with d2o to prolong the 1o2 lifetime yang et al 2022a indicating that 1o2 was also a major reactive species contributing to oi degradation in cucoo2 pms it was further supported by the fact that adding temp as the 1o2 trapping agent generated a more intensive esr signal of temp 1o2 in cucoo2 pms in comparison with that of pms alone and additionally enhanced with solvent exchange from h2o to d2o as well as decreased with oi addition fig 2c furthermore negligible influence of sod o2 scavenger addition on oi degradation and lack of obvious esr signal of dmpoo2 suggested that o2 was hardly involved in oi degradation fig s13 yang et al 2019 also the 1o2 was not formed by o2 intermediate but from pms decomposition by cucoo2 catalyzation in comparison no matter the addition of tba meoh ffa or sod had no adverse effect on oi degradation in the case of cucro2 pms fig 2a and there was no significant difference in oi removal using d2o as an alternative solvent fig s12b moreover dmpo or temp trapping esr did not show any obvious signal of adducts fig 2b and c these manifested that no ross were produced in cucro2 pms the experiment of ph effect indicated that oi removal in cucro2 pms was mainly carried out by the surface reaction where k oi of cucro2 pms system decreased from 99 to 50 as ph increased from 3 0 to 11 0 figs 2d and s14 it could be explained by ph dependent cucro2 surface charges phpzc cucro2 7 4 with the ph elevating the electrostatic repulsion between the cucro2 surface and hso5 became pronounced resulting in a lower effective activation of pms unexpectedly the highest k oi 0 221 min 1 in cucoo2 pms phpzc cucoo2 7 2 was obtained under neutral ph and a less effective against oi elimination under the initial acidic or alkaline condition which was a common phenomenon observed in radical dominant systems ren et al 2015 these results confirmed the hypothesis fig 1 that the oxidation pathway in cucro2 pms differed from cucoo2 pms oi degradation in cucro2 pms might mainly proceed via some other non radical pathways based on the surface oxidation process to provide deep insights into non radical pathways that occurred in cucro2 pms we further explored the electron transfer pathway that is the direct degradation of oi by the catalyst pms complex labeled pms as pms adsorption onto the catalyst is the initial step in the formation of pms in situ raman was conducted to investigate the interaction between cucro2 and pms as shown in figs s15 and s16 three peaks assigned to stretching vibrations of oo 883 cm 1 so4 2 961 cm 1 and so3 2 1080 cm 1 were clearly observed in the pms solution wei et al 2022 after the addition of cucro2 a newly strong peak located at 829 cm 1 appeared which was already indexed as metastable reactive peroxo species i e pms triggered by pms attaching onto the catalyst surface in previous studies si et al 2022 in addition when oi was added in cucro2 pms the pms and oo peaks markedly decreased or even disappeared these results demonstrated the fact that pms conversed into pms reactive species via intense surface interaction between pms and cucro2 and then contributed to the oi degradation in cucro2 pms for further validation the open circuit potential ocp was recorded in situ by using catalysts as electrodes fig s17 the origin potential of cucro2 rose rapidly from 0 16 v to 0 19 v and stabilized at 0 20 v upon pms addition and then continued to increase 0 74 v with the injection of oi such variation of ocp confirmed the process of generation of pms via the oxidation of the cucro2 surface by pms and subsequent occurrence of the electron transfer process between oi and the pms in cucro2 pms yang et al 2022b moreover the chronoamperometric i t curves presented the detailed electron transfer orientation fig 2e a faint negative current emerged after adding pms into cucro2 and a further boost of current density was correspondingly observed with the introduction of oi suggesting that oi directly donated electrons to pms to be oxidized with cucro2 as an electron channel to finish oi degradation by a dominant electron transfer non radical pathway xu et al 2023 compared to those in cucro2 pms the formation and consumption of pms were very inconspicuous along with that a drastic current jump fig 2e and continuous ocp increase fig s17 derived from massive electrons exchange between cucoo2 and pms for so4 and 1o2 production it was suggested the minor role of the electron transfer pathway in cucoo2 pms which was consistent with quenching experiments and esr results additionally the contribution of high valence metal oxo species for oi degradation in cucoo2 pms and cucro2 pms was also excluded by insignificantly adverse effects of dmso in quenching experiment fig s18 zheng et al 2020 comprehensively all these results validated that ross based so4 and 1o2 oxidation pathway was predominant for oi degradation in cucoo2 pms on the contrary the electron transfer pms pathway mainly contributed to oi degradation in cucro2 pms further calculation details in text s2 presented that the relative contributions of so4 and 1o2 species in the cucoo2 pms system were 46 and 42 respectively while oi degradation in the cucro2 pms system was all due to the electron transfer pathway fig 2f liang et al 2022 3 3 predominant active site in regulating pms oxidation pathway tuning the b site metal species co to cr in 3r delafossite cubo2 caused the pms oxidation pathway to shift from ros to pms dominant oxidation process indicating the predominant active site of cubo2 for regulating the pms oxidation pathway highly linked to the b site certainly it was inevitable that replacing b site metal could not only change one of the lattice elements in cubo2 but also altered the chemical state of neighboring coordinate elements namely cu and o among these which was the predominant active site for pms activation deserved further study generally o species fig s19 especially for oxygen vacancy 530 5 ev and surface hydroxyl groups 531 5 ev usually acted as electron donors or electron shuttles to activate pms wang et al 2022a however it was noted that purging n2 had a positive effect on oi degradation in both cucro2 pms and cucoo2 pms fig s20 which was absolutely contrary to the inhibitory effect of n2 in oxygen vacancy mediated pms activation system wu et al 2021 this was a typical phenomenon in the metal redox mediated pms activation process that the absence of o2 competing electron acceptors enabled more electrons to be transferred to pms for generating more reactive species with higher oxidation capacity besides there was any influence on oi degradation when using clo4 1 50 mmol l 1 to shield hydroxyl groups on catalysts in the cucoo2 pms or cucro2 pms fig s21 wang et al 2014 it could be deduced that o species were not the predominant active site in cucoo2 and cucro2 for pms activation which meant that metal species rather than o species in cubo2 contributed more to regulating the pms oxidation pathway theoretically the redox cycle and average oxidation states aos of metal species have a significant impact on the pms oxidation pathway we examined the specific valent state distribution of cu in the different delafossites fig s19b and table s4 the high resolution of cu 2p spectra showed the presence of both cui 931 9 ev and cuii 933 8 ev mi et al 2022 where the integrated areas of cui and cuii spectra in cucoo2 cui 71 2 cuii 28 8 and cucro2 cui 72 2 cuii 27 8 were similar suggesting the approximative aos for surface cu in addition of that negligible variation of cui cuii ratio after being used was observed in the redox cycle for both cucoo2 and cucro2 collectively excluding the role of cu in regulating the pms oxidation pathways furthermore similar and low pms adsorption energy e ads over cu sites on 012 plane of cucoo2 and cucro2 gave further confirmation fig s22 table s5 it was indicative of the predominant active site of co and cr in cubo2 for regulating the pms oxidation pathway which was preferably supported by their obviously different aos and variation of bii biii ratio after being used fig s19c wang et al 2022b liu et al 2020 however the in depth understanding of the thermodynamic process for b site metal co and cr on modulating the distinct pms oxidation pathways still needed more elaborate exploration 3 4 pms activation governed by d electronic configuration of tms sites during pms activation the thermodynamic interaction process between transition metals tms sites and pms including adsorption coordination and dissociation of pms critically governed the formation of pms or ross for pollutant oxidation specifically pms anions adsorbed on the surface of tms based catalysts to form precursor complexes then its o 2p orbital was coordinated to the d orbital of tms sites by Ï bonding to achieve an approximation of their spin state and orbital orientation further triggering electron transfer and driving pms dissociation via various radical or non radical pathways hosmane 2017 in these processes whether the adsorption coordination or dissociation of pms was close to the electronic configuration of tms thus the d orbital electronic configuration of b site metal played a decisive role in regulating the pms activation by cubo2 notably coiii and criii were provided with obvious distinct 3d orbital electron configurations the 3d subshells of coiii 3d 6 were between half filled and full filled whereas criii 3d 3 was less than half filled co or cr was located at the center of coo6 or cro6 octahedra in delafossite its d orbital could split into two energy levels groups i e eg and t2g in the category of crystal field theory stephanos and addison 2017 when pms adsorbed onto cubo2 eg orbital of b sites metal would overlap with o 2p of pms ligands the overlap degree determined the adsorption effect between cubo2 and pms which could be reflected by the partial density of states pdos analysis li et al 2022b as shown in figs 3 a and s23 the overlap of criii 3d states and o 2p states of pms was stronger than that of coiii 3d states and o 2p states the zero eg eg 0 filling of criii site presented with overly strong orbitals overlapping with o 2p of pms endowed cucro2 with strong adsorption force towards pms forming pms fig s15 while a high eg eg 2 filling of coiii hindered the overly strong pms adsorption causing obvious pms decomposition fig s16 guo et al 2021 besides the adsorption energy calculation also verified that pms anion was energetically preferred to be adsorbed by cr site over co site 2 64 ev vs 1 86 ev table s5 once adsorption the d orbital of b sites and o 2p of pms ligands were subsequently adjusted to achieve coordination developing the metastable intermediates of cubo2 pms the coordination behaviors between b sites co cr and pms were the decisive step for pms activation according to the valence bond theory b sites offered empty hybrid orbitals to accept lone pairs electrons of ligands to form the different spin complexes i e high spin complex or low spin complex stephanos and addison 2020 the high spin complex was formed when b sites provided the empty orbitals of the outermost valence electrons 4 s orbital to coordinate with pms whereas once partial unpaired electrons of b sites were paired up to release d orbitals the paired electrons of pms would occupy the inner empty d orbitals resulting in the low spin complex the state of spin complex determined the stability of metastable intermediates of cubo2 pms to explore the spin type of cubo2 pms complex the magnetic moments of b sites before and after reacting with pms were determined by performing temperature dependent magnetization measurements at h 1 koe under field cooling zfc fc conditions fig s24 the susceptibilities that originate from the magnetizations Ï m h abide by the curie weiss law Ï c t Î¸ where c is the curie constant the effective magnetic moment Î¼ eff 8 c Î¼ b can be calculated through the linear fitting of Ï 1 t fig 3b shen et al 2020 it could be seen that the Î¼eff value of co site enhanced from 0 87 to 1 18 Î¼b after reacting with pms this revealed that the electronic configuration of co 3d maintained a high spin state after coordinating with the oxygen donor ligand pms fig 3c in this case the paired electrons of o 2p in pms filled in the outer hybrid orbitals of coiii to coordinate with Ï bond forming the high spin complex cucoo2 pms in contrast the Î¼eff value of cucro2 decreased from 1 81 to 1 37 Î¼b due to the existence of unoccupied 3d orbital the paired electrons of o 2p in pms preferentially occupied inner 3d hybrid orbitals of criii to participate in Ï bonding thus forming the low spin complex cucro2 pms these were further verified by the results of solid esr spectra which were used to characterize unpaired electrons of catalysts fig 3d a sharp symmetric esr signal with a g factor of 1 993 was discerned in cucro2 sample corresponding to the criii suksabye et al 2009 besides a weak coiii signal was also identified for cucoo2 with a g factor of 2 094 weckhuysen et al 2000 after activating with pms an enhanced esr signal of coiii implied more unpaired electrons generating complex with the high spin state contrarily for cucro2 a significant decrease in the esr signal intensity signified that d orbital electrons of criii became paired releasing more empty d orbitals to coordinate with o 2p of pms thus forming the low spin complex in this way the low spin complex was endowed with more paired electrons in the orbital of coordinative cr o hso5 inducing the stable nature of cucro2 pms by contrast the orbital of coordinative co o hso5 contained relatively more unpaired electrons leading to cucoo2 pms being beneficial for dissociation to further give insight into the role of d orbital electronic configuration of b sites on tuning pms dissociation we monitored the variation of peroxy oo bond in pms hooso3 which was detected by in situ raman spectra as shown in fig s16 the intensity ratios of oo so4 2 and so3 2 so4 2 i e i o o i so 4 2 and i o o i so 3 2 clearly decreased after adding cucoo2 to pms solution suggesting the rapid cleavage of peroxy oo bond of pms on co sites and the excellent performance of cucoo2 for pms dissociation to generate so4 continue adding oi the characteristic vibration peak of oo in pms almost disappeared markedly different the value of i o o i so 4 2 showed a trivial change when pms and cucro2 mixed together while the characteristic vibration of oo appeared a red shifted 883 to 897 cm 1 this denoted the donation of electrons from cucro2 to pms and a prolonged peroxo oo bond hu et al 2019 further adding oi i o o i so 4 2 and i o o i so 3 2 greatly reduced confirming that oi promoted the cleavage of peroxo oo bond and drove the transformation of surface activated pms into so4 2 simultaneously liang et al 2021 considering that the feature of electronic configuration of co 3d 6 between half filled and full filled the resulting unpaired electrons in cucoo2 pms high spin complex facilely transferred to peroxo oo bond of pms such electron accumulation could make peroxo oo bond cleavage to generate so4 theoretical calculation clarified pms dissociation impacted by d orbital electronic configuration we established that the oo bond length l o o of pms hooso3 over cubo2 012 models adsorbed pms on b sites was stretched with longer oo bond compared with the origin pms with an l o o of 1 480 Ã¥ table s4 pms displayed a larger l o o value 2 168 Ã¥ on cucoo2 than that on cucro2 fig 4 a after interacting with co site activated pms more readily triggered spontaneous dissociation to generate ross via the single electron transfer on the contrary the cucro2 pms complex was more prone to form pms with a shorter oo bond l o o 1 505 Ã¥ to resist cleavage and provide paired electrons or empty orbitals for the electron shuttle during the electron transfer process likewise the experiments of pms decomposition were also lined with the above conclusions pms was continuously decomposed over time to generate ross i e so4 and 1o2 by cucoo2 in the absence of oi fig s25 instead the amount of pms rapidly consumed in the first 10 min and then reached the equilibrium in the cucro2 pms system meaning that pms was tightly confined on cucro2 to form pms rather than dissociation duan et al 2021 3 5 mechanism insight the above discussions focused on the apparent thermodynamic interaction process between b sites and pms governed by d orbital electron configuration in order to clarify the tuning mechanism of different b sites in delafossite on pms activation it was necessary to give an in depth insight into the inherent electron transfer feature driven by the thermodynamic potential of b sites metal on the activation of pms the molecular orbital mo energy levels of cubo2 were conducted to uncover the electron transfer ability fig 4b the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were the electron donator and acceptor orbital respectively zhao et al 2021 the d electrons in the b sites as the valence electrons dominated the homo energy level of cubo2 the homo of cucoo2 5 85 ev was higher than that of cucro2 5 56 ev denoting that cucoo2 was easier to donate electrons to pms it was also proved by the electron donating capacity edc of cubo2 which was quantified by the mediated electrochemical oxidation meo method fig 4c zhao et al 2020 by integrating the oxidation current response the insets of fig 4c it was obtained that cucoo2 showed a larger number of electrons transfer q than cucro2 0 82 vs 1 14 nmole zhang et al 2018 as calculated edc of cucoo2 were quantified as 0 82 nmole g 1 higher than 0 57 nmole g 1 of cucro2 fig 4c this further supported the superiority of cucoo2 as an ideal electron donator in pms activation which contributed to the participation of ross based oxidation pathway correspondingly the reductive capacity of cucoo2 was stronger than that of cucro2 in course of pms activation evidenced by the h2 tpr profile fig s26 sui et al 2014 cucoo2 was able to transfer more electrons to pms q pms 0 24 e compared to cucro2 q pms 0 10 e table s4 additionally the mo energy levels of pms and oi were further investigated to unravel the selective activation behavior of pms on b sites fig 4b the homo of oi 5 16 ev was more negative than the lumo of cucro2 4 73 ev implying that the electrons originating from oi could facilitate the migration of homo oi to the lumo cucro2 then the electrons localized at the homo in cucro2 5 56 ev were readily injected into the lumo of pms 1 38 ev initiating an electrophilic attack on the oo bond of pms similarly the electron transfer from oi to pms via cucoo2 was also energetically favorable shao et al 2021 however it was noted that the energy gap of cucro2 0 83 ev was narrower than cucoo2 1 73 ev illustrating that the electron of cucro2 was readily transferred from the lumo to homo eis results matched well with the computation results cucro2 exhibited superior electrical conductivity to help the effective electron transfer from pollutants to pms as affirmed by a smaller eis arc radius of cucro2 than that of cucoo2 fig s27 therefore cucro2 acted as an ideal electron shuttle which was more chemical reactivity for pms activation via the electron transfer pathways zhao et al 2021 to further elucidate the tuning mechanism of pms oxidation pathway driven by the thermodynamic potential of b sites with different d orbital electronic configurations the gibbs free energy Î´g diagram and their corresponding intermediate structures were calculated in fig 4d pms hso5 was first adsorbed onto the surface of the cucoo2 as hoso4 and coordinated with coiii to form intermediate coiii ooso3 step ii presenting an energy drop of 1 97 ev zhao et al 2021 afterward the oo bond in coiii ooso3 broken to spontaneously produce oh and so4 step iii which was endothermic with Î´g of 3 83 ev qi et al 2022 the Î´g for the formation of oh and so4 on coiii sites was much lower than criii sites 3 83 ev vs 2 21 ev this caused that coiii sites were more thermodynamically favorable for driving the formation of oh and so4 subsequently promoting the electron transfer to pms to evolve radicals while higher Î´g drove the formation of pms on criii sites wang et al 2022c based on the thermodynamic analysis it was easily speculated that the pms oxidation pathway was thermodynamically transferred from pms based non radical pathways to ross based radical pathways as d orbital electrons of b sites in delafossite shifted from less than half filled to between half filled and full filled in order to confirm the universal applicability of such conclusion we synthesized another two delafossites of cumno2 and cufeo2 fig s28 the 3d subshell of mniii 3d 4 was less than half filled while the 3d subshell of feiii 3d 5 was half filled noteworthy the cufeo2 pms system occurred ross dominated pathway i e so4 oh 1o2 but pms activation by cumno2 was mainly via the electron transfer pathway the above results highlighted the pivotal role of the d orbital electronic configuration of b sites co or cr in delafossite on regulating the distinct pms activation process and the corresponding tuning mechanism was depicted in fig 5 the less than half filled 3d orbital of criii 3d 3 facilitated to form strong overlap with the o 2p orbital of pms then resulted in strong adsorption interaction meanwhile the paired electron of o 2p of pms occupied the empty 3d orbital of criii thereby forming the stable low spin complex cucro2 pms in this regard pms was tightly confined on cucro2 to form shorter oo bonds rather than dissociation furthermore the narrow energy gap of cucro2 led it to serve as an electron shuttle to thermodynamically favorably meet the electron transfer pathway thus the electron transfer channels were established between the oi and pms with the existence of cucro2 and adsorbed pms quickly grabbed one electron from oi with the formation of so4 2 on the other hand the 3d subshell of coiii 3d 6 site was between half filled and full filled which impedimented strong adsorption between coiii and o atom of pms afterward coiii offered the empty orbital of the outermost valence electrons 4 s orbital to coordinate with o 2p of pms creating the high spin complex cucoo2 pms with more unpaired electrons these electrons cumulatively flowed toward the oo bond of pms making efficient pms dissociation also more d electrons of coiii enabled cucoo2 as a superior electron donator to thermodynamically favorably activate pms for ross generation by which oi molecules were directly degraded into intermediates co2 and h2o 4 conclusions in this work we identified an interesting phenomenon that the exclusive pms oxidation pathways occurred on delafossites with different b sites accordingly the d orbital electronic configuration of b sites coiii 3d 6 fe 3d 5 mn 3d 4 criii 3d 3 was firstly proved to act as the universal descriptor to regulate pms oxidation pathways based on the thermodynamic decipher of the apparent interaction process and the inherent electron transfer feature moreover a universal law was proposed that the b sites less than half filled 3d orbital interacted with pms to mainly execute an electron transfer pathway for oi removal conversely the b sites between half filled and full filled 3d orbital preferably activated pms to mainly evolve ross in the delafossite pms oi system our findings unambiguously unveiled the pivotal role of d orbital electronic configuration of tms in regulating pms oxidation pathways at the thermodynamic scale it provided a valuable strategy for the rational design of tms based catalysts and the precise regulation of pms oxidation pathways via the atomic level of d orbital electronic configuration optimization in the light of the practical wastewater treatment vital importantly the proposed d orbital electronic configuration mediated regulation idea could also function as a general prescription for other fenton like reactions beyond pms aops especially for those involving complex intermediate

14836,here we examined the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the removal and inactivation of human sapovirus husav we applied a recently developed in vitro cell culture system to produce purified solutions of husav containing virus concentrations high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an integrated cell culture polymerase chain reaction icc pcr assay to quantify the infectivity of husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments in virus spiking coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration cs rsf and coagulation microfiltration c mf experiments husav removals of 1 6 3 7 log10 and 1 2 4 3 log10 respectively were observed the removal ratios observed with cs rsf were comparable and correlated with those of murine norovirus mnv a widely used surrogate for human noroviruses and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a potential surrogate for human enteric viruses in physical and physicochemical drinking water treatment processes and those observed with c mf were higher than but still correlated with those of mnv and pmmov indicating that mnv and pmmov are both potential surrogates for husav in cs rsf and c mf for astrovirus astv a representative human enteric virus removal ratios of 1 8 3 3 log10 and 1 1 4 0 log10 were observed with cs rsf and c mf respectively the removal ratios of astv observed with cs rsf were comparable and correlated with those of pmmov and those observed with c mf were higher than but still correlated with those of pmmov indicating that pmmov is a potential surrogate for astv in cs rsf and c mf when the efficacy of chlorine treatment was examined by using the developed icc pcr assay 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation of husav was observed at a ct value free chlorine concentration c multiplied by contact time t of 0 02 mg cl2 min l the infectivity reduction ratios of husav were comparable with those of mnv for astv 1 3 1 7 log10 and 3 4 log10 inactivation as evaluated by icc pcr was observed at ct values of 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment and more sensitive than a chlorine resistant virus coxsackievirus b5 1 3 log10 inactivation at a ct value of 0 4 mg cl2 min l as evaluated by the icc pcr assay graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords astrovirus drinking water treatment human sapovirus integrated cell culture pcr murine norovirus pepper mild mottle virus 1 introduction human sapoviruses husavs previously called sapporo like viruses after their discovery from a gastroenteritis outbreak in sapporo japan chiba et al 1979 belong to the genus sapovirus in the family caliciviridae oka et al 2015 the same family as human noroviruses genus norovirus husavs are a common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide health canada 2017 husavs are excreted in the feces of infected individuals who 2011 and have been detected in raw and treated wastewaters health canada 2017 indeed drinking water sources that receive treated wastewaters often become contaminated with these viruses sano et al 2011 sylvestre et al 2021 outbreaks of husav induced gastroenteritis due to contaminated drinking water have been reported although these outbreaks were found to have originated from the intrusion of wastewater into a drinking water distribution system due to pipe breakage kauppinen et al 2019 not from inadequate treatment for the reduction i e removal inactivation of husavs however there is the potential for outbreaks of husav induced gastroenteritis to occur if drinking water treatment processes are inadequate for the reduction of husavs due to the importance of husavs as waterborne pathogens they are classified by the world health organization as pathogens that are of relevance to the supply management of drinking water who 2011 in addition human caliciviruses husavs and human noroviruses are included in the fifth drinking water contaminant candidate list published by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2022 thus understanding the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs is important for the prevention of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by exposure to contaminated drinking water in the laboratory virus spiking experiments using artificially propagated viruses are often used to investigate the virus reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes abad et al 1997 cromeans et al 2010 espinosa et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 shirasaki et al 2020 tanneru and chellam 2012 however this approach needs a large number of viral particles and until recently it was not possible to propagate husavs to this degree because of the lack of an in vitro cell culture system thus the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs have not been investigated it is also unclear whether the reduction efficiencies of husavs are comparable with those of other representative human enteric viruses recently an in vitro cell culture system for husavs has been established that can produce 108 9 copies of husavs per milliliter of cell supernatant takagi et al 2020 which is enough for conducting virus spiking experiments e g initial virus concentrations of 105 8 copies ml were used by frohnert et al 2015 and shirakawa et al 2022 in addition husavs in water samples can be replicated with the cell culture system if they are culturable i e if they are infectious the infectivity of husavs in water samples can therefore be evaluated by examining whether husavs can replicate during propagation using the cell culture system if methods for quantifying infectious husav are successfully developed by applying the cell culture system we could evaluate the efficacy of disinfection processes to inactivate husavs by quantifying infectious husav before and after disinfection processes to quantify infectious virus concentrations assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect such as a plaque forming unit pfu assay have been used widely cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 on the other hand because several viruses do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect the integrated cell culture polymerase chain reaction icc pcr which does not require the production of a cytopathic effect has also been applied abad et al 1997 sylvestre et al 2021 husavs do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect even with the cell culture system of takagi et al 2020 icc pcr should therefore be applied to quantify infectious husav and to assess the efficacy of free chlorine disinfection for the inactivation of husav ideally the virus reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes should be investigated for all human enteric viruses however such wide ranging investigations are not feasible mostly because the propagation of multiple viruses is labor intensive and time consuming due to the virus propagation method varying from virus to virus e g host cell type culture medium composition and optimum virus propagation period therefore viral surrogates are often used for the assessment of the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of human enteric viruses boudaud et al 2012 tanneru and chellam 2012 some animal caliciviruses such as feline calicivirus and murine norovirus mnv can be easily propagated by using cell culture systems vinjÃ© et al 2019 mnv is widely used as a surrogate for human noroviruses to assess the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of those viruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 however because the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs have not been investigated the relationship between the reduction efficiencies of husavs and mnv and therefore the suitability of mnv as a surrogate for husavs is unclear pepper mild mottle virus pmmov is a plant virus that is present in drinking water sources at higher concentrations than human enteric viruses haramoto et al 2013 shirakawa et al 2022 owing to its high concentrations indigenous pmmov has been used to assess the virus removal efficiencies of full scale drinking water treatment plants kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 in addition the removal ratios as evaluated by real time pcr for pmmov have been shown to be comparable with or lower than those for three representative human enteric viruses i e adenovirus coxsackievirus cv and hepatitis a virus hav in laboratory scale coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration cs rsf and membrane filtration including coagulation microfiltration c mf experiments shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 thus pmmov has been proposed as a suitable surrogate for those viruses for the assessment of cs rsf and membrane filtration processes shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 however the suitability of pmmov as a surrogate for husavs in cs rsf and membrane filtration processes is unclear because the efficiencies of these treatment processes for the removal of husavs have not been investigated on the other hand pmmov is not considered to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses in free chlorine disinfection because pmmov has shown very high resistance to free chlorine disinfection compared with representative human enteric viruses including a chlorine resistant virus cv shirasaki et al 2020 here we 1 investigated the husav removal efficiencies of cs rsf and c mf as well as the husav inactivation efficiencies of free chlorine disinfection by applying an in vitro cell culture system to produce purified solutions of husav containing virus concentrations high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments 2 compared the husav removal inactivation efficiencies with those of other representative human enteric viruses astrovirus astv and cv and 3 assessed the suitability of using mnv and pmmov as surrogates for husav to examine the mechanism of inactivation of husav by free chlorine disinfection the relationship between the infectivity reduction ratio of husav and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by free chlorine disinfection was examined by viability pcr using an intercalating dye in this approach the intercalating dye cannot enter viruses with intact capsids whereas it can enter inactivated viruses with damaged capsids bind to the viral rna and inhibit subsequent amplification of the rna by reverse transcription pcr the loss of viral capsid integrity can therefore be examined by using viability pcr astv was chosen because even though astv has been detected in drinking water sources sylvestre et al 2021 and is classified by the world health organization as a pathogen transmitted through drinking water who 2011 data on the reduction of astv by drinking water treatment processes are limited abad et al 1997 espinosa et al 2008 cv was chosen because this virus is much more resistant to chlorine treatment than other representative human enteric viruses such as adenovirus poliovirus echovirus and hav health canada 2017 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 to our knowledge this is the first study assessing the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husav through virus spiking experiments by applying an in vitro cell culture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 husav astv mnv pmmov and cv husav gi 1 ak20

with bile acid sodium glycocholate nacalai tesque inc kyoto japan the virus and cells were the same as those used by the national institute of infectious disease in a previous study takagi et al 2020

faulkner strain atcc vr 185 was obtained from the atcc and propagated in buffalo green monkey kidney epithelial cells bgm cells details of the propagation and purification of mnv and cv and details of the propagation of pmmov are described in our previous reports shirasaki et al 2017b 2018 2 2 cs rsf experiments the water samples used for the cs rsf experiments were collected from two drinking water treatment plants located in japan plants a and b that use cs rsf for the production of drinking water from river water river water samples were collected at plants a and b on 5 october 2021 and 5 november 2021 respectively water quality data for the water samples are shown in table s1 the water samples were stored at 4 c until use and brought to 20 c immediately prior to use cs rsf experiments were conducted with 2 l of virus spiked water in square plastic beakers at 20 c details of the experimental procedures are provided in section s1 2 2 3 c mf experiments the water samples used for the c mf experiments were collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in japan plant c that uses c mf for the production of drinking water at plant c subsoil water is subjected to pre chlorination and manganese oxide mnox coated media filtration and the mnox treated water is used as the raw water for c mf samples of this mnox treated water containing free chlorine were collected on 25 october 2021 the water quality data for the water samples are shown in table s1 the water samples were stored at 4 c until use and brought to 20 c immediately prior to use before each experiment we quantified the residual free chlorine concentrations in the water samples by using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and a dr900 multiparameter portable colorimeter hach company loveland co usa and confirmed that free chlorine in the water samples was completely consumed during sample storage c mf experiments were conducted with 500 ml of virus spiked water in square plastic

fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation osaka japan was used immediately after dilution with milli q water chlorine treatment experiments were conducted with 300 ml of virus spiked pbs in a glass

reverse transcription pcr viral rna of husav astv mnv pmmov or cv was quantified by real time reverse transcription pcr real time rt pcr details of the real time rt pcr method are provided in section s1 5 2 6 quantification of infectious husav astv mnv and cv by icc pcr to quantify infectious husav or astv and to investigate the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate these viruses icc pcr assays were developed for these viruses this approach was taken because husav does not produce an obvious cytopathic effect which makes it impossible to use a pfu assay with this virus and a pfu assay for astv using caco 2 cells which are widely used for the propagation of astv bosch et al 2014 has not been established although pfu assays are available for mnv and cv cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 we also developed icc pcr assays for these viruses to investigate whether icc pcr can be used as an alternative to the pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment samples which were undiluted or serially diluted 10 fold four dilution series per sample were inoculated to host cells in 6 well tissue culture plates with triplicate wells per dilution series wells in which the virus concentrations in the liquid phase of the virus infected cell culture solution after propagation as determined by real time rt pcr were increased compared with those in pre wash and post wash samples see section s1 6 were defined as infectivity positive for icc pcr the number of infectivity positive wells of each dilution series was counted and converted to the most probable number mpn by using the epa mpn calculator https mostprobablenumbercalculator epa gov mpnform details of the icc pcr assays are provided in section s1 6 2 7 quantification of infectious mnv and cv by the pfu assay to evaluate the suitability of icc pcr as an alternative to the pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment infectious mnv or cv was quantified by the pfu assay details of the pfu assay are described in our previous reports shirasaki et al 2017b with some modifications for mnv see section s1 7 2 8 quantification of husav astv mnv and cv by pmaxx enhancer pcr one of the mechanisms of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment is the loss of viral capsid integrity shirasaki et al 2020 torrey et al 2019 to examine the relationship between the virus infectivity reduction ratio and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by chlorine treatment husav astv mnv and cv were quantified by viability pcr using improved propidium monoazide pmaxx with an enhancer pmaxx enhancer pcr in the present study pmaxx solution 20 mm in h2o biotium inc fremont ca usa and pma enhancer for gram negative bacteria 5x solution biotium inc were used as previously described shirasaki et al 2020 2 9 electrophoretic mobility the electrophoretic mobilities of husav and astv were measured in alkalinity adjusted milli q water the electrophoretic mobilities of husav astv mnv and pmmov were also measured in filtered samples of river waters the same samples used for cs rsf and mnox treated water the same samples used for c mf the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses were measured with a zetasizer nano zs 50 mw 532 nm green laser malvern instruments malvern worcestershire uk at 25 c and a 17 measurement angle details of the electrophoretic mobility measurement are provided in section s1 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of purified solution of husav by applying in vitro cell culture system initially we optimized the incubation period for the propagation of husav by the in vitro cell culture system twenty microliters of stock solution of husav was inoculated to hutu 80 cells and the concentrations of husav in the liquid phase of the virus infected cell culture solution were determined for 10 days by real time rt pcr fig s1 the husav concentration increased rapidly from 105 0 copies ml at 1 day post inoculation dpi to 107 6 copies ml at 3 dpi reached a peak concentration of 108 9 copies ml at 7 dpi and then persisted through 10 dpi the 1 dpi samples were the same as the post wash samples described in section 3 3 this result is consistent with that of takagi et al 2020 who also reported that the husav concentration reached peak concentrations of 108 9 copies ml at 5 10 dpi and then persisted through 14 dpi based on these results we concluded that incubation for 10 days was optimal for the propagation of husav and used that incubation time to produce the stock solution of husav for use in the subsequent virus spiking experiments we purified the stock solution of husav by means of tangential flow ultrafiltration for details see section s1 1 the husav concentration in the stock solution was approximately 109 copies ml and 106 mpn ml as determined by real time rt pcr and icc pcr respectively and the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was 6000 mg l after purification the husav concentration remained unchanged but the doc concentration was decreased to 400 mg l data not shown thus we concluded that this approach afforded a purified solution of husav containing a virus concentration high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments in the subsequent virus spiking experiments the purified solution was spiked into river water cs rsf mnox treated water c mf or pbs chlorine treatment at an initial concentration of approximately 105 6 copies ml and 102 3 mpn ml as determined by real time rt pcr and icc pcr respectively by its addition to the water samples the purified solution was diluted 2000 to 3000 fold which reduced the concentration of unintentionally introduced doc components to 0 2 mg l 3 2 removal of husav astv mnv and pmmov by cs rsf the virus removal ratios log10 cc 0 ccs achieved by cs were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig s2 c c0 and c cs are the virus concentrations before coagulation and after settling respectively in the absence of coagulant no removal 0 0 log10 of husav was observed husav was negatively charged in filtered samples of river waters used for cs rsf at ph 7 0 described below thus husav in the river waters was expected to be stably monodispersed by electrical repulsion which would explain the lack of virus removal in the absence of coagulant in contrast by the addition of coagulant at dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples from plants a and b 1 4 1 6 log10 and 1 3 1 6 log10 removals of husav respectively were observed this result suggests that the stably monodispersed virus was destabilized by the addition of coagulant became adsorbed to entrapped in the aluminum floc particles generated during coagulation and settled from suspension by gravity during sedimentation the virus removal ratios log10 c c0 c cs log10 cr 0 crf achieved by cs rsf were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig 1 c r0 and c rf are the virus concentrations in feed water before the rsf and in sand filtrate respectively as with cs alone no removal 0 0 log10 of husav was observed in the absence of coagulant indicating that adsorption of the stably monodispersed virus to the sand surface by the electrostatic attractive force van der waals attractive force was negligible in contrast by the addition of coagulant at dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples from plants a and b 1 6 2 1 log10 and 2 2 2 3 log10 removals of husav respectively were observed this result indicates that the husav particles associated with the suspended aluminum floc particles were effectively removed by the subsequent rsf when coagulant dosages were increased from 0 54 to 1 62 mg al l for the sample from plant a and from 3 24 to 5 40 mg al l for the sample from plant b the removal ratios of husav by cs rsf increased from 1 6 2 1 log10 to 2 2 2 4 log10 and from 2 2 2 3 log10 to 3 3 3 7 log10 respectively fig 1 this result indicates that coagulant dosage affected the removal efficiencies of husav by cs rsf the improvement in virus removal ratios with increasing coagulant dosage is most likely due to an increase in the size of the aluminum floc particles with the adsorbed entrapped viruses an increase in floc size would have increased the amount of the aluminum floc particles that settled from suspension by gravity during sedimentation as well as that were effectively removed by the subsequent rsf ultimately 1 6 2 4 log10 and 2 2 3 7 log10 removals of husav were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 1 62 and 3 24 5 40 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively to investigate whether mnv and pmmov are suitable surrogates for assessing the efficacy of cs rsf to remove husav we examined the relationships between the removal ratios of husav and those of mnv and pmmov by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r values the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of mnv 1 2 3 2 log10 and pmmov 1 3 3 1 log10 and strong correlations were observed between the values for husav and mnv r 0 88 p 0 01 fig 2 a and those for husav and pmmov r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 2b these results indicate that mnv and pmmov are both suitable surrogates for husav in virus spiking cs rsf experiments like husav although no removal 0 1 log10 of astv was observed in the absence of coagulant 1 8 2 0 log10 and 2 7 3 3 log10 removals of astv were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively fig 1 the removal ratios of astv were increased from 1 8 2 0 log10 to 2 6 2 7 log10 when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 54 to 1 08 mg al l for the samples from plant a in contrast the removal ratios of astv remained independent of coagulant dosage for the sample from plant b 2 6 3 3 log10 removals at dosages of 3 24 5 40 mg al l ultimately 1 8 2 7 log10 and 2 6 3 3 log10 removals of astv were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 1 62 and 3 24 5 40 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively the removal ratios of astv were comparable with and moderately correlated with those of husav r 0 61 p 0 05 data not shown in addition the removal ratios of astv were comparable with and strongly correlated with those of pmmov r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 2b these results indicate that pmmov is also a suitable surrogate for astv in virus spiking cs rsf experiments because indigenous pmmov is present in drinking water sources at higher concentrations than human enteric viruses haramoto et al 2013 shirakawa et al 2022 the virus removal efficiencies of full scale cs rsf have been successfully determined by targeting indigenous pmmov kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 thus it is reasonable to conclude that for drinking water treatment plants for which the removal ratios of indigenous pmmov by cs rsf have been determined comparable removal ratios could be expected for indigenous husav and astv at those treatment plants the surface charge of virus particles is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies of cs rsf shirasaki et al 2018 to investigate why the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of astv mnv and pmmov in cs rsf we compared the isoelectric points of the viruses and the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses in filtered samples of river waters used for cs rsf at ph 7 0 the isoelectric point of husav was 4 4 fig 3 a which is similar to those of astv 3 4 fig 3a mnv 3 8 shirasaki et al 2017b and pmmov 3 2 shirasaki et al 2017a indicating that all four viruses are negatively charged at ph 7 0 due to their isoelectric points being 4 4 indeed they showed negative electrophoretic mobilities in filtered samples of the river waters at ph 7 0 fig 3b in addition all four viruses showed similar electrophoretic mobilities ranging from 1 4 to 1 9 and 1 2 to 1 4 Âµm s v cm in filtered samples of the river waters for plants a and b respectively thus the similar electrophoretic mobilities of husav astv mnv and pmmov in the river waters probably led to their similar removal ratios by cs rsf 3 3 removal of husav astv mnv and pmmov by c mf the virus removal ratios log10 cm 0 cmf achieved by c mf were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig 4 c m0 and c mf are the virus concentrations before coagulation and in mf filtrate respectively in the absence of coagulant limited removal 0 7 log10 of husav was observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 husav has a diameter of approximately 40 45 nm li et al 2022 takagi et al 2020 which is smaller than the nominal pore size of the mf membrane used in the present study 0 1 Âµm in addition the virus was negatively charged in filtered samples of mnox treated water used for c mf at ph 7 0 and 7 5 described below thus husav in the mnox treated water was expected to be stably monodispersed by electrical repulsion which would explain the limited removal of husav in the absence of coagulant these results also indicate that adsorption of the stably monodispersed virus to the mf membrane by the electrostatic hydrophobic interactions was negligibly small in contrast by the addition of coagulant at a dosage of 0 27 mg al l 1 2 2 2 log10 and 1 6 1 9 log10 removals of husav were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively this result indicates that during coagulation the husav particles were incorporated into the aluminum floc particles which were larger than the nominal pore size of the mf membrane and the floc particles with the incorporated viruses were then effectively removed by size exclusion when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 27 to 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of husav by c mf were increased from 1 2 2 2 log10 to 3 5 log10 at ph 7 0 fig 4 a and from 1 6 1 9 log10 to 2 6 3 0 log10 at ph 7 5 fig 4b these results indicate that coagulant dosage strongly affected the removal efficiencies of husav by c mf like cs rsf the improvement in virus removal ratios with increasing coagulant dosage is most likely due to an increase in the size of the aluminum floc particles with the adsorbed entrapped viruses an increase in floc size would have decreased the amount of the aluminum floc particles that passed through the mf membrane as discussed in our previous report shirasaki et al 2010 at a coagulant dosage of 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of husav at ph 7 0 were higher than those at ph 7 5 fig 4 indicating that coagulation ph also affected the removal efficiencies of husav by c mf this is most likely due to the presence of a large amount of the positively charged aluminum species at ph 7 0 compared with that at ph 7 5 meyn et al 2011 have also reported that the removal ratios of bacteriophage ms2 are higher at the coagulation ph of 5 5 than at the coagulation ph of 6 5 due to the formation of more positively charged polynuclear aluminum species at ph 5 5 than at ph 6 5 ultimately 1 2 4 3 log10 and 1 6 4 0 log10 removals of husav were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 at coagulant dosages of 0 27 1 08 mg al l respectively to investigate whether mnv and pmmov are suitable surrogates for assessing the efficacy of c mf to remove husav we examined the relationships between the removal ratios of husav and those of mnv and pmmov by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r values virus removal ratios that were below the limit of quantification of real time rt pcr were excluded from the analysis note the same is true for the following analyses of the relationships between the removal ratios of astv and those of husav and pmmov the removal ratios of husav 1 2 3 4 log10 were approximately 1 2 log10 higher than those of mnv 0 3 2 1 log10 and pmmov 0 4 1 2 log10 and strong correlations were observed between the values for husav and mnv r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 5 a and those for husav and pmmov r 0 72 p 0 05 fig 5b these results suggest that mnv and pmmov are both conservative surrogates for husav in virus spiking c mf experiments like husav although limited removal 0 6 log10 of astv diameter 28 41 nm bosch et al 2014 was observed in the absence of coagulant 1 1 1 8 log10 and 1 1 log10 removals of astv were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively at a coagulant dosage of 0 27 mg al l fig 4 the removal ratios of astv were increased from 1 1 1 8 log10 to 3 4 3 8 log10 at ph 7 0 fig 4a and from 1 1 log10 to 1 9 2 4 log10 at ph 7 5 fig 4b when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 27 to 0 41 mg al l in addition at a coagulant dosage of 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of astv at ph 7 0 were higher than those at ph 7 5 fig 4 these results indicate that like husav both coagulant dosage and coagulation ph affected the removal efficiencies of astv by c mf ultimately 1 1 4 0 log10 and 1 1 4 0 log10 removals of astv were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 at coagulant dosages of 0 27 1 08 mg al l respectively the removal ratios of astv 1 1 2 4 log10 were comparable with those of husav 1 2 3 0 log10 and were strongly correlated with those of husav r 0 88 p 0 05 data not shown in addition the removal ratios of astv 1 1 3 4 log10 were approximately 1 2 log10 higher than those of pmmov 0 4 1 6 log10 and were strongly correlated with those of pmmov r 0 86 p 0 05 fig 5b these results suggest that pmmov is also a conservative surrogate for astv in virus spiking c mf experiments as with cs rsf the virus removal efficiencies in full scale c mf have been successfully determined by targeting indigenous pmmov shirakawa et al 2022 thus it is reasonable to conclude that for drinking water treatment plants for which the removal ratios of indigenous pmmov by c mf have been determined higher removal ratios could be expected for indigenous husav and astv at that those treatment plants for c mf as well as cs rsf the surface charge of virus particles is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies shirasaki et al 2017a tanneru and chellam 2012 to investigate why the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of astv and higher than those of mnv and pmmov in c mf we compared the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses in filtered samples of mnox treated water used for c mf at ph 7 0 or 7 5 because the isoelectric points of all four viruses are 4 4 see section 3 2 they showed negative electrophoretic mobilities in filtered samples of the mnox treated water at ph 7 0 and 7 5 fig 3b in addition all four viruses showed similar electrophoretic mobilities ranging from 1 6 to 1 9 and 1 3 to 1 9 Âµm s v cm at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively thus the similar electrophoretic mobilities of husav and astv in the mnox treated water probably led to their similar removal ratios by c mf however the reason for the high removal ratios of husav and astv compared with those of mnv and pmmov by c mf cannot be explained solely by the difference in the electrophoretic mobilities among these viruses one of the factors that is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies in physical and physicochemical water treatment processes such as coagulation is the hydrophobicities of virus particles heffron and mayer 2016 further study is needed to investigate whether the difference in the hydrophobicities of virus particles contributes to the difference in the virus removal ratios in c mf 3 4 development of an icc pcr assay for quantification of infectious husav astv mnv and cv because husav does not produce an obvious cytopathic effect takagi et al 2020 a pfu assay cannot be used to quantify infectious husav we therefore developed an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and then used that assay to examine the efficacy of free chlorine disinfection for the inactivation of husav fig 6 a shows the effect of inoculum concentration on the propagation of husav at an inoculum volume of 20 Âµl which is similar to that used in a previous study 10 Âµl takagi et al 2020 the husav concentrations in the post wash samples i e samples after a 12 h incubation removing of the inoculum and washing of the cell monolayer see section s1 6 as determined by real time rt pcr were up to 2 1 log10 lower than those in the pre wash samples i e samples after a 12 h incubation but before removing of the inoculum see section s1 6 these results suggest that most viruses that did not attach to hutu 80 cells were removed by the washing procedure the husav concentrations increased to 108 copies ml at 10 dpi optimum incubation period determined for the propagation of husav see section 3 1 when the inoculum concentrations were 105 copies ml but did not increase when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml indicating that husav in the inoculum only replicated when the inoculum concentration was 105 copies ml thus we concluded that we could judge whether husav in water samples is infectious by using icc pcr based on the difference between the husav concentrations in the pre wash post wash and 10 dpi samples when the inoculum concentrations were 105 copies ml to optimize the inoculum concentration needed for judging whether husav in water samples is infectious the inoculum volume was increased from 20 to 300 or 1000 Âµl in both cases the husav concentrations increased to 108 copies ml at 10 dpi when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml but did not increase when the inoculum concentrations were 103 copies ml fig 6b c indicating that increasing the inoculum volume from 20 to 300 or 1000 Âµl allowed judgment on whether husav in water samples is infectious even when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml thus we used an inoculum volume of 1000 Âµl in the icc pcr assay for husav and in the development of the icc pcr assays for astv mnv and cv like husav whether astv mnv or cv in water samples is infectious could be judged by using icc pcr when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml the effects of incubation period and inoculum concentration on the propagation of astv mnv and cv are discussed in section s2 1 and figs s3 and s4 based on these results if the virus concentrations in the 10 husav 4 astv or 3 dpi mnv and cv samples were at least 1 log10 higher than those in the pre wash samples and at least 3 log10 higher than those in the post wash samples those wells were defined as infectivity positive for calculating mpn in the following chlorine treatment experiments we used the developed icc pcr assays for quantifying infectious virus concentration mpn ml 3 5 inactivation of husav astv mnv and cv by chlorine treatment 3 5 1 suitability of icc pcr as an alternative to a pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment as described in section 3 4 we found that the inoculum concentration needed for judging whether husav astv mnv or cv in water samples is infectious was 104 copies ml for all four viruses thus in the following chlorine treatment experiments husav or astv was spiked to pbs at an initial concentration of 105 6 or 107 copies ml as evaluated by real time rt pcr which was equivalent to 102 3 mpn ml or 103 4 mpn ml respectively as evaluated by icc pcr mnv or cv was spiked at an initial concentration of 108 copies ml as evaluated by real time rt pcr which was equivalent to 104 5 mpn ml as evaluated by icc pcr and to 103 pfu ml as evaluated by the pfu assay we first evaluated whether icc pcr could be used as an alternative to a pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment fig s5 shows the infectivity reduction ratios log10 n 0 nc of mnv and cv by chlorine treatment at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 as evaluated by the icc pcr and pfu assay n 0 and n c are the virus concentrations before and after chlorine treatment respectively for mnv when the pfu assay was used 2 4 2 7 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value free chlorine concentration c multiplied by contact time t of 0 02 mg cl2 min l fig s5a at the same ct value 3 1 log10 inactivation was observed when icc pcr was used because the concentrations of infectious mnv after chlorine treatment were below the limit of quantification of icc pcr 100 fold concentration using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane with blocking pretreatment was performed see section s1 4 the recovery ratio of infectious mnv during the 100 fold concentration as determined by the pfu assay and icc pcr was 46 and 61 n 1 data not shown respectively indicating that infectious mnv was effectively recovered during the 100 fold concentration by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 2 8 3 0 log10 and 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratios fig s5b for cv when the pfu assay was used 0 9 1 2 log10 and 2 8 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at ct values of 0 35 0 37 and 1 05 1 15 mg cl2 min l respectively fig s5c at the same ct values 1 3 log10 and 3 1 3 4 log10 inactivation respectively were observed when icc pcr was used the infectivity reduction ratios of mnv and cv obtained by icc pcr were comparable with those obtained by the pfu assay these results indicate that icc pcr is a potential alternative to the pfu assay for the assessment of the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate viruses for which the pfu assay is not available such as husav 3 5 2 inactivation of husav and astv by chlorine treatment we evaluated the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate husav and astv by using the developed icc pcr assay fig 7 a e for husav at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 2 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l fig 7a note duplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the second experiment because the concentrations of infectious husav after chlorine treatment were below the limit of quantification of icc pcr 100 fold concentration using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane and blocking pretreatment was performed see section s1 4 the recovery ratio of infectious husav during the 100 fold concentration as determined by icc pcr was 59 47 n 4 data not shown indicating that infectious husav was effectively recovered during the 100 fold concentration by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation was observed at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratio fig 7b at 5 c 2 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l without any concentration procedure fig 7c note duplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the second experiment by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 2 6 2 9 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratio fig 7d the infectivity reduction ratios obtained at 5 c were lower than those obtained at 20 c indicating that the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate husav is lower at 5 c than at 20 c this may be explained by the lower contact frequency between virus particles and free chlorine due to the lower diffusivity of free chlorine at 5 c than at 20 c astv required a higher ct value for inactivation by chlorine treatment than husav fig 7e at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 1 3 1 7 log10 and 1 7 2 0 log10 inactivation were observed at ct values of 0 02 and 0 03 mg cl2 min l respectively note triplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the first and second experiments these results indicate that astv is more resistant than husav to chlorine treatment astv achieved 3 4 log10 inactivation at a ct value of 0 09 mg cl2 min l abad et al 1997 and espinosa et al 2008 have reported 2 5 log10 and 1 3 log10 inactivation of astv by chlorine treatment using initial free chlorine concentrations of 0 5 and 2 mg cl2 l contact times of 60 and 120 min and water temperatures of 20 and 23 c respectively which are findings not consistent with our present results initial free chlorine concentration 0 2 mg cl2 l contact time 5 s 1 min water temperature 20 c possible explanations for these discrepancies include differences in virus type astv type 1 vs type 4 or 8 water type pbs vs drinking water or groundwater and ph 7 0 vs 7 5 or 7 6 among the three studies which are factors that affect the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 in addition the approach for purification of the astv solution may have also differed between the studies in the present study the stock solution of astv was purified by using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane to remove doc components from the culture medium see section s1 1 and the purified astv solution was diluted 2000 to 3000 fold by addition to pbs which together reduced the amount of unintentionally introduced doc components to 0 2 mg l it is unclear whether abad et al 1997 and espinosa et al 2008 used a purification procedure however if they did not it is possible that high amounts of doc components compared with those in the present study were unintentionally introduced into the virus spiked water such introduction of doc components would result in the consumption of a large amount of free chlorine and overestimation of the ct value for a given level of virus inactivation i e underestimation of the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment dunkin et al 2017 mnv is widely used in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments as a surrogate for human noroviruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 for example cromeans et al 2010 have reported a ct value of 0 07 mg cl2 min l for 4 log10 inactivation of mnv by chlorine treatment pbs ph 7 0 5 c in the present study 2 8 3 0 log10 and 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation of mnv were observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively pbs ph 7 0 20 c see section 3 5 1 our results roughly agree with those of cromeans et al 2010 in addition in the present study the infectivity reduction ratios of mnv were comparable with those of husav at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l 3 8 4 0 log10 pbs ph 7 0 20 c together these results suggest that there is a possibility of using mnv as a surrogate for husav in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments because the infectivity reduction ratios of husav and mnv were compared only under one condition pbs ph 7 0 20 c ct value 0 02 mg cl2 min l further study under other conditions is needed to conclude whether mnv is a suitable surrogate for husav in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments several research groups including ours have found that cv b5 shows the highest resistance to chlorine treatment among representative human enteric viruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 ct values of 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 mg cl2 min l for 3 and 4 log10 inactivation respectively of cv b5 by chlorine treatment pbs ph 7 0 20 22 c have been reported shirasaki et al 2020 torii et al 2021 in the present study 2 8 3 4 log10 and 3 1 3 4 log10 inactivation of cv b5 were observed at a ct value of 1 1 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively pbs ph 7 0 20 c see section 3 5 1 our results roughly agree with those of shirasaki et al 2020 and torii et al 2021 when we compared the inactivation efficiencies for husav astv and cv b5 under the same conditions pbs ph 7 0 20 c and quantification by icc pcr we found that 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv were achieved at ct values of only 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these values are much smaller than those achieved for 3 log10 inactivation of cv b5 obtained in the present study and for 4 log10 inactivation of cv b5 reported by shirasaki et al 2020 and torii et al 2021 these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment and more sensitive than the chlorine resistant virus cv b5 the u s environmental protection agency recommends ct values of 2 mg cl2 min l for 3 log10 inactivation of viruses by free chlorine disinfection at ph 6 9 and 20 c usepa 1991 in the present study ct values of only 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l provided 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv respectively this suggests that at least 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv respectively are achieved by free chlorine disinfection with the recommended ct value of 2 mg cl2 min l in the present study only one strain was chosen from husav or astv and used in the virus spiking experiments on the other hand other research groups have reported that the resistance of cv b5 to free chlorine disinfection varies depending on the strain meister et al 2018 torii et al 2021 further study is needed to investigate the variability in the resistance to free chlorine disinfection among strains of husav or astv 3 5 3 relationship between virus infectivity reduction ratio and degree of damage to viral capsid by chlorine treatment to examine the mechanism of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment the relationship between the virus infectivity reduction ratio and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by chlorine treatment was examined by evaluating the virus reduction ratio after chlorine treatment by means of pcr alone or pmaxx enhancer pcr fig 7 for husav although 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation was observed at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l see section 3 5 2 pcr alone showed limited signal reduction 0 7 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7a b even when pmaxx enhancer pcr was used limited signal reduction 0 7 log10 was observed at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l a similar trend was also observed at 5 c fig 7c d these results indicate that husav was inactivated by chlorine treatment due to subtle alterations of the viral capsid at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l because pmaxx was unable to penetrate the capsid of chlorine inactivated husav in contrast unlike pcr alone pmaxx enhancer pcr showed signal reductions of 1 3 2 2 log10 at 20 c and ct values of 0 08 0 09 mg cl2 min l and the signal reduction ratios were increased to 1 9 2 8 log10 with increasing ct values to 0 14 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7a these results suggest that at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2 min l chlorine treatment caused damage to the viral capsid of husav such that pmaxx could penetrate into the virus particles and that damage to the capsid was increased with increasing ct value these results also suggest that chlorine treatment caused negligible damage to the viral rna of husav even at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2 min l similarly although 1 3 2 0 log10 inactivation of astv was observed at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l see section 3 5 2 pcr alone showed limited signal reduction 0 6 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7e in contrast the signal reduction ratios as evaluated by pmaxx enhancer pcr were increased from 0 0 0 7 log10 to 0 9 1 7 log10 with increasing ct values from 0 02 to 0 14 0 17 mg cl2 min l for mnv although 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when icc pcr was used see section 3 5 1 both pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr showed almost no signal reduction 0 4 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l fig 7f g for cv although 1 3 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 4 mg cl2 min l when icc pcr was used see section 3 5 1 pcr alone showed almost no signal reduction 0 4 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 4 1 1 mg cl2 min l fig 7h in contrast the signal reduction ratios as evaluated by pmaxx enhancer pcr were increased from 0 0 0 2 log10 to 0 6 1 0 log10 with increasing ct values from 0 4 to 1 1 mg cl2 min l the signal reduction ratios obtained with pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr were smaller than the infectivity reduction ratios obtained with icc pcr for all of the viruses and ct values tested similar trends were also observed for adenovirus and pmmov in our previous study shirasaki et al 2020 these results indicate that both pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr underestimate the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment which emphasizes the importance of infectivity assays for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment although assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect such as the pfu assay are extensively used as infectivity assays these assays cannot be used for all viruses because some viruses do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect in contrast the icc pcr does not require the production of a cytopathic effect to quantify infectious virus concentrations thus the icc pcr assay is useful for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate viruses for which assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect are not available such as husav 4 conclusions we successfully evaluated the removal efficiencies of husav in cs rsf and c mf as well as the inactivation efficiencies of husav in free chlorine disinfection by applying an in vitro cell culture system to prepare the purified solution of husav containing virus concentration high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments the removal ratios of husav by cs rsf were 1 6 3 7 log10 and were comparable and correlated with those of mnv and pmmov in addition the removal ratios of husav by c mf were 1 2 4 3 log10 and were higher than but still correlated with those of mnv and pmmov thus both mnv and pmmov appear to be potential surrogates for husav in cs rsf and c mf the removal ratios of astv by cs rsf were 1 8 3 3 log10 and were comparable and correlated with those of pmmov in addition the removal ratios of astv by c mf were 1 1 4 0 log10 and were higher than but still correlated with those of pmmov thus pmmov also appears to be a potential surrogate for astv in cs rsf and c mf the infectivity reduction ratios of husav by chlorine treatment at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l as evaluated by the developed icc pcr assay were 3 8 4 0 log10 which were comparable to those of mnv for astv 1 3 1 7 log10 and 3 4 log10 inactivation as evaluated by icc pcr were observed at 20 c and ct values of 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment compared with a chlorine resistant virus cv b5 1 3 log10 inactivation at 20 c and a ct value of 0 4 mg cl2 min l as evaluated by icc pcr analyses using pmaxx enhancer pcr revealed that husav was inactivated by chlorine treatment due to subtle alterations of the viral capsid at ct values of 0 03 mg cl2 min l and due to damage to the capsid but not the viral rna at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2

14836,here we examined the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the removal and inactivation of human sapovirus husav we applied a recently developed in vitro cell culture system to produce purified solutions of husav containing virus concentrations high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an integrated cell culture polymerase chain reaction icc pcr assay to quantify the infectivity of husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments in virus spiking coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration cs rsf and coagulation microfiltration c mf experiments husav removals of 1 6 3 7 log10 and 1 2 4 3 log10 respectively were observed the removal ratios observed with cs rsf were comparable and correlated with those of murine norovirus mnv a widely used surrogate for human noroviruses and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a potential surrogate for human enteric viruses in physical and physicochemical drinking water treatment processes and those observed with c mf were higher than but still correlated with those of mnv and pmmov indicating that mnv and pmmov are both potential surrogates for husav in cs rsf and c mf for astrovirus astv a representative human enteric virus removal ratios of 1 8 3 3 log10 and 1 1 4 0 log10 were observed with cs rsf and c mf respectively the removal ratios of astv observed with cs rsf were comparable and correlated with those of pmmov and those observed with c mf were higher than but still correlated with those of pmmov indicating that pmmov is a potential surrogate for astv in cs rsf and c mf when the efficacy of chlorine treatment was examined by using the developed icc pcr assay 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation of husav was observed at a ct value free chlorine concentration c multiplied by contact time t of 0 02 mg cl2 min l the infectivity reduction ratios of husav were comparable with those of mnv for astv 1 3 1 7 log10 and 3 4 log10 inactivation as evaluated by icc pcr was observed at ct values of 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment and more sensitive than a chlorine resistant virus

human sapovirus integrated cell culture pcr murine norovirus pepper mild mottle virus 1 introduction human sapoviruses husavs previously called sapporo like viruses after their discovery from a gastroenteritis outbreak in sapporo japan chiba et al 1979 belong to the genus sapovirus in the family caliciviridae oka et al 2015 the same family as human noroviruses genus norovirus husavs are a common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide health canada 2017 husavs are excreted in the feces of infected individuals who 2011 and have been detected in raw and treated wastewaters health canada 2017 indeed drinking water sources that receive treated wastewaters often become contaminated with these viruses sano et al 2011 sylvestre et al 2021 outbreaks of husav induced gastroenteritis due to contaminated drinking water have been reported although these outbreaks were found to have originated from the intrusion of wastewater into a drinking water distribution system due to pipe breakage kauppinen et al 2019 not from inadequate treatment for the reduction i e removal inactivation of husavs however there is the potential for outbreaks of husav induced gastroenteritis to occur if drinking water treatment processes are inadequate for the reduction of husavs due to the importance of husavs as waterborne pathogens they are classified by the world health organization as pathogens that are of relevance to the supply management of drinking water who 2011 in addition human caliciviruses husavs and human noroviruses are included in the fifth drinking water contaminant candidate list published by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2022 thus understanding the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs is important for the prevention of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by exposure to contaminated drinking water in the laboratory virus spiking experiments using artificially propagated viruses are often used to investigate the virus reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes abad et al 1997 cromeans et al 2010 espinosa et al 2008 kahler et al 2010 kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 shirasaki et al 2020 tanneru and chellam 2012 however this approach needs a large number of viral particles and until recently it was not possible to propagate husavs to this degree because of the lack of an in vitro cell culture system thus the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs have not been investigated it is also unclear whether the reduction efficiencies of husavs are comparable with those of other representative human enteric viruses recently an in vitro cell culture system for husavs has been established that can produce 108 9 copies of husavs per milliliter of cell supernatant takagi et al 2020 which is enough for conducting virus spiking experiments e g initial virus concentrations of 105 8 copies ml were used by frohnert et al 2015 and shirakawa et al 2022 in addition husavs in water samples can be replicated with the cell culture system if they are culturable i e if they are infectious the infectivity of husavs in water samples can therefore be evaluated by examining whether husavs can replicate during propagation using the cell culture system if methods for quantifying infectious husav are successfully developed by applying the cell culture system we could evaluate the efficacy of disinfection processes to inactivate husavs by quantifying infectious husav before and after disinfection processes to quantify infectious virus concentrations assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect such as a plaque forming unit pfu assay have been used widely cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 on the other hand because several viruses do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect the integrated cell culture polymerase chain reaction icc pcr which does not require the production of a cytopathic effect has also been applied abad et al 1997 sylvestre et al 2021 husavs do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect even with the cell culture system of takagi et al 2020 icc pcr should therefore be applied to quantify infectious husav and to assess the efficacy of free chlorine disinfection for the inactivation of husav ideally the virus reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes should be investigated for all human enteric viruses however such wide ranging investigations are not feasible mostly because the propagation of multiple viruses is labor intensive and time consuming due to the virus propagation method varying from virus to virus e g host cell type culture medium composition and optimum virus propagation period therefore viral surrogates are often used for the assessment of the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of human enteric viruses boudaud et al 2012 tanneru and chellam 2012 some animal caliciviruses such as feline calicivirus and murine norovirus mnv can be easily propagated by using cell culture systems vinjÃ© et al 2019 mnv is widely used as a surrogate for human noroviruses to assess the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of those viruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 however because the efficiencies of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husavs have not been investigated the relationship between the reduction efficiencies of husavs and mnv and therefore the suitability of mnv as a surrogate for husavs is unclear pepper mild mottle virus pmmov is a plant virus that is present in drinking water sources at higher concentrations than human enteric viruses haramoto et al 2013 shirakawa et al 2022 owing to its high concentrations indigenous pmmov has been used to assess the virus removal efficiencies of full scale drinking water treatment plants kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 in addition the removal ratios as evaluated by real time pcr for pmmov have been shown to be comparable with or lower than those for three representative human enteric viruses i e adenovirus coxsackievirus cv and hepatitis a virus hav in laboratory scale coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration cs rsf and membrane filtration including coagulation microfiltration c mf experiments shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 thus pmmov has been proposed as a suitable surrogate for those viruses for the assessment of cs rsf and membrane filtration processes shirasaki et al 2017a 2018 however the suitability of pmmov as a surrogate for husavs in cs rsf and membrane filtration processes is unclear because the efficiencies of these treatment processes for the removal of husavs have not been investigated on the other hand pmmov is not considered to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric viruses in free chlorine disinfection because pmmov has shown very high resistance to free chlorine disinfection compared with representative human enteric viruses including a chlorine resistant virus cv shirasaki et al 2020 here we 1 investigated the husav removal efficiencies of cs rsf and c mf as well as the husav inactivation efficiencies of free chlorine disinfection by applying an in vitro cell culture system to produce purified solutions of husav containing virus concentrations high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments 2 compared the husav removal inactivation efficiencies with those of other representative human enteric viruses astrovirus astv and cv and 3 assessed the suitability of using mnv and pmmov as surrogates for husav to examine the mechanism of inactivation of husav by free chlorine disinfection the relationship between the infectivity reduction ratio of husav and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by free chlorine disinfection was examined by viability pcr using an intercalating dye in this approach the intercalating dye cannot enter viruses with intact capsids whereas it can enter inactivated viruses with damaged capsids bind to the viral rna and inhibit subsequent amplification of the rna by reverse transcription pcr the loss of viral capsid integrity can therefore be examined by using viability pcr astv was chosen because even though astv has been detected in drinking water sources sylvestre et al 2021 and is classified by the world health organization as a pathogen transmitted through drinking water who 2011 data on the reduction of astv by drinking water treatment processes are limited abad et al 1997 espinosa et al 2008 cv was chosen because this virus is much more resistant to chlorine treatment than other representative human enteric viruses such as adenovirus poliovirus echovirus and hav health canada 2017 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 to our knowledge this is the first study assessing the efficacy of drinking water treatment processes for the reduction of husav through virus spiking experiments by applying an in vitro cell culture system 2 materials and methods 2 1 husav astv mnv pmmov and cv husav gi 1 ak20

water treatment plants located in japan plants a and b that use cs rsf for the production of drinking water from river water river water samples were collected at plants a and b on 5 october 2021 and 5 november 2021 respectively water quality data for the water samples are shown in table s1 the water samples were stored at 4 c until use and brought to 20 c immediately prior to use cs rsf experiments were conducted with 2 l of virus spiked water in square plastic beakers at 20 c details of the experimental procedures are provided in section s1 2 2 3 c mf experiments the water samples used for the c mf experiments were collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in japan plant c that uses c mf for the production of drinking water at plant c subsoil water is subjected to pre chlorination and manganese oxide mnox coated media filtration and the mnox treated water is used as the raw water for c mf samples of this mnox treated water containing free chlorine were collected on 25 october 2021 the water quality data for the water samples are shown in table s1 the water samples were stored at 4 c until use and brought to 20 c immediately prior to use before each experiment we quantified the residual free chlorine concentrations in the water samples by using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and a dr900 multiparameter portable colorimeter hach company

fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation osaka japan was used immediately after dilution with milli q water chlorine treatment experiments were conducted with 300 ml of virus spiked pbs in a glass

reverse transcription pcr viral rna of husav astv mnv pmmov or cv was quantified by real time reverse transcription pcr real time rt pcr details of the real time rt pcr method are provided in section s1 5 2 6 quantification of infectious husav astv mnv and cv by icc pcr to quantify infectious husav or astv and to investigate the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate these viruses icc pcr assays were developed for these viruses this approach was taken because husav does not produce an obvious cytopathic effect which makes it impossible to use a pfu assay with this virus and a pfu assay for astv using caco 2 cells which are widely used for the propagation of astv bosch et al 2014 has not been established although pfu assays are available for mnv and cv cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 we also developed icc pcr assays for these viruses to investigate whether icc pcr can be used as an alternative to the pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment samples which were undiluted or serially diluted 10 fold four dilution series per sample were inoculated to host cells in 6 well tissue culture plates with triplicate wells per dilution series wells in which the virus concentrations in the liquid phase of the virus infected cell culture solution after propagation as determined by real time rt pcr were increased compared with those in pre wash and post wash samples see section s1 6 were defined as infectivity positive for icc pcr the number of infectivity positive wells of each dilution series was counted and converted to the most probable number mpn by using the epa mpn calculator https mostprobablenumbercalculator epa gov mpnform details of the icc pcr assays are provided in section s1 6 2 7 quantification of infectious mnv and cv by the pfu assay to evaluate the suitability of icc pcr as an alternative to the pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment infectious mnv or cv was quantified by the pfu assay details of the pfu assay are described in our previous reports shirasaki et al 2017b with some modifications for mnv see section s1 7 2 8 quantification of husav astv mnv and cv by pmaxx enhancer pcr one of the mechanisms of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment is the loss of viral capsid integrity shirasaki et al 2020 torrey et al 2019 to examine the relationship between the virus infectivity reduction ratio and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by chlorine treatment husav astv mnv and cv were quantified by viability pcr using improved propidium monoazide pmaxx with an enhancer pmaxx enhancer pcr in the present study pmaxx solution 20 mm in h2o biotium inc fremont ca usa and pma enhancer for gram negative bacteria 5x solution biotium inc were used as previously described shirasaki et al 2020 2 9 electrophoretic mobility the electrophoretic mobilities of husav and astv were measured in alkalinity adjusted milli q water the electrophoretic mobilities of husav astv mnv and pmmov were also measured in filtered samples of river waters the same samples used for cs rsf and mnox treated water the same samples used for c mf the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses were measured with a zetasizer nano zs 50 mw 532 nm green laser malvern instruments malvern worcestershire uk at 25 c and a 17 measurement angle details of the electrophoretic mobility measurement are provided in section s1 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of purified solution of husav by applying in vitro cell culture system initially we optimized the incubation period for the propagation of husav by the in vitro cell culture system twenty microliters of stock solution of husav was inoculated to hutu 80 cells and the concentrations of husav in the liquid phase of the virus infected cell culture solution were determined for 10 days by real time rt pcr fig s1 the husav concentration increased rapidly from 105 0 copies ml at 1 day post inoculation dpi to 107 6 copies ml at 3 dpi reached a peak concentration of 108 9 copies ml at 7 dpi and then persisted through 10 dpi the 1 dpi samples were the same as the post wash samples described in section 3 3 this result is consistent with that of takagi et al 2020 who also reported that the husav concentration reached peak concentrations of 108 9 copies ml at 5 10 dpi and then persisted through 14 dpi based on these results we concluded that incubation for 10 days was optimal for the propagation of husav and used that incubation time to produce the stock solution of husav for use in the subsequent virus spiking experiments we purified the stock solution of husav by means of tangential flow ultrafiltration for details see section s1 1 the husav concentration in the stock solution was approximately 109 copies ml and 106 mpn ml as determined by real time rt pcr and icc pcr respectively and the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was 6000 mg l after purification the husav concentration remained unchanged but the doc concentration was decreased to 400 mg l data not shown thus we concluded that this approach afforded a purified solution of husav containing a virus concentration high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments in the subsequent virus spiking experiments the purified solution was spiked into river water cs rsf mnox treated water c mf or pbs chlorine treatment at an initial concentration of approximately 105 6 copies ml and 102 3 mpn ml as determined by real time rt pcr and icc pcr respectively by its addition to the water samples the purified solution was diluted 2000 to 3000 fold which reduced the concentration of unintentionally introduced doc components to 0 2 mg l 3 2 removal of husav astv mnv and pmmov by cs rsf the virus removal ratios log10 cc 0 ccs achieved by cs were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig s2 c c0 and c cs are the virus concentrations before coagulation and after settling respectively in the absence of coagulant no removal 0 0 log10 of husav was observed husav was negatively charged in filtered samples of river waters used for cs rsf at ph 7 0 described below thus husav in the river waters was expected to be stably monodispersed by electrical repulsion which would explain the lack of virus removal in the absence of coagulant in contrast by the addition of coagulant at dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples from plants a and b 1 4 1 6 log10 and 1 3 1 6 log10 removals of husav respectively were observed this result suggests that the stably monodispersed virus was destabilized by the addition of coagulant became adsorbed to entrapped in the aluminum floc particles generated during coagulation and settled from suspension by gravity during sedimentation the virus removal ratios log10 c c0 c cs log10 cr 0 crf achieved by cs rsf were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig 1 c r0 and c rf are the virus concentrations in feed water before the rsf and in sand filtrate respectively as with cs alone no removal 0 0 log10 of husav was observed in the absence of coagulant indicating that adsorption of the stably monodispersed virus to the sand surface by the electrostatic attractive force van der waals attractive force was negligible in contrast by the addition of coagulant at dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples from plants a and b 1 6 2 1 log10 and 2 2 2 3 log10 removals of husav respectively were observed this result indicates that the husav particles associated with the suspended aluminum floc particles were effectively removed by the subsequent rsf when coagulant dosages were increased from 0 54 to 1 62 mg al l for the sample from plant a and from 3 24 to 5 40 mg al l for the sample from plant b the removal ratios of husav by cs rsf increased from 1 6 2 1 log10 to 2 2 2 4 log10 and from 2 2 2 3 log10 to 3 3 3 7 log10 respectively fig 1 this result indicates that coagulant dosage affected the removal efficiencies of husav by cs rsf the improvement in virus removal ratios with increasing coagulant dosage is most likely due to an increase in the size of the aluminum floc particles with the adsorbed entrapped viruses an increase in floc size would have increased the amount of the aluminum floc particles that settled from suspension by gravity during sedimentation as well as that were effectively removed by the subsequent rsf ultimately 1 6 2 4 log10 and 2 2 3 7 log10 removals of husav were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 1 62 and 3 24 5 40 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively to investigate whether mnv and pmmov are suitable surrogates for assessing the efficacy of cs rsf to remove husav we examined the relationships between the removal ratios of husav and those of mnv and pmmov by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r values the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of mnv 1 2 3 2 log10 and pmmov 1 3 3 1 log10 and strong correlations were observed between the values for husav and mnv r 0 88 p 0 01 fig 2 a and those for husav and pmmov r 0 77 p 0 01 fig 2b these results indicate that mnv and pmmov are both suitable surrogates for husav in virus spiking cs rsf experiments like husav although no removal 0 1 log10 of astv was observed in the absence of coagulant 1 8 2 0 log10 and 2 7 3 3 log10 removals of astv were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 and 3 24 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively fig 1 the removal ratios of astv were increased from 1 8 2 0 log10 to 2 6 2 7 log10 when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 54 to 1 08 mg al l for the samples from plant a in contrast the removal ratios of astv remained independent of coagulant dosage for the sample from plant b 2 6 3 3 log10 removals at dosages of 3 24 5 40 mg al l ultimately 1 8 2 7 log10 and 2 6 3 3 log10 removals of astv were observed at coagulant dosages of 0 54 1 62 and 3 24 5 40 mg al l for the samples collected from plants a and b respectively the removal ratios of astv were comparable with and moderately correlated with those of husav r 0 61 p 0 05 data not shown in addition the removal ratios of astv were comparable with and strongly correlated with those of pmmov r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 2b these results indicate that pmmov is also a suitable surrogate for astv in virus spiking cs rsf experiments because indigenous pmmov is present in drinking water sources at higher concentrations than human enteric viruses haramoto et al 2013 shirakawa et al 2022 the virus removal efficiencies of full scale cs rsf have been successfully determined by targeting indigenous pmmov kato et al 2018 shirakawa et al 2022 thus it is reasonable to conclude that for drinking water treatment plants for which the removal ratios of indigenous pmmov by cs rsf have been determined comparable removal ratios could be expected for indigenous husav and astv at those treatment plants the surface charge of virus particles is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies of cs rsf shirasaki et al 2018 to investigate why the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of astv mnv and pmmov in cs rsf we compared the isoelectric points of the viruses and the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses in filtered samples of river waters used for cs rsf at ph 7 0 the isoelectric point of husav was 4 4 fig 3 a which is similar to those of astv 3 4 fig 3a mnv 3 8 shirasaki et al 2017b and pmmov 3 2 shirasaki et al 2017a indicating that all four viruses are negatively charged at ph 7 0 due to their isoelectric points being 4 4 indeed they showed negative electrophoretic mobilities in filtered samples of the river waters at ph 7 0 fig 3b in addition all four viruses showed similar electrophoretic mobilities ranging from 1 4 to 1 9 and 1 2 to 1 4 Âµm s v cm in filtered samples of the river waters for plants a and b respectively thus the similar electrophoretic mobilities of husav astv mnv and pmmov in the river waters probably led to their similar removal ratios by cs rsf 3 3 removal of husav astv mnv and pmmov by c mf the virus removal ratios log10 cm 0 cmf achieved by c mf were evaluated by real time rt pcr fig 4 c m0 and c mf are the virus concentrations before coagulation and in mf filtrate respectively in the absence of coagulant limited removal 0 7 log10 of husav was observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 husav has a diameter of approximately 40 45 nm li et al 2022 takagi et al 2020 which is smaller than the nominal pore size of the mf membrane used in the present study 0 1 Âµm in addition the virus was negatively charged in filtered samples of mnox treated water used for c mf at ph 7 0 and 7 5 described below thus husav in the mnox treated water was expected to be stably monodispersed by electrical repulsion which would explain the limited removal of husav in the absence of coagulant these results also indicate that adsorption of the stably monodispersed virus to the mf membrane by the electrostatic hydrophobic interactions was negligibly small in contrast by the addition of coagulant at a dosage of 0 27 mg al l 1 2 2 2 log10 and 1 6 1 9 log10 removals of husav were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively this result indicates that during coagulation the husav particles were incorporated into the aluminum floc particles which were larger than the nominal pore size of the mf membrane and the floc particles with the incorporated viruses were then effectively removed by size exclusion when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 27 to 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of husav by c mf were increased from 1 2 2 2 log10 to 3 5 log10 at ph 7 0 fig 4 a and from 1 6 1 9 log10 to 2 6 3 0 log10 at ph 7 5 fig 4b these results indicate that coagulant dosage strongly affected the removal efficiencies of husav by c mf like cs rsf the improvement in virus removal ratios with increasing coagulant dosage is most likely due to an increase in the size of the aluminum floc particles with the adsorbed entrapped viruses an increase in floc size would have decreased the amount of the aluminum floc particles that passed through the mf membrane as discussed in our previous report shirasaki et al 2010 at a coagulant dosage of 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of husav at ph 7 0 were higher than those at ph 7 5 fig 4 indicating that coagulation ph also affected the removal efficiencies of husav by c mf this is most likely due to the presence of a large amount of the positively charged aluminum species at ph 7 0 compared with that at ph 7 5 meyn et al 2011 have also reported that the removal ratios of bacteriophage ms2 are higher at the coagulation ph of 5 5 than at the coagulation ph of 6 5 due to the formation of more positively charged polynuclear aluminum species at ph 5 5 than at ph 6 5 ultimately 1 2 4 3 log10 and 1 6 4 0 log10 removals of husav were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 at coagulant dosages of 0 27 1 08 mg al l respectively to investigate whether mnv and pmmov are suitable surrogates for assessing the efficacy of c mf to remove husav we examined the relationships between the removal ratios of husav and those of mnv and pmmov by calculating pearson s correlation coefficient r values virus removal ratios that were below the limit of quantification of real time rt pcr were excluded from the analysis note the same is true for the following analyses of the relationships between the removal ratios of astv and those of husav and pmmov the removal ratios of husav 1 2 3 4 log10 were approximately 1 2 log10 higher than those of mnv 0 3 2 1 log10 and pmmov 0 4 1 2 log10 and strong correlations were observed between the values for husav and mnv r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 5 a and those for husav and pmmov r 0 72 p 0 05 fig 5b these results suggest that mnv and pmmov are both conservative surrogates for husav in virus spiking c mf experiments like husav although limited removal 0 6 log10 of astv diameter 28 41 nm bosch et al 2014 was observed in the absence of coagulant 1 1 1 8 log10 and 1 1 log10 removals of astv were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively at a coagulant dosage of 0 27 mg al l fig 4 the removal ratios of astv were increased from 1 1 1 8 log10 to 3 4 3 8 log10 at ph 7 0 fig 4a and from 1 1 log10 to 1 9 2 4 log10 at ph 7 5 fig 4b when coagulant dosage was increased from 0 27 to 0 41 mg al l in addition at a coagulant dosage of 0 41 mg al l the removal ratios of astv at ph 7 0 were higher than those at ph 7 5 fig 4 these results indicate that like husav both coagulant dosage and coagulation ph affected the removal efficiencies of astv by c mf ultimately 1 1 4 0 log10 and 1 1 4 0 log10 removals of astv were observed at ph 7 0 and 7 5 at coagulant dosages of 0 27 1 08 mg al l respectively the removal ratios of astv 1 1 2 4 log10 were comparable with those of husav 1 2 3 0 log10 and were strongly correlated with those of husav r 0 88 p 0 05 data not shown in addition the removal ratios of astv 1 1 3 4 log10 were approximately 1 2 log10 higher than those of pmmov 0 4 1 6 log10 and were strongly correlated with those of pmmov r 0 86 p 0 05 fig 5b these results suggest that pmmov is also a conservative surrogate for astv in virus spiking c mf experiments as with cs rsf the virus removal efficiencies in full scale c mf have been successfully determined by targeting indigenous pmmov shirakawa et al 2022 thus it is reasonable to conclude that for drinking water treatment plants for which the removal ratios of indigenous pmmov by c mf have been determined higher removal ratios could be expected for indigenous husav and astv at that those treatment plants for c mf as well as cs rsf the surface charge of virus particles is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies shirasaki et al 2017a tanneru and chellam 2012 to investigate why the removal ratios of husav were comparable with those of astv and higher than those of mnv and pmmov in c mf we compared the electrophoretic mobilities of the viruses in filtered samples of mnox treated water used for c mf at ph 7 0 or 7 5 because the isoelectric points of all four viruses are 4 4 see section 3 2 they showed negative electrophoretic mobilities in filtered samples of the mnox treated water at ph 7 0 and 7 5 fig 3b in addition all four viruses showed similar electrophoretic mobilities ranging from 1 6 to 1 9 and 1 3 to 1 9 Âµm s v cm at ph 7 0 and 7 5 respectively thus the similar electrophoretic mobilities of husav and astv in the mnox treated water probably led to their similar removal ratios by c mf however the reason for the high removal ratios of husav and astv compared with those of mnv and pmmov by c mf cannot be explained solely by the difference in the electrophoretic mobilities among these viruses one of the factors that is potentially related to the virus removal efficiencies in physical and physicochemical water treatment processes such as coagulation is the hydrophobicities of virus particles heffron and mayer 2016 further study is needed to investigate whether the difference in the hydrophobicities of virus particles contributes to the difference in the virus removal ratios in c mf 3 4 development of an icc pcr assay for quantification of infectious husav astv mnv and cv because husav does not produce an obvious cytopathic effect takagi et al 2020 a pfu assay cannot be used to quantify infectious husav we therefore developed an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and then used that assay to examine the efficacy of free chlorine disinfection for the inactivation of husav fig 6 a shows the effect of inoculum concentration on the propagation of husav at an inoculum volume of 20 Âµl which is similar to that used in a previous study 10 Âµl takagi et al 2020 the husav concentrations in the post wash samples i e samples after a 12 h incubation removing of the inoculum and washing of the cell monolayer see section s1 6 as determined by real time rt pcr were up to 2 1 log10 lower than those in the pre wash samples i e samples after a 12 h incubation but before removing of the inoculum see section s1 6 these results suggest that most viruses that did not attach to hutu 80 cells were removed by the washing procedure the husav concentrations increased to 108 copies ml at 10 dpi optimum incubation period determined for the propagation of husav see section 3 1 when the inoculum concentrations were 105 copies ml but did not increase when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml indicating that husav in the inoculum only replicated when the inoculum concentration was 105 copies ml thus we concluded that we could judge whether husav in water samples is infectious by using icc pcr based on the difference between the husav concentrations in the pre wash post wash and 10 dpi samples when the inoculum concentrations were 105 copies ml to optimize the inoculum concentration needed for judging whether husav in water samples is infectious the inoculum volume was increased from 20 to 300 or 1000 Âµl in both cases the husav concentrations increased to 108 copies ml at 10 dpi when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml but did not increase when the inoculum concentrations were 103 copies ml fig 6b c indicating that increasing the inoculum volume from 20 to 300 or 1000 Âµl allowed judgment on whether husav in water samples is infectious even when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml thus we used an inoculum volume of 1000 Âµl in the icc pcr assay for husav and in the development of the icc pcr assays for astv mnv and cv like husav whether astv mnv or cv in water samples is infectious could be judged by using icc pcr when the inoculum concentrations were 104 copies ml the effects of incubation period and inoculum concentration on the propagation of astv mnv and cv are discussed in section s2 1 and figs s3 and s4 based on these results if the virus concentrations in the 10 husav 4 astv or 3 dpi mnv and cv samples were at least 1 log10 higher than those in the pre wash samples and at least 3 log10 higher than those in the post wash samples those wells were defined as infectivity positive for calculating mpn in the following chlorine treatment experiments we used the developed icc pcr assays for quantifying infectious virus concentration mpn ml 3 5 inactivation of husav astv mnv and cv by chlorine treatment 3 5 1 suitability of icc pcr as an alternative to a pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment as described in section 3 4 we found that the inoculum concentration needed for judging whether husav astv mnv or cv in water samples is infectious was 104 copies ml for all four viruses thus in the following chlorine treatment experiments husav or astv was spiked to pbs at an initial concentration of 105 6 or 107 copies ml as evaluated by real time rt pcr which was equivalent to 102 3 mpn ml or 103 4 mpn ml respectively as evaluated by icc pcr mnv or cv was spiked at an initial concentration of 108 copies ml as evaluated by real time rt pcr which was equivalent to 104 5 mpn ml as evaluated by icc pcr and to 103 pfu ml as evaluated by the pfu assay we first evaluated whether icc pcr could be used as an alternative to a pfu assay for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment fig s5 shows the infectivity reduction ratios log10 n 0 nc of mnv and cv by chlorine treatment at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 as evaluated by the icc pcr and pfu assay n 0 and n c are the virus concentrations before and after chlorine treatment respectively for mnv when the pfu assay was used 2 4 2 7 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value free chlorine concentration c multiplied by contact time t of 0 02 mg cl2 min l fig s5a at the same ct value 3 1 log10 inactivation was observed when icc pcr was used because the concentrations of infectious mnv after chlorine treatment were below the limit of quantification of icc pcr 100 fold concentration using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane with blocking pretreatment was performed see section s1 4 the recovery ratio of infectious mnv during the 100 fold concentration as determined by the pfu assay and icc pcr was 46 and 61 n 1 data not shown respectively indicating that infectious mnv was effectively recovered during the 100 fold concentration by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 2 8 3 0 log10 and 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratios fig s5b for cv when the pfu assay was used 0 9 1 2 log10 and 2 8 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at ct values of 0 35 0 37 and 1 05 1 15 mg cl2 min l respectively fig s5c at the same ct values 1 3 log10 and 3 1 3 4 log10 inactivation respectively were observed when icc pcr was used the infectivity reduction ratios of mnv and cv obtained by icc pcr were comparable with those obtained by the pfu assay these results indicate that icc pcr is a potential alternative to the pfu assay for the assessment of the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate viruses for which the pfu assay is not available such as husav 3 5 2 inactivation of husav and astv by chlorine treatment we evaluated the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate husav and astv by using the developed icc pcr assay fig 7 a e for husav at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 2 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l fig 7a note duplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the second experiment because the concentrations of infectious husav after chlorine treatment were below the limit of quantification of icc pcr 100 fold concentration using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane and blocking pretreatment was performed see section s1 4 the recovery ratio of infectious husav during the 100 fold concentration as determined by icc pcr was 59 47 n 4 data not shown indicating that infectious husav was effectively recovered during the 100 fold concentration by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation was observed at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratio fig 7b at 5 c 2 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l without any concentration procedure fig 7c note duplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the second experiment by a combination of chlorine treatment and the 100 fold concentration 2 6 2 9 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l infectivity reduction ratios were corrected with the determined recovery ratio fig 7d the infectivity reduction ratios obtained at 5 c were lower than those obtained at 20 c indicating that the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate husav is lower at 5 c than at 20 c this may be explained by the lower contact frequency between virus particles and free chlorine due to the lower diffusivity of free chlorine at 5 c than at 20 c astv required a higher ct value for inactivation by chlorine treatment than husav fig 7e at 20 c pbs ph 7 0 1 3 1 7 log10 and 1 7 2 0 log10 inactivation were observed at ct values of 0 02 and 0 03 mg cl2 min l respectively note triplicate experiments were conducted for each contact time but the post wash samples were not quantified in the first and second experiments these results indicate that astv is more resistant than husav to chlorine treatment astv achieved 3 4 log10 inactivation at a ct value of 0 09 mg cl2 min l abad et al 1997 and espinosa et al 2008 have reported 2 5 log10 and 1 3 log10 inactivation of astv by chlorine treatment using initial free chlorine concentrations of 0 5 and 2 mg cl2 l contact times of 60 and 120 min and water temperatures of 20 and 23 c respectively which are findings not consistent with our present results initial free chlorine concentration 0 2 mg cl2 l contact time 5 s 1 min water temperature 20 c possible explanations for these discrepancies include differences in virus type astv type 1 vs type 4 or 8 water type pbs vs drinking water or groundwater and ph 7 0 vs 7 5 or 7 6 among the three studies which are factors that affect the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 in addition the approach for purification of the astv solution may have also differed between the studies in the present study the stock solution of astv was purified by using a tangential flow ultrafiltration membrane to remove doc components from the culture medium see section s1 1 and the purified astv solution was diluted 2000 to 3000 fold by addition to pbs which together reduced the amount of unintentionally introduced doc components to 0 2 mg l it is unclear whether abad et al 1997 and espinosa et al 2008 used a purification procedure however if they did not it is possible that high amounts of doc components compared with those in the present study were unintentionally introduced into the virus spiked water such introduction of doc components would result in the consumption of a large amount of free chlorine and overestimation of the ct value for a given level of virus inactivation i e underestimation of the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment dunkin et al 2017 mnv is widely used in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments as a surrogate for human noroviruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 for example cromeans et al 2010 have reported a ct value of 0 07 mg cl2 min l for 4 log10 inactivation of mnv by chlorine treatment pbs ph 7 0 5 c in the present study 2 8 3 0 log10 and 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation of mnv were observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively pbs ph 7 0 20 c see section 3 5 1 our results roughly agree with those of cromeans et al 2010 in addition in the present study the infectivity reduction ratios of mnv were comparable with those of husav at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l 3 8 4 0 log10 pbs ph 7 0 20 c together these results suggest that there is a possibility of using mnv as a surrogate for husav in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments because the infectivity reduction ratios of husav and mnv were compared only under one condition pbs ph 7 0 20 c ct value 0 02 mg cl2 min l further study under other conditions is needed to conclude whether mnv is a suitable surrogate for husav in virus spiking chlorine treatment experiments several research groups including ours have found that cv b5 shows the highest resistance to chlorine treatment among representative human enteric viruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 shirasaki et al 2020 ct values of 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 mg cl2 min l for 3 and 4 log10 inactivation respectively of cv b5 by chlorine treatment pbs ph 7 0 20 22 c have been reported shirasaki et al 2020 torii et al 2021 in the present study 2 8 3 4 log10 and 3 1 3 4 log10 inactivation of cv b5 were observed at a ct value of 1 1 mg cl2 min l when the pfu assay and icc pcr were used respectively pbs ph 7 0 20 c see section 3 5 1 our results roughly agree with those of shirasaki et al 2020 and torii et al 2021 when we compared the inactivation efficiencies for husav astv and cv b5 under the same conditions pbs ph 7 0 20 c and quantification by icc pcr we found that 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv were achieved at ct values of only 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these values are much smaller than those achieved for 3 log10 inactivation of cv b5 obtained in the present study and for 4 log10 inactivation of cv b5 reported by shirasaki et al 2020 and torii et al 2021 these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment and more sensitive than the chlorine resistant virus cv b5 the u s environmental protection agency recommends ct values of 2 mg cl2 min l for 3 log10 inactivation of viruses by free chlorine disinfection at ph 6 9 and 20 c usepa 1991 in the present study ct values of only 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l provided 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv respectively this suggests that at least 4 log10 and 3 log10 inactivation of husav and astv respectively are achieved by free chlorine disinfection with the recommended ct value of 2 mg cl2 min l in the present study only one strain was chosen from husav or astv and used in the virus spiking experiments on the other hand other research groups have reported that the resistance of cv b5 to free chlorine disinfection varies depending on the strain meister et al 2018 torii et al 2021 further study is needed to investigate the variability in the resistance to free chlorine disinfection among strains of husav or astv 3 5 3 relationship between virus infectivity reduction ratio and degree of damage to viral capsid by chlorine treatment to examine the mechanism of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment the relationship between the virus infectivity reduction ratio and the degree of damage to the viral capsid by chlorine treatment was examined by evaluating the virus reduction ratio after chlorine treatment by means of pcr alone or pmaxx enhancer pcr fig 7 for husav although 3 8 4 0 log10 inactivation was observed at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l see section 3 5 2 pcr alone showed limited signal reduction 0 7 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7a b even when pmaxx enhancer pcr was used limited signal reduction 0 7 log10 was observed at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l a similar trend was also observed at 5 c fig 7c d these results indicate that husav was inactivated by chlorine treatment due to subtle alterations of the viral capsid at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l because pmaxx was unable to penetrate the capsid of chlorine inactivated husav in contrast unlike pcr alone pmaxx enhancer pcr showed signal reductions of 1 3 2 2 log10 at 20 c and ct values of 0 08 0 09 mg cl2 min l and the signal reduction ratios were increased to 1 9 2 8 log10 with increasing ct values to 0 14 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7a these results suggest that at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2 min l chlorine treatment caused damage to the viral capsid of husav such that pmaxx could penetrate into the virus particles and that damage to the capsid was increased with increasing ct value these results also suggest that chlorine treatment caused negligible damage to the viral rna of husav even at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2 min l similarly although 1 3 2 0 log10 inactivation of astv was observed at ct values of 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l see section 3 5 2 pcr alone showed limited signal reduction 0 6 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 17 mg cl2 min l fig 7e in contrast the signal reduction ratios as evaluated by pmaxx enhancer pcr were increased from 0 0 0 7 log10 to 0 9 1 7 log10 with increasing ct values from 0 02 to 0 14 0 17 mg cl2 min l for mnv although 3 3 3 4 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l when icc pcr was used see section 3 5 1 both pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr showed almost no signal reduction 0 4 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 02 0 03 mg cl2 min l fig 7f g for cv although 1 3 log10 inactivation was observed at a ct value of 0 4 mg cl2 min l when icc pcr was used see section 3 5 1 pcr alone showed almost no signal reduction 0 4 log10 at all of the ct values tested 0 4 1 1 mg cl2 min l fig 7h in contrast the signal reduction ratios as evaluated by pmaxx enhancer pcr were increased from 0 0 0 2 log10 to 0 6 1 0 log10 with increasing ct values from 0 4 to 1 1 mg cl2 min l the signal reduction ratios obtained with pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr were smaller than the infectivity reduction ratios obtained with icc pcr for all of the viruses and ct values tested similar trends were also observed for adenovirus and pmmov in our previous study shirasaki et al 2020 these results indicate that both pcr alone and pmaxx enhancer pcr underestimate the efficacy of virus inactivation by chlorine treatment which emphasizes the importance of infectivity assays for evaluating virus inactivation by chlorine treatment although assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect such as the pfu assay are extensively used as infectivity assays these assays cannot be used for all viruses because some viruses do not produce an obvious cytopathic effect in contrast the icc pcr does not require the production of a cytopathic effect to quantify infectious virus concentrations thus the icc pcr assay is useful for evaluating the efficacy of chlorine treatment to inactivate viruses for which assays depending on the production of a cytopathic effect are not available such as husav 4 conclusions we successfully evaluated the removal efficiencies of husav in cs rsf and c mf as well as the inactivation efficiencies of husav in free chlorine disinfection by applying an in vitro cell culture system to prepare the purified solution of husav containing virus concentration high enough to conduct virus spiking experiments to develop an icc pcr assay to quantify infectious husav and to conduct virus spiking experiments the removal ratios of husav by cs rsf were 1 6 3 7 log10 and were comparable and correlated with those of mnv and pmmov in addition the removal ratios of husav by c mf were 1 2 4 3 log10 and were higher than but still correlated with those of mnv and pmmov thus both mnv and pmmov appear to be potential surrogates for husav in cs rsf and c mf the removal ratios of astv by cs rsf were 1 8 3 3 log10 and were comparable and correlated with those of pmmov in addition the removal ratios of astv by c mf were 1 1 4 0 log10 and were higher than but still correlated with those of pmmov thus pmmov also appears to be a potential surrogate for astv in cs rsf and c mf the infectivity reduction ratios of husav by chlorine treatment at 20 c and a ct value of 0 02 mg cl2 min l as evaluated by the developed icc pcr assay were 3 8 4 0 log10 which were comparable to those of mnv for astv 1 3 1 7 log10 and 3 4 log10 inactivation as evaluated by icc pcr were observed at 20 c and ct values of 0 02 and 0 09 mg cl2 min l respectively these results indicate that husav and astv are both highly sensitive to chlorine treatment compared with a chlorine resistant virus cv b5 1 3 log10 inactivation at 20 c and a ct value of 0 4 mg cl2 min l as evaluated by icc pcr analyses using pmaxx enhancer pcr revealed that husav was inactivated by chlorine treatment due to subtle alterations of the viral capsid at ct values of 0 03 mg cl2 min l and due to damage to the capsid but not the viral rna at ct values of 0 08 mg cl2

14837,the application of mainstream anammox is highly desirable for municipal wastewater treatment however enrichment of anammox bacteria anaob is challenging particularly given the vicious competition from denitrifying bacteria db here suspended sludge biomass management a novel operational strategy for hybrid process suspended sludge biofilm was investigated for 570 days based on a modified anaerobic anoxic oxic system treating municipal wastewater by successively decreasing the suspended sludge concentration the traditional hybrid process was successfully upgraded to a pure

functional gene quantification and a series of ex situ batch experiments demonstrated that the stepwise decreases in suspended sludge concentration effectively mitigated the vicious competition of db

when extended to municipal wwtps the contribution ratio of anammox was far below the expected value 15 9 in the no 4 wwtp of xi an china li et al 2019 the major technical bottleneck lies in the notoriously low anaob biomass especially compared to db nejidat et al 2018 kumar and lin 2010 the biomass imbalance between anaob and db provokes the imbalance in niche and substrate competition taking an integrated validation pilot plant as an example most no2 produced by no3 reduction was further consumed by db which trapped the activity and abundance of anaob at very low levels zhao et al 2021 to create niche advantages for anaob it is recommended to integrate biocarriers into suspended sludge known as the hybrid process suspended sludge biofilm li et al 2017 sengar et al 2018 wade and wolkowicz 2021 given the sessile lifestyle anaob is prone to survive on the carrier biofilms e g plastic ring sand particles and even submersible mixer kuenen 2008 mulder et al 1995 park et al 2017 zekker et al 2012a zhang et al 2021 which is an essential prerequisite for the mainstream use of anammox recent studies have found that in hybrid systems microbial interactions substrate sharing and substrate competition between suspended sludge and carrier biofilms had significant impacts on anaob gao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 however there is still no clear strategy that can coordinate the complex relationship between suspended sludge and biofilm to achieve anaob enrichment ultimately our recent study unexpectedly found an encouraging phenomenon under hybrid conditions anaob was acutely enriched in the anoxic biofilms from 0 74 to 4 34 due to an unexpected loss of suspended sludge from 2873 mg volatile suspended solids vss l to 534 mg vss l li et al 2021 the sharp decline in the suspended sludge concentration provoked the deterioration of denitrification however anammox showed increasingly higher activity similarly in the latest study anaob abundance decreased with the introduction of suspended sludge but significantly increased from 0 82 to 2 22 after the discharge of suspended sludge liu et al 2023 inspired by previous studies we hypothesize here that the reduction of the suspended sludge concentration in the hybrid system potentially facilitates the anaob enrichment in the biofilms the rationality of this hypothesis is that db predominates in suspended sludge and thus the decline in suspended sludge concentration reduces db biomass specifically heterotrophic denitrification will potentially be less competitive for no2 with decreasing db biomass presenting an opportunity for anaob to acquire a more significant proportion of no2 gao et al 2022 li et al 2021 2020 on the other hand the decrease in db biomass has a similar effect as anaob bioaugmentation namely a relative increase in anaob biomass in this sense the biomass balance of db and anaob may be restored providing an essential prerequisite for the niche construction of anaob although the above hypothesis sheds fresh light on the anaob enrichment under mainstream conditions there is still a lack of direct evidence and systematic evaluation especially in actual municipal wastewater to this end this study proposes suspended sludge biomass management as a novel operational strategy for hybrid process an anaerobic anoxic oxic combining with biological contact oxidation a2o bco bioreactor was established and operated for 570 days the overarching objectives of this study were to i systematically evaluate the feasibility of suspended sludge biomass management for strengthening anammox in hybrid process ii reveal the impacts of suspended sludge biomass management on the microbial community core microbial interaction and metabolic activity finally the prospect of upgrading the traditional hybrid process to a pure biofilm anammox process through suspended sludge biomass management was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the

oberkochen germany was employed to display the microstructure of the biofilms and to assess the structural stability during long term operation 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal performance during suspended sludge biomass management the a2o bco bioreactor was continuously operated for 570 days treating low c n ratio 3 7 0 8 municipal wastewater with six phases divided by biomass types table 1 owing to the unique configuration suspended sludge was segregated outside the bco unit fig 1 thus the bco unit maintained a pure biofilm state throughout the operation and was unaffected by the variations in the suspended sludge concentration during the 570 days of operation near complete nh4 removal was achieved the average effluent nh4 n concentration was as low as 0 2 0 3 mg n l corresponding to a removal efficiency of 99 6 0 8 fig 2b in phase i days 1 81 the a2o unit was initiated with pure suspended sludge of 6342 484 mg vss l the effective hrt was 12 1 h corresponding to an influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 77 8 7 1 g n m3 d the tin concentration of the effluent was 14 7 1 0 mg n l fig 2c representing an nre and nitrogen removal rate nrr of 62 1 4 5 and 48 7 9 7 g n m3 day respectively the hybrid process was established in phase ii days 82 201 carrier biofilms holding anaob candidatus brocadia 1 98 candidatus kuenenia 0 04 were integrated into the anaerobic and anoxic zones with a filling ratio of 40 the biomass of seeding biofilms was 50 5 3 2 mg vss carrier corresponding to a biomass concentration of 2099 129 mg vss l fig s1 the suspended sludge concentration remained at 6045 102 mg vss l fig 2a during phase ii anaob increased the nre and nrr to 70 7 3 7 and 55 8 6 5 g n m3 d respectively under the hybrid conditions to mitigate the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms the concentration of suspended sludge was successively reduced to 4067 382 mg vss l phase iii days 202 320 and 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv days 321 442 during this process the nitrogen removal performance gradually improved the effluent tin concentration decreased to 9 9 1 9 mg n l and 8 2 1 6 mg n l the nre increased to 74 5 4 9 and 79 2 3 9 respectively and the nrr increased to 58 8 9 8 g n m3 d and 62 3 9 0 g n m3 d respectively in phase v days 443 519 the hybrid process was upgraded to the pure biofilm process by discharging all suspended sludge from the a2o unit during this process the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated severely the tin concentration in the effluent reached up to 16 3 4 0 mg n l days 443 494 representing an nre as low as 60 5 11 6 indicating that the pure biofilm process was overloaded fig 2c to recover the nre the influent nlr was successively lowered to 68 4 6 1 and 52 9 5 8 g n m3 d by prolonging the hrt to 14 5 h and 18 2 h and the nre and nrr then increased sharply from day 520 the a2o bco biosystem reached a quasi steady state phase vi days 520 570 during which the effluent tin was sustained at a low level of 10 2 2 3 mg n l with a corresponding nre of 74 4 5 0 in summary the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid process was significantly improved by suspended sludge biomass management nre p 0 001 nrr p 0 001 and finally the hybrid process was successfully upgraded to the pure biofilm process with stable nitrogen removal performance 3 2 variations in anammox performance by suspended sludge biomass management 3 2 1 in situ anammox reaction rate and contribution ratio to nitrogen removal to investigate the variations in anammox performance during the suspended sludge biomass management the loss of nh4 in the anaerobic and anoxic do 0 01 mg l zones was monitored throughout the operation anammox and microbial assimilation are potential pathways for nh4 loss under oxygen free conditions rahimi et al 2020 in the ex situ test the nh4 loss due to microbial assimilation was undetectable fig s6 thus in this study all the nh4 loss in the anaerobic and anoxic zones was attributed to anammox on the basis of this the in situ anammox reaction rate referring to the sum of the anammox reaction rates in the anaerobic and anoxic zones eq 3 and the contribution ratio of anammox to nitrogen removal eq 4 were quantified when the a2o unit initially operated with pure suspended sludge phase i the nh4 loss was hardly observed due to the absence of anaob fig s4 when the hybrid process was established in the anaerobic and anoxic zones the nh4 loss was detected notably the in situ anammox rate showed a significant negative correlation with the suspended sludge concentration p 0 001 r 2 0 93 fig 3a in phase ii it was limited to a low level of 8 8 1 9 g n m3 d contributing 9 2 2 8 to nitrogen removal fig 3b as the suspended sludge concentration decreased to 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv the anammox rate successively increased to 39 5 3 8 g n m3 d corresponding to a contribution ratio of 43 7 7 2 this explained the successive improvement of nre under the limited influent c n ratio in phase vi the in situ anammox rate peaked under the pure biofilm status 45 5 3 2 g n m3 d contributing 67 1 8 3 to nitrogen removal as the dominant pathway 3 2 2 high level enrichment of anaob in biofilms the absolute abundances of anaob 16s rrna gene and hzsb gene were determined by qpcr in the anaerobic fig 4a and anoxic biofilms fig 4b they were significantly more abundant than in suspended sludge p 0 001 fig s7 which confirms the niche preference of anaob for biofilms laureni et al 2019 pÃ©rez et al 2020 zekker et al 2012b zhang et al 2020a taking the anoxic biofilms as examples the abundance of the 16s rrna gene of anaob was 2 72 0 04 109 copies g vss in the seeding biofilms day 82 the following four months of operation with high concentration suspended sludge reduced it to 9 94 0 99 108 copies g vss day 200 p 0 001 with the concentration of suspended sludge gradually decreasing to 2046 261 mg vss l anaob was significantly enriched to 6 12 0 22 109 copies g vss day 435 p 0 001 finally under the pure biofilm conditions it peaked at 1 16 0 01 1010 copies g vss day 561 the long term trend of anammox abundance was in line with the in situ anammox rate high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed similar results details in section 3 4 candidatus brocadia was enriched in the anoxic biofilms from 0 70 day 200 to as high as 5 99 day 561 phylogenetic analysis suggested that the otu466 was dominant with over 85 80 of total anaob which was phylogenetically related to candidatus brocadia sp 40 fig s8 this anammox abundance level exceeded most mainstream anammox systems treating municipal wastewater anja and ottosen 2019 nejidat et al 2018 clsm fish identified the spatial distribution of anaob in the anoxic biofilms fig s9 in the seeding biofilms anaob was found in the innermost 50 Î¼m layer labeled in pink a superposition of red anaob cy5 and blue total bacteria cy3 by day 561 anaob had spread throughout the biofilms a higher pink fluorescence intensity suggested a higher density of the targeted anaob which was in good accordance with the qpcr and high throughput sequencing results 3 3 nitrogen removal pathway characteristics 3 3 1 distinct nitrogen removal pathways in suspended sludge and biofilms to better understand the increase in the anammox performance and enrichment of anaob during the suspended sludge biomass management a series of ex situ batch experiments were conducted on day 429 first the nitrogen metabolic pathways of suspended sludge and anoxic biofilms were assessed separately with nh4 no3 and organic matter ch3coona as substrates for the pure suspended sludge 5962 mg vss l no3 was depleted within 0 5 h without no2 accumulation and nh4 loss fig 5a this suggested the dominance of cascade denitrification in the suspended sludge while anammox was absent by contrast significant nh4 loss was observed in the pure biofilm system 54 5 mg vss carrier filling ratio of 40 corresponding to a biomass concentration of 2181 mg vss l fig 5b the specific anammox activity saa was 10 5 0 1 mg n g vss h the decrease in nh4 continued until no3 was depleted at 90 min which was in good accordance with the nitrogen conversion profiles of the pda process chen et al 2020 gao et al 2021 ma et al 2017 the nitrogen mass balance analysis showed that the no3 to no2 transforming ratio ntr referring to the ratio of no2 utilized by anaob in total no2 production from no3 reduction was as high as 65 7 0 9 these results suggest that anaob was more competitive for no2 than db in the biofilms which enabled a satisfactory pda performance 3 3 2 effects of suspended sludge on anammox in the hybrid system the anammox performance of the hybrid system was evaluated by integrating anoxic biofilms into suspended sludge at different concentration levels 5962 4097 and 2063 mg vss l fig 5c e in these three hybrid systems the saa was lower than in the pure biofilm system when the suspended sludge biomass concentration was 5962 mg vss l the saa was as low as 1 0 0 1 mg n g vss h contributing 10 6 1 3 to nitrogen removal fig 5c when the suspended sludge concentrations were reduced to 4097 mg vss l and 2063 mg vss l the saa increased to 2 8 0 3 fig 5d and 5 6 0 6 mg n g vss h fig 5e respectively corresponding to anammox contribution ratios of 27 7 3 4 and 45 8 6 8 respectively during these tests the saa and anammox contribution ratios were negatively correlated with the biomass concentration of suspended sludge pearson s r 0 98 pearson s r 0 98 fig s10 in addition the ntrs at 5962 4097 and 2063 mg vss l were 7 1 1 1 19 7 2 2 and 35 1 4 0 respectively which were also negatively correlated with the biomass concentration of suspended sludge pearson s r 0 97 fig s10 as the suspended sludge was completely discharged i e in the pure biofilm system the ntr peaked at 65 7 0 9 these results provided direct evidence for the two preceding hypotheses i the db in suspended sludge outcompeted anaob in biofilms for the shared substrate no2 and ii a reduction in the biomass concentration of suspended sludge could effectively mitigate the competition of db against anaob 3 4 variations in the core bacterial microbiomes and distributions of functional genes the microbial diversity and the variations in core bacterial microbiomes were analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the rarefaction and shannon curves showed a decrease in the microbial richness in the anoxic biofilms suggesting that some functional bacteria were selectively enriched during the suspended sludge biomass management fig s11 the core bacterial microbiomes associated with nitrogen removal were evaluated at the genus level or higher in the suspended sludge the taxonomic classification of the phylum showed that actinobacteriota 14 6 32 9 proteobacteria 17 9 32 8 and chloroflexi 14 7 24 7 were dominant fig 6a planctomycetota the phylum to which anaob belongs was almost absent at the genus level denitrifying populations accounted for 9 of the top 12 dominant genera including conventional dbs such as caldilineaceae 3 11 6 13 and jg30 kf cm45 1 58 6 22 as well as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos candidatus microthrix 1 06 5 01 and tetrasphaera 1 26 6 28 fig 6c these dbs showed no significant statistical variations in abundance during the suspended sludge biomass management these results indicated that db including dpao was the overwhelmingly core bacterial microbiome in suspended sludge in the anoxic biofilms chloroflexi 27 9 43 3 and proteobacteria 20 8 37 3 were the keystone phyla fig 6b the abundance of planctomycetota increased notably from 1 3 to 7 3 during the suspended sludge biomass management in the seeding biofilms anammox genera candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were observed with relative abundances of 1 98 and 0 04 respectively fig 6d by the end of phase ii the abundance of candidatus brocadia was reduced to 0 70 and candidatus kuenenia could no longer be detected notably as the suspended sludge concentration decreased to 4067 382 mg vss l phase iii and 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv candidatus brocadia was gradually enriched to 1 61 and 3 92 in the anoxic biofilms after the suspended sludge was completely discharged from the system candidatus brocadia was further enriched to 5 99 as the dominant genus in fact db was the most abundant microbiome in the seeding biofilms with representative genera of olb14 13 50 thauera 5 46 and denitratisoma 2 33 however with the enrichment of candidatus brocadia the relative abundance of db showed a significant reduction e g olb14 from 17 46 to 7 90 and thauera from 5 46 to 0 14 it may well be that anaob affected the denitrifying populations by competing for the shared substrate no2 therefore the core bacterial microbiomes in the anoxic biofilms were reshaped by the suspended sludge biomass management db and anaob coexisted in the biofilms as the two main microbiomes rather than only being dominated by db as initially inoculated the distribution of functional genes associated with nitrogen removal was evaluated by qpcr as mentioned earlier hzsb encoding hydrazine synthase Î² subunit a specific functional gene of anaob was mainly enriched in the biofilms but was barely found in the suspended sludge in contrast the functional genes responsible for the cascade denitrification narg napa nirs nirk and nosz were enriched in the suspended sludge fig 7a in line with the high throughput sequencing results this suggested that suspended sludge possessed a more abundant denitrifying population than biofilms making it more competitive for no2 in this sense it is particularly critical to mitigate the competition of db for no2 by reducing the suspended sludge concentration the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was calculated to better illustrate the distinct nitrogen metabolism pathways in the suspended sludge and biofilms specifically a higher rate of no3 reduction over no2 reduction is desirable for the synergy between db and anaob in this regard a relatively higher abundance of no3 reductase typically encoded by napa and narg over no2 reductase typically encoded by nirk and nirs is required therefore the napa narg to nirk nirs ratio was employed to represent the dynamic ratio of no3 and no2 reductase levels in suspended sludge the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was 1 0 0 2 fig 7b which was in good agreement with traditional nitrification denitrification n dn systems but well below that of pda systems cui et al 2020 li et al 2021 this explained the dominance of cascade denitrification in suspended sludge in comparison the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was much higher in the anoxic biofilms 14 1 1 7 which was more favorable for db to produce no2 than to consume no2 thereby ensuring the coupling efficiency of pda which enabled the satisfactory pda performance in the anoxic biofilms these results underscore the significance of suspended sludge biomass management the reduction in suspended sludge could directly mitigate the suppression of cascade denitrification in suspended sludge on anammox in biofilms 4 discussion the mainstream use of anammox for minimizing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of municipal wwtps is highly attractive however regardless of the process configuration or biomass type sufficient enrichment of anaob is not straightforward for municipal wwtps the application cases of mainstream anammox for municipal wastewater over the past decade were summarized in table s3 taking our previous work as an example the pda process was applied to the upgradation of a wwtp in xi an china 2 105 m3 day li et al 2019 despite years of operation the final anaob abundance only reached 1 9 108 2 0 109 copies g vss the technical bottleneck in anaob enrichment has significantly delayed the anammox based paradigm shift of wwtps worldwide fofana et al 2022 lackner et al 2014 vandekerckhove et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zekker et al 2021 the pda which db and anaob jointly mediate is a promising option for the mainstream application of anammox and has demonstrated encouraging stability in laboratory scale installations the current view is that the high enrichment of the pd functional microbiome is a crucial prerequisite for mainstream pda du et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2022 specifically the pd functional microbiome refers to those dbs that could reduce no3 with significant no2 accumulation first some strains reduce no3 with no2 as the only product due to the absence of no2 reductase e g rhodobacter sphaeroides 2 4 1 and staphylococcus sp ma et al 2020 second some strains present the progressive onset po of denitrification genes e g thauera sp dnt 1 and thauera terpenicaa bringing about temporary no2 accumulation liu et al 2013 in fact the high enrichment of the pd functional microbiome relies largely on the induction of readily degradable organic carbon and a low cod no3 n ratio du et al 2019 kumar and lin 2010 zhang et al 2020b in a recent engineering application sodium acetate and glucose were replenished as readily degradable carbon sources into the anoxic zone of a wwtp in tianjin china 3 104 m3 day liu et al 2021 an ntr of over 90 persisted for 17 months until the replenishment was switched off however the average sodium acetate and glucose dosages were 1 76 t day and 3 32 t day respectively this reflected a thorny issue that the mainstream use of pda may be at the expense of an extended carbon footprint and enormous operating costs the present study underscores that the enrichment of anaob in the hybrid system was closely related to the suspended sludge concentration the ex situ batch experiments demonstrated that the saa was significantly negatively correlated with the suspended sludge concentration pearson s r 0 98 fig s10 although stronger denitrification was attained with a higher suspended sludge concentration anammox showed lower activity fig 5 in the long term operation the anammox reaction rate suffered from the high suspended sludge concentration in phases ii and iii with the anammox abundance falling to the lowest level candidatus brocadia 0 70 16s rrna gene of anaob 9 94 0 99 108 copies g vss these phenomena were very similar to previous pda system treating municipal wastewater which were attributed to the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms to mitigate this vicious competition suspended sludge biomass management was implemented in the batch experiments the ntr increased from 7 1 1 1 hybrid system with suspended sludge of 5962 mg vss l to 65 7 0 9 biofilm only fig 5 in the anoxic biofilms anaob was enriched to an impressively high level candidatus brocadia 5 99 16s rrna gene of anaob 1 16 0 01 1010 copies g vss far higher than the reported level in mainstream anammox systems treating municipal wastewater anja and ottosen 2019 cao et al 2018 li et al 2019 nejidat et al 2018 interestingly when blasting the db in this system with the pd functional microbiome previously reported their abundances were very low even unobservable in contrast conventional db responsible for cascaded denitrification prevailed this challenges the stereotype that the pd functional microbiome is obligatory for mainstream pda when the vicious competition of db against anaob is mitigated satisfactory mainstream anammox is hopefully achieved such as in phases iv and vi in this study in this sense suspended sludge biomass management lowers the threshold of mainstream pda enabling the application of pda even in the absence of a pd functional microbiome in the final stage of the suspended sludge biomass management phase vi the suspended sludge was completely discharged under the pure biofilm status a highly stable nitrogen removal performance was attained with the removal efficiencies of tin and nh4 n achieving 74 4 5 0 and 99 7 0 9 respectively representing a successful upgradation from the traditional hybrid process to the pure biofilm process for municipal wwtps excess sludge disposal is a longstanding problem that significantly increases the economic burden and energy consumption while posing potential risks to water and soil environments abdel wahaab et al 2020 abdelrahman et al 2023 hao et al 2020 jÃ¡kÃ³i et al 2021 wang et al 2023 however there has been a lack of methods for upgrading traditional processes to pure biofilm processes in this regard suspended sludge biomass management presents a new approach for wwtps to eliminate dependence on excess sludge disposal from the practical application perspective it has three significant advantages i in terms of operability it is easier to implement than conventional strategies such as the precise control of the c n ratio ii in terms of economy and sustainability it does not require additional facilities nor additional carbon sources and chemicals iii in terms of stability the concentration of suspended sludge is a relatively stable parameter that does not fluctuate significantly with varying influent loads unlike the do concentration or c n ratio which ensures the effectiveness of this strategy ren et al 2022 furthermore it should be noted that the in situ anammox reaction rate under the pure biofilm status was 45 5 3 2 g n m3 d which was comparable with the traditional n dn processes these results shed light on the potential application of suspended sludge biomass management toward wwtp upgradation it is not limited to the high level enrichment of anaob in a hybrid system more importantly it facilitates the anammox based paradigm shift of wwtps in the near future 5 conclusions in this study a novel strategy of suspended sludge biomass management was proposed and investigated in an a2o bco process for 570 days the key conclusions are as follows suspended sludge biomass management enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid process the nre and nrr were significantly improved from 62 1 4 5 to 79 2 3 9 p 0 001 and from 48 7 9 7 to 62 3 9 0 g n m3 d p 0 001 respectively stepwise reductions of suspended sludge could effectively mitigate the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms the in situ anammox reaction rate increased from 8 8 1 9 to 45 5 3 2 g n

14837,the application of mainstream anammox is highly desirable for municipal wastewater treatment however enrichment of anammox bacteria anaob is challenging particularly given the vicious competition from denitrifying bacteria db here suspended sludge biomass management a novel operational strategy for hybrid process suspended sludge biofilm was investigated for 570 days based on a modified anaerobic anoxic oxic system treating municipal wastewater by successively decreasing the suspended sludge concentration the traditional hybrid process was successfully upgraded to a pure biofilm anammox process during this process both the nitrogen removal efficiency nre and rate nrr were significantly improved p 0 001 from 62 1 4 5 to 79 2 3 9 and from 48 7 9 7 to 62 3 9 0 g n m3 d respectively mainstream anammox was improved in the following candidatus brocadia was enriched from 0 70 to 5 99 in anoxic biofilms from 9 94 0 99 108 to 1 16 0 01 1010 copies g vss p 0 001 the in

functional gene quantification and a series of ex situ batch experiments demonstrated that the stepwise decreases in suspended sludge concentration effectively mitigated the vicious competition of db

partial denitrification pd no3 to no2 is a promising process to provide anammox with the required no2 under mainstream conditions du et al 2019 ma et al 2020 rahimi et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 specifically denitrifying bacteria db reduce no3 to no2 which is then used by anaob as the electron acceptor for nh4 oxidation known as pd coupling anammox pda in lab scale pda reactors high nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 93 6 on average was attained from synthetic sewage du et al 2017 pda contributed 93 0 94 7 to nitrogen removal from actual municipal wastewater wang et al 2019b nevertheless when extended to municipal wwtps the contribution ratio of anammox was far below the expected value 15 9 in the no 4 wwtp of xi an china li et al 2019 the major technical bottleneck lies in the notoriously low anaob biomass especially compared to db nejidat et al 2018 kumar and lin 2010 the biomass imbalance between anaob and db provokes the imbalance in niche and substrate competition taking an integrated validation pilot plant as an example most no2 produced by no3 reduction was further consumed by db which trapped the activity and abundance of anaob at very low levels zhao et al 2021 to create niche advantages for anaob it is recommended to integrate biocarriers into suspended sludge known as the hybrid process suspended sludge biofilm li et al 2017 sengar et al 2018 wade and wolkowicz 2021 given the sessile lifestyle anaob is prone to survive on the carrier biofilms e g plastic ring sand particles and even submersible mixer kuenen 2008 mulder et al 1995 park et al 2017 zekker et al 2012a zhang et al 2021 which is an essential prerequisite for the mainstream use of anammox recent studies have found that in hybrid systems microbial interactions substrate sharing and substrate competition between suspended sludge and carrier biofilms had significant impacts on anaob gao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 however there is still no clear strategy that can coordinate the complex relationship between suspended sludge and biofilm to achieve anaob enrichment ultimately our recent study unexpectedly found an encouraging phenomenon under hybrid conditions anaob was acutely enriched in the anoxic biofilms from 0 74 to 4 34 due to an unexpected loss of suspended sludge from 2873 mg volatile suspended solids vss l to 534 mg vss l li et al 2021 the sharp decline in the suspended sludge concentration provoked the deterioration of denitrification however anammox showed increasingly higher activity similarly in the latest study anaob abundance decreased with the introduction of suspended sludge but significantly increased from 0 82 to 2 22 after the discharge of suspended sludge liu et al 2023 inspired by previous studies we hypothesize here that the reduction of the suspended sludge concentration in the hybrid system potentially facilitates the anaob enrichment in the biofilms the rationality of this hypothesis is that db predominates in suspended sludge and thus the decline in suspended sludge concentration reduces db biomass specifically heterotrophic denitrification will potentially be less competitive for no2 with decreasing db biomass presenting an opportunity for anaob to acquire a more significant proportion of no2 gao et al 2022 li et al 2021 2020 on the other hand the decrease in db biomass has a similar effect as anaob bioaugmentation namely a relative increase in anaob biomass in this sense the biomass balance of db and anaob may be restored providing an essential prerequisite for the niche construction of anaob although the above hypothesis sheds fresh light on the anaob enrichment under mainstream conditions there is still a lack of direct evidence and systematic evaluation especially in actual municipal wastewater to this end this study proposes suspended sludge biomass management as a novel operational strategy for hybrid process an anaerobic anoxic oxic combining with biological contact oxidation a2o bco bioreactor was established and operated for 570 days the overarching objectives of this study were to i systematically evaluate the feasibility of suspended sludge biomass management for strengthening anammox in hybrid process ii reveal the impacts of suspended sludge biomass management on the microbial community core microbial interaction and metabolic activity finally the prospect of upgrading the traditional hybrid process to a pure biofilm anammox process through suspended sludge biomass management was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the

oberkochen germany was employed to display the microstructure of the biofilms and to assess the structural stability during long term operation 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal performance during suspended sludge biomass management the a2o bco bioreactor was continuously operated for 570 days treating low c n ratio 3 7 0 8 municipal wastewater with six phases divided by biomass types table 1 owing to the unique configuration suspended sludge was segregated outside the bco unit fig 1 thus the bco unit maintained a pure biofilm state throughout the operation and was unaffected by the variations in the suspended sludge concentration during the 570 days of operation near complete nh4 removal was achieved the average effluent nh4 n concentration was as low as 0 2 0 3 mg n l corresponding to a removal efficiency of 99 6 0 8 fig 2b in phase i days 1 81 the a2o unit was initiated with pure suspended sludge of 6342 484 mg vss l the effective hrt was 12 1 h corresponding to an influent nitrogen loading rate nlr of 77 8 7 1 g n m3 d the tin concentration of the effluent was 14 7 1 0 mg n l fig 2c representing an nre and nitrogen removal rate nrr of 62 1 4 5 and 48 7 9 7 g n m3 day respectively the hybrid process was established in phase ii days 82 201 carrier biofilms holding anaob candidatus brocadia 1 98 candidatus kuenenia 0 04 were integrated into the anaerobic and anoxic zones with a filling ratio of 40 the biomass of seeding biofilms was 50 5 3 2 mg vss carrier corresponding to a biomass concentration of 2099 129 mg vss l fig s1 the suspended sludge concentration remained at 6045 102 mg vss l fig 2a during phase ii anaob increased the nre and nrr to 70 7 3 7 and 55 8 6 5 g n m3 d respectively under the hybrid conditions to mitigate the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms the concentration of suspended sludge was successively reduced to 4067 382 mg vss l phase iii days 202 320 and 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv days 321 442 during this process the nitrogen removal performance gradually improved the effluent tin concentration decreased to 9 9 1 9 mg n l and 8 2 1 6 mg n l the nre increased to 74 5 4 9 and 79 2 3 9 respectively and the nrr increased to 58 8 9 8 g n m3 d and 62 3 9 0 g n m3 d respectively in phase v days 443 519 the hybrid process was upgraded to the pure biofilm process by discharging all suspended sludge from the a2o unit during this process the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated severely the tin concentration in the effluent reached up to 16 3 4 0 mg n l days 443 494 representing an nre as low as 60 5 11 6 indicating that the pure biofilm process was overloaded fig 2c to recover the nre the influent nlr was successively lowered to 68 4 6 1 and 52 9 5 8 g n m3 d by prolonging the hrt to 14 5 h and 18 2 h and the nre and nrr then increased sharply from day 520 the a2o bco biosystem reached a quasi steady state phase vi days 520 570 during which the effluent tin was sustained at a low level of 10 2 2 3 mg n l with a corresponding nre of 74 4 5 0 in summary the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid process was significantly improved by suspended sludge biomass management nre p 0 001 nrr p 0 001 and finally the hybrid process was successfully upgraded to the pure biofilm process with stable nitrogen removal performance 3 2 variations in anammox performance by suspended sludge biomass management 3 2 1 in situ anammox reaction rate and contribution ratio to nitrogen removal to investigate the variations in anammox performance during the suspended sludge biomass management the loss of nh4 in the anaerobic and anoxic do 0 01 mg l zones was monitored throughout the operation anammox and microbial assimilation are potential pathways for nh4 loss under oxygen free conditions rahimi et al 2020 in the ex situ test the nh4 loss due to microbial assimilation was undetectable fig s6 thus in this study all the nh4 loss in the anaerobic and anoxic zones was attributed to anammox on the basis of this the in situ anammox reaction rate referring to the sum of the anammox reaction rates in the anaerobic and anoxic zones eq 3 and the contribution ratio of anammox to nitrogen removal eq 4 were quantified when the a2o unit initially operated with pure suspended sludge phase i the nh4 loss was hardly observed due to the absence of anaob fig s4 when the hybrid process was established in the anaerobic and anoxic zones the nh4 loss was detected notably the in situ anammox rate showed a significant negative correlation with the suspended sludge concentration p 0 001 r 2 0 93 fig 3a in phase ii it was limited to a low level of 8 8 1 9 g n m3 d contributing 9 2 2 8 to nitrogen removal fig 3b as the suspended sludge concentration decreased to 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv the anammox rate successively increased to 39 5 3 8 g n m3 d corresponding to a contribution ratio of 43 7 7 2 this explained the successive improvement of nre under the limited influent c n ratio in phase vi the in situ anammox rate peaked under the pure biofilm status 45 5 3 2 g n m3 d contributing 67 1 8 3 to nitrogen removal as the dominant pathway 3 2 2 high level enrichment of anaob in biofilms the absolute abundances of anaob 16s rrna gene and hzsb gene were determined by qpcr in the anaerobic fig 4a and anoxic biofilms fig 4b they were significantly more abundant than in suspended sludge p 0 001 fig s7 which confirms the niche preference of anaob for biofilms laureni et al 2019 pÃ©rez et al 2020 zekker et al 2012b zhang et al 2020a taking the anoxic biofilms as examples the abundance of the 16s rrna gene of anaob was 2 72 0 04 109 copies g vss in the seeding biofilms day 82 the following four months of operation with high concentration suspended sludge reduced it to 9 94 0 99 108 copies g vss day 200 p 0 001 with the concentration of suspended sludge gradually decreasing to 2046 261 mg vss l anaob was significantly enriched to 6 12 0 22 109 copies g vss day 435 p 0 001 finally under the pure biofilm conditions it peaked at 1 16 0 01 1010 copies g vss day 561 the long term trend of anammox abundance was in line with the in situ anammox rate high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed similar results details in section 3 4 candidatus brocadia was enriched in the anoxic biofilms from 0 70 day 200 to as high as 5 99 day 561 phylogenetic analysis suggested that the otu466 was dominant with over 85 80 of total anaob which was phylogenetically related to candidatus brocadia sp 40 fig s8 this anammox abundance level exceeded most mainstream anammox systems treating municipal wastewater anja and ottosen 2019 nejidat et al 2018 clsm fish identified the spatial distribution of anaob in the anoxic biofilms fig s9 in the seeding biofilms anaob was found in the innermost 50 Î¼m layer labeled in pink a superposition of red anaob cy5 and blue total bacteria cy3 by day 561 anaob had spread throughout the biofilms a higher pink fluorescence intensity suggested a higher density of the targeted anaob which was in good accordance with the qpcr and high throughput sequencing results 3 3 nitrogen removal pathway characteristics 3 3 1 distinct nitrogen removal pathways in suspended sludge and biofilms to better understand the increase in the anammox performance and enrichment of anaob during the suspended sludge biomass management a series of ex situ batch experiments were conducted on day 429 first the nitrogen metabolic pathways of suspended sludge and anoxic biofilms were assessed separately with nh4 no3 and organic matter ch3coona as substrates for the pure suspended sludge 5962 mg vss l no3 was depleted within 0 5 h without no2 accumulation and nh4 loss fig 5a this suggested the dominance of cascade denitrification in the suspended sludge while anammox was absent by contrast significant nh4 loss was observed in the pure biofilm system 54 5 mg vss carrier filling ratio of 40 corresponding to a biomass concentration of 2181 mg vss l fig 5b the specific anammox activity saa was 10 5 0 1 mg n g vss h the decrease in nh4 continued until no3 was depleted at 90 min which was in good accordance with the nitrogen conversion profiles of the pda process chen et al 2020 gao et al 2021 ma et al 2017 the nitrogen mass balance analysis showed that the no3 to no2 transforming ratio ntr referring to the ratio of no2 utilized by anaob in total no2 production from no3 reduction was as high as 65 7 0 9 these results suggest that anaob was more competitive for no2 than db in the biofilms which enabled a satisfactory pda performance 3 3 2 effects of suspended sludge on anammox in the hybrid system the anammox performance of the hybrid system was evaluated by integrating anoxic biofilms into suspended sludge at different concentration levels 5962 4097 and 2063 mg vss l fig 5c e in these three hybrid systems the saa was lower than in the pure biofilm system when the suspended sludge biomass concentration was 5962 mg vss l the saa was as low as 1 0 0 1 mg n g vss h contributing 10 6 1 3 to nitrogen removal fig 5c when the suspended sludge concentrations were reduced to 4097 mg vss l and 2063 mg vss l the saa increased to 2 8 0 3 fig 5d and 5 6 0 6 mg n g vss h fig 5e respectively corresponding to anammox contribution ratios of 27 7 3 4 and 45 8 6 8 respectively during these tests the saa and anammox contribution ratios were negatively correlated with the biomass concentration of suspended sludge pearson s r 0 98 pearson s r 0 98 fig s10 in addition the ntrs at 5962 4097 and 2063 mg vss l were 7 1 1 1 19 7 2 2 and 35 1 4 0 respectively which were also negatively correlated with the biomass concentration of suspended sludge pearson s r 0 97 fig s10 as the suspended sludge was completely discharged i e in the pure biofilm system the ntr peaked at 65 7 0 9 these results provided direct evidence for the two preceding hypotheses i the db in suspended sludge outcompeted anaob in biofilms for the shared substrate no2 and ii a reduction in the biomass concentration of suspended sludge could effectively mitigate the competition of db against anaob 3 4 variations in the core bacterial microbiomes and distributions of functional genes the microbial diversity and the variations in core bacterial microbiomes were analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the rarefaction and shannon curves showed a decrease in the microbial richness in the anoxic biofilms suggesting that some functional bacteria were selectively enriched during the suspended sludge biomass management fig s11 the core bacterial microbiomes associated with nitrogen removal were evaluated at the genus level or higher in the suspended sludge the taxonomic classification of the phylum showed that actinobacteriota 14 6 32 9 proteobacteria 17 9 32 8 and chloroflexi 14 7 24 7 were dominant fig 6a planctomycetota the phylum to which anaob belongs was almost absent at the genus level denitrifying populations accounted for 9 of the top 12 dominant genera including conventional dbs such as caldilineaceae 3 11 6 13 and jg30 kf cm45 1 58 6 22 as well as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos candidatus microthrix 1 06 5 01 and tetrasphaera 1 26 6 28 fig 6c these dbs showed no significant statistical variations in abundance during the suspended sludge biomass management these results indicated that db including dpao was the overwhelmingly core bacterial microbiome in suspended sludge in the anoxic biofilms chloroflexi 27 9 43 3 and proteobacteria 20 8 37 3 were the keystone phyla fig 6b the abundance of planctomycetota increased notably from 1 3 to 7 3 during the suspended sludge biomass management in the seeding biofilms anammox genera candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were observed with relative abundances of 1 98 and 0 04 respectively fig 6d by the end of phase ii the abundance of candidatus brocadia was reduced to 0 70 and candidatus kuenenia could no longer be detected notably as the suspended sludge concentration decreased to 4067 382 mg vss l phase iii and 2046 261 mg vss l phase iv candidatus brocadia was gradually enriched to 1 61 and 3 92 in the anoxic biofilms after the suspended sludge was completely discharged from the system candidatus brocadia was further enriched to 5 99 as the dominant genus in fact db was the most abundant microbiome in the seeding biofilms with representative genera of olb14 13 50 thauera 5 46 and denitratisoma 2 33 however with the enrichment of candidatus brocadia the relative abundance of db showed a significant reduction e g olb14 from 17 46 to 7 90 and thauera from 5 46 to 0 14 it may well be that anaob affected the denitrifying populations by competing for the shared substrate no2 therefore the core bacterial microbiomes in the anoxic biofilms were reshaped by the suspended sludge biomass management db and anaob coexisted in the biofilms as the two main microbiomes rather than only being dominated by db as initially inoculated the distribution of functional genes associated with nitrogen removal was evaluated by qpcr as mentioned earlier hzsb encoding hydrazine synthase Î² subunit a specific functional gene of anaob was mainly enriched in the biofilms but was barely found in the suspended sludge in contrast the functional genes responsible for the cascade denitrification narg napa nirs nirk and nosz were enriched in the suspended sludge fig 7a in line with the high throughput sequencing results this suggested that suspended sludge possessed a more abundant denitrifying population than biofilms making it more competitive for no2 in this sense it is particularly critical to mitigate the competition of db for no2 by reducing the suspended sludge concentration the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was calculated to better illustrate the distinct nitrogen metabolism pathways in the suspended sludge and biofilms specifically a higher rate of no3 reduction over no2 reduction is desirable for the synergy between db and anaob in this regard a relatively higher abundance of no3 reductase typically encoded by napa and narg over no2 reductase typically encoded by nirk and nirs is required therefore the napa narg to nirk nirs ratio was employed to represent the dynamic ratio of no3 and no2 reductase levels in suspended sludge the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was 1 0 0 2 fig 7b which was in good agreement with traditional nitrification denitrification n dn systems but well below that of pda systems cui et al 2020 li et al 2021 this explained the dominance of cascade denitrification in suspended sludge in comparison the ratio of napa narg to nirk nirs was much higher in the anoxic biofilms 14 1 1 7 which was more favorable for db to produce no2 than to consume no2 thereby ensuring the coupling efficiency of pda which enabled the satisfactory pda performance in the anoxic biofilms these results underscore the significance of suspended sludge biomass management the reduction in suspended sludge could directly mitigate the suppression of cascade denitrification in suspended sludge on anammox in biofilms 4 discussion the mainstream use of anammox for minimizing the energy consumption and carbon footprint of municipal wwtps is highly attractive however regardless of the process configuration or biomass type sufficient enrichment of anaob is not straightforward for municipal wwtps the application cases of mainstream anammox for municipal wastewater over the past decade were summarized in table s3 taking our previous work as an example the pda process was applied to the upgradation of a wwtp in xi an china 2 105 m3 day li et al 2019 despite years of operation the final anaob abundance only reached 1 9 108 2 0 109 copies g vss the technical bottleneck in anaob enrichment has significantly delayed the anammox based paradigm shift of wwtps worldwide fofana et al 2022 lackner et al 2014 vandekerckhove et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zekker et al 2021 the pda which db and anaob jointly mediate is a promising option for the mainstream application of anammox and has demonstrated encouraging stability in laboratory scale installations the current view is that the high enrichment of the pd functional microbiome is a crucial prerequisite for mainstream pda du et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2022 specifically the pd functional microbiome refers to those dbs that could reduce no3 with significant no2 accumulation first some strains reduce no3 with no2 as the only product due to the absence of no2 reductase e g rhodobacter sphaeroides 2 4 1 and staphylococcus sp ma et al 2020 second some strains present the progressive onset po of denitrification genes e g thauera sp dnt 1 and thauera terpenicaa bringing about temporary no2 accumulation liu et al 2013 in fact the high enrichment of the pd functional microbiome relies largely on the induction of readily degradable organic carbon and a low cod no3 n ratio du et al 2019 kumar and lin 2010 zhang et al 2020b in a recent engineering application sodium acetate and glucose were replenished as readily degradable carbon sources into the anoxic zone of a wwtp in tianjin china 3 104 m3 day liu et al 2021 an ntr of over 90 persisted for 17 months until the replenishment was switched off however the average sodium acetate and glucose dosages were 1 76 t day and 3 32 t day respectively this reflected a thorny issue that the mainstream use of pda may be at the expense of an extended carbon footprint and enormous operating costs the present study underscores that the enrichment of anaob in the hybrid system was closely related to the suspended sludge concentration the ex situ batch experiments demonstrated that the saa was significantly negatively correlated with the suspended sludge concentration pearson s r 0 98 fig s10 although stronger denitrification was attained with a higher suspended sludge concentration anammox showed lower activity fig 5 in the long term operation the anammox reaction rate suffered from the high suspended sludge concentration in phases ii and iii with the anammox abundance falling to the lowest level candidatus brocadia 0 70 16s rrna gene of anaob 9 94 0 99 108 copies g vss these phenomena were very similar to previous pda system treating municipal wastewater which were attributed to the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms to mitigate this vicious competition suspended sludge biomass management was implemented in the batch experiments the ntr increased from 7 1 1 1 hybrid system with suspended sludge of 5962 mg vss l to 65 7 0 9 biofilm only fig 5 in the anoxic biofilms anaob was enriched to an impressively high level candidatus brocadia 5 99 16s rrna gene of anaob 1 16 0 01 1010 copies g vss far higher than the reported level in mainstream anammox systems treating municipal wastewater anja and ottosen 2019 cao et al 2018 li et al 2019 nejidat et al 2018 interestingly when blasting the db in this system with the pd functional microbiome previously reported their abundances were very low even unobservable in contrast conventional db responsible for cascaded denitrification prevailed this challenges the stereotype that the pd functional microbiome is obligatory for mainstream pda when the vicious competition of db against anaob is mitigated satisfactory mainstream anammox is hopefully achieved such as in phases iv and vi in this study in this sense suspended sludge biomass management lowers the threshold of mainstream pda enabling the application of pda even in the absence of a pd functional microbiome in the final stage of the suspended sludge biomass management phase vi the suspended sludge was completely discharged under the pure biofilm status a highly stable nitrogen removal performance was attained with the removal efficiencies of tin and nh4 n achieving 74 4 5 0 and 99 7 0 9 respectively representing a successful upgradation from the traditional hybrid process to the pure biofilm process for municipal wwtps excess sludge disposal is a longstanding problem that significantly increases the economic burden and energy consumption while posing potential risks to water and soil environments abdel wahaab et al 2020 abdelrahman et al 2023 hao et al 2020 jÃ¡kÃ³i et al 2021 wang et al 2023 however there has been a lack of methods for upgrading traditional processes to pure biofilm processes in this regard suspended sludge biomass management presents a new approach for wwtps to eliminate dependence on excess sludge disposal from the practical application perspective it has three significant advantages i in terms of operability it is easier to implement than conventional strategies such as the precise control of the c n ratio ii in terms of economy and sustainability it does not require additional facilities nor additional carbon sources and chemicals iii in terms of stability the concentration of suspended sludge is a relatively stable parameter that does not fluctuate significantly with varying influent loads unlike the do concentration or c n ratio which ensures the effectiveness of this strategy ren et al 2022 furthermore it should be noted that the in situ anammox reaction rate under the pure biofilm status was 45 5 3 2 g n m3 d which was comparable with the traditional n dn processes these results shed light on the potential application of suspended sludge biomass management toward wwtp upgradation it is not limited to the high level enrichment of anaob in a hybrid system more importantly it facilitates the anammox based paradigm shift of wwtps in the near future 5 conclusions in this study a novel strategy of suspended sludge biomass management was proposed and investigated in an a2o bco process for 570 days the key conclusions are as follows suspended sludge biomass management enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid process the nre and nrr were significantly improved from 62 1 4 5 to 79 2 3 9 p 0 001 and from 48 7 9 7 to 62 3 9 0 g n m3 d p 0 001 respectively stepwise reductions of suspended sludge could effectively mitigate the competition of db in suspended sludge against anaob in biofilms the in situ anammox reaction rate increased from 8 8 1 9 to 45 5 3 2 g n

14838,extracellular antibiotic resistance genes eargs are important emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nutritional substrate deficiency i e starvation frequently occurs in wwtps owing to annual maintenance water quality fluctuation and sludge storage and it can greatly alter the antibiotic resistance and extracellular dna content of bacteria however the fate and corresponding transmission risk of eargs in activated sludge under starvation stress remain largely unknown herein we used metagenomic sequencing to explore the effects of starvation scenarios carbon nitrogen and or phosphorus deficiency and environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic on the distribution mobility and hosts of eargs in activated sludge the results showed that 30 days of starvation reduced the absolute abundances of eargs by 40 9 88 2 but high risk dual and multidrug resistance genes persisted starvation particularly the simultaneous lack of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under aerobic conditions effectively alleviated eargs by reducing the abundance of extracellular mobile genetic elements emges starvation also altered the profile of bacterial hosts of eargs and the bacterial community composition the latter of which had an indirect positive effect on eargs via changing emges our findings shed light on the response patterns and mechanisms of eargs in activated sludge under starvation conditions and highlight starvation as a potential strategy to mitigate the risk of previously neglected eargs in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular antibiotic resistance genes starvation activated sludge metagenomics substrate type environmental condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the risk assessment and control of emerging antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment are essential issues in combating the global threat of antibiotic resistance unep 2017 the activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps with highly diverse and dense microbial consortia represents a hotspot of args hendriksen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 args in activated sludge can be divided into two main groups intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs and these have divergent proliferation and dissemination patterns zhou et al 2019 iargs can shuttle between bacterial cells via conjugation and transduction whereas eargs transfer to bacteria through transformation zarei baygi and smith 2021 zhou et al 2019 thus the fate of these forms of args and their roles in the transmission of antibiotic resistance in activated sludge require urgent discrimination in particular eargs are more proximal to the water phase than iargs and are believed to be the intermediate form of args that leak into wastewater therefore reducing the amount of eargs might limit the spread of args in wwtps and this idea is attracting increasing attention owing to the high ecological and human health risks of args zarei baygi and smith 2021 nutritional substrate deficiency i e starvation widely exists in bacterial habitats especially in the inner layer of biofilms bernier et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 stewart and franklin 2008 starvation can regulate bacterial resistance by altering the physiological features e g stringent active response and growth arrest cell structure and gene expression of many bacterial species table s1 for example 24 h carbon c starvation was shown to reduce energy metabolism in escherichia coli e coli which strengthened its tolerance to antibiotics including gentamicin and ofloxacin moreau 2014 under nitrogen n starvation e coli showed a 20 times higher survival rate compared with non n starved e coli following 24 h exposure to ciprofloxacin brown 2019 in pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa the resistance to antimicrobial peptides improved by 100 fold after two days of phosphorus p starvation lewenza 2013 additionally when exposed to starvation bacterial strains such as e coli finkel and kolter 2001 p aeruginosa mulcahy et al 2010 and haloferax volcanii chimileski et al 2014 can degrade extracellular dna edna into nucleotides which can then be utilized as a source of c n and p these findings indicate that eargs contained in the abundant edna from activated sludge dominiak et al 2011 may also be degraded under starvation scenarios however previous studies on bacterial antibiotic resistance under starvation stress have rarely investigated the temporal variations in eargs in environmental strains or consortia but this information is important for developing strategies to mitigate the risk of args in wwtps the microbial consortia in activated sludge may frequently be exposed to starvation shock owing to annual maintenance water quality fluctuation and storage requirement miller et al 2014 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 previous studies have reported that starvation stress disturbs the activity and structure of the bacterial community in activated sludge liu et al 2017 metch et al 2019 takimoto et al 2021 which could affect the composition and abundance of args su et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 specifically n starvation improved the growth of sulfonamide resistant bacteria and maintained the abundance of args in activated sludge tang et al 2022 whereas insufficient c substrate inhibited bacterial growth in activated sludge thus decreasing the abundance of sul1 and sul2 guo et al 2017 although numerous studies have proven that eargs are an important fraction of args in activated sludge and significantly contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment ikuma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 the effects of starvation on the eargs profile and bacterial hosts remain unclear notably starvation stress can impact horizontal gene transfer which is a key pathway for args spread between and within bacteria huddleston et al 2013 nishioka et al 2007 the transformation frequency of gallibacterium anatis increased 6 to 90 times after exposure to c n and p starvation kristensen et al 2012 the transconjugant number of e coli under c starvation was shown to be 1000 fold lower than those of non starved e coli fox et al 2008 moreover starvation can regulate the distribution of extracellular mobile genetic elements emges in bacteria soora et al 2015 which are the major drivers in facilitating the acquisition and horizontal transfer of args partridge et al 2018 nevertheless a knowledge gap remains regarding the distribution of emges and the corresponding mobility of eargs in activated sludge upon exposure to starvation here for the first time we performed metagenomic sequencing to examine eargs fate in activated sludge and the underlying mechanisms under nutritional substrate starvation c n and or p deficiency in different environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic the specific aims of this study were as follows i to investigate the effects of starvation on the diversity and abundance of eargs ii to elucidate the mobility of eargs by monitoring variations of emges during starvation and iii to clarify the change patterns of the bacterial hosts of eargs in response to starvation these findings provide insight into the dynamic profiles of eargs in activated sludge under particular operating statuses and may promote the development of applicable strategies for reducing args and their risks in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge and chemicals a total volume of 15 l seed activated sludge was collected from the membrane reactor in a municipal wwtp with mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 3 0 g l all chemicals were purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china and were of analytical grade 2 2 starvation experiments the starvation experiments were carried out by restricting specific nutritional substrates under various environmental conditions for 30 d this experimental period was set up according to the typical time of sludge storage or wwtp maintenance which usually takes several weeks miller et al 2014 wang et al 2015 four starvation scenarios including the simultaneous lack of c n and p abbreviated as c n p and single c n or p deficiency were initiated under the alternating anaerobic aerobic condition in addition the c n p starvation under four environmental conditions i e anaerobic anoxic aerobic and alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions was examined the original ck0 and non starved containing c n p ck30 activated sludge samples were used as control groups in the starvation experiments the specific experimental conditions are described in table s2 each 900 ml sludge mixture was transferred into a 1 l conical flask and was starved at 20 c with continuous shaking at 150 rpm after starvation two parallel sludge samples collected from each pre shaken conical flask were well mixed to avoid bias caused by random sampling li et al 2023 tian et al 2016 finally the mixed sludge samples were centrifuged 10 000 g 4 c 15 min to remove the supernatant and stored at 80 c for subsequent edna extraction 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and gene prediction edna from the sludge samples was extracted using the weak base 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 homogenization method mao et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 supplementary information si text s1 and fig s1 which was confirmed to be feasible and favorable for extracting edna without idna cross contamination as indicated by the quantitative quality control dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 dna sequencing was conducted on the illumina hiseq 3000 4000 platform novegene beijing china using an index pe150 8 150 strategy paired end sequencing 150 bp reads and 8 bp index sequence megahit metagenemark and cd hit were used to perform metagenomic assembly predict open reading frames orfs and obtain non redundant gene catalog i e unigenes respectively si text s2 information about the edna in the metagenomic sequencing is provided in table s3 data related to the metagenomic sequencing assembly and gene prediction is shown in table s4 our rarefaction curves showed that the sequencing depth is sufficient to identify the eargs and emges fig s2 2 4 eargs emges and microbial annotations the unigenes sequences were retrieved for eargs alignment against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database http arpcard mcmaster ca alcock et al 2020 the identified earg orfs were then manually sorted into earg types and subtypes the clean reads for the diversity and abundances of emges were searched for integrons against the integrall database http integrall bio ua pt moura et al 2009 for insertion sequences iss against the isfinder database https www is biotoul fr siguier et al 2015 and for plasmids against the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov in addition the taxonomic affiliation of the predicted gene was determined by aligning the unigenes against the integrated nr database qin et al 2010 which were further processed by the lowest common ancestor lca based algorithm using megan huson et al 2011 the bacterial hosts of eargs were sorted out from the taxonomic annotation results based on the same gene identity details of the taxonomic assignment and the thresholds for eargs and emges identification are shown in si text s3 2 5 data analysis and visualization to avoid bias caused by sample variation normalization by the reference sequence length and sequencing depth was performed as previously described pehrsson et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the relative abundances of eargs emges and bacteria genera for bacterial community and earg hosts were expressed as reads per kilobase per million reads rpkm and were calculated using the following equation rel i n i 1000 l i 1 n total where rel i is the relative abundance of earg emge or bacterial genus i ni is the number of clean reads mapped to earg emge or bacterial genus i li is the length of the reference sequence of earg emge or bacterial genus i and n total is the number of clean reads in a sample millions furthermore to assess the actual risk of eargs zhu et al 2021 the absolute abundances of eargs expressed as mg g mlvss were obtained by multiplying the relative abundances of eargs and the edna yield table s3 the abundances and types of eargs were visualized by overview graphs http mkweb bcgsc ca tableviewer the number of eargs co occurring in different samples was presented using venndiagram 1 6 17 and r package 4 2 1 chen and boutros 2011 a heatmap of emges was constructed with hemi 2 0 http hemi biocuckoo cn ning et al 2022 the top 10 most abundant earg subtypes and their bacterial hosts in each sample were displayed after de duplication using origin 2021 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa partial least squares path modeling pls pm tenenhaus et al 2005 was performed using r 4 2 1 with the plspm package to investigate the total direct and indirect effects of the relative abundances of bacterial community and emges on eargs abundances pearson correlations between eargs and emges were generated using spss 26 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa the genetic co occurrence of eargs and emges was identified using a script https github com zs402606665 arg mge clusters and visualized using scalable vector graphics 1 2 3 results 3 1 distribution of eargs under starvation stress 3 1 1 effects of nutritional substrate types the diversity and abundance of eargs in activated sludge were examined after single substrate starvation c n or p and multi substrate starvation c n p as shown in table 1 the number of earg types and subtypes in activated sludge was almost unchanged after the 30 d substrate deficiency except there was an 8 3 reduction in earg subtypes after c n p starvation the absolute abundances of eargs in the c n p c n and p starvation tests decreased from 842 2 mg g mlvss to 156 5 mg g mlvss 99 1 mg g mlvss 100 1 mg g mlvss and 497 4 mg g mlvss with percentage decreases of 81 4 88 2 88 1 and 40 9 respectively these results showed that c n p c and n starvation efficiently removed eargs additionally the relative abundances of eargs decreased from 216 0 rpkm to 182 6 rpkm a 15 4 decrease after c n p starvation whereas it increased by 9 0 28 0 and 12 1 after c n and p starvation respectively table 1 the decline in eargs abundance under c n p starvation was probably related to the reduction of biomass table s3 and edna fig s3 and the high degradation rate of eargs by dnase zou et al 2020 collectively c n p starvation effectively reduced the diversity and abundance of eargs providing a potential pathway to mitigate the risk of args in activated sludge regarding the predominate earg types the relative abundances of elfamycin resistance genes dual resistance genes and multidrug resistance mdr genes were reduced by 16 3 14 1 and 33 1 respectively after c n p starvation fig 1 a however the most abundant elfamycin resistance genes increased by 8 7 41 7 and 18 5 in the c n and p starvation tests respectively fig 1a indicating an aggregated load of specific eargs in activated sludge under single nutrient starvation similarly the relative abundances of dual resistance and mdr genes after the 30 d n starvation increased by 20 2 and 20 7 and their corresponding percentages reached 17 8 and 10 3 of the total relative abundance of eargs respectively fig 1a these results confirmed that dual resistance and mdr genes could be reduced by c n p starvation but they persisted or were even enriched in activated sludge when exposed to single substrate starvation especially n starvation because dual resistant and mdr bacteria can increase clinical treatment costs and patient mortality cosme et al 2017 pazda et al 2019 the proliferation of persistent dual resistance and mdr genes in activated sludge warrants further attention the majority 75 of earg subtypes showed a reduction in relative abundance after c n p starvation fig 1b in contrast single c n or p deficiency resulted in a consistent increase in the relative abundance of many earg subtypes such as ef tu rpsl and rpsj fig 1b in particular the relative abundance of ef tu the most abundant earg subtype belonging to the elfamycin args decreased by 16 3 after c n p starvation but it increased by 8 7 41 7 after the single substrate starvations fig 1b moreover the composition of ef tu also changed after 30 d of starvation fig 1c the relative percentage of ef tu encoding kirromycin resistance in e coli was reduced by 10 7 13 4 after c n p c and n starvation while the others increased by varying degrees e g the enterococcus faecium e faecium ef tu mutants conferring resistance to ge2270a increased by up to 77 5 ef tu is the predominant earg subtype in wwtps zheng et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 and has been shown to encode the most abundant protein for peptide elongation in bacteria cells prezioso et al 2017 in addition to ef tu the relative abundances of gyra and gyrb dual resistance or mdr genes markedly increased by 50 9 and 99 4 respectively after n starvation notably 65 earg subtypes co occurred in all starvation groups and the control group ck0 fig 1d these eargs accounted for 97 2 98 8 of the total relative abundance of each sample fig 1e implying a high stability of the core eargs composition 3 1 2 effects of environmental conditions the distribution of eargs in activated sludge under nutritional substrate starvation was studied in different environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic environments these conditions represent the typical process parameters regarding the availability of electron acceptor oxygen or nitrate in wwtps and have been widely demonstrated to affect the fate of args in activated sludge christgen et al 2015 guo et al 2021 yuan et al 2016 in the present study starvation under the different environmental conditions did not markedly change the diversity of eargs table 1 however the absolute and relative abundances of eargs after starvation decreased by 80 1 86 0 and 1 8 19 3 respectively table 1 furthermore the absolute and relative abundances of eargs after aerobic starvation were much lower than those after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic starvation table 1 indicating that aerobic starvation may be more effective in removing eargs for the earg types the predominant elfamycin resistance dual resistance and mdr genes after starvation in all tested environmental conditions were reduced by 8 1 16 3 9 2 13 6 and 1 9 48 0 respectively fig 2 a in particular the relative abundance of mdr genes was reduced by up to 48 0 and 33 1 under aerobic and anaerobic aerobic starvation respectively however it was nearly unchanged after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 2a notably the relative abundances of aminoglycoside resistance genes after anaerobic aerobic and anoxic starvation were slightly increased by 7 8 and 8 0 respectively but they decreased by 11 3 after aerobic starvation fig 2a our findings show that high dissolved oxygen combined with low substrate availability may contribute to the elimination of high risk mdr and aminoglycoside resistance genes in activated sludge at the subtype level the abundance of the most abundant earg ef tu decreased by 8 1 20 6 and its composition also changed to varying degrees resulting from starvation under different environmental conditions fig 2b and c specifically the proportion of ef tu encoding kirromycin resistance in e coli decreased by 8 3 6 3 and 11 5 respectively after alternating anaerobic aerobic anoxic and aerobic starvation fig 2c the proportion of ef tu encoding ge2270a resistance in e faecium was two fold higher after aerobic starvation than after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 2c indicating that aerobic condition favored ge2270a resistance further analysis showed that 66 earg subtypes co occurred in all samples fig 2d which accounted for 98 2 99 0 of the total abundance in each starved sample fig 2e interestingly the relative abundances of the co occurring eargs such as ef tu rpsl and rpob in the aerobic group were lower than those of the control anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic groups fig 2b implying that aerobic starvation can better accelerate the elimination of eargs 3 2 mobility of eargs under starvation stress mges play an important role in the transfer of args among microorganisms forster et al 2022 the fate of mges in activated sludge is closely associated with the nutritional status and environmental variables yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 therefore the profiles of emges including integrons iss and plasmids under different types of substrate starvation and environmental conditions were examined 3 2 1 substrate specific starvation as presented in table 2 no obvious changes in emges diversity were observed in the c and n starved groups whereas c n p and p starvation decreased the total numbers of each type of emges by 16 7 29 3 and 8 9 19 4 respectively regarding emges abundance the 30 d c n p starvation reduced the total abundances of integrons iss and plasmids by 54 4 41 4 and 43 4 respectively table 2 suggesting that c n p starvation efficiently reduced the mobility of eargs under c starvation the total abundances of integrons and iss were reduced by 30 3 and 14 2 respectively and the total abundance of plasmids slightly increased by 3 3 table 2 conversely emges in the n and p starved groups were enriched by 23 8 83 6 and 67 4 109 6 respectively table 2 implying that a lack of n and p can promote eargs transfer these findings suggest that starvation may substantially alter the abundances of emges but not their diversity to further understand the specific impact of starvation on the composition of three types of emges in activated sludge the top 20 emges in the starved samples were visualized by a heatmap fig 3 c n p starvation resulted in a 97 1 81 8 and 86 4 decrease in the types of integrons iss and plasmids respectively similarly c starvation reduced the majority of emge types by 88 2 68 2 and 67 4 for integrons iss and plasmids respectively by contrast n and p deficiency enriched most types of integrons iss and plasmids the relative abundances of emges with a greater than two fold change accounted for 14 7 34 1 and 17 6 34 1 of the enriched ones after n and p starvation respectively notably all the enriched integrons except fm866927 c5700 belonged to inti1 fig 3 which was genetically co localized with sul1 in all starved samples fig 4 previous studies have reported that single n and p starvation increased the amount of p ppgpp brown 2019 resulting in the stable enrichment of inti1 spira and ospino 2020 inti1 has been identified as a vital transmitter of args in activated sludge zhou et al 2019 and is prevalent in human pathogenic bacteria ribeirinho soares et al 2022 these findings indicate that c n p and c starvation may serve as a potential tool to restrict eargs transfer whereas n and p starvation may aggravate the dissemination risk of eargs by enriching various emges 3 2 2 substrate starvation under different environmental conditions the different nutrient starvations under all tested environmental conditions especially in the anoxic environment decreased the numbers of integrons iss and plasmids in activated sludge table 2 starvation under the different environmental conditions also reduced the total abundances of integrons iss and plasmids by 44 2 60 5 17 2 46 1 and 32 9 43 4 respectively table 2 interestingly the total relative abundances of integrons and iss after aerobic starvation were lower than those after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic starvation table 2 these results suggest that starvation especially aerobic starvation can mitigate the mobility of eargs by reducing the diversity and abundance of emges further analysis elucidated that anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation decreased the abundance of all 28 types of integrons sorted by the top 20 types in each group and most of the iss and plasmids with a relatively high initial abundances that is 3 rpkm and 0 3 rpkm for iss and plasmids respectively fig 5 a thus anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation achieved efficient emges removal the anaerobic and anoxic starvations resulted in a decrease in the relative abundances of most emges to varying degrees however these starvations also enriched a fraction of emges specifically regarding the relative abundances of integrons fj621588 c7009 inti1 was increased by 11 8 after anaerobic starvation while fj621588 c7007 inti1 fj384365 c6288 inti1 and dq914960 c7616 inti1 were increased by 10 7 13 9 and 12 7 respectively after anoxic starvation fig 5a furthermore the majority of the iss greater than 76 with an initial relative abundances of 3 rpkm were enriched by up to 95 9 after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 5b additionally 41 7 and 75 0 of the plasmids with initial relative abundances of 0 3 rpkm were enriched under anaerobic and anoxic starvation respectively fig 5c these findings demonstrate that anaerobic and anoxic starvation had a strong screening effect on some integrons belonging to inti1 and low abundance iss or plasmids resulting in the persistent dissemination of eargs in activated sludge 3 3 bacterial hosts of eargs under starvation stress the bacterial community is one of the critical driving factors determining args fate danko et al 2021 forsberg et al 2014 therefore the bacterial hosts of eargs at genus level after starvation were determined by a combination of blastp alignment and lca based algorithm for the most abundant dominant mycobacterium the relative abundance increased by 53 1 and 77 3 respectively after c n p and c starvation but it dramatically decreased by 63 1 in the p starved group fig 6 a nevertheless the composition of mycobacterium carrying eargs changed little during starvation with the majority identified as vectors of rpob embb and gyra fig 6b as an important host of args in activated sludge luo et al 2022 sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 mycobacterium are recognized as important human pathogens koh et al 2011 that can cause serious pneumonia wei et al 2020 thus the enrichment of mycobacterium after c n p and c starvation deserves further attention regarding the hosts of the most abundant earg subtype e g ef tu the relative abundances markedly changed after starvation and also differed among the various substrate deficiency scenarios fig s4a these results indicate that starvation had a substantial influence on the abundance and composition of eargs hosts the variation of bacterial hosts of eargs in activated sludge was also assessed after starvation under the different environmental conditions we found that the host composition of eargs varied among the environmental conditions specifically the relative abundances of the dominant eargs host i e mycobacterium increased by 53 1 22 3 60 3 and 34 1 after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic starvation respectively fig 7 a suggesting that anaerobic aerobic and anoxic starvation can endow a higher predominance of mycobacterium however the composition of eargs from mycobacterium was roughly stable under starvation in different environmental conditions fig 7b furthermore the other highly abundant hosts including steroidobacter lautropia and rubrivivax consistently decreased during anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation which led to the relative abundance of nitrospira increasing by 29 3 and 13 1 respectively fig 7a some hosts of the predominate ef tu were dramatically affected by the starvation conditions for instance the relative abundances of the most abundant ef tu hosts including steroidobacter rubrivivax and methylibium were decreased by 20 7 66 2 and 43 5 58 2 after anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation respectively and caldilinea increased by two and three times in these two conditions fig s4b additionally dechloromonas was almost eliminated after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig s4b 4 discussion 4 1 c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation effectively removed eargs in activated sludge numerous studies using pure bacterial strains have reported that there is a close link between starvation responses and the development of antibiotic resistance table s1 although nutrient deficiency frequently occurs in wwtps its impacts on args fate especially for the previously neglected eargs in activated sludge are not well understood our results showed that nutrient specific starvation especially c n p starvation effectively reduced the abundances of eargs table 1 suggesting that starvation could be used to mitigate the risk of eargs in activated sludge this was probably because eargs in edna were degraded to serve as a nutrient source under c n p starvation previous studies have shown that the degraded edna can provide c n and p for many bacterial species including e coli and p aeruginosa in nutrient limited environments huang et al 2022 lewenza 2013 furthermore the environmental conditions i e the presence of the electron acceptors including oxygen and nitrate during starvation were found to affect the efficiency of eargs removal table 1 in particular compared with anaerobic starvation aerobic starvation led to a higher degree of eargs reduction table 1 possibly because of the higher degradation rate of eargs under aerobic starvation than under anaerobic starvation tang et al 2022 these observations have two possible explanations 1 the aerobic condition with oxygen as an electron acceptor could more significantly accelerate the endogenous metabolism of extracellular polymeric substances eps including eargs in sludge compared with the anaerobic condition without electron acceptors wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2022 2 sludge particles could have protected dnase active sites and arg target sites under anaerobic conditions thereby reducing the degradation rate of eargs but this protective effect did not occur under aerobic conditions zou et al 2020 4 2 a reduction in emges rather than changes in bacterial community facilitated the elimination of eargs under c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation previous studies have reported that the composition of args in activated sludge is generally driven by mges and the bacterial community structure liao et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 to discriminate the relative contribution of these driving mechanisms to eargs variation during starvation pls pm analyses were conducted based on the relative abundances of eargs emges and bacterial community composition the emges abundance strongly and directly impacted the eargs abundances whereas the bacterial community composition showed a slightly negative direct effect on eargs abundances fig 8 in fact the relative abundances of emges after starvation were significantly positively correlated with that of eargs figs 9 s5 and s6 likewise a previous study found that the changes of args abundance and inti1 abundance were highly correlated under starvation tang et al 2022 moreover multiple genetic co occurrences of emges and eargs e g sul1 inti1 tnas3 and mexd ps121 1a were observed in most of the starved samples figs 4 and s7 however the variation of eargs showed opposite trends when compared with some of their bacterial hosts during starvation for example after c n p starvation the relative abundance of the dominate ef tu decreased but the relative abundances of half of its hosts substantially increased figs 1b and s4a despite this the bacterial community may be indirectly linked with eargs through emges fig 8 in fact numerous studies have reported that under various selective pressures including nutrients heavy metal and antibiotic the variation of args was mainly determined by the changes of mges whereas the bacteria community may directly affect emges and thereby indirectly affecting eargs cui et al 2018 luo et al 2022 wu et al 2022 therefore we tentatively infer that emges rather than the bacterial community directly contributed to the variations in eargs under starvation our results show that the total abundance and diversity of emges in activated sludge were markedly reduced by c n p starvation i e without electron donor substrates table 2 this might be attributable to the higher adsorption and degradation rate of emges in edna after c n p starvation compared with other types of substrate deficiency tang et al 2022 alternatively the reduction of emges under c n p starvation may be associated with enhanced natural transformation of edna into bacterial cells johnston et al 2014 since args are commonly embedded in mges partridge et al 2018 and there is evidence of emge earg clusters figs 4 and s7 the efficient removal of emges under c n p starvation may be a powerful way to reduce the prevalence of eargs when considering the environmental conditions i e the presence of electron acceptors similar to the variations in eargs observed after starvation table 1 and fig 2 aerobic starvation was also more conducive to eliminating emges table 2 because emges and eargs are both specific dna elements within eps composites in activated sludge we doubt that similar mechanisms account for the decrease in emges and eargs as mediated by higher eps consumption and dnase activity under aerobic conditions collectively our findings confirm that nutrient deficiency under aerobic conditions favors the removal of emges which would be beneficial for controlling the propagation and spread of eargs in wwtps 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study using metagenomic sequencing technology to examine the effects of starvation stress on the distribution mobility and bacterial hosts of eargs in activated sludge our findings show that eargs in activated sludge can be reduced by applying multi substrate starvation whereas some high risk eargs dual resistance or mdr genes may be enriched by single substrate starvation this work led to the following key conclusions starvation in the absence of c n p substrates under aerobic conditions decreased the diversity and abundance of eargs providing a potential strategy to lower the risk of args in wwtps single n and p deficiency and anaerobic anoxic starvation enriched some emges which increased the transmission risk of eargs whereas c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation effectively reduced the emges abundance starvation altered the abundance and composition of bacterial hosts of eargs which varied with the specific nutrient deficiency and environmental conditions the superior eargs removal under aerobic c n p starvation was attributed to the efficient reduction in emges abundance rather than to changes in the bacterial community composition despite this the ability and mechanism of horizontal transfer of eargs in activated sludge require further study credit authorship contribution

14838,extracellular antibiotic resistance genes eargs are important emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nutritional substrate deficiency i e starvation frequently occurs in wwtps owing to annual maintenance water quality fluctuation and sludge storage and it can greatly alter the antibiotic resistance and extracellular dna content of bacteria however the fate and corresponding transmission risk of eargs in activated sludge under starvation stress remain largely unknown herein we used metagenomic sequencing to explore the effects of starvation scenarios carbon nitrogen and or phosphorus deficiency and environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic on the distribution mobility and hosts of eargs in activated sludge the results showed that 30 days of starvation reduced the absolute abundances of eargs by 40 9 88 2 but high risk dual and multidrug resistance genes persisted starvation particularly the simultaneous lack of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus under aerobic conditions effectively alleviated eargs by reducing the abundance of extracellular mobile genetic elements emges starvation also altered the profile of bacterial hosts of eargs and the bacterial community composition the latter of which had an indirect positive effect on eargs via changing emges our findings shed light on the response patterns and mechanisms of eargs in activated sludge under starvation conditions and highlight starvation as a potential strategy to mitigate the risk of previously neglected eargs in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular antibiotic resistance genes starvation activated sludge metagenomics substrate type environmental condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the risk assessment and control of emerging antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment are essential issues in combating the global threat of antibiotic resistance unep 2017 the activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps with highly diverse and dense microbial consortia represents a hotspot of args hendriksen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 args in activated sludge can be divided into two main groups intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs and these have divergent proliferation and dissemination patterns zhou et al 2019 iargs can shuttle between bacterial cells via conjugation and transduction whereas eargs transfer to bacteria through transformation zarei baygi and smith 2021 zhou et al 2019 thus the fate of these forms of args and their roles in the transmission of antibiotic resistance in activated sludge require urgent discrimination in particular eargs are more proximal to the water phase than iargs and are believed to be the intermediate form of args that leak into wastewater therefore reducing the amount of eargs might limit the spread of args in wwtps and this idea is attracting increasing attention owing to the high ecological and human health risks of args zarei baygi and smith 2021 nutritional substrate deficiency i e starvation widely exists in bacterial habitats especially in the inner layer of biofilms bernier et al 2013 nguyen et al 2011 stewart and franklin 2008 starvation can regulate bacterial resistance by altering the physiological features e g stringent active response and growth arrest cell structure and gene expression of many bacterial species table s1 for example 24 h carbon c starvation was shown to reduce energy metabolism in escherichia coli e coli which strengthened its tolerance to antibiotics including gentamicin and ofloxacin moreau 2014 under nitrogen n starvation e coli showed a 20 times higher survival rate compared with non n starved e coli following 24 h exposure to ciprofloxacin brown 2019 in pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa the resistance to antimicrobial peptides improved by 100 fold after two days of phosphorus p starvation lewenza 2013 additionally when exposed to starvation bacterial strains such as e coli finkel and kolter 2001 p aeruginosa mulcahy et al 2010 and haloferax volcanii chimileski et al 2014 can degrade extracellular dna edna into nucleotides which can then be utilized as a source of c n and p these findings indicate that eargs contained in the abundant edna from activated sludge dominiak et al 2011 may also be degraded under starvation scenarios however previous studies on bacterial antibiotic resistance under starvation stress have rarely investigated the temporal variations in eargs in environmental strains or consortia but this information is important for developing strategies to mitigate the risk of args in wwtps the microbial consortia in activated sludge may frequently be exposed to starvation shock owing to annual maintenance water quality fluctuation and storage requirement miller et al 2014 sun et al 2020 wang et al 2015 previous studies have reported that starvation stress disturbs the activity and structure of the bacterial community in activated sludge liu et al 2017 metch et al 2019 takimoto et al 2021 which could affect the composition and abundance of args su et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 specifically n starvation improved the growth of sulfonamide resistant bacteria and maintained the abundance of args in activated sludge tang et al 2022 whereas insufficient c substrate inhibited bacterial growth in activated sludge thus decreasing the abundance of sul1 and sul2 guo et al 2017 although numerous studies have proven that eargs are an important fraction of args in activated sludge and significantly contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment ikuma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 the effects of starvation on the eargs profile and bacterial hosts remain unclear notably starvation stress can impact horizontal gene transfer which is a key pathway for args spread between and within bacteria huddleston et al 2013 nishioka et al 2007 the transformation frequency of gallibacterium anatis increased 6 to 90 times after exposure to c n and p starvation kristensen et al 2012 the transconjugant number of e coli under c starvation was shown to be 1000 fold lower than those of non starved e coli fox et al 2008 moreover starvation can regulate the distribution of extracellular mobile genetic elements emges in bacteria soora et al 2015 which are the major drivers in facilitating the acquisition and horizontal transfer of args partridge et al 2018 nevertheless a knowledge gap remains regarding the distribution of emges and the corresponding mobility of eargs in activated sludge upon exposure to starvation here for the first time we performed metagenomic sequencing to examine eargs fate in activated sludge and the underlying mechanisms under nutritional substrate starvation c n and or p deficiency in different environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic the specific aims of this study were as follows i to investigate the effects of starvation on the diversity and abundance of eargs ii to elucidate the mobility of eargs by monitoring variations of emges during starvation and iii to clarify the change patterns of the bacterial hosts of eargs in response to starvation these findings provide insight into the dynamic profiles of eargs in activated sludge under particular operating statuses and may promote the development of applicable strategies for reducing args and their risks in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge and chemicals a total volume of 15 l seed activated sludge was collected from the membrane reactor in a municipal wwtp with mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 3 0 g l all chemicals were purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china and were of analytical grade 2 2 starvation experiments the starvation experiments were carried out by restricting specific nutritional substrates under various environmental conditions for 30 d this experimental period was set up according to the typical time of sludge storage or wwtp maintenance which usually takes several weeks miller et al 2014 wang et al 2015 four starvation scenarios including the simultaneous lack of c n and p abbreviated as c n p and single c n or p deficiency were initiated under the alternating anaerobic aerobic condition in addition the c n p starvation under four environmental conditions i e anaerobic anoxic aerobic and alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions was examined the original ck0 and non starved containing c n p ck30 activated sludge samples were used as control groups in the starvation experiments the specific experimental conditions are described in table s2 each 900 ml sludge mixture was transferred into a 1 l conical flask and was starved at 20 c with continuous shaking at 150 rpm after starvation two parallel sludge samples collected from each pre shaken conical flask were well mixed to avoid bias caused by random sampling li et al 2023 tian et al 2016 finally the mixed sludge samples were centrifuged 10 000 g 4 c 15 min to remove the supernatant and stored at 80 c for subsequent edna extraction 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and gene prediction edna from the sludge samples was extracted using the weak base 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 homogenization method mao et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 supplementary information si text s1 and fig s1 which was confirmed to be feasible and favorable for extracting edna without idna cross contamination as indicated by the quantitative quality control dong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 mao et al 2014 dna sequencing was conducted on the illumina hiseq 3000 4000 platform novegene beijing china using an index pe150 8 150 strategy paired end sequencing 150 bp reads and 8 bp index sequence megahit metagenemark and cd hit were used to perform metagenomic assembly predict open reading frames orfs and obtain non redundant gene catalog i e unigenes respectively si text s2 information about the edna in the metagenomic sequencing is provided in table s3 data related to the metagenomic sequencing assembly and gene prediction is shown in table s4 our rarefaction curves showed that the sequencing depth is sufficient to identify the eargs and emges fig s2 2 4 eargs emges and microbial annotations the unigenes sequences were retrieved for eargs alignment against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database http arpcard mcmaster ca alcock et al 2020 the identified earg orfs were then manually sorted into earg types and subtypes the clean reads for the diversity and abundances of emges were searched for integrons against the integrall database http integrall bio ua pt moura et al 2009 for insertion sequences iss against the isfinder database https www is biotoul fr siguier et al 2015 and for plasmids against the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov in addition the taxonomic affiliation of the predicted gene was determined by aligning the unigenes against the integrated nr database qin et al 2010 which were further processed by the lowest common ancestor lca based algorithm using megan huson et al 2011 the bacterial hosts of eargs were sorted out from the taxonomic annotation results based on the same gene identity details of the taxonomic assignment and the thresholds for eargs and emges identification are shown in si text s3 2 5 data analysis and visualization to avoid bias caused by sample variation normalization by the reference sequence length and sequencing depth was performed as previously described pehrsson et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 the relative abundances of eargs emges and bacteria genera for bacterial community and earg hosts were expressed as reads per kilobase per million reads rpkm and were calculated using the following equation rel i n i 1000 l i 1 n total where rel i is the relative abundance of earg emge or bacterial genus i ni is the number of clean reads mapped to earg emge or bacterial genus i li is the length of the reference sequence of earg emge or bacterial genus i and n total is the number of clean reads in a sample millions furthermore to assess the actual risk of eargs zhu et al 2021 the absolute abundances of eargs expressed as mg g mlvss were obtained by multiplying the relative abundances of eargs and the edna yield table s3 the abundances and types of eargs were visualized by overview graphs http mkweb bcgsc ca tableviewer the number of eargs co occurring in different samples was presented using venndiagram 1 6 17 and r package 4 2 1 chen and boutros 2011 a heatmap of emges was constructed with hemi 2 0 http hemi biocuckoo cn ning et al 2022 the top 10 most abundant earg subtypes and their bacterial hosts in each sample were displayed after de duplication using origin 2021 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa partial least squares path modeling pls pm tenenhaus et al 2005 was performed using r 4 2 1 with the plspm package to investigate the total direct and indirect effects of the relative abundances of bacterial community and emges on eargs abundances pearson correlations between eargs and emges were generated using spss 26 0 ibm corp armonk ny usa the genetic co occurrence of eargs and emges was identified using a script https github com zs402606665 arg mge clusters and visualized using scalable vector graphics 1 2 3 results 3 1 distribution of eargs under starvation stress 3 1 1 effects of nutritional substrate types the diversity and abundance of eargs in activated sludge were examined after single substrate starvation c n or p and multi substrate starvation c n p as shown in table 1 the number of earg types and subtypes in activated sludge was almost unchanged after the 30 d substrate deficiency except there was an 8 3 reduction in earg subtypes after c n p starvation the absolute abundances of eargs in the c n p c n and p starvation tests decreased from 842 2 mg g mlvss to 156 5 mg g mlvss 99 1 mg g mlvss 100 1 mg g mlvss and 497 4 mg g mlvss with percentage decreases of 81 4 88 2 88 1 and 40 9 respectively these results showed that c n p c and n starvation efficiently removed eargs additionally the relative abundances of eargs decreased from 216 0 rpkm to 182 6 rpkm a 15 4 decrease after c n p starvation whereas it increased by 9 0 28 0 and 12 1 after c n and p starvation respectively table 1 the decline in eargs abundance under c n p starvation was probably related to the reduction of biomass table s3 and edna fig s3 and the high degradation rate of eargs by dnase zou et al 2020 collectively c n p starvation effectively reduced the diversity and abundance of eargs providing a potential pathway to mitigate the risk of args in activated sludge regarding the predominate earg types the relative abundances of elfamycin resistance genes dual resistance genes and multidrug resistance mdr genes were reduced by 16 3 14 1 and 33 1 respectively after c n p starvation fig 1 a however the most abundant elfamycin resistance genes increased by 8 7 41 7 and 18 5 in the c n and p starvation tests respectively fig 1a indicating an aggregated load of specific eargs in activated sludge under single nutrient starvation similarly the relative abundances of dual resistance and mdr genes after the 30 d n starvation increased by 20 2 and 20 7 and their corresponding percentages reached 17 8 and 10 3 of the total relative abundance of eargs respectively fig 1a these results confirmed that dual resistance and mdr genes could be reduced by c n p starvation but they persisted or were even enriched in activated sludge when exposed to single substrate starvation especially n starvation because dual resistant and mdr bacteria can increase clinical treatment costs and patient mortality cosme et al 2017 pazda et al 2019 the proliferation of persistent dual resistance and mdr genes in activated sludge warrants further attention the majority 75 of earg subtypes showed a reduction in relative abundance after c n p starvation fig 1b in contrast single c n or p deficiency resulted in a consistent increase in the relative abundance of many earg subtypes such as ef tu rpsl and rpsj fig 1b in particular the relative abundance of ef tu the most abundant earg subtype belonging to the elfamycin args decreased by 16 3 after c n p starvation but it increased by 8 7 41 7 after the single substrate starvations fig 1b moreover the composition of ef tu also changed after 30 d of starvation fig 1c the relative percentage of ef tu encoding kirromycin resistance in e coli was reduced by 10 7 13 4 after c n p c and n starvation while the others increased by varying degrees e g the enterococcus faecium e faecium ef tu mutants conferring resistance to ge2270a increased by up to 77 5 ef tu is the predominant earg subtype in wwtps zheng et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 and has been shown to encode the most abundant protein for peptide elongation in bacteria cells prezioso et al 2017 in addition to ef tu the relative abundances of gyra and gyrb dual resistance or mdr genes markedly increased by 50 9 and 99 4 respectively after n starvation notably 65 earg subtypes co occurred in all starvation groups and the control group ck0 fig 1d these eargs accounted for 97 2 98 8 of the total relative abundance of each sample fig 1e implying a high stability of the core eargs composition 3 1 2 effects of environmental conditions the distribution of eargs in activated sludge under nutritional substrate starvation was studied in different environmental conditions alternating anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic environments these conditions represent the typical process parameters regarding the availability of electron acceptor oxygen or nitrate in wwtps and have been widely demonstrated to affect the fate of args in activated sludge christgen et al 2015 guo et al 2021 yuan et al 2016 in the present study starvation under the different environmental conditions did not markedly change the diversity of eargs table 1 however the absolute and relative abundances of eargs after starvation decreased by 80 1 86 0 and 1 8 19 3 respectively table 1 furthermore the absolute and relative abundances of eargs after aerobic starvation were much lower than those after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic starvation table 1 indicating that aerobic starvation may be more effective in removing eargs for the earg types the predominant elfamycin resistance dual resistance and mdr genes after starvation in all tested environmental conditions were reduced by 8 1 16 3 9 2 13 6 and 1 9 48 0 respectively fig 2 a in particular the relative abundance of mdr genes was reduced by up to 48 0 and 33 1 under aerobic and anaerobic aerobic starvation respectively however it was nearly unchanged after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 2a notably the relative abundances of aminoglycoside resistance genes after anaerobic aerobic and anoxic starvation were slightly increased by 7 8 and 8 0 respectively but they decreased by 11 3 after aerobic starvation fig 2a our findings show that high dissolved oxygen combined with low substrate availability may contribute to the elimination of high risk mdr and aminoglycoside resistance genes in activated sludge at the subtype level the abundance of the most abundant earg ef tu decreased by 8 1 20 6 and its composition also changed to varying degrees resulting from starvation under different environmental conditions fig 2b and c specifically the proportion of ef tu encoding kirromycin resistance in e coli decreased by 8 3 6 3 and 11 5 respectively after alternating anaerobic aerobic anoxic and aerobic starvation fig 2c the proportion of ef tu encoding ge2270a resistance in e faecium was two fold higher after aerobic starvation than after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 2c indicating that aerobic condition favored ge2270a resistance further analysis showed that 66 earg subtypes co occurred in all samples fig 2d which accounted for 98 2 99 0 of the total abundance in each starved sample fig 2e interestingly the relative abundances of the co occurring eargs such as ef tu rpsl and rpob in the aerobic group were lower than those of the control anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic groups fig 2b implying that aerobic starvation can better accelerate the elimination of eargs 3 2 mobility of eargs under starvation stress mges play an important role in the transfer of args among microorganisms forster et al 2022 the fate of mges in activated sludge is closely associated with the nutritional status and environmental variables yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 therefore the profiles of emges including integrons iss and plasmids under different types of substrate starvation and environmental conditions were examined 3 2 1 substrate specific starvation as presented in table 2 no obvious changes in emges diversity were observed in the c and n starved groups whereas c n p and p starvation decreased the total numbers of each type of emges by 16 7 29 3 and 8 9 19 4 respectively regarding emges abundance the 30 d c n p starvation reduced the total abundances of integrons iss and plasmids by 54 4 41 4 and 43 4 respectively table 2 suggesting that c n p starvation efficiently reduced the mobility of eargs under c starvation the total abundances of integrons and iss were reduced by 30 3 and 14 2 respectively and the total abundance of plasmids slightly increased by 3 3 table 2 conversely emges in the n and p starved groups were enriched by 23 8 83 6 and 67 4 109 6 respectively table 2 implying that a lack of n and p can promote eargs transfer these findings suggest that starvation may substantially alter the abundances of emges but not their diversity to further understand the specific impact of starvation on the composition of three types of emges in activated sludge the top 20 emges in the starved samples were visualized by a heatmap fig 3 c n p starvation resulted in a 97 1 81 8 and 86 4 decrease in the types of integrons iss and plasmids respectively similarly c starvation reduced the majority of emge types by 88 2 68 2 and 67 4 for integrons iss and plasmids respectively by contrast n and p deficiency enriched most types of integrons iss and plasmids the relative abundances of emges with a greater than two fold change accounted for 14 7 34 1 and 17 6 34 1 of the enriched ones after n and p starvation respectively notably all the enriched integrons except fm866927 c5700 belonged to inti1 fig 3 which was genetically co localized with sul1 in all starved samples fig 4 previous studies have reported that single n and p starvation increased the amount of p ppgpp brown 2019 resulting in the stable enrichment of inti1 spira and ospino 2020 inti1 has been identified as a vital transmitter of args in activated sludge zhou et al 2019 and is prevalent in human pathogenic bacteria ribeirinho soares et al 2022 these findings indicate that c n p and c starvation may serve as a potential tool to restrict eargs transfer whereas n and p starvation may aggravate the dissemination risk of eargs by enriching various emges 3 2 2 substrate starvation under different environmental conditions the different nutrient starvations under all tested environmental conditions especially in the anoxic environment decreased the numbers of integrons iss and plasmids in activated sludge table 2 starvation under the different environmental conditions also reduced the total abundances of integrons iss and plasmids by 44 2 60 5 17 2 46 1 and 32 9 43 4 respectively table 2 interestingly the total relative abundances of integrons and iss after aerobic starvation were lower than those after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic and anoxic starvation table 2 these results suggest that starvation especially aerobic starvation can mitigate the mobility of eargs by reducing the diversity and abundance of emges further analysis elucidated that anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation decreased the abundance of all 28 types of integrons sorted by the top 20 types in each group and most of the iss and plasmids with a relatively high initial abundances that is 3 rpkm and 0 3 rpkm for iss and plasmids respectively fig 5 a thus anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation achieved efficient emges removal the anaerobic and anoxic starvations resulted in a decrease in the relative abundances of most emges to varying degrees however these starvations also enriched a fraction of emges specifically regarding the relative abundances of integrons fj621588 c7009 inti1 was increased by 11 8 after anaerobic starvation while fj621588 c7007 inti1 fj384365 c6288 inti1 and dq914960 c7616 inti1 were increased by 10 7 13 9 and 12 7 respectively after anoxic starvation fig 5a furthermore the majority of the iss greater than 76 with an initial relative abundances of 3 rpkm were enriched by up to 95 9 after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig 5b additionally 41 7 and 75 0 of the plasmids with initial relative abundances of 0 3 rpkm were enriched under anaerobic and anoxic starvation respectively fig 5c these findings demonstrate that anaerobic and anoxic starvation had a strong screening effect on some integrons belonging to inti1 and low abundance iss or plasmids resulting in the persistent dissemination of eargs in activated sludge 3 3 bacterial hosts of eargs under starvation stress the bacterial community is one of the critical driving factors determining args fate danko et al 2021 forsberg et al 2014 therefore the bacterial hosts of eargs at genus level after starvation were determined by a combination of blastp alignment and lca based algorithm for the most abundant dominant mycobacterium the relative abundance increased by 53 1 and 77 3 respectively after c n p and c starvation but it dramatically decreased by 63 1 in the p starved group fig 6 a nevertheless the composition of mycobacterium carrying eargs changed little during starvation with the majority identified as vectors of rpob embb and gyra fig 6b as an important host of args in activated sludge luo et al 2022 sun et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 mycobacterium are recognized as important human pathogens koh et al 2011 that can cause serious pneumonia wei et al 2020 thus the enrichment of mycobacterium after c n p and c starvation deserves further attention regarding the hosts of the most abundant earg subtype e g ef tu the relative abundances markedly changed after starvation and also differed among the various substrate deficiency scenarios fig s4a these results indicate that starvation had a substantial influence on the abundance and composition of eargs hosts the variation of bacterial hosts of eargs in activated sludge was also assessed after starvation under the different environmental conditions we found that the host composition of eargs varied among the environmental conditions specifically the relative abundances of the dominant eargs host i e mycobacterium increased by 53 1 22 3 60 3 and 34 1 after anaerobic aerobic anaerobic anoxic and aerobic starvation respectively fig 7 a suggesting that anaerobic aerobic and anoxic starvation can endow a higher predominance of mycobacterium however the composition of eargs from mycobacterium was roughly stable under starvation in different environmental conditions fig 7b furthermore the other highly abundant hosts including steroidobacter lautropia and rubrivivax consistently decreased during anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation which led to the relative abundance of nitrospira increasing by 29 3 and 13 1 respectively fig 7a some hosts of the predominate ef tu were dramatically affected by the starvation conditions for instance the relative abundances of the most abundant ef tu hosts including steroidobacter rubrivivax and methylibium were decreased by 20 7 66 2 and 43 5 58 2 after anaerobic aerobic and aerobic starvation respectively and caldilinea increased by two and three times in these two conditions fig s4b additionally dechloromonas was almost eliminated after anaerobic and anoxic starvation fig s4b 4 discussion 4 1 c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation effectively removed eargs in activated sludge numerous studies using pure bacterial strains have reported that there is a close link between starvation responses and the development of antibiotic resistance table s1 although nutrient deficiency frequently occurs in wwtps its impacts on args fate especially for the previously neglected eargs in activated sludge are not well understood our results showed that nutrient specific starvation especially c n p starvation effectively reduced the abundances of eargs table 1 suggesting that starvation could be used to mitigate the risk of eargs in activated sludge this was probably because eargs in edna were degraded to serve as a nutrient source under c n p starvation previous studies have shown that the degraded edna can provide c n and p for many bacterial species including e coli and p aeruginosa in nutrient limited environments huang et al 2022 lewenza 2013 furthermore the environmental conditions i e the presence of the electron acceptors including oxygen and nitrate during starvation were found to affect the efficiency of eargs removal table 1 in particular compared with anaerobic starvation aerobic starvation led to a higher degree of eargs reduction table 1 possibly because of the higher degradation rate of eargs under aerobic starvation than under anaerobic starvation tang et al 2022 these observations have two possible explanations 1 the aerobic condition with oxygen as an electron acceptor could more significantly accelerate the endogenous metabolism of extracellular polymeric substances eps including eargs in sludge compared with the anaerobic condition without electron acceptors wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2022 2 sludge particles could have protected dnase active sites and arg target sites under anaerobic conditions thereby reducing the degradation rate of eargs but this protective effect did not occur under aerobic conditions zou et al 2020 4 2 a reduction in emges rather than changes in bacterial community facilitated the elimination of eargs under c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation previous studies have reported that the composition of args in activated sludge is generally driven by mges and the bacterial community structure liao et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 to discriminate the relative contribution of these driving mechanisms to eargs variation during starvation pls pm analyses were conducted based on the relative abundances of eargs emges and bacterial community composition the emges abundance strongly and directly impacted the eargs abundances whereas the bacterial community composition showed a slightly negative direct effect on eargs abundances fig 8 in fact the relative abundances of emges after starvation were significantly positively correlated with that of eargs figs 9 s5 and s6 likewise a previous study found that the changes of args abundance and inti1 abundance were highly correlated under starvation tang et al 2022 moreover multiple genetic co occurrences of emges and eargs e g sul1 inti1 tnas3 and mexd ps121 1a were observed in most of the starved samples figs 4 and s7 however the variation of eargs showed opposite trends when compared with some of their bacterial hosts during starvation for example after c n p starvation the relative abundance of the dominate ef tu decreased but the relative abundances of half of its hosts substantially increased figs 1b and s4a despite this the bacterial community may be indirectly linked with eargs through emges fig 8 in fact numerous studies have reported that under various selective pressures including nutrients heavy metal and antibiotic the variation of args was mainly determined by the changes of mges whereas the bacteria community may directly affect emges and thereby indirectly affecting eargs cui et al 2018 luo et al 2022 wu et al 2022 therefore we tentatively infer that emges rather than the bacterial community directly contributed to the variations in eargs under starvation our results show that the total abundance and diversity of emges in activated sludge were markedly reduced by c n p starvation i e without electron donor substrates table 2 this might be attributable to the higher adsorption and degradation rate of emges in edna after c n p starvation compared with other types of substrate deficiency tang et al 2022 alternatively the reduction of emges under c n p starvation may be associated with enhanced natural transformation of edna into bacterial cells johnston et al 2014 since args are commonly embedded in mges partridge et al 2018 and there is evidence of emge earg clusters figs 4 and s7 the efficient removal of emges under c n p starvation may be a powerful way to reduce the prevalence of eargs when considering the environmental conditions i e the presence of electron acceptors similar to the variations in eargs observed after starvation table 1 and fig 2 aerobic starvation was also more conducive to eliminating emges table 2 because emges and eargs are both specific dna elements within eps composites in activated sludge we doubt that similar mechanisms account for the decrease in emges and eargs as mediated by higher eps consumption and dnase activity under aerobic conditions collectively our findings confirm that nutrient deficiency under aerobic conditions favors the removal of emges which would be beneficial for controlling the propagation and spread of eargs in wwtps 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study using metagenomic sequencing technology to examine the effects of starvation stress on the distribution mobility and bacterial hosts of eargs in activated sludge our findings show that eargs in activated sludge can be reduced by applying multi substrate starvation whereas some high risk eargs dual resistance or mdr genes may be enriched by single substrate starvation this work led to the following key conclusions starvation in the absence of c n p substrates under aerobic conditions decreased the diversity and abundance of eargs providing a potential strategy to lower the risk of args in wwtps single n and p deficiency and anaerobic anoxic starvation enriched some emges which increased the transmission risk of eargs whereas c n p deficiency and aerobic starvation effectively reduced the emges abundance starvation altered the abundance and composition of bacterial hosts of eargs which varied with the specific nutrient deficiency and environmental conditions the superior eargs removal under aerobic c n p starvation was attributed to the efficient reduction in emges abundance rather than to changes in the bacterial community composition despite this the ability and mechanism of horizontal transfer of eargs in activated sludge require further study credit authorship contribution

14839,the suitability of a location for an on site wastewater treatment process for areas which lack access to centralised wastewater treatment systems requires an assessment of the permeability of the soil into which the effluent will be discharged in many jurisdictions this is determined using some type of in situ percolation test falling head percolation tests which give a value of percolation time pt that is empirically related to the notion of hydraulic conductivity are widely used as they are relatively simple to carry out but the test does not have a sound theoretical framework and test methods are not standardised internationally in comparison the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil obtained from a constant head well permeameter test is independent of test conditions and so is a more suitable metric for design a database of over 900 falling head tests carried out across a range of different subsoil types in ireland has been collated all with the inherent limitations of the existing regulative framework regarding the percolation test and soil texture assessment these tests were then modelled using hydrus 2 d numerical modelling simulations to determine equivalent field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs values and thereby provide a correlation with pt values across the range of subsoil conditions in addition falling head tests have been carried out in parallel to constant head permeameter tests in the field and compared against the relationship derived from the broad dataset of simulated results this revealed an optimal solution by which to determine kfs from the field permeameter test using parameters recommended for most structured soils from clays to loams the trendline based on irish data was also compared against more generic formulations of the relationship between pt and kfs and shown to match closely particularly the reynolds 2016 unified methodology finally the irish threshold pt limits for on site wastewater treatment have been converted to kfs values and compared against other international standards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords percolation tests falling head constant head hydrus

doi org 10 17632 bt66828vrh 1 1 introduction the infiltration capacity of soil needs to be determined in order to design effective engineered systems that rely on the percolation of water and or wastewater as a key part of the overall treatment process this includes solutions for on site wastewater treatment and storm water runoff systems used in sustainable urban drainage systems suds such treatment systems which are often passive in nature are increasingly seen as appropriate sustainable solutions charlesworth et al 2003 diaz elsayed et al 2017 and aim to attenuate both hydraulic and pollutant loads in order to protect surface and groundwater resources for on site wastewater treatment used in areas which lack access to centralised wastewater treatment systems in situ field methods are commonly used to assess the permeability of soil to determine whether a site is suitable the aim of on site wastewater design is to provide a soil treatment unit stu also known as a percolation area or drainfield which will achieve tertiary treatment of effluent with natural disinfection siegrist 2017 the key to an effective stu inherent in most countries design codes or standards for example epa 2021 is to maintain an unsaturated subsoil through which the effluent can percolate freely at low velocities thus maximising the time of travel between the source of contamination and any potential water source wherein chemical and microbiological contaminants will be attenuated to an acceptable level before they reach the groundwater gill et al 2007 1 1 movement of water in unsaturated soil the permeability of soil is often assessed using its saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat which is a soil property that quantifies the degree to which a soil can transmit water through its saturated pores there have been many attempts to predict ksat for different soil types according to properties such as porosity grain size distribution bulk density clay content etc see chapuis 2012 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity varies non linearly in unsaturated soils depending on the moisture content ochsner 2019 which makes prediction and measurement of water transport processes in unsaturated soils difficult selker et al 1999 movement of water in soil is determined largely by soil moisture content and physical soil characteristics such as texture or particle size distribution structure consistence and porosity tyler 2001 the matric potential or matric suction of soil describes the capillary and adsorptive forces which hold water in soil pore spaces and is the driving force behind water movement in unsaturated soils horrocks and valentine 1999 the magnitude of matric potential depends on the soil water content the size of the soil pores the surface properties of the soil particles and the surface tension of the soil water whalley et al 2013 soil water retention curves show the relationship between soil water content and matric potential fine textured soils characterised by small pores and large particle surface areas tend to hold and retain more water than coarser soils with larger pores and smaller particle surface areas due to their larger matric potential at a given moisture content usepa 1980 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils decreases as soil water content decreases but the decline is less rapid in fine textured soils compared to coarse textured soils again due to higher matric potential however under saturated conditions ksat is significantly higher in coarse textured soils compared to fine textured soils such as clay van genuchten and pachepsky 2011 1 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for stu design design loading for stus can be based on accurate assessments measurements of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the soil the long term design hydraulic loading rates for the interface where the effluent percolates into the soil are defined as a fraction of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the soil in order to maintain unsaturated conditions from which the size of the stu is then determined this design parameter is normally termed the long term acceptance rate ltar cen standards cen tr 12 566 2 the relationship between the clean water hydraulic conductivity and a sustainable long term wastewater infiltration rate i e the ltar used for design purposes is complex due to the nature and development of a diverse microbial biomat biozone at the interface where the effluent first meets the soil beal et al 2006 mckinley and siegrist 2011 in addition the level of treatment of the effluent primary or secondary treated infiltrating into the stu impacts the extent of biomat formation along the stu trenches knappe et al 2020 most national codes base the hydraulic design loading rate upon empirical experience in general this value usually should not exceed 5 to 10 of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity as determined by percolation tests carried out with clean water regardless of effluent quality or soil type siegrist 2017 as even very high quality effluents i e secondary or tertiary treated with bod concentrations 20 mg l and full nitrification can cause soil clogging and permeability loss if the design loading is too high van cuyk et al 2005 several different approaches can be taken to determine a soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity either by percolation tests carried out in the laboratory or in the field or via soil size distribution analysis soil size distributions as determined by sieve analyses in geotechnical laboratories are used to categorise soils by texture which are then used in some design standards in the us canada australia and new zealand to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity in some wastewater design standards soil texture can be determined in the field by various texture by feel hand tests one popular method is that presented by thien 1979 which takes site assessors through a flowchart of hand tests allowing soils to be categorised according to categories in the usda soil texture triangle usda 2017 however categorisation of soils by texture can be difficult to compare between jurisdictions which employ their own specific soil classification system e g australian and new zealand standard 2012 british standards 2015 usda 2017 etc these differences make direct comparison of estimated ksat and derivative design loadings difficult see table s 1 for some comparisons the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a subsoil can also be determined by a percolation test either where a sample of undisturbed soil is taken back to the laboratory for testing under controlled pressure head conditions or in situ in the field using a constant head test methodology the constant head well permeameter test is widely used internationally to measure the field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs reynolds and elrick 2002 reynolds 2016 amoozegar 2020 which is usually considered to be a unique soil hydraulic property independent of test conditions mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and which can be compared easily between jurisdictions other advantages include the ability to obtain accurate results for low permeability soils as well as quicker resolution of tests however soils of the same type in small area can exhibit great spatial variability due to inherent heterogeneity usepa 1980 in addition different test methodologies see later will lead to variation in results particularly with respect to achieving steady state flows in the field during the tests as well as differences in local conditions between when the tests are carried out such as water temperature pressure and the level of the water table nieÄ and spychaÅa 2014 reynolds 2016 saturated hydraulic conductivities measured on soil cores in laboratory tests ksat have been shown to be approximately 50 higher than saturated conductivities measured in the field kfs due to the presence of entrapped air bouwer 1966 hence kfs is considered a more realistic and appropriate measurement for many vadose zone applications elrick and reynolds 1986 bouwer 1978 a constant head well permeameter test involves boring a cylindrical hole to the required depth and then establishing and maintaining a constant depth of water in the hole the rate of water flow from the hole into the soil is measured frequently until it becomes approximately constant over several successive observations thereby reaching steady state amoozegar 2020 into the soil the kfs of the soil can then be determined using the constant water flow rate the radius of the well and the head of ponded water in the well with appropriate equations see section 2 5 there is no universal agreement amongst investigators on the most suitable equations or approach for calculating kfs analyses of permeameter data progressed from those based solely on saturated flow around the auger hole and the hydrostatic pressure contribution glover 1953 to analyses using the richards equation 1931 that include saturated unsaturated flow and hydrostatic pressure gravity and capillary contributions to flow elrick et al 1989 stephens et al 1987 philip 1985 reynolds et al 1985 stephens and neuman 1982 1 3 percolation times pt from falling head percolation tests for stu design while many jurisdictions use kfs determined from constant head permeameter tests as part of stu site assessment procedures falling head percolation tests first developed by ryon in 1926 winneberger 1974 are the traditional percolation tests used for on site wastewater treatment design and are still in widespread use for example in ireland the uk the us canada south africa south african national standard 2010 and india india national standard 1985 these tests involve excavating a hole to the depth of the proposed percolation area filling it with water and allowing it seep away refilling it and then recording the time it takes for the water level to drop 2 5 cm winneberger 1974 advantages of the falling head test include accumulated experience the simplicity of the test and the fact that it is a highly intuitive measurement which mimics some stu processes reynolds 2016 however the measured percolation time pt does not define soil permeability accurately at high values i e low soil hydraulic conductivity rates and pt values cannot be compared easily between jurisdictions due to the lack of method standardisation and the dependence of the results on test conditions such as the dimensions of the test hole the test water depth and the interval for taking readings usepa 1980 elrick and reynolds 1986 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 reynolds 2016 the use of two different percolation parameters kfs and pt values internationally for stu design makes comparison of standards problematic the aim of this research was to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the falling head percolation test which is the prescribed test in the irish code of practice for dwwts design epa 2021 across a range of different subsoil types in ireland and determine a direct relationship between the percolation time and saturated hydraulic conductivity from numerical modelling using the hydrus software this has then allowed the empirically defined thresholds used for on site wastewater soil treatment design as currently determined from falling head percolation tests i e pt values to be defined according to saturated hydraulic conductivities and then enabled comparison against other international standards used for the assessment of a site s suitability for on site wastewater treatment in addition a direct comparison between falling head and constant head field tests carried out in parallel in the field has been made at selected sites to assess whether the constant head permeameter test can be used as a more rigorous and reliable alternative percolation test 2 materials and methods 2 1 irish bedrock and superficial geology the subsoils tested using the in situ falling head percolation test were located across the republic of ireland and covered the variety of different geological conditions present in the country considering its relatively small size ireland is formed of a diverse bedrock geology comprised of precambrian schists and quartzites devonian sandstone carboniferous limestone granites and some smaller formations such as basalts the aquifers within the bedrock are dominated by secondary porosity and permeability robins and misstear 2000 bedrock aquifers in ireland are overlain to various extents by unconsolidated materials i e subsoils deposited under glacial periglacial and temperate conditions during the quaternary period with the glacial deposits being widespread and variable holland and sanders 2009 there are five main subsoil types identified across ireland including till sands and gravels lake deposits alluvium and peat till is the dominant subsoil deposit in ireland covering over 43 of the country area at surface and probably another 25 beneath peat or floodplain sediments kelly et al 2015 till can vary in thickness but is generally less than 20 m thick and with relatively low permeability subsoil permeability has been shown to vary greatly over short distances depending on subsoil textural properties as well as density compactness and preferential flow paths kelly et al 2015 despite this variation a general pattern exists and the geological survey of ireland have defined a map of regional subsoil permeability according to three broad classes of permeability termed high moderate and low most tills in ireland are considered to have a moderate or low permeability moderate permeability subsoils generally have less than 14 clay and generally comprise of silts and or sands in contrast low permeability subsoils have greater than 12 clay and therefore are defined by the textural class clay or silt clay in contrast high permeability sands and gravels tend to be sorted and have less than 7 fines kelly et al 2015 2 2 falling head percolation test field data in ireland an on site falling head percolation test is prescribed in the national legislation epa 2021 known nationally as the t test the percolation time pt value obtained from the test is then used to define long term acceptance rates for site design which have been developed empirically over several years in conjunction with results from evidence based field trials gill et al 2007 2009 o luanaigh et al 2012 a database of 920 falling head field test results were collated from site assessments associated with different projects carried out by the environmental engineering research group in trinity college dublin over an 18 year period for each percolation test the site assessment was carried out according to the epa 2021 methodology including the standard and or modified t test procedure outlined in the code of practice as follows three percolation test holes were dug adjacent to the proposed percolation area each 300 mm 300 mm 400 mm deep below the proposed invert level of the percolation pipe following the required pre soaking period whereby the hole was filled to 400 mm depth 24 h before the test the pt value in min 25 mm for each test hole was determined the next day by refilling the hole to 400 mm depth and then timing the water level drop from 300 to 200 mm for three consecutive drops subsoil characterisation was determined by means of a trial pit approximately 2 m deep or to the water table bedrock and soils were classified according to the bs 5930 methodology bs 2015 this system categorises soil into five main constituents gravel sand silt silt clay and clay using field based dilatancy toughness plasticity and cohesion tests set out in bs 5930 i e the thread test ribbon test and dilatancy test secondary descriptors were also added to the soil gravelly silty sandy and clayey in order to further describe the soil sample e g sandy clay or silty sand refer to table s1 in the supplemental information which shows the equivalence between the bs5930 and 12 usda soil texture classification systems the depth to the water table bedrock was recorded during test pit evaluation as well as different soil horizon depths the typical percolation time 25th to 75th percentile ranges for the four main bs 5930 soil types sand silt silt clay clay are shown in table 1 2 3 numerical modelling the finite element modelling software hydrus 2d was used to simulate the falling head percolation tests in the database hydrus 2d uses the mixed form of richards equation and has been used in many simulations related to on site wastewater treatment bradshaw et al 2013 west and brye 2019 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat values determined in the model can be considered to be equivalent to field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs values in these simulations to provide more confidence in the modelling given that particle size analyses were not carried out at most of these sites as well as to reduce the number of models required the data for the four main bs 5930 soil types sand silt silt clay clay was screened to only use those field results within the 25th to 75th percentile range for each soil type resulting in 388 test simulations hydrus 2d simulates variably saturated transient water content and volumetric flux using finite elements to determine an analytic solution to the richards equation Å¡imÅ¯nek et al 2007 in order to simulate a falling head percolation test the programme developer wrote a bespoke software code for a new well boundary condition whereby a seepage face boundary condition is specified at the boundary representing the well wall i e edge of test hole the software then evaluates the following mass balance equation to determine the position of the water level in the well using 1 Ï r w 2 d h w d t q i n t q p t where rw is the well radius and hw is the water level in the well qin is the water inflow into the well from the soil profile across the well wall or its screened part and qp is the pumping rate this leads to its finite difference discretization 2 Ï r 2 h w i 1 h w i Î´ t q i n q p where Î´t is the time step and h w i and h w i 1 are water levels in the well at the previous and current time steps parts of the boundary below and above the water level in the well are then assigned as the time variable pressure head dirichlet and seepage face boundary conditions respectively a no flux boundary condition was applied to the rest of the surfaces see supplemental fig s1 hydrus then calculates which part of the seepage face boundary is active with prescribed zero pressure head and which is inactive with prescribed zero flux the fluxes across these two parts of the boundary are then calculated and reported separately in order to simulate the position of the water level in the well percolation test hole hw an observation node was specified at the bottom of the well the simulation was first run for 24 h to mimic the pre soaking filling of the test hole starting at 400 mm deep as required in the field test as well as to initialise each model simulation after that period the modelling of each falling head t test then commenced the hydraulic model chosen for the simulations was van genuchten mualem van genuchten 1980 with no hysteresis default water retention curve parameters i e Î¸ r Î¸ s Î± n and l provided by hydrus for each soil type were used except for ks which was varied to achieve the best calibration result with the actual data this assumption that all soils with the same textural class have the same hydraulic parameters is a limitation of the modelling approach but did enable the very high number of tests representative of soils across ireland to be included which was deemed to be important to provide a balanced comparison across the range however to refine the soil texture parameters somewhat further a comparison between the bs 5930 and usda soil classification systems was carried out in order to choose the most appropriate model parameters see table s1 for each t test it was assumed that the soil profile contains only one layer in the percolating zone with no anisotropy a linear head pressure distribution with depth was applied to the observed profile as the initial condition see fig 1 supplemental fig s2 a to d shows examples of the different head pressure results for various soil textures at the end of the simulations fig 2 shows different hydrus 2d simulated head pressure versus time graphs for percolation tests across different subsoil textures for each field test the average time to drop from 400 mm to 300 mm and then down to 200 mm depth was available and in some cases a continuation of the drop down to 100 mm depth the water level drop simulations were calibrated to pass through these fixed points on the continuous water level time series as closely as possible by adjusting the ks values as shown in fig 2 the hydrus modelling of the falling head percolation tests was carried out in 2d using an axis of symmetry down through a hole of radius 150 mm as shown in fig 1 however on reflection it was unclear whether such a section would represent a square hole of 300 mm sides as intended to mimic the t test conditions or a circular hole of diameter 300 mm hence to assess this the t test was modelled in 3d using another bespoke code written by the hydrus developer as the well boundary condition was not yet generally available in the commercially available hydrus 3d package the 3d geometry of the t test hole compared to the 2d geometry is shown in the supplemental information fig s3 with the results from modelling different soil types a clay loam vs a loam in 2d vs 3d shown in fig s4 this compared two different 2d geometries against the 3d square hole as follows bottom width of 150 mm as used for modelling t tests 2d square in fig s4 bottom width of 184 3 mm to give equivalent base and side area to a square hole if circular 2d circ in fig s4 the results clearly show that the 3d simulations yielded almost identical results as the 2d simulation using the 150 mm bottom width whereas the 2d simulations with the 184 3 mm bottom width resulted in slower percolation rates thereby confirming the decision to simulate the 300 mm square hole t tests with an axis of symmetry down through a hole of radius 150 mm in hydrus 2d 2 4 constant head field permeameter tests in order to assess the complementarity between the falling head and constant head field tests parallel tests were carried out on a number of selected sites to compare the derived field saturated hydraulic conductivities the constant head tests were performed using the aardvark type permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp ca and the falling head tests followed the standard epa 2021 methodology outlined in section 2 2 the respective depths at which the parallel tests were carried out are shown on fig 3 for each test a 100 mm diameter hole was augured down to the required depth the aardvark permeameter module apm which maintains a fixed head of water h 92 mm above the base of the unit via a pressure regulator was carefully lowered into the hole to just rest on the base hanging from a tape measure from which the depth of the borehole is recorded the apm was connected to the reservoir via a tube and the valve opened the aardvark permeameter estimates field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs using the amount of supplied water determined using a depth drop d from the reservoir measured at equal time intervals see fig s5 which is equivalent to the amount of percolated water over time i e the soil water infiltration rate the measurement ends when the reservoir flow rate soil water infiltration rate does not change over several consecutive readings i e when the flow rate has reached steady state kfs was evaluated from the permeameter data using the reynolds 2008 solution formulated as follows reynolds et al 1985 used the matric flux potential Ï m defined by gardner 1958 to solve the richards equation for water flow through the saturated and unsaturated zones around the cylindrical test hole under a constant depth of water and presented the following reynolds 2008 expression for kfs from the constant head well permeameter test for soil at or below field capacity for determining based on this and previous work including elrick and reynolds 1986 1992 3 k f s c q 2 Ï h 2 c Ï r 2 2 Ï h Î± 1 where Î± is soil sorptive number for ponded infiltration and can be estimated from table 2 and c is a borehole shape function determined from 4 c h r z 1 z 2 h r z 3 reynolds 2008 zhang et al 1998 where z1 z2 and z3 are dimensionless empirical constants shown in table 2 eq 3 describes steady three dimensional flow and accounts for gravity capillarity and hydrostatic pressure effects in the borehole it should be noted that the sensitivity of kfs to the choice of Î± decreases as h increases errors due to incorrect selection of Î± are generally less than a factor of 2 and often less than 25 reynolds et al 1992 which reynolds 2008 deems to be of sufficient accuracy for many practical applications given the inherent variability of kfs it should be noted that in that interest of completeness kfs was also evaluated using the less physically approximate glover standard solution 1953 and the glover solution adjusted for gravity 1983 the results of which are reported in the supplemental information 2 5 relationship between percolation time pt and kfs many attempts have been made over the past number of decades to formulate a relationship between falling head percolation time pt and kfs including winneberger 1974 fritton et al 1986 radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 jabro 2009 and reynolds 2016 this study has used the radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and reynolds 2016 relationships as they are based on the mathematical descriptions of the test holes and so were deemed to be more applicable compared to the other studies which used field data sets to establish correlations 2 5 1 radcliffe and west 2000 relationship radcliffe and west 2000 used an alternative version of the elrick and reynolds 1992 relationship 5 q q Ï r 2 k f s 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 where q is the steady water flux per unit area Î»c is the macroscopic capillary length and g is a geometric factor that depends primarily on the ratio of h r and is given by 6 g 1 2 Ï a 1 a 2 h r a 3 h r 2 a 4 h r 3 bosch and west 1998 the values of the coefficients a1 a2 a3 a4 and Î»c depend on texture and structure and are shown in table 3 rearranging eq 5 gives 7 k f s q 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 the falling head percolation rate pt 1 q and so 8 k f s f 1 p t where 9 f 1 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 f is a dimensionless factor and is the ratio of kfs to 1 pt allowing a direct comparison when converting pt to kfs an average ponding depth over the time interval for the falling head test should be used 2 5 2 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 relationship mulqueen and rodgers 2001 used an expression by elrick and reynolds 1986 for the rate of fall of a water surface in a cylindrical percolation test hole which allows for gradients due to pressure head and gravitational and matric potentials as follows 10 d t r 2 c d h 2 k f s h 2 2 h Ï m r 2 k f s c where dt is the percolation time c is a borehole shape function 11 c sinh 1 h r r 2 h 2 1 1 2 r h Ïm the matric flux potential 12 Ï m Ï i 0 k Ï d Ï Ï 0 where k Ï is the matric potential dependant unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and Ïi is the initial matric potential this relationship was applied to the falling head t test as used in the irish epa code of practice 2021 by transforming the plan area of the square test hole to an equivalent cylindrical hole area giving the following 13 k f s 4 2 p t where pt is in min 25 mm and kfs is in md 1 at high and low values of kfs the relationship between kfs and pt is asymptotic 2 5 3 reynolds 2016 relationship using a similar approach to radcliffe and west 2000 reynolds 2016 developed a unified analysis for falling head percolation tests and constant head well permeameter chwp tests see also reynolds et al 2015 kfs is determined for the chwp test using eq 6 with both tests using a cylindrical borehole and both undergoing an initial pre soaking period this allows the steady flow chwp relationship to be converted to a transient flow falling head percolation test relationship using 14 q Ï r

when the soil is at field capacity or drier i e Ïi 1 m reynolds et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrus 2d modelling results the field saturated hydraulic conductivities determined from the hydrus 2d model simulations of falling head test data across a full range of irish soil textures is shown in fig 4 a from this the generic relationship between percolation time pt and kfs value as used in the modelling was derived by comparing best fit relationships between linear exponential logarithmic power and polynomial functions with the power function showing the optimal fit with an r2 value of 0 933 and relative bias of 1 63 see fig 4b formulated by 18 k f s 3015 p t 0 98 these data also reveal how few t tests are completed in low permeability soils for values of pt 90 min 25 mm which is partly due to the length of time that such tests take but also due to the fact that pt 90 min 25 mm has been the threshold cut off for suitability for on site wastewater treatment in the national code of practice over the last 10 years 3 2 parallel falling head and constant head permeameter field tests the results from the 17 parallel falling head tests and constant head permeameter tests are summarised in table s2 which compares hydraulic conductivities derived according to different mathematical solutions some percolation tests were inconclusive from the perspective of gaining pt values as they had very low percolation rates and too small reductions in water level over the course of a full day to complete the test but kfs values were obtained in all cases from the constant head permeameter method fig 5 compares the kfs results from the constant head permeameter tests solved using the reynolds 2008 solution using parameters recommended for fine clayey soils most structured soils from clays to loams and coarse and gravelly soils i e Î± 4 12 and 36 m 1 see table 2 against the corresponding pt values from parallel t tests and the hydrus 2d best fit trendline across the irish dataset for the more coarse grained higher permeability soils pt values 10 min 25 mm the reynolds 2008 solution using parameters recommended for coarse and gravelly sands i e Î± 36 m 1 are seen to fit the hydrus trendline the best the reynolds 2008 solution for fine textured clayey and unstructured soils i e Î± 4 m 1 consistently yields lower resultant kfs values in comparison to the hydrus derived trendline for irish data even for the lower hydraulic conductivity soils hence while the numbers of data points are limited the field data solved with reynolds 2008 using recommended parameters for most structured soils from clays to loams as well as unstructured medium and fine sands i e Î± 12 m 1 appears to agree well with the hydrus 2d trendline ideally more parallel tests are needed between the pt value range of 90 to 120 but such sites are hard to find in ireland as this refers to an extremely narrow range of saturated hydraulic conductivities kfs between 2 8 and 3 6 cm d 1 limitations of the correlation produced using the hydrus simulated dataset include the accuracy of converting between usda soil texture classifications used in hydrus software and bs 5930 soil texture categories and the difficulty in carrying out parallel falling head and constant head field tests across the full range of soil textures and permeabilities within the context of irish legislative design thresholds for on site wastewater treatment it should be noted that the glover 1953 and the glover solution adjusted for gravity reynolds et al 1983 were also compared as seen on fig s6 but found to give higher values of kfs when compared to the reynolds 2008 solutions using Î± 4 and 12 m 1 this is in agreement with the findings of amoozegar 2020 archer et al 2014 reynolds 2008 and jabro and evans 2006 for medium to fine textured soils i e soils where capillarity is most important whilst the glover solution can provide good estimates of kfs under particular soil conditions where the hydrostatic pressure effect dominates and capillary effects are minimal such as in very wet or coarse textured soils amoozegar et al 2020 archer et al 2014 theron et al 2010 jabro and evans 2006 radcliffe and west 2000 elrick and reynolds 1992 it may underestimate or overestimate kfs in some circumstances due to the assumption of saturated flow around the test hole which is rarely achieved in practice reynolds 2013 reynolds and elrick 2002 stephens and neuman 1982 the solution presented by reynolds 2008 based on the richards equation accounts for gravity hydrostatic pressure and capillary effects but it is more complicated to apply than the glover solution requiring the estimation of soil parameters such as Î± 3 3 assessment of pt kfs formulations the generalised pt kfs models which were chosen for comparison radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and reynolds 2016 were not produced from field test data but based on mathematical descriptions of test conditions measured pt values from falling head tests were converted to equivalent kfs values using the applicable correlation equations eqs 5 17 outlined previously the pt value kfs data points have been compared against the hydrus 2d model trendline for the irish soil dataset fig 6 which shows that the reynolds 2016 correlation was found to fit the irish model trendline particularly well while the mulqueen and rodgers and radcliffe and west equations gave slightly higher estimates for kfs from the field test results reciprocally measured kfs values from constant head permeameter tests solved using the reynolds 2008 equations were converted to equivalent pt values and these kfs pt data points and compared against the hydrus 2d model trendline fig 7 a b this shows that the hydrus 2d trendline for the irish dataset was found to lie between the three models albeit that the radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 converted pt values followed the trendline more closely than the reynolds 2016 using the Î± and z constants recommended for most structured soils from clays to loams i e Î± 12 m 1 see table 2 the reynolds 2016 derived points make a much closer fit if the Î± parameter is changed to 24 m 1 fig 7c pushing the soil category more towards coarse and gravelly sands including some highly structured soils with large cracks and or macropores this may be reflective of the predominant glacially derived heterogenous subsoils prevalent in ireland this comparison also helps to investigate how generalizable the relationship might be beyond the specific geographic test locations for the irish soil data the similarity in the results of these comparisons gives a high degree of confidence in the hydrus model trendline as a reasonable means to convert between pt value and kfs in irish soils particularly given the variability expected in kfs and pt value field test results some gaps are evident in the dataset across the range of hydraulic conductivities but this method of validation allows the kfs measurements in the lower permeability range to be included beyond the 120 min 25 mm threshold it should be noted that the graphs of pt value converted to kfs are smooth due to the fact that falling head test hole dimensions and average ponding heights used in calculations did not vary between tests in comparison curves showing kfs converted to pt value using reynolds 2016 and radcliffe and west 2000 are less smooth due to small differences in test hole radii between various tests radii ranged from 5 25 to 6 cm however the difference in dimensions for the constant head test holes used in these cases was found to have little impact on the conversion equation results as the ratios of infiltration area to infiltration volume were similar 3 4 comparison with international soil texture kfs ranges as highlighted in section 1 comparison of pt values across jurisdictions can be problematic due to the wide ranging methodologies used for the falling head percolation test such as different test hole dimensions different initial ponding heights etc which directly impact pt value results in order to make an international comparison of the irish pt test methodology the indicative pt values for each bs 5930 subsoil texture class were converted to kfs values using the hydrus 2d model trendline kfs 3015 pt 0 98 these kfs ranges were then compared to those provided in selected international design standards as shown in table 4 this comparison required soil texture categories from different soil classification systems to be converted to bs 5930 classifications which is complicated by differences in particle size limits for soil constituents and the fact that some international soil texture groupings include more than one bs 5930 category in addition many standards also classify soils according to structure and consistence e g australia new zealand british columbia which are not considered in the irish code of practice epa 2021 the kfs ranges for bs 5930 soils as adapted from the international standards can therefore only act as rough guidelines table s 3 in the supplemental information shows some examples of equating international soil categories with bs 5930 classifications in the sand and gravel range estimates from the hydrus model trendline tend to be lower than those from other standards which may be due to differences in soil classification systems for example many lower permeability soil groupings in international standards such as the clay loam sandy clay loam silty clay loam grouping shown in table s3 include the bs 5930 classification of sand low hydraulic conductivity within the bs 5930 sand classification is possible particularly where fine particles are present up to 34 fine particles clay silt can be present in sand as well as finer sand particles from 0 06 mm in fact using the bulk descriptors sand silt or gravel to help classify the permeability of soils may be of very limited use macdonald et al 2012 fogg et al 1998 and more attention should be given to the presence of silt or clay as permeability is strongly related to the finest soil fraction macdonald et al 2012 the lower permeability soils are of particular importance in the irish context i e below approximately 10 cm d 1 in this range the indicative values provided by the trendline are comparable to those in the international standards the kfs ranges were also compared to pedotransfer function estimates presented in the literature by bormann 2010 and saxton and rawls 2006 bormann 2010 developed a soil triangle outlining ranges for various soil hydrological parameters including ksat see fig s7 the ksat ranges presented in the triangle are in line with those predicted by the hydrus modelling derived trendline as well as the international ranges indicated in table 4 for example in the bormann triangle clay according to bs 5930 clay 35 has ksat 10 cm d 1 silt silt 35 has ksat 10 cm d 1 and sand silt and clay 35 has ksat approximately 50 100 cm d 1 these are in line with the saxton and rawls 2006 predicted saturated hydraulic conductivities for the usda soil textural classes as outlined in table 5 in which the equivalent bs 5930 soil texture categories have been added these kfs ranges are similar to those predicted by the hydrus model trendline from estimated pt values for the silt silt clay and clay categories for sandy loam at the lower limit of sand content required for sand under bs 5930 i e 65 sand the estimated ksat is 120 7 cm d 1 compared to approximately 78 cm d 1 predicted by the hydrus model for the upper limit of sand pt value estimate 3 5 kfs design thresholds for the irish context finally table 6 shows the kfs values calculated using the hydrus modelling derived trendline using the current pt value thresholds specified in the irish code of practice epa 2021 used for dwwts site assessment and design to provide more context to the important ranges particularly at the lower hydraulic conductivity end of the scale as discussed in section 3 2 these kfs values can be confidently determined in the field using a constant head permeameter test with the reynolds 2008 equation mulqueen and rodgers 2001 estimated that the kfs range for soils suitable for a septic tank absorption system in ireland could be in the range 8 to 200 cmd 1 which is close to the range suggested by the model for the lower hydraulic conductivity threshold the definition of these threshold values in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity also now enables direct comparison of the irish legislation used for on site wastewater soil treatment design against other international standards 4 conclusions hydrus 2d modelling based upon a database of over 900 falling head percolation tests carried out across a wide range of soil types in ireland was used to develop a correlation between kfs and percolation time as determined using the ireland s legislative falling head percolation test used for site assessment for on site wastewater treatment the best fit trendline for the hydrus 2d simulations was found to fit with parallel falling head and constant head permeameter test results to a large degree when kfs was solved using reynolds 2008 solution with parameter values i e Î± z1 z2 z3 recommended for most soils Î± 12 m 1 etc when comparing the model trendline to other pt kfs correlations it was found to fall within similar ranges in addition kfs ranges predicted by the model based on pt values for bs 5930 soil categories are within international ranges for low permeability soils silt clay silt clay but the model tends to predict lower kfs for sands and gravels this discrepancy may be due to differences in soil classification systems particularly the inclusion of sand as defined by bs 5930 in some lower permeability groupings internationally the modelling process illuminated the fact that the broad categories of the bs 5930 soil texture classification system particularly gravel sand and silt may be of limited use in terms of predicting kfs as can be seen in comparisons with other soil classification systems international groupings of similar soils in terms of hydraulic conductivity values can include all bs 5930 soil texture categories in some cases the choice of solution for kfs is particularly important in the lower hydraulic conductivity range which is generally of most concern for site assessment in ireland however and the reynolds 2008 parameter values i e Î± z1 z2 z3 recommended for most soils appears to agree best with model predictions in addition the kfs ranges predicted by the hydrus model trendline are in good agreement with those estimated by applying ptfs across the range of soil textures bormann 2010 saxton and rawls 2006 given the range of comparisons conducted on the pt kfs correlation produced from hydrus modelling it was concluded that the trendline can be confidently used to provide comparisons between pt values and kfs particularly for low permeability soils in the irish context thus facilitating the introduction of the constant head test for low permeability soils whereby constant head test results can be easily converted to a percolation time pt value allowing comparison with the existing design thresholds credit authorship

14839,the suitability of a location for an on site wastewater treatment process for areas which lack access to centralised wastewater treatment systems requires an assessment of the permeability of the soil into which the effluent will be discharged in many jurisdictions this is determined using some type of in situ percolation test falling head percolation tests which give a value of percolation time pt that is empirically related to the notion of hydraulic conductivity are widely used as they are relatively simple to carry out but the test does not have a sound theoretical framework and test methods are not standardised internationally in comparison the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil obtained from a constant head well permeameter test is independent of test conditions and so is a more suitable metric for design a database of over 900 falling head tests carried out across a range of different subsoil types in ireland has been collated all with the inherent limitations of the existing regulative framework regarding the percolation test and soil texture assessment these tests were then modelled using hydrus 2 d numerical modelling simulations to determine equivalent field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs values and thereby provide a correlation with pt values across the range of subsoil conditions in addition falling head tests have been carried out in parallel to constant head permeameter tests in the field and compared against the relationship derived from the broad dataset of simulated results this revealed an optimal solution by which to determine kfs from the field permeameter test using parameters recommended for most structured soils from clays to loams the trendline based on irish data was also compared against more generic formulations of the relationship between pt and kfs and shown to match closely particularly the reynolds 2016 unified methodology finally the irish threshold pt limits for on site wastewater treatment have been converted to kfs values and compared against other international standards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords percolation tests falling head constant head hydrus

doi org 10 17632 bt66828vrh 1 1 introduction the infiltration capacity of soil needs to be determined in order to design effective engineered systems that rely on the percolation of water and or wastewater as a key part of the overall treatment process this includes solutions for on site wastewater treatment and storm water runoff systems used in sustainable urban drainage systems suds such treatment systems which are often passive in nature are increasingly seen as appropriate sustainable solutions charlesworth et al 2003 diaz elsayed et al 2017 and aim to attenuate both hydraulic and pollutant loads in order to protect surface and groundwater resources for on site wastewater treatment used in areas which lack access to centralised wastewater treatment systems in situ field methods are commonly used to assess the permeability of soil to determine whether a site is suitable the aim of on site wastewater design is to provide a soil treatment unit stu also known as a percolation area or drainfield which will achieve tertiary treatment of effluent with natural disinfection siegrist 2017 the key to an effective stu inherent in most countries design codes or standards for example epa 2021 is to maintain an unsaturated subsoil through which the effluent can percolate freely at low velocities thus maximising the time of travel between the source of contamination and any potential water source wherein chemical and microbiological contaminants will be attenuated to an acceptable level before they reach the groundwater gill et al 2007 1 1 movement of water in unsaturated soil the permeability of soil is often assessed using its saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat which is a soil property that quantifies the degree to which a soil can transmit water through its saturated pores there have been many attempts to predict ksat for different soil types according to properties such as porosity grain size distribution bulk density clay content etc see chapuis 2012 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity varies non linearly in unsaturated soils depending on the moisture content ochsner 2019 which makes prediction and measurement of water transport processes in unsaturated soils difficult selker et al 1999 movement of water in soil is determined largely by soil moisture content and physical soil characteristics such as texture or particle size distribution structure consistence and porosity tyler 2001 the matric potential or matric suction of soil describes the capillary and adsorptive forces which hold water in soil pore spaces and is the driving force behind water movement in unsaturated soils horrocks and valentine 1999 the magnitude of matric potential depends on the soil water content the size of the soil pores the surface properties of the soil particles and the surface tension of the soil water whalley et al 2013 soil water retention curves show the relationship between soil water content and matric potential fine textured soils characterised by small pores and large particle surface areas tend to hold and retain more water than coarser soils with larger pores and smaller particle surface areas due to their larger matric potential at a given moisture content usepa 1980 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils decreases as soil water content decreases but the decline is less rapid in fine textured soils compared to coarse textured soils again due to higher matric potential however under saturated conditions ksat is significantly higher in coarse textured soils compared to fine textured soils such as clay van genuchten and pachepsky 2011 1 2 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for stu design design loading for stus can be based on accurate assessments measurements of the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the soil the long term design hydraulic loading rates for the interface where the effluent percolates into the soil are defined as a fraction of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the soil in order to maintain unsaturated conditions from which the size of the stu is then determined this design parameter is normally termed the long term acceptance rate ltar cen standards cen tr 12 566 2 the relationship between the clean water hydraulic conductivity and a sustainable long term wastewater infiltration rate i e the ltar used for design purposes is complex due to the nature and development of a diverse microbial biomat biozone at the interface where the effluent first meets the soil beal et al 2006 mckinley and siegrist 2011 in addition the level of treatment of the effluent primary or secondary treated infiltrating into the stu impacts the extent of biomat formation along the stu trenches knappe et al 2020 most national codes base the hydraulic design loading rate upon empirical experience in general this value usually should not exceed 5 to 10 of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity as determined by percolation tests carried out with clean water regardless of effluent quality or soil type siegrist 2017 as even very high quality effluents i e secondary or tertiary treated with bod concentrations 20 mg l and full nitrification can cause soil clogging and permeability loss if the design loading is too high van cuyk et al 2005 several different approaches can be taken to determine a soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity either by percolation tests carried out in the laboratory or in the field or via soil size distribution analysis soil size distributions as determined by sieve analyses in geotechnical laboratories are used to categorise soils by texture which are then used in some design standards in the us canada australia and new zealand to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity in some wastewater design standards soil texture can be determined in the field by various texture by feel hand tests one popular method is that presented by thien 1979 which takes site assessors through a flowchart of hand tests allowing soils to be categorised according to categories in the usda soil texture triangle usda 2017 however categorisation of soils by texture can be difficult to compare between jurisdictions which employ their own specific soil classification system e g australian and new zealand standard 2012 british standards 2015 usda 2017 etc these differences make direct comparison of estimated ksat and derivative design loadings difficult see table s 1 for some comparisons the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a subsoil can also be determined by a percolation test either where a sample of undisturbed soil is taken back to the laboratory for testing under controlled pressure head conditions or in situ in the field using a constant head test methodology the constant head well permeameter test is widely used internationally to measure the field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs reynolds and elrick 2002 reynolds 2016 amoozegar 2020 which is usually considered to be a unique soil hydraulic property independent of test conditions mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and which can be compared easily between jurisdictions other advantages include the ability to obtain accurate results for low permeability soils as well as quicker resolution of tests however soils of the same type in small area can exhibit great spatial variability due to inherent heterogeneity usepa 1980 in addition different test methodologies see later will lead to variation in results particularly with respect to achieving steady state flows in the field during the tests as well as differences in local conditions between when the tests are carried out such as water temperature pressure and the level of the water table nieÄ and spychaÅa 2014 reynolds 2016 saturated hydraulic conductivities measured on soil cores in laboratory tests ksat have been shown to be approximately 50 higher than saturated conductivities measured in the field kfs due to the presence of entrapped air bouwer 1966 hence kfs is considered a more realistic and appropriate measurement for many vadose zone applications elrick and reynolds 1986 bouwer 1978 a constant head well permeameter test involves boring a cylindrical hole to the required depth and then establishing and maintaining a constant depth of water in the hole the rate of water flow from the hole into the soil is measured frequently until it becomes approximately constant over several successive observations thereby reaching steady state amoozegar 2020 into the soil the kfs of the soil can then be determined using the constant water flow rate the radius of the well and the head of ponded water in the well with appropriate equations see section 2 5 there is no universal agreement amongst investigators on the most suitable equations or approach for calculating kfs analyses of permeameter data progressed from those based solely on saturated flow around the auger hole and the hydrostatic pressure contribution glover 1953 to analyses using the richards equation 1931 that include saturated unsaturated flow and hydrostatic pressure gravity and capillary contributions to flow elrick et al 1989 stephens et al 1987 philip 1985 reynolds et al 1985 stephens and neuman 1982 1 3 percolation times pt from falling head percolation tests for stu design while many jurisdictions use kfs determined from constant head permeameter tests as part of stu site assessment procedures falling head percolation tests first developed by ryon in 1926 winneberger 1974 are the traditional percolation tests used for on site wastewater treatment design and are still in widespread use for example in ireland the uk the us canada south africa south african national standard 2010 and india india national standard 1985 these tests involve excavating a hole to the depth of the proposed percolation area filling it with water and allowing it seep away refilling it and then recording the time it takes for the water level to drop 2 5 cm winneberger 1974 advantages of the falling head test include accumulated experience the simplicity of the test and the fact that it is a highly intuitive measurement which mimics some stu processes reynolds 2016 however the measured percolation time pt does not define soil permeability accurately at high values i e low soil hydraulic conductivity rates and pt values cannot be compared easily between jurisdictions due to the lack of method standardisation and the dependence of the results on test conditions such as the dimensions of the test hole the test water depth and the interval for taking readings usepa 1980 elrick and reynolds 1986 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 reynolds 2016 the use of two different percolation parameters kfs and pt values internationally for stu design makes comparison of standards problematic the aim of this research was to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the falling head percolation test which is the prescribed test in the irish code of practice for dwwts design epa 2021 across a range of different subsoil types in ireland and determine a direct relationship between the percolation time and saturated hydraulic conductivity from numerical modelling using the hydrus software this has then allowed the empirically defined thresholds used for on site wastewater soil treatment design as currently determined from falling head percolation tests i e pt values to be defined according to saturated hydraulic conductivities and then enabled comparison against other international standards used for the assessment of a site s suitability for on site wastewater treatment in addition a direct comparison between falling head and constant head field tests carried out in parallel in the field has been made at selected sites to assess whether the constant head permeameter test can be used as a more rigorous and reliable alternative percolation test 2 materials and methods 2 1 irish bedrock and superficial geology the subsoils tested using the in situ falling head percolation test were located across the republic of ireland and covered the variety of different geological conditions present in the country considering its relatively small size ireland is formed of a diverse bedrock geology comprised of precambrian schists and quartzites devonian sandstone carboniferous limestone granites and some smaller formations such as basalts the aquifers within the bedrock are dominated by secondary porosity and permeability robins and misstear 2000 bedrock aquifers in ireland are overlain to various extents by unconsolidated materials i e subsoils deposited under glacial periglacial and temperate conditions during the quaternary period with the glacial deposits being widespread and variable holland and sanders 2009 there are five main subsoil types identified across ireland including till sands and gravels lake deposits alluvium and peat till is the dominant subsoil deposit in ireland covering over 43 of the country area at surface and probably another 25 beneath peat or floodplain sediments kelly et al 2015 till can vary in thickness but is generally less than 20 m thick and with relatively low permeability subsoil permeability has been shown to vary greatly over short distances depending on subsoil textural properties as well as density compactness and preferential flow paths kelly et al 2015 despite this variation a general pattern exists and the geological survey of ireland have defined a map of regional subsoil permeability according to three broad classes of permeability termed high moderate and low most tills in ireland are considered to have a moderate or low permeability moderate permeability subsoils generally have less than 14 clay and generally comprise of silts and or sands in contrast low permeability subsoils have greater than 12 clay and therefore are defined by the textural class clay or silt clay in contrast high permeability sands and gravels tend to be sorted and have less than 7 fines kelly et al 2015 2 2 falling head percolation test field data in ireland an on site falling head percolation test is prescribed in the national legislation epa 2021 known nationally as the t test the percolation time pt value obtained from the test is then used to define long term acceptance rates for site design which have been developed empirically over several years in conjunction with results from evidence based field trials gill et al 2007 2009 o luanaigh et al 2012 a database of 920 falling head field test results were collated from site assessments associated with different projects carried out by the environmental engineering research group in trinity college dublin over an 18 year period for each percolation test the site assessment was carried out according to the epa 2021 methodology including the standard and or modified t test procedure outlined in the code of practice as follows three percolation test holes were dug adjacent to the proposed percolation area each 300 mm 300 mm 400 mm deep below the proposed invert level of the percolation pipe following the required pre soaking period whereby the hole was filled to 400 mm depth 24 h before the test the pt value in min 25 mm for each test hole was determined the next day by refilling the hole to 400 mm depth and then timing the water level drop from 300 to 200 mm for three consecutive drops subsoil characterisation was determined by means of a trial pit approximately 2 m deep or to the water table bedrock and soils were classified according to the bs 5930 methodology bs 2015 this system categorises soil into five main constituents gravel sand silt silt clay and clay using field based dilatancy toughness plasticity and cohesion tests set out in bs 5930 i e the thread test ribbon test and dilatancy test secondary descriptors were also added to the soil gravelly silty sandy and clayey in order to further describe the soil sample e g sandy clay or silty sand refer to table s1 in the supplemental information which shows the equivalence between the bs5930 and 12 usda soil texture classification systems the depth to the water table bedrock was recorded during test pit evaluation as well as different soil horizon depths the typical percolation time 25th to 75th percentile ranges for the four main bs 5930 soil types sand silt silt clay clay are shown in table 1 2 3 numerical modelling the finite element modelling software hydrus 2d was used to simulate the falling head percolation tests in the database hydrus 2d uses the mixed form of richards equation and has been used in many simulations related to on site wastewater treatment bradshaw et al 2013 west and brye 2019 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat values determined in the model can be considered to be equivalent to field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs values in these simulations to provide more confidence in the modelling given that particle size analyses were not carried out at most of these sites as well as to reduce the number of models required the data for the four main bs 5930 soil types sand silt silt clay clay was screened to only use those field results within the 25th to 75th percentile range for each soil type resulting in 388 test simulations hydrus 2d simulates variably saturated transient water content and volumetric flux using finite elements to determine an analytic solution to the richards equation Å¡imÅ¯nek et al 2007 in order to simulate a falling head percolation test the programme developer wrote a bespoke software code for a new well boundary condition whereby a seepage face boundary condition is specified at the boundary representing the well wall i e edge of test hole the software then evaluates the following mass balance equation to determine the position of the water level in the well using 1 Ï r w 2 d h w d t q i n t q p t where rw is the well radius and hw is the water level in the well qin is the water inflow into the well from the soil profile across the well wall or its screened part and qp is the pumping rate this leads to its finite difference discretization 2 Ï r 2 h w i 1 h w i Î´ t q i n q p where Î´t is the time step and h w i and h w i 1 are water levels in the well at the previous and current time steps parts of the boundary below and above the water level in the well are then assigned as the time variable pressure head dirichlet and seepage face boundary conditions respectively a no flux boundary condition was applied to the rest of the surfaces see supplemental fig s1 hydrus then calculates which part of the seepage face boundary is active with prescribed zero pressure head and which is inactive with prescribed zero flux the fluxes across these two parts of the boundary are then calculated and reported separately in order to simulate the position of the water level in the well percolation test hole hw an observation node was specified at the bottom of the well the simulation was first run for 24 h to mimic the pre soaking filling of the test hole starting at 400 mm deep as required in the field test as well as to initialise each model simulation after that period the modelling of each falling head t test then commenced the hydraulic model chosen for the simulations was van genuchten mualem van genuchten 1980 with no hysteresis default water retention curve parameters i e Î¸ r Î¸ s Î± n and l provided by hydrus for each soil type were used except for ks which was varied to achieve the best calibration result with the actual data this assumption that all soils with the same textural class have the same hydraulic parameters is a limitation of the modelling approach but did enable the very high number of tests representative of soils across ireland to be included which was deemed to be important to provide a balanced comparison across the range however to refine the soil texture parameters somewhat further a comparison between the bs 5930 and usda soil classification systems was carried out in order to choose the most appropriate model parameters see table s1 for each t test it was assumed that the soil profile contains only one layer in the percolating zone with no anisotropy a linear head pressure distribution with depth was applied to the observed profile as the initial condition see fig 1 supplemental fig s2 a to d shows examples of the different head pressure results for various soil textures at the end of the simulations fig 2 shows different hydrus 2d simulated head pressure versus time graphs for percolation tests across different subsoil textures for each field test the average time to drop from 400 mm to 300 mm and then down to 200 mm depth was available and in some cases a continuation of the drop down to 100 mm depth the water level drop simulations were calibrated to pass through these fixed points on the continuous water level time series as closely as possible by adjusting the ks values as shown in fig 2 the hydrus modelling of the falling head percolation tests was carried out in 2d using an axis of symmetry down through a hole of radius 150 mm as shown in fig 1 however on reflection it was unclear whether such a section would represent a square hole of 300 mm sides as intended to mimic the t test conditions or a circular hole of diameter 300 mm hence to assess this the t test was modelled in 3d using another bespoke code written by the hydrus developer as the well boundary condition was not yet generally available in the commercially available hydrus 3d package the 3d geometry of the t test hole compared to the 2d geometry is shown in the supplemental information fig s3 with the results from modelling different soil types a clay loam vs a loam in 2d vs 3d shown in fig s4 this compared two different 2d geometries against the 3d square hole as follows bottom width of 150 mm as used for modelling t tests 2d square in fig s4 bottom width of 184 3 mm to give equivalent base and side area to a square hole if circular 2d circ in fig s4 the results clearly show that the 3d simulations yielded almost identical results as the 2d simulation using the 150 mm bottom width whereas the 2d simulations with the 184 3 mm bottom width resulted in slower percolation rates thereby confirming the decision to simulate the 300 mm square hole t tests with an axis of symmetry down through a hole of radius 150 mm in hydrus 2d 2 4 constant head field permeameter tests in order to assess the complementarity between the falling head and constant head field tests parallel tests were carried out on a number of selected sites to compare the derived field saturated hydraulic conductivities the constant head tests were performed using the aardvark type permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp ca and the falling head tests followed the standard epa 2021 methodology outlined in section 2 2 the respective depths at which the parallel tests were carried out are shown on fig 3 for each test a 100 mm diameter hole was augured down to the required depth the aardvark permeameter module apm which maintains a fixed head of water h 92 mm above the base of the unit via a pressure regulator was carefully lowered into the hole to just rest on the base hanging from a tape measure from which the depth of the borehole is recorded the apm was connected to the reservoir via a tube and the valve opened the aardvark permeameter estimates field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs using the amount of supplied water determined using a depth drop d from the reservoir measured at equal time intervals see fig s5 which is equivalent to the amount of percolated water over time i e the soil water infiltration rate the measurement ends when the reservoir flow rate soil water infiltration rate does not change over several consecutive readings i e when the flow rate has reached steady state kfs was evaluated from the permeameter data using the reynolds 2008 solution formulated as follows reynolds et al 1985 used the matric flux potential Ï m defined by gardner 1958 to solve the richards equation for water flow through the saturated and unsaturated zones around the cylindrical test hole under a constant depth of water and presented the following reynolds 2008 expression for kfs from the constant head well permeameter test for soil at or below field capacity for determining based on this and previous work including elrick and reynolds 1986 1992 3 k f s c q 2 Ï h 2 c Ï r 2 2 Ï h Î± 1 where Î± is soil sorptive number for ponded infiltration and can be estimated from table 2 and c is a borehole shape function determined from 4 c h r z 1 z 2 h r z 3 reynolds 2008 zhang et al 1998 where z1 z2 and z3 are dimensionless empirical constants shown in table 2 eq 3 describes steady three dimensional flow and accounts for gravity capillarity and hydrostatic pressure effects in the borehole it should be noted that the sensitivity of kfs to the choice of Î± decreases as h increases errors due to incorrect selection of Î± are generally less than a factor of 2 and often less than 25 reynolds et al 1992 which reynolds 2008 deems to be of sufficient accuracy for many practical applications given the inherent variability of kfs it should be noted that in that interest of completeness kfs was also evaluated using the less physically approximate glover standard solution 1953 and the glover solution adjusted for gravity 1983 the results of which are reported in the supplemental information 2 5 relationship between percolation time pt and kfs many attempts have been made over the past number of decades to formulate a relationship between falling head percolation time pt and kfs including winneberger 1974 fritton et al 1986 radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 jabro 2009 and reynolds 2016 this study has used the radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and reynolds 2016 relationships as they are based on the mathematical descriptions of the test holes and so were deemed to be more applicable compared to the other studies which used field data sets to establish correlations 2 5 1 radcliffe and west 2000 relationship radcliffe and west 2000 used an alternative version of the elrick and reynolds 1992 relationship 5 q q Ï r 2 k f s 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 where q is the steady water flux per unit area Î»c is the macroscopic capillary length and g is a geometric factor that depends primarily on the ratio of h r and is given by 6 g 1 2 Ï a 1 a 2 h r a 3 h r 2 a 4 h r 3 bosch and west 1998 the values of the coefficients a1 a2 a3 a4 and Î»c depend on texture and structure and are shown in table 3 rearranging eq 5 gives 7 k f s q 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 the falling head percolation rate pt 1 q and so 8 k f s f 1 p t where 9 f 1 1 h Î» c g Ï r 2 h 2 g Ï r 2 f is a dimensionless factor and is the ratio of kfs to 1 pt allowing a direct comparison when converting pt to kfs an average ponding depth over the time interval for the falling head test should be used 2 5 2 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 relationship mulqueen and rodgers 2001 used an expression by elrick and reynolds 1986 for the rate of fall of a water surface in a cylindrical percolation test hole which allows for gradients due to pressure head and gravitational and matric potentials as follows 10 d t r 2 c d h 2 k f s h 2 2 h Ï m r 2 k f s c where dt is the percolation time c is a borehole shape function 11 c sinh 1 h r r 2 h 2 1 1 2 r h Ïm the matric flux potential 12 Ï m Ï i 0 k Ï d Ï Ï 0 where k Ï is the matric potential dependant unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and Ïi is the initial matric potential this relationship was applied to the falling head t test as used in the irish epa code of practice 2021 by transforming the plan area of the square test hole to an equivalent cylindrical hole area giving the following 13 k f s 4 2 p t where pt is in min 25 mm and kfs is in md 1 at high and low values of kfs the relationship between kfs and pt is asymptotic 2 5 3 reynolds 2016 relationship using a similar approach to radcliffe and west 2000 reynolds 2016 developed a unified analysis for falling head percolation tests and constant head well permeameter chwp tests see also reynolds et al 2015 kfs is determined for the chwp test using eq 6 with both tests using a cylindrical borehole and both undergoing an initial pre soaking period this allows the steady flow chwp relationship to be converted to a transient flow falling head percolation test relationship using 14 q Ï r 2 d h d t Î´ h Î´ t 1 p t elrick and reynolds 1986 where pt is percolation time dh dt is the rate of fall of borehole head Î´h is the decline in borehole ponding depth over time period Î´t by combining eqs 3 and 14 see reynolds 2016 for details the following relationship was derived to convert between falling head test percolation time pt and constant head test value kfs 15 p t Î´ t Î´ h m

each individual borehole measurement the soil sorptive number Î± can be expanded to 17 Î± Î± 1 exp Î± Ï i where Ïi is the antecedent pore water pressure head in the soil surrounding the test hole and Î± is the integrally correct slope of the soil s unsaturated hydraulic conductivity versus pore water pressure head relationship k Ï reynolds and elrick 1987 Î± is approximately equal to Î± in when the soil is at field capacity or drier i e Ïi 1 m reynolds et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrus 2d modelling results the field saturated hydraulic conductivities determined from the hydrus 2d model simulations of falling head test data across a full range of irish soil textures is shown in fig 4 a from this the generic relationship between percolation time pt and kfs value as used in the modelling was derived by comparing best fit relationships between linear exponential logarithmic power and polynomial functions with the power function showing the optimal fit with an r2 value of 0 933 and relative bias of 1 63 see fig 4b formulated by 18 k f s 3015 p t 0 98 these data also reveal how few t tests are completed in low permeability soils for values of pt 90 min 25 mm which is partly due to the length of time that such tests take but also due to the fact that pt 90 min 25 mm has been the threshold cut off for suitability for on site wastewater treatment in the national code of practice over the last 10 years 3 2 parallel falling head and constant head permeameter field tests the results from the 17 parallel falling head tests and constant head permeameter tests are summarised in table s2 which compares hydraulic conductivities derived according to different mathematical solutions some percolation tests were inconclusive from the perspective of gaining pt values as they had very low percolation rates and too small reductions in water level over the course of a full day to complete the test but kfs values were obtained in all cases from the constant head permeameter method fig 5 compares the kfs results from the constant head permeameter tests solved using the reynolds 2008 solution using parameters recommended for fine clayey soils most structured soils from clays to loams and coarse and gravelly soils i e Î± 4 12 and 36 m 1 see table 2 against the corresponding pt values from parallel t tests and the hydrus 2d best fit trendline across the irish dataset for the more coarse grained higher permeability soils pt values 10 min 25 mm the reynolds 2008 solution using parameters recommended for coarse and gravelly sands i e Î± 36 m 1 are seen to fit the hydrus trendline the best the reynolds 2008 solution for fine textured clayey and unstructured soils i e Î± 4 m 1 consistently yields lower resultant kfs values in comparison to the hydrus derived trendline for irish data even for the lower hydraulic conductivity soils hence while the numbers of data points are limited the field data solved with reynolds 2008 using recommended parameters for most structured soils from clays to loams as well as unstructured medium and fine sands i e Î± 12 m 1 appears to agree well with the hydrus 2d trendline ideally more parallel tests are needed between the pt value range of 90 to 120 but such sites are hard to find in ireland as this refers to an extremely narrow range of saturated hydraulic conductivities kfs between 2 8 and 3 6 cm d 1 limitations of the correlation produced using the hydrus simulated dataset include the accuracy of converting between usda soil texture classifications used in hydrus software and bs 5930 soil texture categories and the difficulty in carrying out parallel falling head and constant head field tests across the full range of soil textures and permeabilities within the context of irish legislative design thresholds for on site wastewater treatment it should be noted that the glover 1953 and the glover solution adjusted for gravity reynolds et al 1983 were also compared as seen on fig s6 but found to give higher values of kfs when compared to the reynolds 2008 solutions using Î± 4 and 12 m 1 this is in agreement with the findings of amoozegar 2020 archer et al 2014 reynolds 2008 and jabro and evans 2006 for medium to fine textured soils i e soils where capillarity is most important whilst the glover solution can provide good estimates of kfs under particular soil conditions where the hydrostatic pressure effect dominates and capillary effects are minimal such as in very wet or coarse textured soils amoozegar et al 2020 archer et al 2014 theron et al 2010 jabro and evans 2006 radcliffe and west 2000 elrick and reynolds 1992 it may underestimate or overestimate kfs in some circumstances due to the assumption of saturated flow around the test hole which is rarely achieved in practice reynolds 2013 reynolds and elrick 2002 stephens and neuman 1982 the solution presented by reynolds 2008 based on the richards equation accounts for gravity hydrostatic pressure and capillary effects but it is more complicated to apply than the glover solution requiring the estimation of soil parameters such as Î± 3 3 assessment of pt kfs formulations the generalised pt kfs models which were chosen for comparison radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 and reynolds 2016 were not produced from field test data but based on mathematical descriptions of test conditions measured pt values from falling head tests were converted to equivalent kfs values using the applicable correlation equations eqs 5 17 outlined previously the pt value kfs data points have been compared against the hydrus 2d model trendline for the irish soil dataset fig 6 which shows that the reynolds 2016 correlation was found to fit the irish model trendline particularly well while the mulqueen and rodgers and radcliffe and west equations gave slightly higher estimates for kfs from the field test results reciprocally measured kfs values from constant head permeameter tests solved using the reynolds 2008 equations were converted to equivalent pt values and these kfs pt data points and compared against the hydrus 2d model trendline fig 7 a b this shows that the hydrus 2d trendline for the irish dataset was found to lie between the three models albeit that the radcliffe and west 2000 mulqueen and rodgers 2001 converted pt values followed the trendline more closely than the reynolds 2016 using the Î± and z constants recommended for most structured soils from clays to loams i e Î± 12 m 1 see table 2 the reynolds 2016 derived points make a much closer fit if the Î± parameter is changed to 24 m 1 fig 7c pushing the soil category more towards coarse and gravelly sands including some highly structured soils with large cracks and or macropores this may be reflective of the predominant glacially derived heterogenous subsoils prevalent in ireland this comparison also helps to investigate how generalizable the relationship might be beyond the specific geographic test locations for the irish soil data the similarity in the results of these comparisons gives a high degree of confidence in the hydrus model trendline as a reasonable means to convert between pt value and kfs in irish soils particularly given the variability expected in kfs and pt value field test results some gaps are evident in the dataset across the range of hydraulic conductivities but this method of validation allows the kfs measurements in the lower permeability range to be included beyond the 120 min 25 mm threshold it should be noted that the graphs of pt value converted to kfs are smooth due to the fact that falling head test hole dimensions and average ponding heights used in calculations did not vary between tests in comparison curves showing kfs converted to pt value using reynolds 2016 and radcliffe and west 2000 are less smooth due to small differences in test hole radii between various tests radii ranged from 5 25 to 6 cm however the difference in dimensions for the constant head test holes used in these cases was found to have little impact on the conversion equation results as the ratios of infiltration area to infiltration volume were similar 3 4 comparison with international soil texture kfs ranges as highlighted in section 1 comparison of pt values across jurisdictions can be problematic due to the wide ranging methodologies used for the falling head percolation test such as different test hole dimensions different initial ponding heights etc which directly impact pt value results in order to make an international comparison of the irish pt test methodology the indicative pt values for each bs 5930 subsoil texture class were converted to kfs values using the hydrus 2d model trendline kfs 3015 pt 0 98 these kfs ranges were then compared to those provided in selected international design standards as shown in table 4 this comparison required soil texture categories from different soil classification systems to be converted to bs 5930 classifications which is complicated by differences in particle size limits for soil constituents and the fact that some international soil texture groupings include more than one bs 5930 category in addition many standards also classify soils according to structure and consistence e g australia new zealand british columbia which are not considered in the irish code of practice epa 2021 the kfs ranges for bs 5930 soils as adapted from the international standards can therefore only act as rough guidelines table s 3 in the supplemental information shows some examples of equating international soil categories with bs 5930 classifications in the sand and gravel range estimates from the hydrus model trendline tend to be lower than those from other standards which may be due to differences in soil classification systems for example many lower permeability soil groupings in international standards such as the clay loam sandy clay loam silty clay loam grouping shown in table s3 include the bs 5930 classification of sand low hydraulic conductivity within the bs 5930 sand classification is possible particularly where fine particles are present up to 34 fine particles clay silt can be present in sand as well as finer sand particles from 0 06 mm in fact using the bulk descriptors sand silt or gravel to help classify the permeability of soils may be of very limited use macdonald et al 2012 fogg et al 1998 and more attention should be given to the presence of silt or clay as permeability is strongly related to the finest soil fraction macdonald et al 2012 the lower permeability soils are of particular importance in the irish context i e below approximately 10 cm d 1 in this range the indicative values provided by the trendline are comparable to those in the international standards the kfs ranges were also compared to pedotransfer function estimates presented in the literature by bormann 2010 and saxton and rawls 2006 bormann 2010 developed a soil triangle outlining ranges for various soil hydrological parameters including ksat see fig s7 the ksat ranges presented in the triangle are in line with those predicted by the hydrus modelling derived trendline as well as the international ranges indicated in table 4 for example in the bormann triangle clay according to bs 5930 clay 35 has ksat 10 cm d 1 silt silt 35 has ksat 10 cm d 1 and sand silt and clay 35 has ksat approximately 50 100 cm d 1 these are in line with the saxton and rawls 2006 predicted saturated hydraulic conductivities for the usda soil textural classes as outlined in table 5 in which the equivalent bs 5930 soil texture categories have been added these kfs ranges are similar to those predicted by the hydrus model trendline from estimated pt values for the silt silt clay and clay categories for sandy loam at the lower limit of sand content required for sand under bs 5930 i e 65 sand the estimated ksat is 120 7 cm d 1 compared to approximately 78 cm d 1 predicted by the hydrus model for the upper limit of sand pt value estimate 3 5 kfs design thresholds for the irish context finally table 6 shows the kfs values calculated using the hydrus modelling derived trendline using the current pt value thresholds specified in the irish code of practice epa 2021 used for dwwts site assessment and design to provide more context to the important ranges particularly at the lower hydraulic conductivity end of the scale as discussed in section 3 2 these kfs values can be confidently determined in the field using a constant head permeameter test with the reynolds 2008 equation mulqueen and rodgers 2001 estimated that the kfs range for soils suitable for a septic tank absorption system in ireland could be in the range 8 to 200 cmd 1 which is close to the range suggested by the model for the lower hydraulic conductivity threshold the definition of these threshold values in terms of saturated hydraulic conductivity also now enables direct comparison of the irish legislation used for on site wastewater soil treatment design against other international standards 4 conclusions hydrus 2d modelling based upon a database of over 900 falling head percolation tests carried out across a wide range of soil types in ireland was used to develop a correlation between kfs and percolation time as determined using the ireland s legislative falling head percolation test used for site assessment for on site wastewater treatment the best fit trendline for the hydrus 2d simulations was found to fit with parallel falling head and constant head permeameter test results to a large degree when kfs was solved using reynolds 2008 solution with parameter values i e Î± z1 z2 z3 recommended for most soils Î± 12 m 1 etc when comparing the model trendline to other pt kfs correlations it was found to fall within similar ranges in addition kfs ranges predicted by the model based on pt values for bs 5930 soil categories are within international ranges for low permeability soils silt clay silt clay but the model tends to predict lower kfs for sands and gravels this discrepancy may be due to differences in soil classification systems particularly the inclusion of sand as defined by bs 5930 in some lower permeability groupings internationally the modelling process illuminated the fact that the broad categories of the bs 5930 soil texture classification system particularly gravel sand and silt may be of limited use in terms of predicting kfs as can be seen in comparisons with other soil classification systems international groupings of similar soils in terms of hydraulic conductivity values can include all bs 5930 soil texture categories in some cases the choice of solution for kfs is particularly important in the lower hydraulic conductivity range which is generally of most concern for site assessment in ireland however and the reynolds 2008 parameter values i e Î± z1 z2 z3 recommended for most soils appears to agree best with model predictions in addition the kfs ranges predicted by the hydrus model trendline are in good agreement with those estimated by applying ptfs across the range of soil textures bormann 2010 saxton and rawls 2006 given the range of comparisons conducted on the pt kfs correlation produced from hydrus modelling it was concluded that the trendline can be confidently used to provide comparisons between pt values and kfs particularly for low permeability soils in the irish context thus facilitating the introduction of the constant head test for low permeability soils whereby constant head test results can be easily converted to a percolation time pt value allowing comparison with the existing design thresholds credit authorship
