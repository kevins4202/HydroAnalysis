20010,the dissolved metal adsorption and association was determined for ten different filter materials recommended and or implemented in bioretention facilities batch adsorption and batch kinetic experiments were performed at lab scale using both single and multi metal solutions metal strengths and association were determined by sequential extraction analysis all materials adsorbed metals and 90 of adsorption occurred within 1 h however as metal solutions became more complex adsorption behavior changed generally filter materials classified as sand with a naturally high ph relatively low organic matter om content and large specific surface area seem to be good choices for removing dissolved metals additionally a chalk additive might improve metal adsorption whereas biochar did not significantly improve metal retention and may be an unwanted due to degradation over time extra source of om regardless of filter material metals primarily adsorbed to the exchangeable form which indicates that metal adsorption might not be permanent but rather substantially reversible in some cases more research is needed to assess whether dissolved metals adsorbed in filter materials of bioretention systems pose a delayed threat instead of an immediate threat finally the authors strongly recommend filter materials intended for stormwater bioretention facilities to be tested prior to implementation graphical abstract image 1 keywords filter material biofilter heavy metals metal fractionation filter media 1 introduction given the increased awareness about stormwater pollution and treatment needs the use of stormwater bioretention as an on site stormwater control measure is increasing in many countries around the world stormwater can contain a variety of pollutants e g metals sediment pathogens nutrients and organic pollutants although target pollutants for bioretention systems varies depending on regulations region and receiving water body metals are often a main concern hunt et al 2012 as urban stormwater runoff is considered a major source of metal contamination in receiving water bodies e g becouze lareure et al 2019 depending on their prevalence toxicity and resistance to degradation and or chemical transformation metals might negatively affect the ecological status of surface waters søberg et al 2017 a large number of field and laboratory studies have shown efficient total metal removal for bioretention systems often exceeding 80 90 e g hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 however reported removals of dissolved metals are fewer and contradictory including both efficient removal and significant leaching e g muthanna et al 2007 søberg et al 2017 the vegetation has been shown to contribute to the total metal removal in stormwater bioretention systems muthanna et al 2007 sun and davis 2007 read et al 2008 however the filter material accounts for the majority of metal removal muthanna et al 2007 blecken et al 2009 2011 and hence filter material composition is crucial for achieving effective dissolved metal treatment the filter material serves two functions i to retain and delay flow by temporary storage and infiltration and ii to treat stormwater runoff by a combination of physical chemical and biological processes the material should have a hydraulic conductivity ensuring both adequate retention for adsorption to occur and adequate infiltration capacity to avoid overflow fassman et al 2013 it should have physical and chemical properties to support plant life enhance treatment and avoid clogging fassman et al 2013 at present many filter materials are marketed and used in actual bioretention facilities without any previous testing hence research is needed to understand how their composition affects pollutant retention performance in some regions or countries rigorous recommendations for filter material compositions are specified in design manuals e g payne et al 2015 dwa 2005 payne et al 2015 ncdeq 2018 however depending on the target pollutants different recommendations for filter material composition exist hunt et al 2012 in other countries e g sweden there are no such national specifications so consultants and or local stormwater managers define filter materials on a case by case basis choices of filter materials are often based on hunches or preferences of a few individuals and are not tested prior to or after implementation further some filter materials may not efficiently remove or may even leach targeted pollutants because other objectives e g support of plant growth are prioritized during their development a considerable ratio of metals can be present in the dissolved phase in urban stormwater runoff lindfors et al 2017 although dissolved metals are more difficult to remove and usually more bioavailable compared to particulate metals thereby posing a greater risk fassman et al 2013 flanagan et al 2019 bioretention studies have generally focused on total metal removal hunt et al 2012 moreover recent work showed that a substantial amount of the dissolved metals usually defined as 0 45 μm may be present in mobile species free ions which further emphasizes the importance of investigating adsorption processes in stormwater treatment facilities lindfors et al 2017 at present no studies have systematically evaluated and compared the dissolved metal adsorption capacities of different filter materials recommended implemented in stormwater bioretention worldwide most studies concerning filter material in stormwater bioretention are i done on entire bioretention systems at either lab pilot or full scale e g li and davis 2008 wang et al 2017 and not only on the filter material itself ii examine the function of the entire system when enriching the filter material with some type of additive aluminum coating iron coating biochar fly ash etc e g li et al 2016 afrooz and boehm 2017 or iii test alternative low cost materials or adsorbents e g red soil perlite vermiculite coco peat construction waste etc e g vijayaraghavan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 when choosing a filter material long term retention rather than short term adsorption is most relevant to address the management and or lifetime of bioretention systems together with potential risks for leaching of adsorbed metals hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 it is essential to understand processes by which the metals are bound to the filter material for instance it is well known that om e g peat compost favors metal adsorption however such om degrades under oxidizing conditions leading to release of soluble trace metals into stormwater as it passes through the filter tessier et al 1979 hence the partitioning of adsorbed metals into different chemical forms and their risks of desorption under various environmental conditions warrant attention relatively large amounts of metals may be present in potentially available fractions in analogous materials from other stormwater treatment facilities e g pond sediments karlsson et al 2016 only one study has addressed such fractionation in bioretention systems the results indicated that metals were mainly trapped 50 in the residual fraction but the tests were restricted to filter material mixes with lignin in lab scale bioretention columns wang et al 2017 hence the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare dissolved metal adsorption capacities of 10 filter materials recommended and or implemented in bioretention facilities worldwide the chosen materials are manufactured according to current guidelines dwa 2005 ncdeq 2018 have been tested in scientific studies blecken et al 2009 grotehusmann et al 2016 søberg et al 2017 or are national market leaders the materials dissolved metal adsorption capacities were evaluated in laboratory batch and kinetic adsorption experiments using both single and multi metal solutions to obtain indications of the effects if any of competition between metals on their adsorption capacities furthermore the metals fractionation was examined by sequential extraction analysis to gain knowledge about possible changes in their adsorption capacity over time e g if desorption is likely to occur 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbents ten commonly implemented and or recommended filter materials listed in table 1 and briefly described here for bioretention facilities were examined ltu top layer is a sand based material developed by the urban water research group at luleå university of technology based on recommendations by the facility for advancing water biofiltration fawb 2008 however it has a lower percentage of fines than recommended by the fawb to enhance infiltration during freeze thaw cycles blecken et al 2011 several pilot scale studies blecken et al 2011 søberg et al 2017 have shown this material to be an efficient metal adsorbent hekla regnbädd and hekla regnbädd biokol hekla regnbädd with supplementary biochar were developed by the swedish supplier bara mineraler hasselfors was developed by another swedish supplier called hasselfors garden and also contains biochar originally these materials were intended to support plant growth having high om contents and water holding capacities table 2 they are now commonly used in swedish bioretention facilities intended to improve water quality although they have not been subjected to laboratory or field tests the dwa and dwa chalk materials are fabricated according to the german water manual dwa m 187 their original purpose was implementation in bioretention systems for highway runoff and cso treatment so called retention soil filters the addition of chalk is recommended to enhance metal adsorption and compensate for low om content grotehusmann et al 2016 dwa 2005 orbicon standard field topsoil 1 was developed by the danish consultancy orbicon and is intended for road beds three bioretention soils from the united states were also evaluated one from wade moore equipment co north carolina and two from companies in ohio each mix met the respective states current guidelines for bioretention soil generally a sandy blend with varying amounts of om the mixes were developed to target pollutants of particular local concern nutrients and sediment in north carolina and ohio respectively therefore none of these bioretention soils had specific amendments designed to target metal retention origins or suppliers and abbreviations of the materials that will be used hereafter are presented in table 1 and the filter materials are illustrated in fig s1 2 2 filter material characterization to obtain indications of potentially relevant factors for metal adsorption the om content specific surface area ssa ph and particle size distributions of each material were determined the om content was measured from ignition residues according to swedish standard ss 028113 the ssa was determined by an accredited external laboratory escubed limited wetherby uk using the brunauer emmett teller bet method ph was determined according to the international standard iso 10390 using a wtw ph 3110 field ph meter and particle size distributions psds were determined by dry sieving according to swedish standard ss iso 11277 2009 and expressed in terms of d50 diameter at which smaller particles comprise 50 of a sample s mass or median particle size and cu coefficient of uniformity d10 d60 2 3 initial leaching to examine if the materials can act as a source of metals the initial leaching capacity was examined by shaking 10 g of dry material diluted in 100 ml vwr iso 4788 measuring cylinders with an accuracy of 0 5 ml at 20 c milli q water for 24 h aqueous phase metal contents were then determined using methodology described in section 2 8 2 4 batch adsorption experiments the metal adsorption capacity of each material was examined using batch adsorption experiments with single metal solutions containing either cu or zn at 1 10 50 100 and 1000 mg l and multi metal solutions the latter contained cu zn and ni at 1 10 50 100 and 1000 mg l 10 fold lower concentrations of cr and pb and 100 fold lower concentrations of cd as in the leaching experiments 10 g samples of dry material were shaken in 100 ml milli q water for 24 h metal concentrations in solution determined by methodology described in section 2 8 were then used to calculate adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity q of each material by equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 a d s o r p t i o n c i c f c i 100 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q m g m e t a l g m a t e r i a

adsorbate 100 ml the adsorption data were fitted to linear freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich sorption isotherms generally the langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich sorption isotherms provided the best fits i e highest r2 values so the linear and freundlich isotherms will not be discussed further however it is important to emphasize that these equations are merely numerical relationships used to fit data and the isotherm equation parameters are only valid for the chemical conditions under which the experiment was conducted thus they cannot be used to predict metal adsorption behavior in environments with differences in ionic strength ph metal concentrations presence of other substances longer or shorter contact times etc underlying assumptions of the langmuir isotherm used in the linear form here equation 3 are that the adsorbent has a homogenous surface with monolayer adsorption at a finite number of identical and equivalent sorption sites with equal affinity for the adsorbate moreover it is assumed that there is no lateral interaction or steric hindrance between adsorbed molecules even at adjacent sorption sites foo and hameed 2010 note steric hindrance would limit q max but lateral interaction could potentially either restrict or increase it 3 linearized langmuir c f q e q m a x k l 1 c f q m a x here c f is the final concentration of a metal q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the affinity constant the characteristics of the langmuir adsorption process can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant known as the separation factor r l 4 r l 1 1 k l c i the value of r l indicates whether adsorption is unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 by plotting c f q e vs c f the langmuir constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 assumptions underlying the temkin isotherm using the linear form in equation 5 are that bonding energy is uniformly distributed with the heat of adsorption decreasing linearly with coverage ignoring extremely low and very high concentrations 5 linearized temkin q e b ln k t b ln c f here b kj mol equation 6 is a constant related to the heat of adsorption 6 b r t b t where r kj kmol is the gas constant t k is temperature in kelvin b t is a dimensionless model constant and k t l mg is the equilibrium binding constant by plotting q e vs lnc f the temkin constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 bolis 2013 the dubinin radushkevich isotherm using the linear form presented in equation 7 is based on assumptions of a heterogeneous surface which is more realistic since solutions and materials are rarely perfectly mixed therefore the surfaces are unlikely to be homogeneous as is assumed for the langmuir isotherm linearized dubinin radushkevich 7 ln q e ln q s k d r ε 2 here ɛ equation 8 is the polanyi potential 8 ε r t k ln 1 1 c e where q s mg g is the adsorption capacity and k dr mol2 kj2 is the dubinin radushkevich activity coefficient related to mean sorption energy characteristics

exchange 8 e 16 kj mol or chemical e 16 kj mol by plotting lnq e vs ɛ 2 the dubinin radushkevich constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 2 5 batch adsorption kinetics metal uptake rates and contact times needed for completion of adsorption reactions were assessed by batch kinetic experiments with two single metal solutions cu and zn concentration 10 mg l and one multi metal solution with 10 mg l of cu zn and ni 1 mg l of pb and cr and 0 1 mg l of cd the time steps were 1 h 3 h 6 h 10 h and 24 h and the protocol was the same as that applied in the batch adsorption experiments except that samples were collected for analysis at each time step data were fitted against pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models with the pseudo second order kinetic model equation 10 providing the best fit highest r 2 values hence the pseudo first order kinetic equation will not be discussed further 10 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e t

adsorbed 100 ml of a multi metal solution with 100 mg l of cu zn and ni 10 mg l of pb and cr and 1 mg l of cd were added to 10 g of each filter material and shaken for 24 h the adsorbed metals were then subjected to sequential extraction analysis by an accredited laboratory as follows a sample of each material was ground in a steel dish and treated according to the swedish standard ss 028113 1 it was then acidified by adding 1 hno3 v v and analyzed by icp sfms cd and pb according to standards ss en iso 17294 1 2 modified and epa method 200 8 modified or icp aes cr cu ni zn according to standards ss en iso 11805 modified and epa method 200 7 modified to determine residual amounts of metals in the samples they were dried at 50 c and treated according to standards astm d3682 2013 astm d4503 2008 and ss en 13656 2003 then analyzed by icp sfms according to standards ss en iso 17294 2 2016 and epa method 200 8 1994 six fractions were extracted i adsorbed and exchangeable metals and carbonates ii labile organic forms iii amorphous fe and mn oxides iv crystalline fe oxides v stable organic forms and sulfides and vi residuals fractions i v are potentially mobile fraction i contains easily leached metals likely to be mobilized by changes in ambient water s ionic composition fraction ii includes metals bound to om which will degrade and release captured metals under oxidizing conditions fraction iii includes metals bound to amorphous fe and mn oxides which behave as metal sinks under oxidizing conditions but are unstable under anoxic conditions fraction iv includes metals bound to more stable crystalline fe oxides that only become unstable under persistently anoxic conditions which in most cases are unlikely to occur in bioretention fraction v includes metals bound to stable organic forms and sulfides which mobilize under oxidizing conditions fraction vi contains metals that are not likely to be released in solution under conditions normally present in nature tessier et al 1979 2 7 reagents solutions were made using the following laboratory grade chemicals zn no3 2 6h2o acros organics cas no 10196 18 6 cd no3 2 4h2o alfa aesar cas no 10022 68 1 cu no3 2

undesired metal salts metal nitrates were used since nitrates have no any affinity for metals to avoid precipitation of metal oxides the ph of the solutions was not adjusted hence they had partly lower ph 4 6 5 depending on metal and solution than what is common for stormwater runoff the actual concentrations of all solutions were determined by an accredited external laboratory als scandinavia luleå sweden by icp sfms 2 8 general procedures analytical methodology all experiments were conducted at room temperature 18 6 c 0 6 according to two ebro ebi310 temperature loggers before weighing samples for the experiments all filter materials were dried in incubators for at least 24 h at 35 c above which om may oxidize thus changing material properties then the materials were mixed with a plastic spoon and 10 g of material was randomly collected the solid to liquid ratio in all experiments was 1 10 10 g of dry material to 100 ml of solution all experiments except the sequential leaching were run in duplicate however if results differed markedly an extra replicate was run which was only the case in a very few instances controls solution without filter material were included in all runs samples were shaken on two orbital shaking tables set to 200 rpm in all cases the ph of the metal solutions was measured using a field ph meter ph330 wtw gmbh weilheim germany after shaking all samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters filtropur s and sent for analysis of the dissolved metals at an accredited laboratory als scandinavia luleå sweden at the laboratory each liquid sample was acidified by addition of 1 ml hno3 per 100 ml then analyzed by icp sfms according to standards ss en iso 17294 1 2 modified and epa method 200 8 modified 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter material characteristics as shown in table 2 the ph of ltu top and nc usa were 6 1 and 6 3 respectively the ph of dwa chalk was 9 2 and the ph of all the other materials ranged from 7 7 to 8 8 materials with biochar additive hekla b and hasselfors had the highest ssa and om contents in contrast the sand based materials ltu top dwa and dwa chalk without biochar additives have low om contents and small ssa hasselfors had by far the largest d50 and second lowest cu table 2 so it is much coarser mainly gravel and more heterogeneous material than the others fig 1 despite variations in d50 and cu the psd analysis confirmed that all the other materials are primarily sandy materials fig 1 3 2 initial leaching after 24 h of shaking in 100 ml milli q water cd and cr concentrations in the water were most often below the detection limit table 3 all materials except dwa and dwa chalk including the control leached cu table 3 ni pb and zn leaching from some of the materials as well as zn from the control was also observed however only hekla and hekla b had significantly higher concentrations of cu and zn than the control and hence the observed leachates of cu and zn from the other materials cannot be regarded as actual leaching furthermore hekla and hekla b had the highest leachates of pb and ni as well unfortunately it was not possible to clarify the reason s for the leaching of cu and zn in the controls but the concentrations detected in the initial leaching tests table 3 are much lower than concentrations used in the batch adsorption batch kinetic and sequential extraction experiments so leaching from the materials did not substantially influence the results 3 3 batch adsorption experiments large variations in metal adsorption between the materials were detected fig 2 especially at the highest metal concentrations while some materials adsorbed most of the metals even at the highest initial concentrations dwa nc usa and ltu top adsorbed zn ni and cd less efficiently especially from the multi metal solutions as shown in fig 2 amounts of the metals adsorbed generally increased with increases in initial concentration while the materials had sufficient adsorption sites to adsorb all most metals at the lower initial concentrations the potential adsorption capacity became increasingly saturated as initial concentration increased until the amount of metals exceeded the number of adsorption sites meena et al 2008 thus all materials adsorbed essentially all available metals at the two lowest initial concentrations whereas differences in adsorption capacity between materials appeared at the higher initial concentrations furthermore adsorption of zn ni and cd from the multi metal solution were lower at the highest initial concentration than at the second highest concentration more cu and especially zn were generally adsorbed from the single metal solutions than from the multi metal solutions at the three highest initial concentrations fig 2 this was probably due to a lack of adsorption sites as well as competition between metals for available adsorption sites kb ohio and bn ohio were consistently amongst the three materials with the highest adsorption capacities while ltu top dwa and nc usa were amongst the three with the lowest adsorption capacities furthermore for the materials ltu top nc usa dwa and hekla b in some cases higher final metal concentrations were recorded at the highest initial concentrations fig 2 this observation was not due to leaching since these concentrations table 3 were far lower than the increase in metal concentrations observed at these high initial concentrations 1000 mg l for cu zn and ni 100 mg l for cr and pb 10 mg l for cd these concentrations exceeded the metal sorption capacity by far thus the percentage of the metals which was adsorbed by these materials was rather negligible and consequently initial and final concentrations were approximately the same the uncertainty of the analytical method approximately 20 at the highest initial concentrations involved that in some samples the reported final concentration was slightly higher than the initial one hence the observed higher final concentrations is most likely explained by that analytical uncertainty this is further supported by the fact that the duplicates did not deviate considerably from each other several of the materials included in this study have been previously tested in pilot and field scale although it showed very low adsorption capacities in the present study fig 2 ltu top efficiently removed metals in pilot scale bioretention facilities under various ambient conditions e g blecken et al 2009 blecken et al 2011 søberg et al 2017 dwa chalk consistently adsorbed more metals than dwa fig 2 in accordance with a previous survey of full scale bioretention facilities with these filter materials grotehusmann et al 2016 this also confirmed the importance of adding chalk for metal adsorption as recommended in the german guidelines for bioretention dwa 2005 in an evaluation of two full scale bioretention cells at north carolina state university luell 2011 observed relatively low removal of total cu 23 43 dissolved cu 17 49 and total zn 79 this is consistent with nc usa being amongst the three materials with the lowest adsorption capacities in the present study fig 2 the kb ohio material removed 68 and 83 of total zn and pb respectively in previous field scale bioretention tests but leached ca cu fe mg and mn winston et al 2015 in the present study kb ohio showed excellent adsorption of all tested metals and was consistently amongst the top three materials fig 2 however it should be noted that winston et al 2015 and luell 2011 focused on full scale systems exposed to numerous uncontrolled factors in contrast to the lab scale systems maintained under controlled conditions in the present study additionally field scale tests also account for particulate bond metals unlike the current study no previous tests of metal adsorption by hekla hekla b hasselfors or orbicon have been published despite their widespread use in bioretention in sweden and denmark the isotherm that provided the best fit to the data depended on the metal type of solution and filter material for the two single metal solutions the langmuir isotherms generally provided the best fit however for the single metal solutions all isotherms had high 0 8 r2 values table s1 the isotherm of best fit for adsorption from the multi metal solutions depended on the metal in these cases the langmuir isotherm provided the best fit for cu ni and pb adsorption the dubinin radushkevich isotherm the best fit for zn and cd adsorption and the temkin isotherm the best fit for cr adsorption table s1 however the other isotherms could also be applied for most of the metals apart from cr from multi metal solutions albeit while generating somewhat lower r2 values table s1 these findings illustrate that the complexity of metal adsorption increases with increases in the number of metals present due to competition between metals for binding sites so different metals do not necessarily exhibit the same behavior under identical conditions bradl 2004 this phenomenon is evidenced by the observed lower adsorption of cu and zn from multi metal solutions than from single metal solutions fig 2 the calculated isotherm parameters table s1 confirm that ltu top dwa and nc usa consistently adsorbed the lowest quantity of metals for example the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity constant the dubinin radushkevich adsorption capacity constant and the temkin heat of adsorption constant for adsorption of cu from single and multi metal solutions zn from single metal solutions and pb from multi metal solutions were consistently lowest for these three filter materials accordingly the temkin model constant and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energy were consistently higher in these cases the relatively poor performance of ltu top dwa and nc usa was also supported by the temkin isotherm model constants for adsorption of cr from the multi metal solutions table s1 however the trends were less clear for adsorption of zn ni and cd from multi metal solutions and were only supported by the dubinin radushkevich model constants despite the langmuir isotherm providing a better fit for adsorption of ni and relatively high r2 values for adsorption of zn and cd from the multi metal solutions for some of the filter materials final concentrations of zn ni and cd in experiments with the most concentrated multi metal solution were higher than the initial concentrations this resulted in negative adsorption capacity values which reduced the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities and probably explains the relatively indistinct patterns in adsorption of zn ni and cd from multi metal solutions table s1 with a few exceptions the calculated isotherm parameters table s1 also confirm that kb ohio and bn ohio generally provided the best dissolved metal adsorption for example the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity constant dubinin radushkevich adsorption capacity constant and temkin heat of adsorption constant were highest for these materials while the temkin model constant and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energy were lowest table s1 3 4 batch adsorption kinetics the batch adsorption kinetic data fitted the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation well with r2 values close to 1 table s2 despite differences between materials the adsorption process was relatively fast within an hour most of the materials had adsorbed 90 of the metals fig 3 and half life times of less than a minute were observed table s2 adsorption by ltu top nc usa and dwa was generally lower and slower than the other materials fig 3 dwa chalk had a lower initial adsorption rate and longer half life time than the remaining six materials table s2 but equally high equilibrium adsorbate concentrations fig 3 table s2 hekla and hekla b had slower and lower adsorption of cr from multi metal solutions fig 3 and thus the longest half life times and lowest equilibrium adsorbate concentrations for cr table s2 with typical infiltration rates of 300 mm h fawb 2008 hunt et al 2012 contact times for a 600 mm deep filter are generally at least 2 h although in practice the infiltration rate of course varies depending on the type of material filter depth root macro pores bioturbation and level of clogging as 90 of the metals were adsorbed within an hour actual retention times in full scale bioretention should be adequate for high metal removal it has been commonly observed that a majority of metal adsorption happens in the upper layers of bioretention e g søberg et al 2017 which would support the assumption of rather quick adsorption processes further stormwater sediment and thus particulate metals are trapped on top of the filter which also contributes to the high metal concentrations in this layer 3 5 sequential extractions the sequential extractions revealed that in most cases the largest fraction of the metals adsorbed by all of the materials was fraction i the exchangeable fraction followed by the labile organic forms ii and amorphous fe and mn oxides iii fractions fig 4 the high percentages of potentially leachable fractions imply an obvious risk of adsorbed metals being desorbed by changes in the ionic composition of ambient water or development of oxidizing conditions tessier et al 1979 for instance during extended dry periods which have been shown to affect metal removal in bioretention blecken et al 2009 and or after maintenance karlsson et al 2016 the latter becomes evident considering that metals primarily accumulate in the top 5 cm of bioretention filter materials e g søberg et al 2017 generally the filter materials having high om contents hekla hekla b hasselfors and bn ohio table 2 had higher percentages of adsorbed metals in fraction ii labile organic forms fig 4 particularly percentages of adsorbed cu and pb in fraction ii were relatively high in the hekla b and bn ohio materials hence the addition of om in forms of e g a top mulch layer as previously recommended in the usa li and davis 2008 or compost for the enhancement of metal removal fassman et al 2013 may not be sustainable for efficient metal removal on a long term basis since these metals are likely to be released to solution as the om degrades the partitioning of cr was distinctive as the percentage adsorbed in the exchangeable fraction was low in several materials fig 4 moreover substantial percentages of cr but no other metals adsorbed by several materials were detected in fractions iv and v for example 18 of cr adsorbed to fraction v stable organic forms and sulfides in hasselfors and 15 adsorbed to fraction iv more crystalline fe oxides in ltu top fig 4 there were no obvious similarities between the six filter materials that adsorbed higher proportions of cr in fractions ii v than in fraction i table 2 however cr iii is rapidly adsorbed by soil specifically by fe and mn oxides having particularly high affinities for fe oxides bradl 2004 furthermore cr adsorption increases with increases in ph and om content but decreases in the presence of competing cations including ions of the other five metals considered here bradl 2004 this might at least partly explain why fractionation patterns of cr strongly differed from those of the other metals 3 6 discussion conflicting results have been observed in previous studies regarding removal of dissolved metals in stormwater bioretention systems some have found that dissolved metals are efficiently retained e g blecken et al 2011 wang et al 2017 while others have found substantial leaching e g muthanna et al 2007 hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 efficient removal indicates that metals are bound to the filter material in more stable forms than found in this study or that oxidation of om did not occur however metals in the exchangeable fraction are likely to be desorbed and potentially re adsorbed further down in the filter material moreover the bioretention systems examined in the cited studies muthanna et al 2007 hatt et al 2008 blecken et al 2011 wang et al 2017 søberg et al 2017 were relatively young 2 years and found metals to be adsorbed in the top 5 cm of the filter material hence these systems were far from saturated with metals thus the zone with higher metal concentrations might gradually extend downwards in the filter material the metal fractionation results from this study indicate that substantial amounts of metals in filter materials may be in potentially leachable forms this has clear implications for the materials long term performance during and after long dry periods and their disposal after maintenance when risks of metal desorption during excavation and movement of excavated filter material must be considered sequential extractions of filter materials from two approximately four year old full scale bioretention facilities in washington d c and maryland usa indicated that adsorbed metals were strongly bound to the bioretention filter material and largely immobile not in the exchangeable fraction li and davis 2008 jones and davis 2013 however after extended dry periods promoting aeration and oxidation of the filter material high metal concentrations in bioretention effluent have been detected by blecken et al 2009 this may have been due to metal adsorption in potentially leachable forms although the filter material similar to ltu top was not subjected to confirmatory sequential extraction in contrast in a laboratory scale study of cd removal by four bioretention filter materials fine sand zeolite sand and quartz sand accumulated cd was detected mainly in the residual form wang et al 2017 moreover another study of metal fractionation in soil underlying infiltration facilities i e not in engineered bioretention filter material found that metal fractionation changed over time proportions of cu and pb in the exchangeable fraction decreased while proportions of zn and cd increased kumar 2016 these partly conflicting results in combination with findings of this study and previously reported effects of drying clearly show that further analyses of metal fractionation in bioretention filter material are required inter alia there are needs to evaluate risks posed by remobilization of adsorbed metals in bioretention filter materials under various ambient conditions and with different filter material compositions e g contents of compost biochar and similar organic substances which may degrade over time fassman et al 2013 both chemisorption and physisorption of metals release heat but the amounts of heat released differ substantially in ranges of ca 80 400 kj mol and 5 45 kj mol respectively bolis 2013 the temkin isotherm heat of adsorption constants and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energies obtained in this study were 1 2 and 5 1 kj mol respectively table s1 indicative of physical sorption processes the langmuir separation factors table s1 also indicate that the adsorption processes were favorable but not irreversible 0 r l 1 and thus largely physical in physical adsorption the bonds are relatively weak and easily break bolis 2013 further the metals may be adsorbed in several layers of molecules and easily desorbed by changes in temperature or other ambient water variables bolis 2013 these observations are consistent with findings in the present study that most of the adsorbed metals were in the exchangeable i labile organic ii and amorphous fe and mn oxides iii fractions fig 4 where metals are easily desorbed by changes in ambient water ionic composition and under oxidizing conditions tessier et al 1979 chalk calcium carbonate contents of soils have been associated with metal fixation and are considered important for metal adsorption and hence their soluble concentrations alloway et al 1988 its addition seemed to enhance metal adsorption since dwa chalk consistently adsorbed higher amounts of the metals than dwa fig 1 the relatively low ssa low om content high d50 and high coefficient of uniformity table 2 of dwa chalk are not favorable characteristics for metal adsorption hence its high ph due to the chalk additive is presumably the main characteristic that favors metal adsorption in recent years biochar has received considerable attention as a soil additive for heavy metal adsorption in stormwater treatment systems because it has various metal ion binding functional groups and increases ssa due to its high porosity mohanty et al 2018 however no significant difference p 0 872 for a two sample t test at 95 ci in metal adsorption were observed between hekla and hekla b which are identical except for the presence and absence of biochar figs 2 and 3 further adsorption parameters of both hasselfors and hekla b the materials containing biochar were moderate and did not substantially differ from those of the other materials figs 2 and 3 accordingly a recent review of the utility of biochar as an additive in stormwater treatment systems concluded that it has varying capacity to remove metals mohanty et al 2018 results herein would not support its use for metal removal the materials with the highest metal adsorption kb ohio bn ohio and orbicon all have relatively high ph and ssa low to medium om contents and are classified as sand with relatively uniform grainsize table 2 conversely dwa ltu top and nc usa the materials with the lowest metal adsorption have markedly lower ph than the other materials small ssa and low om contents table 2 hence filter materials with a naturally high ph low to medium om contents large ssa and uniform particles in the sand range seem optimal for retaining dissolved metals in stormwater bioretention systems the hasselfors material is coarser than the other materials being based on gravel rather than sand fig 1 table 2 thus it is likely to provide shorter retention times than the other materials and its metal adsorption rates may be lower than those observed in this study in practice in contrast the orbicon material has much smaller particles than the other materials fig 1 table 2 which might pose risks for clogging and thus overflow or bypass a major challenge when selecting bioretention filter materials is balancing high infiltration rates but lower adsorption and contact time offered by coarse materials and potentially higher adsorption and longer contact time but higher overflow offered by finer materials previous studies have found that percentages of most metals in exchangeable fractions of stormwater sediments pond sediments gully pot sediments road dust etc are low or non detectable marsalek and marsalek 1997 karlsson et al 2016 jayarathne et al 2017 however jayarathne et al 2017 found approximately 50 of adsorbed zn and cd in the exchangeable fraction furthermore li and davis 2008 found a close relationship between capture of metals and runoff particles hence the sediment trapped by stormwater bioretention systems will affect the metal fractionation as well as the filter material results of this study show that filter materials for stormwater bioretention have numerous differences and complex sometimes conflicting characteristics all of which may affect metal treatment hence identifying the optimal mixture is challenging especially as other objectives e g supporting plants treatment of other pollutants and low cost must also be met 4 conclusion all the tested materials adsorbed metals although as metal concentrations increased and metal solutions became more complex the adsorption of some metals decreased furthermore adsorption was generally fast and within an hour more than 90 of most metals was adsorbed the material that performed best depended on both the metal and solution single or multi metal however filter materials with a naturally high ph relatively low to moderate om content large ssa and uniform sand sized particles e g kb ohio bn ohio and orbicon generally seems to be good choices for removing dissolved metals addition of chalk may also help to improve metal adsorption by increasing the filter material s ph while biochar addition seems to have no direct impact despite increasing materials ssa and om contents moreover adding it may be undesirable due to its degradation over time high percentages of the adsorbed metals were found in the potentially leachable fractions with obvious implications for long term performance of the materials their functionality under varying conditions and the maintenance of bioretention facilities

20010,the dissolved metal adsorption and association was determined for ten different filter materials recommended and or implemented in bioretention facilities batch adsorption and batch kinetic experiments were performed at lab scale using both single and multi metal solutions metal strengths and association were determined by sequential extraction analysis all materials adsorbed metals and 90 of adsorption occurred within 1 h however as metal solutions became more complex adsorption behavior changed generally filter materials classified as sand with a naturally high ph relatively low organic matter om content and large specific surface area seem to be good choices for removing dissolved metals additionally a chalk additive might improve metal adsorption whereas biochar did not significantly improve metal retention and may be an unwanted due to degradation over time extra source of om regardless of filter material metals primarily adsorbed to the exchangeable form which indicates that metal adsorption might not be permanent but rather substantially reversible in some cases more research is needed to assess whether dissolved metals adsorbed in filter materials of bioretention systems pose a delayed threat instead of an immediate threat finally the authors strongly recommend filter materials intended for stormwater bioretention facilities to be tested prior to implementation graphical abstract image 1 keywords filter material biofilter heavy metals metal fractionation filter media 1 introduction given the increased awareness about stormwater pollution and treatment needs the use of stormwater bioretention as an on site stormwater control measure is increasing in many countries around the world stormwater can contain a variety of pollutants e g metals sediment pathogens nutrients and organic pollutants although target pollutants for bioretention systems varies depending on regulations region and receiving water body metals are often a main concern hunt et al 2012 as urban stormwater runoff is considered a major source of metal contamination in receiving water bodies e g becouze lareure et al 2019 depending on their prevalence toxicity and resistance to degradation and or chemical transformation metals might negatively affect the ecological status of surface waters søberg et al 2017 a large number of field and laboratory studies have shown efficient total metal removal for bioretention systems often exceeding 80 90 e g hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 however reported removals of dissolved metals are fewer and contradictory including both efficient removal and significant leaching e g muthanna et al 2007 søberg et al 2017 the vegetation has been shown to contribute to the total metal removal in stormwater bioretention systems muthanna et al 2007 sun and davis 2007 read et al 2008 however the filter material accounts for the majority of metal removal muthanna et al 2007 blecken et al 2009 2011 and hence filter material composition is crucial for achieving effective dissolved metal treatment the filter material serves two functions i to retain and delay flow by temporary storage and infiltration and ii to treat stormwater runoff by a combination of physical chemical and biological processes the material should have a hydraulic conductivity ensuring both adequate retention for adsorption to occur and adequate infiltration capacity to avoid overflow fassman et al 2013 it should have physical and chemical properties to support plant life enhance treatment and avoid clogging fassman et al 2013 at present many filter materials are marketed and used in actual bioretention facilities without any previous testing hence research is needed to understand how their composition affects pollutant retention performance in some regions or countries rigorous recommendations for filter material compositions are specified in design manuals e g payne et al 2015 dwa 2005 payne et al 2015 ncdeq 2018 however depending on the target pollutants different recommendations for filter material composition exist hunt et al 2012 in other countries e g sweden there are no such national specifications so consultants and or local stormwater managers define filter materials on a case by case basis choices of filter materials are often based on hunches or preferences of a few individuals and are not tested prior to or after implementation further some filter materials may not efficiently remove or may even leach targeted pollutants because other objectives e g support of plant growth are prioritized during their development a considerable ratio of metals can be present in the dissolved phase in urban stormwater runoff lindfors et al 2017 although dissolved metals are more difficult to remove and usually more bioavailable compared to particulate metals thereby posing a greater risk fassman et al 2013 flanagan et al 2019 bioretention studies have generally focused on total metal removal hunt et al 2012 moreover recent work showed that a substantial amount of the dissolved metals usually defined as 0 45 μm may be present in mobile species free ions which further emphasizes the importance of investigating adsorption processes in stormwater treatment facilities lindfors et al 2017 at present no studies have systematically evaluated and compared the dissolved metal adsorption capacities of different filter materials recommended implemented in stormwater bioretention worldwide most studies concerning filter material in stormwater bioretention are i done on entire bioretention systems at either lab pilot or full scale e g li and davis 2008 wang et al 2017 and not only on the filter material itself ii examine the function of the entire system when enriching the filter material with some type of additive aluminum coating iron coating biochar fly ash etc e g li et al 2016 afrooz and boehm 2017 or iii test alternative low cost materials or adsorbents e g red soil perlite vermiculite coco peat construction waste etc e g vijayaraghavan et al 2010 wang et al 2017 when choosing a filter material long term retention rather than short term adsorption is most relevant to address the management and or lifetime of bioretention systems together with potential risks for leaching of adsorbed metals hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 it is essential to understand processes by which the metals are bound to the filter material for instance it is well known that om e g peat compost favors metal adsorption however such om degrades under oxidizing conditions leading to release of soluble trace metals into stormwater as it passes through the filter tessier et al 1979 hence the partitioning of adsorbed metals into different chemical forms and their risks of desorption under various environmental conditions warrant attention relatively large amounts of metals may be present in potentially available fractions in analogous materials from other stormwater treatment facilities e g pond sediments karlsson et al 2016 only one study has addressed such fractionation in bioretention systems the results indicated that metals were mainly trapped 50 in the residual fraction but the tests were restricted to filter material mixes with lignin in lab scale bioretention columns wang et al 2017 hence the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare dissolved metal adsorption capacities of 10 filter materials recommended and or implemented in bioretention facilities worldwide the chosen materials are manufactured according to current guidelines dwa 2005 ncdeq 2018 have been tested in scientific studies blecken et al 2009 grotehusmann et al 2016 søberg et al 2017 or are national market leaders the materials dissolved metal adsorption capacities were evaluated in laboratory batch and kinetic adsorption experiments using both single and multi metal solutions to obtain indications of the effects if any of competition between metals on their adsorption capacities furthermore the metals fractionation was examined by sequential extraction analysis to gain knowledge about possible changes in their adsorption capacity over time e g if desorption is likely to occur 2 material and methods 2 1 adsorbents ten commonly implemented and or recommended filter materials listed in table 1 and briefly described here for bioretention facilities were examined ltu top layer is a sand based material developed by the urban water research group at luleå university of technology based on recommendations by the facility for advancing water biofiltration fawb 2008 however it has a lower percentage of fines than recommended by the fawb to enhance infiltration during freeze thaw cycles blecken et al 2011 several pilot scale studies blecken et al 2011 søberg et al 2017 have shown this material to be an efficient metal adsorbent hekla regnbädd and hekla regnbädd biokol hekla regnbädd with supplementary biochar were developed by the swedish supplier bara mineraler hasselfors was developed by another swedish supplier called hasselfors garden and also contains biochar originally these materials were intended to support plant growth having high om contents and water holding capacities table 2 they are now commonly used in swedish bioretention facilities intended to improve water quality although they have not been subjected to laboratory or field tests the dwa and dwa chalk materials are fabricated according to the german water manual dwa m 187 their original purpose was implementation in bioretention systems for highway runoff and cso treatment so called retention soil filters the addition of chalk is recommended to enhance metal adsorption and compensate for low om content grotehusmann et al 2016 dwa 2005 orbicon standard field topsoil 1 was developed by the danish consultancy orbicon and is intended for road beds three bioretention soils from the united states were also evaluated one from wade moore equipment co north carolina and two from companies in ohio each mix met the respective states current guidelines for bioretention soil generally a sandy blend with varying amounts of om the mixes were developed to target pollutants of particular local concern nutrients and sediment in north carolina and ohio respectively therefore none of these bioretention soils had specific amendments designed to target metal retention origins or suppliers and abbreviations of the materials that will be used hereafter are presented in table 1 and the filter materials are illustrated in fig s1 2 2 filter material characterization to obtain indications of potentially relevant factors for metal adsorption the om content specific surface area ssa ph and particle size distributions of each material were determined the om content was measured from ignition residues according to swedish standard ss 028113 the ssa was determined by an accredited external laboratory escubed limited wetherby uk using the brunauer emmett teller bet method ph was determined according to the international standard iso 10390 using a wtw ph 3110 field ph meter and particle size distributions psds were determined by dry sieving according to swedish standard ss iso 11277 2009 and expressed in terms of d50 diameter at which smaller particles comprise 50 of a sample s mass or median particle size and cu coefficient of uniformity d10 d60 2 3 initial leaching to examine if the materials can act as a source of metals the initial leaching capacity was examined by shaking 10 g of dry material diluted in 100 ml vwr iso 4788 measuring cylinders with an accuracy of 0 5 ml at 20 c milli q water for 24 h aqueous phase metal contents were then determined using methodology described in section 2 8 2 4 batch adsorption experiments the metal adsorption capacity of each material was examined using batch adsorption experiments with single metal solutions containing either cu or zn at 1 10 50 100 and 1000 mg l and multi metal solutions the latter contained cu zn and ni at 1 10 50 100 and 1000 mg l 10 fold lower concentrations of cr and pb and 100 fold lower concentrations of cd as in the leaching experiments 10 g samples of dry material were shaken in 100 ml milli q water for 24 h metal concentrations in solution determined by methodology described in section 2 8 were then used to calculate adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity q of each material by equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 a d s o r p t i o n c i c f c i 100 2 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q m g m e t a l g m a t e r i a

adsorbate 100 ml the adsorption data were fitted to linear freundlich langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich sorption isotherms generally the langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich sorption isotherms provided the best fits i e highest r2 values so the linear and freundlich isotherms will not be discussed further however it is important to emphasize that these equations are merely numerical relationships used to fit data and the isotherm equation parameters are only valid for the chemical conditions under which the experiment was conducted thus they cannot be used to predict metal adsorption behavior in environments with differences in ionic strength ph metal concentrations presence of other substances longer or shorter contact times etc underlying assumptions of the langmuir isotherm used in the linear form here equation 3 are that the adsorbent has a homogenous surface with monolayer adsorption at a finite number of identical and equivalent sorption sites with equal affinity for the adsorbate moreover it is assumed that there is no lateral interaction or steric hindrance between adsorbed molecules even at adjacent sorption sites foo and hameed 2010 note steric hindrance would limit q max but lateral interaction could potentially either restrict or increase it 3 linearized langmuir c f q e q m a x k l 1 c f q m a x here c f is the final concentration of a metal q e mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the affinity constant the characteristics of the langmuir adsorption process can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant known as the separation factor r l 4 r l 1 1 k l c i the value of r l indicates whether adsorption is unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 by plotting c f q e vs c f the langmuir constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 assumptions underlying the temkin isotherm using the linear form in equation 5 are that bonding energy is uniformly distributed with the heat of adsorption decreasing linearly with coverage ignoring extremely low and very high concentrations 5 linearized temkin q e b ln k t b ln c f here b kj mol equation 6 is a constant related to the heat of adsorption 6 b r t b t where r kj kmol is the gas constant t k is temperature in kelvin b t is a dimensionless model constant and k t l mg is the equilibrium binding constant by plotting q e vs lnc f the temkin constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 bolis 2013 the dubinin radushkevich isotherm using the linear form presented in equation 7 is based on assumptions of a heterogeneous surface which is more realistic since solutions and materials are rarely perfectly mixed therefore the surfaces are unlikely to be homogeneous as is assumed for the langmuir isotherm linearized dubinin radushkevich 7 ln q e ln q s k d r ε 2 here ɛ equation 8 is

exchange 8 e 16 kj mol or chemical e 16 kj mol by plotting lnq e vs ɛ 2 the dubinin radushkevich constants can be calculated from the slope and intercept respectively foo and hameed 2010 2 5 batch adsorption kinetics metal uptake rates and contact times needed for completion of adsorption reactions were assessed by batch kinetic experiments with two single metal solutions cu and zn concentration 10 mg l and one multi metal solution with 10 mg l of cu zn and ni 1 mg l of pb and cr and 0 1 mg l of cd the time steps were 1 h 3 h 6 h 10 h and 24 h and the protocol was the same as that applied in the batch adsorption experiments except that samples were collected for analysis at each time step data were fitted against pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models with the pseudo second order kinetic model equation 10 providing the best fit highest r 2 values hence the pseudo first order kinetic equation will not be discussed further 10 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e t

adsorbed 100 ml of a multi metal solution with 100 mg l of cu zn and ni 10 mg l of pb and cr and 1 mg l of cd were added to 10 g of each filter material and shaken for 24 h the adsorbed metals were then subjected to sequential extraction analysis by an accredited laboratory as follows a sample of each material was ground in a steel dish and treated according to the swedish standard ss 028113 1 it was then acidified by adding 1 hno3 v v and analyzed by icp sfms cd and pb according to standards ss en iso 17294 1 2 modified and epa method 200 8 modified or icp aes cr cu ni zn according to standards ss en iso 11805 modified and epa method 200 7 modified to determine residual amounts of metals in the samples they were dried at 50 c and treated according to standards astm d3682 2013 astm d4503 2008 and ss en 13656 2003 then analyzed by icp sfms according to standards ss en iso 17294 2 2016 and epa method 200 8 1994 six fractions were extracted i adsorbed and exchangeable metals and carbonates ii labile organic forms iii amorphous fe and mn oxides iv crystalline fe oxides v stable organic forms and sulfides and vi residuals fractions i v are potentially mobile fraction i contains

undesired metal salts metal nitrates were used since nitrates have no any affinity for metals to avoid precipitation of metal oxides the ph of the solutions was not adjusted hence they had partly lower ph 4 6 5 depending on metal and solution than what is common for stormwater runoff the actual concentrations of all solutions were determined by an accredited external laboratory als scandinavia luleå sweden by icp sfms 2 8 general procedures analytical methodology all experiments were conducted at room temperature 18 6 c 0 6 according to two ebro ebi310 temperature loggers before weighing samples for the experiments all filter materials were dried in incubators for at least 24 h at 35 c above which om may oxidize thus changing material properties then the materials were mixed with a plastic spoon and 10 g of material was randomly collected the solid to liquid ratio in all experiments was 1 10 10 g of dry material to 100 ml of solution all experiments except the sequential leaching were run in duplicate however if results differed markedly an extra replicate was run which was only the case in a very few instances controls solution without filter material were included in all runs samples were shaken on two orbital shaking tables set to 200 rpm in all cases the ph of the metal solutions was measured using a field ph meter ph330 wtw gmbh weilheim germany after shaking all samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters filtropur s and sent for analysis of the dissolved metals at an accredited laboratory als scandinavia luleå sweden at the laboratory each liquid sample was acidified by addition of 1 ml hno3 per 100 ml then analyzed by icp sfms according to standards ss en iso 17294 1 2 modified and epa method 200 8 modified 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter material characteristics as shown in table 2 the ph of ltu top and nc usa were 6 1 and 6 3 respectively the ph of dwa chalk was 9 2 and the ph of all the other materials ranged from 7 7 to 8 8 materials with biochar additive hekla b and hasselfors had the highest ssa and om contents in contrast the sand based materials ltu top dwa and dwa chalk without biochar additives have low om contents and small ssa hasselfors had by far the largest d50 and second lowest cu table 2 so it is much coarser mainly gravel and more heterogeneous material than the others fig 1 despite variations in d50 and cu the psd analysis confirmed that all the other materials are primarily sandy materials fig 1 3 2 initial leaching after 24 h of shaking in 100 ml milli q water cd and cr concentrations in the water were most often below the detection limit table 3 all materials except dwa and dwa chalk including the control leached cu table 3 ni pb and zn leaching from some of the materials as well as zn from the control was also observed however only hekla and hekla b had significantly higher concentrations of cu and zn than the control and hence the observed leachates of cu and zn from the other materials cannot be regarded as actual leaching furthermore hekla and hekla b had the highest leachates of pb and ni as well unfortunately it was not possible to clarify the reason s for the leaching of cu and zn in the controls but the concentrations detected in the initial leaching tests table 3 are much lower than concentrations used in the batch adsorption batch kinetic and sequential extraction experiments so leaching from the materials did not substantially influence the results 3 3 batch adsorption experiments large variations in metal adsorption between the materials were detected fig 2 especially at the highest metal concentrations while some materials adsorbed most of the metals even at the highest initial concentrations dwa nc usa and ltu top adsorbed zn ni and cd less efficiently especially from the multi metal solutions as shown in fig 2 amounts of the metals adsorbed generally increased with increases in initial concentration while the materials had sufficient adsorption sites to adsorb all most metals at the lower initial concentrations the potential adsorption capacity became increasingly saturated as initial concentration increased until the amount of metals exceeded the number of adsorption sites meena et al 2008 thus all materials adsorbed essentially all available metals at the two lowest initial concentrations whereas differences in adsorption capacity between materials appeared at the higher initial concentrations furthermore adsorption of zn ni and cd from the multi metal solution were lower at the highest initial concentration than at the second highest concentration more cu and especially zn were generally adsorbed from the single metal solutions than from the multi metal solutions at the three highest initial concentrations fig 2 this was probably due to a lack of adsorption sites as well as competition between metals for available adsorption sites kb ohio and bn ohio were consistently amongst the three materials with the highest adsorption capacities while ltu top dwa and nc usa were amongst the three with the lowest adsorption capacities furthermore for the materials ltu top nc usa dwa and hekla b in some cases higher final metal concentrations were recorded at the highest initial concentrations fig 2 this observation was not due to leaching since these concentrations table 3 were far lower than the increase in metal concentrations observed at these high initial concentrations 1000 mg l for cu zn and ni 100 mg l for cr and pb 10 mg l for cd these concentrations exceeded the metal sorption capacity by far thus the percentage of the metals which was adsorbed by these materials was rather negligible and consequently initial and final concentrations were approximately the same the uncertainty of the analytical method approximately 20 at the highest initial concentrations involved that in some samples the reported final concentration was slightly higher than the initial one hence the observed higher final concentrations is most likely explained by that analytical uncertainty this is further supported by the fact that the duplicates did not deviate considerably from each other several of the materials included in this study have been previously tested in pilot and field scale although it showed very low adsorption capacities in the present study fig 2 ltu top efficiently removed metals in pilot scale bioretention facilities under various ambient conditions e g blecken et al 2009 blecken et al 2011 søberg et al 2017 dwa chalk consistently adsorbed more metals than dwa fig 2 in accordance with a previous survey of full scale bioretention facilities with these filter materials grotehusmann et al 2016 this also confirmed the importance of adding chalk for metal adsorption as recommended in the german guidelines for bioretention dwa 2005 in an evaluation of two full scale bioretention cells at north carolina state university luell 2011 observed relatively low removal of total cu 23 43 dissolved cu 17 49 and total zn 79 this is consistent with nc usa being amongst the three materials with the lowest adsorption capacities in the present study fig 2 the kb ohio material removed 68 and 83 of total zn and pb respectively in previous field scale bioretention tests but leached ca cu fe mg and mn winston et al 2015 in the present study kb ohio showed excellent adsorption of all tested metals and was consistently amongst the top three materials fig 2 however it should be noted that winston et al 2015 and luell 2011 focused on full scale systems exposed to numerous uncontrolled factors in contrast to the lab scale systems maintained under controlled conditions in the present study additionally field scale tests also account for particulate bond metals unlike the current study no previous tests of metal adsorption by hekla hekla b hasselfors or orbicon have been published despite their widespread use in bioretention in sweden and denmark the isotherm that provided the best fit to the data depended on the metal type of solution and filter material for the two single metal solutions the langmuir isotherms generally provided the best fit however for the single metal solutions all isotherms had high 0 8 r2 values table s1 the isotherm of best fit for adsorption from the multi metal solutions depended on the metal in these cases the langmuir isotherm provided the best fit for cu ni and pb adsorption the dubinin radushkevich isotherm the best fit for zn and cd adsorption and the temkin isotherm the best fit for cr adsorption table s1 however the other isotherms could also be applied for most of the metals apart from cr from multi metal solutions albeit while generating somewhat lower r2 values table s1 these findings illustrate that the complexity of metal adsorption increases with increases in the number of metals present due to competition between metals for binding sites so different metals do not necessarily exhibit the same behavior under identical conditions bradl 2004 this phenomenon is evidenced by the observed lower adsorption of cu and zn from multi metal solutions than from single metal solutions fig 2 the calculated isotherm parameters table s1 confirm that ltu top dwa and nc usa consistently adsorbed the lowest quantity of metals for example the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity constant the dubinin radushkevich adsorption capacity constant and the temkin heat of adsorption constant for adsorption of cu from single and multi metal solutions zn from single metal solutions and pb from multi metal solutions were consistently lowest for these three filter materials accordingly the temkin model constant and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energy were consistently higher in these cases the relatively poor performance of ltu top dwa and nc usa was also supported by the temkin isotherm model constants for adsorption of cr from the multi metal solutions table s1 however the trends were less clear for adsorption of zn ni and cd from multi metal solutions and were only supported by the dubinin radushkevich model constants despite the langmuir isotherm providing a better fit for adsorption of ni and relatively high r2 values for adsorption of zn and cd from the multi metal solutions for some of the filter materials final concentrations of zn ni and cd in experiments with the most concentrated multi metal solution were higher than the initial concentrations this resulted in negative adsorption capacity values which reduced the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities and probably explains the relatively indistinct patterns in adsorption of zn ni and cd from multi metal solutions table s1 with a few exceptions the calculated isotherm parameters table s1 also confirm that kb ohio and bn ohio generally provided the best dissolved metal adsorption for example the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity constant dubinin radushkevich adsorption capacity constant and temkin heat of adsorption constant were highest for these materials while the temkin model constant and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energy were lowest table s1 3 4 batch adsorption kinetics the batch adsorption kinetic data fitted the lagergren pseudo second order kinetic equation well with r2 values close to 1 table s2 despite differences between materials the adsorption process was relatively fast within an hour most of the materials had adsorbed 90 of the metals fig 3 and half life times of less than a minute were observed table s2 adsorption by ltu top nc usa and dwa was generally lower and slower than the other materials fig 3 dwa chalk had a lower initial adsorption rate and longer half life time than the remaining six materials table s2 but equally high equilibrium adsorbate concentrations fig 3 table s2 hekla and hekla b had slower and lower adsorption of cr from multi metal solutions fig 3 and thus the longest half life times and lowest equilibrium adsorbate concentrations for cr table s2 with typical infiltration rates of 300 mm h fawb 2008 hunt et al 2012 contact times for a 600 mm deep filter are generally at least 2 h although in practice the infiltration rate of course varies depending on the type of material filter depth root macro pores bioturbation and level of clogging as 90 of the metals were adsorbed within an hour actual retention times in full scale bioretention should be adequate for high metal removal it has been commonly observed that a majority of metal adsorption happens in the upper layers of bioretention e g søberg et al 2017 which would support the assumption of rather quick adsorption processes further stormwater sediment and thus particulate metals are trapped on top of the filter which also contributes to the high metal concentrations in this layer 3 5 sequential extractions the sequential extractions revealed that in most cases the largest fraction of the metals adsorbed by all of the materials was fraction i the exchangeable fraction followed by the labile organic forms ii and amorphous fe and mn oxides iii fractions fig 4 the high percentages of potentially leachable fractions imply an obvious risk of adsorbed metals being desorbed by changes in the ionic composition of ambient water or development of oxidizing conditions tessier et al 1979 for instance during extended dry periods which have been shown to affect metal removal in bioretention blecken et al 2009 and or after maintenance karlsson et al 2016 the latter becomes evident considering that metals primarily accumulate in the top 5 cm of bioretention filter materials e g søberg et al 2017 generally the filter materials having high om contents hekla hekla b hasselfors and bn ohio table 2 had higher percentages of adsorbed metals in fraction ii labile organic forms fig 4 particularly percentages of adsorbed cu and pb in fraction ii were relatively high in the hekla b and bn ohio materials hence the addition of om in forms of e g a top mulch layer as previously recommended in the usa li and davis 2008 or compost for the enhancement of metal removal fassman et al 2013 may not be sustainable for efficient metal removal on a long term basis since these metals are likely to be released to solution as the om degrades the partitioning of cr was distinctive as the percentage adsorbed in the exchangeable fraction was low in several materials fig 4 moreover substantial percentages of cr but no other metals adsorbed by several materials were detected in fractions iv and v for example 18 of cr adsorbed to fraction v stable organic forms and sulfides in hasselfors and 15 adsorbed to fraction iv more crystalline fe oxides in ltu top fig 4 there were no obvious similarities between the six filter materials that adsorbed higher proportions of cr in fractions ii v than in fraction i table 2 however cr iii is rapidly adsorbed by soil specifically by fe and mn oxides having particularly high affinities for fe oxides bradl 2004 furthermore cr adsorption increases with increases in ph and om content but decreases in the presence of competing cations including ions of the other five metals considered here bradl 2004 this might at least partly explain why fractionation patterns of cr strongly differed from those of the other metals 3 6 discussion conflicting results have been observed in previous studies regarding removal of dissolved metals in stormwater bioretention systems some have found that dissolved metals are efficiently retained e g blecken et al 2011 wang et al 2017 while others have found substantial leaching e g muthanna et al 2007 hatt et al 2008 søberg et al 2017 efficient removal indicates that metals are bound to the filter material in more stable forms than found in this study or that oxidation of om did not occur however metals in the exchangeable fraction are likely to be desorbed and potentially re adsorbed further down in the filter material moreover the bioretention systems examined in the cited studies muthanna et al 2007 hatt et al 2008 blecken et al 2011 wang et al 2017 søberg et al 2017 were relatively young 2 years and found metals to be adsorbed in the top 5 cm of the filter material hence these systems were far from saturated with metals thus the zone with higher metal concentrations might gradually extend downwards in the filter material the metal fractionation results from this study indicate that substantial amounts of metals in filter materials may be in potentially leachable forms this has clear implications for the materials long term performance during and after long dry periods and their disposal after maintenance when risks of metal desorption during excavation and movement of excavated filter material must be considered sequential extractions of filter materials from two approximately four year old full scale bioretention facilities in washington d c and maryland usa indicated that adsorbed metals were strongly bound to the bioretention filter material and largely immobile not in the exchangeable fraction li and davis 2008 jones and davis 2013 however after extended dry periods promoting aeration and oxidation of the filter material high metal concentrations in bioretention effluent have been detected by blecken et al 2009 this may have been due to metal adsorption in potentially leachable forms although the filter material similar to ltu top was not subjected to confirmatory sequential extraction in contrast in a laboratory scale study of cd removal by four bioretention filter materials fine sand zeolite sand and quartz sand accumulated cd was detected mainly in the residual form wang et al 2017 moreover another study of metal fractionation in soil underlying infiltration facilities i e not in engineered bioretention filter material found that metal fractionation changed over time proportions of cu and pb in the exchangeable fraction decreased while proportions of zn and cd increased kumar 2016 these partly conflicting results in combination with findings of this study and previously reported effects of drying clearly show that further analyses of metal fractionation in bioretention filter material are required inter alia there are needs to evaluate risks posed by remobilization of adsorbed metals in bioretention filter materials under various ambient conditions and with different filter material compositions e g contents of compost biochar and similar organic substances which may degrade over time fassman et al 2013 both chemisorption and physisorption of metals release heat but the amounts of heat released differ substantially in ranges of ca 80 400 kj mol and 5 45 kj mol respectively bolis 2013 the temkin isotherm heat of adsorption constants and dubinin radushkevich mean sorption energies obtained in this study were 1 2 and 5 1 kj mol respectively table s1 indicative of physical sorption processes the langmuir separation factors table s1 also indicate that the adsorption processes were favorable but not irreversible 0 r l 1 and thus largely physical in physical adsorption the bonds are relatively weak and easily break bolis 2013 further the metals may be adsorbed in several layers of molecules and easily desorbed by changes in temperature or other ambient water variables bolis 2013 these observations are consistent with findings in the present study that most of the adsorbed metals were in the exchangeable i labile organic ii and amorphous fe and mn oxides iii fractions fig 4 where metals are easily desorbed by changes in ambient water ionic composition and under oxidizing conditions tessier et al 1979 chalk calcium carbonate contents of soils have been associated with metal fixation and are considered important for metal adsorption and hence their soluble concentrations alloway et al 1988 its addition seemed to enhance metal adsorption since dwa chalk consistently adsorbed higher amounts of the metals than dwa fig 1 the relatively low ssa low om content high d50 and high coefficient of uniformity table 2 of dwa chalk are not favorable characteristics for metal adsorption hence its high ph due to the chalk additive is presumably the main characteristic that favors metal adsorption in recent years biochar has received considerable attention as a soil additive for heavy metal adsorption in stormwater treatment systems because it has various metal ion binding functional groups and increases ssa due to its high porosity mohanty et al 2018 however no significant difference p 0 872 for a two sample t test at 95 ci in metal adsorption were observed between hekla and hekla b which are identical except for the presence and absence of biochar figs 2 and 3 further adsorption parameters of both hasselfors and hekla b the materials containing biochar were moderate and did not substantially differ from those of the other materials figs 2 and 3 accordingly a recent review of the utility of biochar as an additive in stormwater treatment systems concluded that it has varying capacity to remove metals mohanty et al 2018 results herein would not support its use for metal removal the materials with the highest metal adsorption kb ohio bn ohio and orbicon all have relatively high ph and ssa low to medium om contents and are classified as sand with relatively uniform grainsize table 2 conversely dwa ltu top and nc usa the materials with the lowest metal adsorption have markedly lower ph than the other materials small ssa and low om contents table 2 hence filter materials with a naturally high ph low to medium om contents large ssa and uniform particles in the sand range seem optimal for retaining dissolved metals in stormwater bioretention systems the hasselfors material is coarser than the other materials being based on gravel rather than sand fig 1 table 2 thus it is likely to provide shorter retention times than the other materials and its metal adsorption rates may be lower than those observed in this study in practice in contrast the orbicon material has much smaller particles than the other materials fig 1 table 2 which might pose risks for clogging and thus overflow or bypass a major challenge when selecting bioretention filter materials is balancing high infiltration rates but lower adsorption and contact time offered by coarse materials and potentially higher adsorption and longer contact time but higher overflow offered by finer materials previous studies have found that percentages of most metals in exchangeable fractions of stormwater sediments pond sediments gully pot sediments road dust etc are low or non detectable marsalek and marsalek 1997 karlsson et al 2016 jayarathne et al 2017 however jayarathne et al 2017 found approximately 50 of adsorbed zn and cd in the exchangeable fraction furthermore li and davis 2008 found a close relationship between capture of metals and runoff particles hence the sediment trapped by stormwater bioretention systems will affect the metal fractionation as well as the filter material results of this study show that filter materials for stormwater bioretention have numerous differences and complex sometimes conflicting characteristics all of which may affect metal treatment hence identifying the optimal mixture is challenging especially as other objectives e g supporting plants treatment of other pollutants and low cost must also be met 4 conclusion all the tested materials adsorbed metals although as metal concentrations increased and metal solutions became more complex the adsorption of some metals decreased furthermore adsorption was generally fast and within an hour more than 90 of most metals was adsorbed the material that performed best depended on both the metal and solution single or multi metal however filter materials with a naturally high ph relatively low to moderate om content large ssa and uniform sand sized particles e g kb ohio bn ohio and orbicon generally seems to be good choices for removing dissolved metals addition of chalk may also help to improve metal adsorption by increasing the filter material s ph while biochar addition seems to have no direct impact despite increasing materials ssa and om contents moreover adding it may be undesirable due to its degradation over time high percentages of the adsorbed metals were found in the potentially leachable fractions with obvious implications for long term performance of the materials their functionality under varying conditions and the maintenance of bioretention facilities

20011,basic understanding of formation of aerobic granular sludge ags has mainly been derived from lab scale systems with simple influents containing only highly diffusible volatile fatty acids vfa as organic substrate this study compares start up of ags systems fed by different synthetic and municipal wastewaters ww characterised by increasing complexity in terms of non diffusible organic substrate four ags reactors were started with the same inoculum activated sludge and operated for one year the development of ags settling characteristics nutrient and substrate removal performance as well as microbial community composition were monitored our results indicate that the higher the content of diffusible organic substrate in the ww the faster the formation of ags the presence of non diffusible organic substrate in the influent ww led to the formation of small granules and to the presence of 20 40 of total suspended solids of flocs in the ags when ags was fed with complex influent ww the classical phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms pao gao were outcompeted by their fermentative equivalents substrate and nutrient removal was observed in all reactors despite the difference in physical and settling properties of the ags but the levels of p and n removal depended on the influent carbon composition mechanistically our results indicate that increased levels of non diffusible organic substrate in the influent lower the potential for microbial growth deep inside the granules additionally non diffusible organic substrates give a competitive advantage to the main opponents of ags formation ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho both of these mechanisms are suspected to limit ags formation the presented study has relevant implications for both practice and research start up duration of ags systems treating high complexity ww were one order of magnitude higher than a typical lab scale system treating vfa rich synthetic ww and biomass as flocs persisted as a significant fraction finally the complex synthetic influent ww composed of vfa soluble fermentable and particulate substrate tested here seems to be a more adequate surrogate of real municipal ww for laboratory studies than 100 vfa ww graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge influent composition low strength municipal wastewater microbial community particulate substrate 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags systems have been developed over the past 20 years and now offer a relevant alternative over conventional activated sludge systems morgenroth et al 1997 advantages of ags include enhanced settling properties a high suspended solid concentration and the co existence of different redox conditions across the granules which result in significant energy footprint and chemical savings khan et al 2015 worldwide more than 40 full scale plants are now in operation treating a wide range of municipal and industrial wastewaters pronk et al 2017 however the performance and or granulation process of ags systems are often hampered by the wastewater composition guimarães et al 2018 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 guimarães et al 2017 to optimise the performances of such systems it is therefore required to understand the link between the influent composition and the granule formation lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs have been extensively used to develop our fundamental understanding of ags systems weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016b de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 those studies were mainly conducted using high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfa e g acetate and or propionate and phosphorus the key role of anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions on the granule formation was identified de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 these conditions favour the growth of slow growing organisms like polyphosphate pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao which have been identified as key players in granulation de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the growth of pao and gao and ultimately the granulation is improved by the presence of soluble organic carbon fermented or not in the influent the selective uptake of soluble organic carbon by pao and gao outcompete ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho oho growth hampers the formation of granular biomass or the nutrient removal performances while it also promotes the formation of flocs de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a weissbrodt et al 2014 novák et al 1993 if the growth of pao and gao is crucial for the formation of aerobic granules during treatment of vfa rich influent it is then intuitive that granulation might be hampered during treatment of municipal ww containing high particulate organic substrate xb and low vfa fractions a key aspect in understanding ags systems is in characterizing the microbial community composition and understanding how it influences the granulation process the microbial communities of ags systems fed with 100 vfa ww are well described in literature and dominated by gammapropteobacteria in particular the pao candidatus ca accumulibacter and the gaos from the competibacteraceae family weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016a henriet et al 2016 most of these bacteria have a metabolism adapted to vfa uptake under anaerobic conditions it is also likely that those bacteria are not able to ferment most sugars and amino acids or to hydrolyse polymers marques et al 2017 kong et al 2006 so far only few studies have characterised the microbial communities of ags treating ww containing xb hence the core microbial community of these ags has not been identified yet wang et al 2018 szabó et al 2017a świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 kang et al 2018 fermentative and hydrolysing bacteria are expected to be abundant in such systems similarly to enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems treating municipal ww kong et al 2008 the fermentative pao tetrasphaera does not store vfa in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and is usually more abundant than ca accumulibacter in danish ebpr ww treatment plants mielczarek et al 2013 tetrasphaera can take up orthophosphate aerobically after anaerobic storage of different carbon sources like amino acids and glucose nguyen et al 2011 micropruina is also commonly found in ebpr activated sludge saunders et al 2016 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 micropruina is a fermentative gao able to take up and ferment various carbon sources anaerobically to constitute glycogen reserves mcilroy et al 2018 it is however unclear to what extent tetrasphaera and micropruina play a role in the formation of ags during treatment of complex ww with a high xb content a key aspect of this study will be to characterise the microbial communities found in ags systems fed with ww containing different fractions and types of xb another objective will be to identify correlations between these communities and the sludge settling properties and nutrient removal performance if the ww composition influences the microbial community it is reasonable to expect that the granulation process of ags systems is also impacted e g physical properties of biomass and start up kinetics a harsh selection of fast settling biomass in lab scale reactors fed with 100 vfa synthetic ww resulted in rapid granulation within two weeks weissbrodt et al 2013 mosquera corral et al 2011 but nutrient removal was impaired for weeks to months lochmatter and holliger 2014 successfully started up an ags system within 28 days without loss of nutrient removal by applying a more gentle washout of slow settling biomass and by adapting the organic loading during the early stages of start up start up of ags systems with municipal ww can be significantly longer harsh selection pressure on slow settling biomass can lead to fast granulation e g 20 days de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 but the time reported to transform activated sludge into ags while maintaining the nutrient removal performance have normally been much longer 40 400 days liu et al 2010 giesen et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 therefore this study aims to clarify the link between start up kinetics and influent ww composition while similar operating conditions are applied and the same inoculum activated sludge is used the diffusibility and uptake rate of organic carbon directly influences the microbial competition for substrate and in turn the granulation fig 1 a slow anaerobic conversion of non diffusible xb combined with a decreased substrate availability within the granule can result in carbon leakage i e carbon available in aerobic conditions carbon leakage favours oho growth to the detriment of paos gaos and fermenters and ultimately result in floc formation larsen and harremoës 1994 morgenroth et al 2002 wagner et al 2015 jabari et al 2016 suresh et al 2018 for municipal ww non diffusible xb usually represents 50 of the total influent chemical oxygen demand cod tchobanoglous et al 2014 based on the current knowledge the formation of ags during treatment of xb rich ww might thus be hampered in addition it remains unclear whether flocs are detrimental to ags systems when non diffusible xb represents a high proportion of the influent cod the main goal of this study was to understand the link between influent ww composition microbial community physical ags parameters and nutrient removal performance the specific research questions were to better understand how the ww composition in terms of diffusible and non diffusible organic substrates i influences the overall microbial community development ii divides the microbial community between flocs and granules iii governs nutrient removal iv defines physical characteristics such as settling properties sludge morphology and v influences the success and duration of start up of ags systems when similar operating conditions are applied four lab scale sbr were inoculated with the same activated sludge and operated for over 400 days in parallel four distinct wws were used 100 vfa synthetic complex synthetic municipal primary effluent and municipal raw ww the sludge properties

complex synthetic ww r2 primary effluent municipal ww r3 and raw municipal ww r4 those four wws mainly differed with regards of the carbon source i e concentrations in volatile fatty acids soluble and particulate organic substrates table 1 after approximatively three months of operation r4 was restarted due to complete sludge loss data of r4 fed with raw ww are thus shown for the first run run 1 and the second run run 2 2 2 experimental set up the four sbrs comprised a mixed liquor volume of 12 9 l height to diameter ratio 8 4 and were operated in simultaneous fill draw mode the sbr cycles consisted of the following phases i anaerobic phase 90 min ii aerobic phase 240 min iii settling duration see description below and iv selective excess sludge withdrawal 60 s with a total cycle length of 5 6 h 4 3 cycles per day the anaerobic phase comprised an anaerobic plug flow feeding pf and an anaerobic idle the latter was changed to anaerobic mixing on day 357 and 289 for reactors r3 and r4 run 2 respectively the ww upflow velocity during pf feeding vww was set to 0 25 m h 1 anaerobic pf idle and 0 38 m h 1 anaerobic pf mixing the volume exchange ratio ver was set to 0 3 the oxygen concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled with a setpoint of 2 00 mg o2 l 1 mixing was provided by a mechanical stirrer during anaerobic pf mixing and by aeration during aerobic conditions

control and data acquisition scada system all reactors were inoculated with activated sludge from the ww treatment plant wwtp thunersee switzerland which performs biological carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 3 start up approach the start up approach was based on the strategy developed by lochmatter and holliger 2014 the selective pressure on slow settling biomass was first maintained at a low level in order to prevent too high washout stress this was achieved by slowly increasing the critical settling velocity vcrit from 1 7 to 5 1 m h 1 an increase in vcrit was iteratively

vcrit was decreased again the procedure was repeated on a weekly basis also long anaerobic and aerobic phases were applied total cycle duration 5 6 h in order to improve anaerobic cod uptake and aerobic nutrient removal finally vww was kept low 0 25 0 38 m h 1 in order to provide a high substrate gradient during anaerobic plug flow feeding and improve anaerobic cod uptake 2 4 start up

substrate vfa or fermentable in the ww resulted in better settling properties fig 2 low svi30 and svi ratios close to 1 were measured for the ags of r1 and r2 high content in diffusible organic substrate larger svi30 and svi ratios close to 0 8 were on the other hand measured for the ags of r3 and r4 high content in non diffusible organic substrate the svi30 of the sludge of r1 and r2 decreased rapidly during the first 30 days of operation and then stabilised at 30 50 ml g 1 simultaneously svi ratios 0 9 were measured only 1 2 weeks were thus required to achieve granulation in these two reactors based on their svi30 values over long term the svi30 and svi ratios of ags of r2 remained more variable in comparison with the ones of r1 achieving good settling properties for the systems fed by municipal ww required a much longer period several months to over 1 year the svi30 values of the ags of r4 steadily decreased within the first 100 days of operation to 50 ml g 1 for both runs and stabilised at svi30 70 ml g 1 after 170 d for r4 run 2 ags of r3 responded sensitively to changing operating conditions which resulted in variable and high svi30 values from day 0 200 svi30 80 ml g 1 and svi30 10 ratio 0 8 were finally achieved quickly after introduction of anaerobic pf mixing from day 357 for r3 successful start up based on settling parameters svi30 90 ml g 1 and svi30 10 ratio 0 8 was achieved within the first two weeks for r1 and r2 a much longer start up time was required for ags of r4 and r3 around 34 and 163 days were required to achieve successful start up based on settling parameters for ags of r4 run 2 and r4 run 1 respectively r3 was successfully started up only after 400 days 3 2 sludge size fractions the effect of the influent composition on the granulation process was confirmed by monitoring the different biomass size fractions fig 3 the size of the granules greatly varied as a result of the presence of non diffusible xb in the influent high fractions of large granules d 1 mm were observed in r1 only while smaller granules mixed with flocs were observed in r2 r3 and r4 both runs overall successful granulation based on size fractions d 0 25 mm of at least 50 of tss was achieved after 1 1 5 month of operation in all systems ags of r1 was dominated by medium and large diameter granules d 0 63 mm while flocs d 0 25 mm represented only a minor fraction the fraction of granules steadily increased in r1 while flocs simultaneously decreased to about 5 after 50 days of operation large granules gradually replaced small granules and dominated the sludge composition after 100 days of operation the total fraction of granules d 0 25 mm in r1 remained steady throughout the entire reactor operation despite some fluctuations in the individual fractions a major loss of large granules was observed after 300 days of operation in r1 incomplete uptake of carbon during anaerobic conditions possibly caused by pass of the settled sludge bed during plug flow feeding resulted in filamentous outgrowth of the granules supplementary information fig s5d filamentous outgrowth first resulted in an increase of sheared off debris indicated by an increase in d 0 63 mm size fractions followed by breakage of large granules after 390 days of operation though large granules started to develop again ags fed with complex influent ww were mainly composed of small granules 50 70 and flocs 20 40 the ags size fractions measured in the reactors fed with complex synthetic and municipal ww were very similar small granules represented the predominant size fraction with 60 80 almost no large granules developed in these systems rarely above 10 of total biomass also the fractions of flocs decreased from 80 to less than 40 within the first 40 days after day 40 20 40 of flocs remained in the systems until the end of the experiment large fluctuations of size fractions mainly of flocs were only observed in r2 and r3 3 3 evolution of the bacterial community composition from inoculation to stable state the microbial communities were monitored over 426 days for the four reactors 267 samples 12 millions of reads fig 4 the microbial communities developed differently in r1 100 vfa than in r2 r3 and r4 with the latter two being very similar to each other the microbial community in r2 complex synthetic ww was rather similar to the ones of r3 and r4 although some differences could be observed in r1 an initial increase of the gammaproteobacteria with successive changes within this class was observed dechloromonas was progressively replaced by other betaproteobacteriales such as azoarcus or zoogloea whose relative abundance fluctuated greatly during the experiment the proportion of actinobacteria here comprising mainly putative fermenting bacteria gradually decreased to below 2 after day 119 tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter represented 8 and 3 of the inocula communities respectively in r1 the abundance of tetrasphaera decreased progressively and was 0 5 after 100 days whereas the abundance of ca accumulibacter fluctuated between 0 1 and 8 in r2 r3 and r4 actinobacteria became abundant 30 50 during the two first weeks of operation and stabilised at around 10 after 200 days of operation the abundance of tetrasphaera remained quite stable during the first 130 days in these reactors and then decreased to 1 3 whereas abundance of ca accumulibacter was always 3 the evolution of the microbial communities according to the different wws are represented in the pcoa of the bray curtis distance matrix of the bacterial otus 97 relative abundance fig 5 in all reactors the bacterial community quickly changed first after inoculation transition phase and then stabilised stable state the bacterial communities of r3 and r4 municipal ww evolved towards a similar stable state the bacterial community of r1 evolved very differently from r3 and r4 the evolution of the bacterial community of r2 was different from the one of r1 and quite close to the ones in reactors r3 and r4 the time to reach stable state significantly varied from one reactor to another in r1 and r3 the bacterial community stabilised after 231 days while 178 and 120 days were required for r2 and r4 respectively the evolution of bacterial communities of r4 was similar during run 1 and run 2 the shannon diversity index decreased during the transition phase in particular for the reactors treating synthetic ww supplementary information fig s8 the index was higher in the samples of the stable states in comparison to the samples of the transition phases which supports the pertinence of the criterion applied to determine the stable state a comparison of the proportions of each genus was performed in order to identify the taxa responsible for the differences between the different microbial communities of the four ags systems and the inocula supplementary information fig s11 out of the total 422 taxa 38 were identified as discriminant some of the discriminant taxa were characteristic for ags fed with the simple ww r1 such as meganema or members of the rhodobacteraceae family supplementary information fig s11 other taxa were mainly abundant in the ags fed with real ww inocula r3 and r4 such as propioniciclava iamia acidovorax kouleothrix ca epiflobacter and sulfuritalea several taxa were more abundant in ags treating complex ww whether synthetic or municipal microlunatus the fermentative gao micropruina or the fermentative pao tetrasphaera the following genera were abundant and present in the core community of the systems but not discriminant the pao ca accumulibacter the gao cpb c22 f32 ca microthrix saprospiraceae f rhodobacter thauera and thiotrix finally the proportions of the bacterial taxa of r1 and r2 were compared separately with those of r3 and r4 combined this comparison was performed to assess the effect of synthetic vs real ww on the microbial communities of ags among the 29 abundant taxa in r3 or r4 23 were found in significantly lower proportions in r1 in r2 the number of underrepresented taxa dropped to only 15 supplementary information table s9 3 4 bacterial communities of granules and flocs the presence of non diffusible organic substrate in the ww resulted in 20 40 of flocs in the ags it is thus relevant to understand to what extent the microbial communities in flocs and granules are similar the relative abundances of the main genera in flocs and granules were compared to detect potential enrichment of some genera between those two types of microbial aggregate fig 6 at stable state zoogloea flavobacterium cycu 0281 thauera and trichococcus were enriched in flocs whereas nitrospira ca competibacter rhodobacter terrimonas and cpb cs1 were enriched in granules however only few of these differences were significant supplementary information table s10 when considered separately e g nitrospira in r1 and r4 and thauera in r4 hence in term of microbial community composition flocs are quite similar to granules 3 5 nutrient removal performance overall good substrate nutrient removal and effluent quality was observed for all systems despite significant differences in the sludge properties and granulation process table 2 very low tss concentrations were measured in the effluent of r1 and r2 20 mgtss l 1 as well as in the effluent of r4 run 1 15 mgtss l 1 the highest tss concentration was measured in the effluent of r3 45 mg tss l 1 during run 2 of r4 tss effluent concentrations 34 mgtss l 1 were lower than in r3 but still higher in comparison to r4 run 1 as well as r1 and r2 excellent cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were observed in all reactors except r3 for r1 r2 and r4 the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were consistently larger than 90 and 95 respectively the sludge loss in the effluent of r3 43 21 mgtss l 1 increased the average cod concentration in its effluent effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were consistently low in all reactors high tn removal 77 via simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was observed in r1 only which was indicated by the lowest no3 n effluent concentrations larger no3 n effluent concentrations measured in the effluent of r2 r3 and r4 resulted from a larger accumulation of no3 n during the aerobic phase compared to r1 since full nitrification was observed in all systems it can be concluded that the higher no3 n effluent concentrations result from a lower simultaneous denitrification rate during aerobic bulk conditions po4 p removal was constant and high 90 for ags of r1 and r2 only ags of r4 run 1 and run 2 showed lower po4 p removal of 61 and 78 on average respectively the lowest po4 p removal was observed for ags of r3 however po4 p removal of r3 and r4 run 2 improved up to 95 after introducing anaerobic pf mixing at day 357 and 289 respectively overall successful start up of the reactors in terms of substrate nutrient removal was achieved long before achieving good settling properties full cod and nh4 n removal were observed right after inoculation of the systems high p removal was observed without delay for r1 and r2 while stable and high biological phosphorus removal was reached after 77 and 93 days for r3 and r4 run 2 respectively r4 run 1 was not able to recover high p removal performance before the restart 3 6 correlations between settling properties nutrient removal performances and microbial community composition multiple factor analysis mfa indicates a correlation between the proportion of soluble cod in the influent a high proportion of medium to big granules and a svi30 10 ratio close to 1 suggesting good granulation and settleability fig 7 the proportion of soluble influent cod also correlated with good nutrient removal performances such as nitrogen total phosphorus or phosphate removal efficiencies tn tp and po4 p removal the projection of the samples in the two dimensional mfa space provides information about the global similarity between samples fig 7b overall samples of r2 are close to the ones of r1 and closer to samples of r4 than r3 at stable state the bacterial communities settling properties size distribution of the sludge and the nutrient removal performances show different individual distributions in the two dimensional space supplementary information fig s17 bacterial communities of ags of r3 and r4 are very similar at stable state and close to the communities of the inoculum supplementary information fig s17a microbial communities of r3 and r4 are clearly distinct from the ones of the reactors treating synthetic ww however closer to the ones of r2 than to those of r1 the projection of the samples forms a gradient from r1 to r3 with r2 and r4 in between based on settling properties and size distribution of the sludge supplementary information fig s17b the links between the microbial communities and the size and density of the biomass is confirmed by the correlation of 0 65 between the two corresponding bray curtis distance matrices supplementary information table s13 and table s12 based on the nutrient removal performance data a majority of samples mainly from r1 r2 and r4 grouped together outliers mainly from r3 surrounded this group supplementary information fig s17c this reflects the fact that ags of r3 had lower nutrient removal performances than ags of the other three reactors even at stable state weak correlation 0 05 between the bray curtis distance matrices of the bacterial communities and the nutrient removal performances supplementary information fig s17 is observed at stable state 3 7 identification of correlations between the discriminant taxa and the sludge size distributions the settling properties and the nutrient removal performances three different clusters were identified by correlating the discriminant taxa with the different properties of the sludge fig 8 cluster i correlated with a high proportion of big and medium size granules good settling properties and good nutrient removal it includes the pao ca accumulibacter and its gao competitors from the family competibacteraceae ca competibacter ca contendobacter cpb cs1 aerobic filamentous meganema zoogloea potentially filamentous flavobacterium bacteria and the nitrifying nitrospira also belong to this cluster numerous putative denitrifiers are also part of cluster i zoogloea ca competibacter ca contendobacter ca accumulibacter cluster ii correlates with high proportions of small granules and flocs relatively good settling properties good p removal and partial tn removal it is composed of the aerobic bacteria terrimonas which has the ability to hydrolyse various substrates and amaricoccus which can store carbon in the form of pha it also comprises fermentative or putatively fermentative bacteria such as microlunatus and mesorhizobium for which in situ physiology is not well described yet the bacteria belonging to this cluster were relatively abundant in the reactor treating complex synthetic ww r2 cluster iii contains taxa correlated with high proportions of small granules and flocs poorer settling properties and lower nutrient removal this cluster contains one third of novel or poorly characterised genera such as p58 or dokdonella it also includes fermentative bacteria including tetrasphaera micropruina propioniciclava kouleotrix and trichococcus as cluster i it contains various potential denitrifiers such as iamia sulfuritalea microthrix or acidovorax cluster iii also comprises bacteria likely able to degrade macromolecules e g ca epiflobacter cycu 0281 and members of the family chitinophagaceae these bacteria are more abundant in the systems treating municipal ww inocula r3 r4 members of the genera ca microthrix and trichococcus and the family caldilineaceaepresent in cluster iii can be filamentous and thus impair the settleability of the sludge and be at least in part responsible for the poorer settleability associated with this cluster 4 discussion 4 1 diffusibility of organic substrates has significant influence on formation of ags wastewater composition in terms of diffusible non diffusible organic substrate significantly influences the formation of ags a comparison between the four reactors fed with different amounts of diffusible non diffusible organic substrate helped validating the conceptual model presented above fig 1 fast granulation was observed with wws containing high amounts of diffusible organic substrate r1 and r2 thus resulting in excellent settling properties and stable nutrient removal performances on the other hand a low amount of diffusible organic substrate resulted in slow granulation poorer settling properties and often partial nutrient removal granulation results from the selection of slower growing carbon storing microorganisms over oho de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 vjayan and vadivelu 2017 the high proportions of diffusible organic substrate in r1 and r2 promoted the growth of organisms that can store or use carbon under anaerobic conditions storing microorganisms such as ca accumulibacter classical pao and ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 classical gaos represented an important part of the microbial community of r1 fig 4 in r2 the fermentative pao tetrasphaera and the fermentative gao micropruina were abundant in particular during granulation the influent composition specifically favoured the growth of these organisms which coincided with the rapid development of well settling ags however the size of the granules which developed in r1 and r2 was very different with large granules dominating ags of r1 while smaller granules were observed in r2 if diffusibility of substrate is very high bacterial growth in the deep layers is then promoted ultimately leading to the formation of dense large granules as in r1 granule size is in theory linked to deep substrate penetration into the granule which is influenced by the substrate concentration gradient uptake rate and diffusibility of substrate morgenroth 2008 rittman and mccarty 1981 the nature and content of extracellular polymeric substances eps associated with granule densification is influenced by substrate type and loading and has strong implications on the granule size and settling rusanowska et al 2019 deep substrate diffusion and conversion occurred in r1 as indicated by the high snd measured for this system during the aeration phase denitrification occurred in the anoxic zones of the granules due to previous anaerobic storage of diffusible organic substrate classical pao and gao enriched in the ags of r1 were able to grow under both anoxic and aerobic conditions thus favouring the densification of the granules the lower fractions of diffusible organic substrate in r2 influent resulted in a limited growth in the core of the granules and ultimately in the formation of smaller granules the different properties of the granules of r1 and r2 settling granule size and biomass fractionation etc can thus be explained by the amount and nature of the diffusible and non diffusible substrates vfa fermentable soluble and particulate organic substrate granulation can therefore be linked to two aspects 1 the diffusibility of the substrate governs its availability within the granules and 2 the nature of the substrates determines the microbial community composition and the aggregates densification on the contrary the high proportions of non diffusible xb in the influent of r3 and r4 hampered the granulation process several phenomena lead to the conclusion that hydrolysis is only partial during anaerobic plug flow feeding 1 ww particles are often large from several μm up to 1 2 mm levine et al 1985 dimock and morgenroth 2006 2 hydrolysis is a very slow process benneouala et al 2017 morgenroth et al 2002 jabari et al 2016 and 3 the anaerobic feeding duration of 1 2 h typically applied in ags systems is insufficient to provide full hydrolysis of xb wagner et al 2015 jabari et al 2016 therefore partial anaerobic conversion of xb is unavoidable and results in a high availability of substrate during the subsequent aerobic phase which in turn supports the growth of oho wagner et al 2015 oho growth leads to poorer settling properties due to filamentous outgrowth floc formation or a decrease of p removal novák et al 1993 suresh et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2014 pronk et al 2015a de kreuk et al 2010 extensive oho growth outcompeting slower growing storing organisms is the most likely reason for the slow development of granules bad settling properties and overall lower nutrient removal performance observed for ags of r3 and r4 in comparison to r1 and r2 classical pao and gao were outcompeted by fermentative pao and gao in r3 and r4 and similarly in r2 the enrichment of fermentative pao and gao in those systems is the result of lower influent vfa concentrations combined with large amounts of fermentable substrates stemming from both influent wws and produced via hydrolysis of non diffusible compounds 4 2 start up high concentrations of diffusible organic substrate as found in the synthetic wws of r1 and r2 led to faster granulation 1 month compared to granulation in r3 1 year or r4 5 months a main finding of our study is that different characteristic times were required to establish stable microbial communities stable physical properties of the ags or steady substrate nutrient removal characteristic time to establish full substrate nutrient removal was the quickest around few days weeks while characteristic time to establish a stable microbial community was the slowest several months complete substrate and nutrient removal was observed without any delay right after inoculation with activated sludge for all reactors maintaining high conversion rates after inoculation required an appropriate start up strategy our selected start up strategy relied on applying a low washout stress to avoid a too harsh washout of slow growing organisms full nitrification without no2 accumulation was observed after start up while no or a very short loss of biological p removal was noticed sustained nutrient removal after inoculation was also observed by lochmatter and holliger 2014 who applied a similar start up strategy of low washout stress on slow settling biomass low amounts of diffusible organic substrate in the ww must thus be balanced by a less harsh washout of flocs during start up aggressive washout of slow settling biomass as strategy to start up ags systems using either 100 vfa or municipal ww as influent can result in very short start up times down to 1 and 3 weeks respectively with settleability of svi10 40 ml g 1 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 the current study did not apply aggressive washout of slow settling biomass flocs during start up resulting in significantly slower granule formation since granulation was achieved in all reactors the start up strategy in the current study is viable and relevant even in unfavourable influent ww conditions such as low strength municipal ww maintaining high substrate nutrient conversion rates over long term ultimately resulted in the formation of granules the different kinetics of ags formation confirm the general trend observed in previous studies start up is typically shorter with diffusible only influent ww consisting of 100 vfa 1 4 weeks de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 lochmatter and holliger 2014 weissbrodt et al 2014 than with ww containing non diffusible polymeric compounds such as municipal or industrial ww 3 weeks more than 1 year de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 liu et al 2010 giesen et al 2013 the faster granulation of ags in r4 compared to ags of r3 confirms that higher organic loads facilitate the granulation process nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2017 li et al 2008 rusanowska et al 2019 establishing a stable microbial community required between 4 and 8 months for all systems during this period different transient bacterial communities were observed the transient bacterial community was dominated by zoogloea in r1 fed with 100 vfa ww we propose that the presence of zoogloea in r1 is an indirect consequence of the excellent settling properties of the ags which led to preferential flow and bypass of soluble cod into the aerobic phase supplementary information s15 the growth of zoogloea during the early stage of granulation in r1 likely resulted from the presence of vfa in the aerobic phase weissbrodt et al 2013 similar to the study of weissbrodt et al 2013 the high abundance of zoogloea observed in r1 was associated with a high proportion of granules and a thin settled bed during feeding several studies however suggested that zoogloea plays a positive role in the formation of granules in vfa rich influent ww by producing specific eps li et al 2008 larsen et al 2008 kang et al 2018 therefore the availability of diffusible substrates under aerobic conditions might not automatically be detrimental to granulation in the reactors fed with complex ww r2 r3 and r4 actinobacteria dominated the transitional bacterial community in particular micropruina was very abundant in these three reactors and was concomitant to the formation of granules its role in granulation in complex ww fed ags systems is yet to be determined 4 3 stable state the list of potential organisms that play a functional role in ags systems can be extended based on this study considering their effect on nutrient removal and taking into account the role of different influent compositions however a core microbial community of ags systems cannot be established yet during stable state operation dominant species in r1 were reported as abundant in other 100 vfa fed ags systems such as zoogloea thauera rhodobacter meganema and nitrospira in systems fed with vfas only the pao guild mainly consisted of ca accumulibacter while the gao guild was mostly composed of members of the competibacteraceae family e g ca competibacter cpb c22 f32 weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016a henriet et al 2016 such simple microbial community greatly differs from the ones of r2 r3 and r4 abundant taxa detected in r2 r3 and r4 were previously detected in ags fed with complex ww like e g cycu 0281 dokdonella flavobacterium haliangium nitrospira rhodobacter thauera thrichococcus unclassified genera related to xanthomonadaceae and zoogloea kang et al 2018 szabó et al 2017a świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 fermentative bacteria were present in both r2 and r3 r4 in particular the pao tetrasphaera and the gao micropruina the sole presence of both diffusible and non diffusible organic substrate independent of their nature resulted in relatively similar microbial communities yet the remaining differences between those systems could stem from continuous inoculation of the sludge by bacteria present in the influent ww indeed the similarity of the bacterial communities of r3 and r4 is stronger within ags sampled during the same date than after the same number of days of reactor operation parts of the microbial communities thus stem from immigration of bacteria via the influent ww saunders et al 2016 filamentous oho detected in high proportions in r3 and r4 e g trichococcus and the family caldilineaceae can have a negative impact on the settling properties of the sludge those filamentous oho are characterised by a high affinity for aerobic carbon degradation which is consistent with the presence of slowly biodegradable substrates in the influent of those reactors yet many genera known to have hydrolysing capabilities such as ca epiflobacter cycu 0281 and kouleothrix correlated with low settling properties because they are linked to the presence of xb but not necessarily because they are filamentous during stable state the bacterial communities selected in the different ags systems had multiple taxa in common with the core communities of ebpr activated sludge e g ca accumulibacter micropruina tetrasphaera zoogloea saunders et al 2016 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 but many taxa that are not yet characterised at the genus level were identified they belong to the family of xanthomonadaceae caldilineaceae cytophagaceae or to the phylum of saccharibacteria however their function in ags systems is yet to be determined the grouping of r1 vs r2 r3 r4 based on microbial community also reflected differences in tn removal which was lower in the reactors fed with complex ww tn removal in the systems can occur either via 1 pre denitrification of remaining no3 from the previous cycle during the feeding and subsequent anoxic anaerobic mixing phase or 2 snd during aerobic bulk conditions the latter process requires denitrifying bacteria available cod and the presence of substantial anoxic zones within the granules numerous putative denitrifying bacteria were detected in ags of all reactors but only r1 gathered all the conditions to perform snd resulting in low effluent no3 large granule size and a high proportion of diffusible organic substrate in the influent further research is required to identify the influence of each of these factors on snd and to improve snd in ags systems fed by complex influent ww decreased p removal was observed in ags systems treating municipal ww r3 r4 possibly due to low influent diffusible organic substrate especially vfa in combination with carbon leakage and low influent po4 p concentrations guimarães et al 2018 short term loss of p removal was also observed in r1 concomitantly to bypassing of substrate during pf feeding in addition low ortho p concentrations of the municipal ww received by r3 r4 did not promote the growth of paos de kreuk et al 2010 indeed the proportion of paos was above 5 in the four reactors at stable state these proportions are much lower than the average proportion reported in danish ebpr wwtp 13 and may have made the four systems less robust in terms of p removal nielsen et al 2010 yet the anaerobic carbon uptake and therewith p removal were enhanced by the introduction of an anoxic anaerobic mixed phase after pf feeding 4 4 the role of flocs in ags systems our results indicate that the presence of flocs 20 40 is representative of ags systems fed with wws that contain non diffusible xb fig 3 flocs were observed several months after the establishment of good stable settling properties and substrate nutrient removal flocs fractions ranging from 16 to 40 of tss were also reported in literature for pilot and full scale ags plants derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015b van dijk et al 2018 our results thus indicate that ags systems are hybrid systems composed of both flocs and granules rather than biofilm only systems the presence of flocs in ags systems results from both short term and long term mechanisms short term exposure of the granules to non diffusible xb triggers filamentous outgrowth de kreuk et al 2010 xb attaches to the granule surface and is then partially hydrolysed during the anaerobic phase de kreuk et al 2010 the fraction of xb that is not converted anaerobically is then degraded under aerobic conditions thus promoting the growth of oho and filamentous outgrowth finger type pronk et al 2015a such short term mechanism might however not be relevant for real ags systems in which the sludge is exposed to xb over long term several months years over long term the presence of xb in the influent favours the presence of flocs filamentous structures in turn do not develop on the surface of granules as xb is likely captured degraded by flocs derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 xb attachment onto the granules surface is likely limited during anaerobic pf feeding while the hydrolysis rate is in addition very low especially under anaerobic conditions jabari et al 2016 for these reasons it is expected that significant amount of xb remain available during the mixed aerobic phase we hypothesized that under mixed conditions flocs would have a competitive advantage over granules for capturing and then degrading xb wagner et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 the surface to volume ratio of the flocs is much larger than the one of the regular and round shaped granules andreadakis 1993 mihciokur and oguz 2016 we propose that the availability of xb during the mixed aerobic phase combined with its selective capture by flocs is the main reason for their presence in ags systems treating municipal ww we ultimately suggest that flocs might in fact be beneficial during treatment of complex ww with elevated levels of non diffusible xb using ags technology the microbial communities in the flocs and granules differed only for some particular genera at stable state thus the microbial community structures evolved in a similar manner in both fractions probably due to a constant exchange of biomass between the two fractions liu et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 for the four reactors our results indicate a higher fraction of zoogloea in flocs than in granules the enrichment of zoogloea in flocs was particularly pronounced in the ags of r1 where the proportion of flocs was the lowest 5 and where filamentous outgrowth was often observed the presence of zoogloea in flocs likely resulted from erosion of the granules surface szabó et al 2017b erosion of the granule s surfaces might have been favoured by the low cohesion of filamentous structures resulting from the growth of zoogloea on the contrary the higher abundance of slow growing organisms in granules e g nitrospira likely resulted from favourable growth conditions in the core of the granule the srt gradually increases over the granule s depth thus providing suitable growth conditions for slow growing organisms such as nitrifiers high cohesion within granules also reduces the detachment rate and thus the exchange of bacteria from the granules to the flocs in this case the differences between the bacterial communities of granules and flocs can become significant because both fractions offer different niches and have different retention times winkler et al 2012 it is therefore expected that slow growing bacteria are progressively enriched in the granules the mechanism is confirmed by our measurements of relative abundance of nitrospira ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 moreover the lowest differences between the microbial communities of flocs and granules in r3 can be explained by granulation being more recent compared to the other systems 4 5 implications for research and practice our findings have relevant implications for both research and engineering practice the complex synthetic ww resulted in the development of ags that was more similar to ags fed by municipal ww rather than ags fed by100 vfa we therefore advise the use of complex synthetic ww vfa diffusible fermentable substrate and high non diffusible xb contents as surrogate of municipal ww the proportion and composition of xb can be tuned and modified to address specific research questions in terms of implications for engineering practice our study provides relevant information for the start up of ags systems the superior performance of ags in r4 over ags in r3 indicates that an increased loading was beneficial for granulation and nutrient removal despite the increased fraction of xb in the influent however a balance must be found between applying a sufficient loading while limiting operating costs e g aeration start up time was likely extended due to the chosen start up strategy low washout stress and low vww during pf feeding in comparison to other studies derlon et al 2016 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 but operating the system at low vww also helped maintaining high substrate and nutrient removal rates during the entire experimental phase as observed in the present study and reported in literature derlon et al 2016 lochmatter and holliger 2014 applying a higher selective pressure by gradually increasing the vww during pf feeding would accelerate the formation of granules but based on our experience increasing the selective pressure applied via vcrit is coupled with an increased risk of biomass loss due to the sensitivity of ags systems fed by low strength municipal ww a fine balance between maintaining high srt conditions for forming granules and applying a selective sludge removal of slow settling biomass must be found in terms of nutrient removal partial denitrification due to poor snd proved to be representative of ags systems fed with non diffusible xb an increased tn removal in those systems was achieved by implementing an additional mixed phase following the pf feeding denitrification during this phase likely benefited po4 p removal as observed for r3 and r4 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are 1 the wastewater composition in terms of diffusible and non diffusible organic substrates governs both the microbial community composition granulation kinetics settling properties and nutrient removal of ags high fractions of diffusible organic substrates result in fast granulation and excellent settleability of ags whereas presence of non diffusible xb in the influent hampers granulation reduces settleability and results in the presence of substantial fractions 20 40 of flocs the bacterial communities of flocs and granules were globally very similar within the same reactor but several taxa were enriched in flocs or granules respectively 2 ags fed by vfa based synthetic ww resulted as expected in a specialized bacterial community containing classical pao and gao e g ca accumulibacter ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 that led to fast granulation excellent settling performance stable nutrient removal large granules and a quasi absence of flocs 3 ags fed by complex substrates containing non diffusible xb revealed bacterial communities characterised by a high abundance of fermenting bacteria including fermentative pao and gao high amounts of diffusible organic substrate and total organic load were key factors to enhance the settleability and granulation kinetics of the sludge as well as the stability of nutrient removal performances 4 an increased floc fraction was constitutive in ags reactors fed with complex ww and was attributed to the presence of non diffusible xb in the influent it is neither possible nor desirable to wash out all flocs in ags systems fed with complex ww 5 complex synthetic ww led to ags with characteristics resembling those treating raw municipal ww hence the often applied 100 vfa synthetic ww should be replaced by complex synthetic ww as a surrogate of municipal ww in future lab scale experiments studying ags declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20011,basic understanding of formation of aerobic granular sludge ags has mainly been derived from lab scale systems with simple influents containing only highly diffusible volatile fatty acids vfa as organic substrate this study compares start up of ags systems fed by different synthetic and municipal wastewaters ww characterised by increasing complexity in terms of non diffusible organic substrate four ags reactors were started with the same inoculum activated sludge and operated for one year the development of ags settling characteristics nutrient and substrate removal performance as well as microbial community composition were monitored our results indicate that the higher the content of diffusible organic substrate in the ww the faster the formation of ags the presence of non diffusible organic substrate in the influent ww led to the formation of small granules and to the presence of 20 40 of total suspended solids of flocs in the ags when ags was fed with complex influent ww the classical phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms pao gao were outcompeted by their fermentative equivalents substrate and nutrient removal was observed in all reactors despite the difference in physical and settling properties of the ags but the levels of p and n removal depended on the influent carbon composition mechanistically our results indicate that increased levels of non diffusible organic substrate in the influent lower the potential for microbial growth deep inside the granules additionally non diffusible organic substrates give a competitive advantage to the main opponents of ags formation ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho both of these mechanisms are suspected to limit ags formation the presented study has relevant implications for both practice and research start up duration of ags systems treating high complexity ww were one order of magnitude higher than a typical lab scale system treating vfa rich synthetic ww and biomass as flocs persisted as a significant fraction finally the complex synthetic influent ww composed of vfa soluble fermentable and particulate substrate tested here seems to be a more adequate surrogate of real municipal ww for laboratory studies than 100 vfa ww graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge influent composition low strength municipal wastewater microbial community particulate substrate 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags systems have been developed over the past 20 years and now offer a relevant alternative over conventional activated sludge systems morgenroth et al 1997 advantages of ags include enhanced settling properties a high suspended solid concentration and the co existence of different redox conditions across the granules which result in significant energy footprint and chemical savings khan et al 2015 worldwide more than 40 full scale plants are now in operation treating a wide range of municipal and industrial wastewaters pronk et al 2017 however the performance and or granulation process of ags systems are often hampered by the wastewater composition guimarães et al 2018 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 guimarães et al 2017 to optimise the performances of such systems it is therefore required to understand the link between the influent composition and the granule formation lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs have been extensively used to develop our fundamental understanding of ags systems weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016b de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 those studies were mainly conducted using high concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfa e g acetate and or propionate and phosphorus the key role of anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions on the granule formation was identified de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 these conditions favour the growth of slow growing organisms like polyphosphate pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao which have been identified as key players in granulation de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 the growth of pao and gao and ultimately the granulation is improved by the presence of soluble organic carbon fermented or not in the influent the selective uptake of soluble organic carbon by pao and gao outcompete ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho oho growth hampers the formation of granular biomass or the nutrient removal performances while it also promotes the formation of flocs de kreuk et al 2010 pronk et al 2015a weissbrodt et al 2014 novák et al 1993 if the growth of pao and gao is crucial for the formation of aerobic granules during treatment of vfa rich influent it is then intuitive that granulation might be hampered during treatment of municipal ww containing high particulate organic substrate xb and low vfa fractions a key aspect in understanding ags systems is in characterizing the microbial community composition and understanding how it influences the granulation process the microbial communities of ags systems fed with 100 vfa ww are well described in literature and dominated by gammapropteobacteria in particular the pao candidatus ca accumulibacter and the gaos from the competibacteraceae family weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016a henriet et al 2016 most of these bacteria have a metabolism adapted to vfa uptake under anaerobic conditions it is also likely that those bacteria are not able to ferment most sugars and amino acids or to hydrolyse polymers marques et al 2017 kong et al 2006 so far only few studies have characterised the microbial communities of ags treating ww containing xb hence the core microbial community of these ags has not been identified yet wang et al 2018 szabó et al 2017a świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 kang et al 2018 fermentative and hydrolysing bacteria are expected to be abundant in such systems similarly to enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems treating municipal ww kong et al 2008 the fermentative pao tetrasphaera does not store vfa in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and is usually more abundant than ca accumulibacter in danish ebpr ww treatment plants mielczarek et al 2013 tetrasphaera can take up orthophosphate aerobically after anaerobic storage of different carbon sources like amino acids and glucose nguyen et al 2011 micropruina is also commonly found in ebpr activated sludge saunders et al 2016 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 micropruina is a fermentative gao able to take up and ferment various carbon sources anaerobically to constitute glycogen reserves mcilroy et al 2018 it is however unclear to what extent tetrasphaera and micropruina play a role in the formation of ags during treatment of complex ww with a high xb content a key aspect of this study will be to characterise the microbial communities found in ags systems fed with ww containing different fractions and types of xb another objective will be to identify correlations between these communities and the sludge settling properties and nutrient removal performance if the ww composition influences the microbial community it is reasonable to expect that the granulation process of ags systems is also impacted e g physical properties of biomass and start up kinetics a harsh selection of fast settling biomass in lab scale reactors fed with 100 vfa synthetic ww resulted in rapid granulation within two weeks weissbrodt et al 2013 mosquera corral et al 2011 but nutrient removal was impaired for weeks to months lochmatter and holliger 2014 successfully started up an ags system within 28 days without loss of nutrient removal by applying a more gentle washout of slow settling biomass and by adapting the organic loading during the early stages of start up start up of ags systems with municipal ww can be significantly longer harsh selection pressure on slow settling biomass can lead to fast granulation e g 20 days de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 but the time reported to transform activated sludge into ags while maintaining the nutrient removal performance have normally been much longer 40 400 days liu et al 2010 giesen et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 therefore this study aims to clarify the link between start up kinetics and influent ww composition while similar operating conditions are applied and the same inoculum activated sludge is used the diffusibility and uptake rate of organic carbon directly influences the microbial competition for substrate and in turn the granulation fig 1 a slow anaerobic conversion of non diffusible xb combined with a decreased substrate availability within the granule can result in carbon leakage i e carbon available in aerobic conditions carbon leakage favours oho growth to the detriment of paos gaos and fermenters and ultimately result in floc formation larsen and harremoës 1994 morgenroth et al 2002 wagner et al 2015 jabari et al 2016 suresh et al 2018 for municipal ww non diffusible xb usually represents 50 of the total influent chemical oxygen demand cod tchobanoglous et al 2014 based on the current knowledge the formation of ags during treatment of xb rich ww might thus be hampered in addition it remains unclear whether flocs are detrimental to ags systems when non diffusible xb represents a high proportion of the influent cod the main goal of this study was to understand the link between influent ww composition microbial community physical ags parameters and nutrient removal performance the specific research questions were to better understand how the ww composition in terms of diffusible and non diffusible organic substrates i influences the overall microbial community development ii divides the microbial community between flocs and granules iii governs nutrient removal iv defines physical characteristics such as settling properties sludge morphology and v influences the success and duration of start up of ags systems when similar operating conditions are applied four lab scale sbr were inoculated with the same activated sludge and operated for over 400 days in parallel four distinct wws were used 100 vfa synthetic complex synthetic municipal primary effluent and municipal raw ww the sludge properties morphology concentration svi and size distribution reactor performances c n p and total suspended solids tss removal and microbial community composition of the flocs and granules were monitored by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach four sbrs were operated in parallel for 400 days and fed with four different wws 100 vfa acetate propionate synthetic ww r1 complex synthetic ww r2 primary effluent municipal ww r3 and raw municipal ww r4 those four wws mainly differed with regards of the carbon source i e concentrations in volatile fatty acids soluble and particulate organic substrates table 1 after approximatively three months of operation r4 was restarted due to complete sludge loss data of r4 fed with raw ww are thus shown for the first run run 1 and the second run run 2 2 2 experimental set up the four sbrs comprised a mixed liquor volume of 12 9 l height to diameter ratio 8 4 and were operated in simultaneous fill draw mode the sbr cycles consisted of the following phases i anaerobic phase 90 min ii aerobic phase 240 min iii settling duration see description below and iv selective excess sludge withdrawal 60 s with a total cycle length of 5 6 h 4 3 cycles per day the anaerobic phase comprised an anaerobic plug flow feeding pf and an anaerobic idle the latter was changed to anaerobic mixing on day 357 and 289 for reactors r3 and r4 run 2 respectively the ww upflow velocity during pf feeding vww was set to 0 25 m h 1 anaerobic pf idle and 0 38 m h 1 anaerobic pf mixing the volume exchange ratio ver was set to 0 3 the oxygen concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled with a setpoint of 2 00 mg o2 l 1 mixing was provided by a mechanical stirrer during anaerobic pf mixing and by aeration during aerobic conditions all sbrs were equipped with oxygen sensors optical ldo endress hauser switzerland both sensors were connected to a programmable logic controller plc which was controlled and monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system all reactors were inoculated with activated sludge from the ww treatment plant wwtp thunersee switzerland which performs biological carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 3 start up approach the start up approach was based on the strategy developed by lochmatter and holliger 2014 the selective pressure on slow settling biomass was first maintained at a low level in order to prevent too high washout stress this was achieved by slowly increasing the critical settling velocity vcrit from 1 7 to 5 1 m h 1 an increase in vcrit was iteratively reassured by srt calculations equation 1 1 s r t v r t s s r q e x t s s e x q e f f t s s e f f vr is the reactor volume l tssr is the tss concentration in the reactor gtss l 1 qex is the flow rate

vcrit was decreased again the procedure was repeated on a weekly basis also long anaerobic and aerobic phases were applied total cycle duration 5 6 h in order to improve anaerobic cod uptake and aerobic nutrient removal finally vww was kept low 0 25 0 38 m h 1 in order to provide a high substrate gradient during anaerobic plug flow feeding and improve anaerobic cod uptake 2 4 start up

statistical analysis all the statistical analyses and the related plots were performed with r program v 3 5 0 r core team 2018 using the packages reshape2 gplots and ggplot2 wickham 2007 2016 warnes

the bacterial operational taxonomic units otu 97 relative abundance the biomass communities of the different samples were separated in two states a transition state and a stable state for each reactor a bacterial community was considered in the stable state if the maximum bray curtis pairwise distance with the communities of all the following sample points was below 0 6 the maximal distance between all the samples was 0 88 five stable state datasets corresponding to the stable states of the 4 reactors and of the inoculum were analysed further in order to extract the taxa that are discriminant between these five stable states the mean relative abundances of the genera were compared two by two after hellinger transformations the means were compared by using t tests the taxa are considered

states taxa are considered abundant if their average abundance during stable state is higher than 1 in at least one stable dataset the taxa being divergent and abundant are considered as discriminant taxa in the following analysis there were 56 abundant 273 divergent and 38 discriminant taxa on a total of 422 at genus level 1 1 5 comparison of the bacterial communities in flocs and granules the average proportions of the most abundant genera were compared in each reactor with t tests in order to evaluate potential differences in the microbial communities in flocs and granules the results with a p value lower than the bonferoni corrected p value of 0 01 p value 0 01 20 0 0005 were considered as significant 3 results 3 1 settling properties a higher amount of diffusible organic substrate vfa or fermentable in the ww resulted in better settling properties fig 2 low svi30 and svi ratios close to 1 were measured for the ags of r1 and r2 high content in diffusible organic substrate larger svi30 and svi ratios close to 0 8 were on the other hand measured for the ags of r3 and r4 high content in non diffusible organic substrate the svi30 of the sludge of r1 and r2 decreased rapidly during the first 30 days of operation and then stabilised at 30 50 ml g 1 simultaneously svi ratios 0 9 were measured only 1 2 weeks were thus required to achieve granulation in these two reactors based on their svi30 values over long term the svi30 and svi ratios of ags of r2 remained more variable in comparison with the ones of r1 achieving good settling properties for the systems fed by municipal ww required a much longer period several months to over 1 year the svi30 values of the ags of r4 steadily decreased within the first 100 days of operation to 50 ml g 1 for both runs and stabilised at svi30 70 ml g 1 after 170 d for r4 run 2 ags of r3 responded sensitively to changing operating conditions which resulted in variable and high svi30 values from day 0 200 svi30 80 ml g 1 and svi30 10 ratio 0 8 were finally achieved quickly after introduction of anaerobic pf mixing from day 357 for r3 successful start up based on settling parameters svi30 90 ml g 1 and svi30 10 ratio 0 8 was achieved within the first two weeks for r1 and r2 a much longer start up time was required for ags of r4 and r3 around 34 and 163 days were required to achieve successful start up based on settling parameters for ags of r4 run 2 and r4 run 1 respectively r3 was successfully started up only after 400 days 3 2 sludge size fractions the effect of the influent composition on the granulation process was confirmed by monitoring the different biomass size fractions fig 3 the size of the granules greatly varied as a result of the presence of non diffusible xb in the influent high fractions of large granules d 1 mm were observed in r1 only while smaller granules mixed with flocs were observed in r2 r3 and r4 both runs overall successful granulation based on size fractions d 0 25 mm of at least 50 of tss was achieved after 1 1 5 month of operation in all systems ags of r1 was dominated by medium and large diameter granules d 0 63 mm while flocs d 0 25 mm represented only a minor fraction the fraction of granules steadily increased in r1 while flocs simultaneously decreased to about 5 after 50 days of operation large granules gradually replaced small granules and dominated the sludge composition after 100 days of operation the total fraction of granules d 0 25 mm in r1 remained steady throughout the entire reactor operation despite some fluctuations in the individual fractions a major loss of large granules was observed after 300 days of operation in r1 incomplete uptake of carbon during anaerobic conditions possibly caused by pass of the settled sludge bed during plug flow feeding resulted in filamentous outgrowth of the granules supplementary information fig s5d filamentous outgrowth first resulted in an increase of sheared off debris indicated by an increase in d 0 63 mm size fractions followed by breakage of large granules after 390 days of operation though large granules started to develop again ags fed with complex influent ww were mainly composed of small granules 50 70 and flocs 20 40 the ags size fractions measured in the reactors fed with complex synthetic and municipal ww were very similar small granules represented the predominant size fraction with 60 80 almost no large granules developed in these systems rarely above 10 of total biomass also the fractions of flocs decreased from 80 to less than 40 within the first 40 days after day 40 20 40 of flocs remained in the systems until the end of the experiment large fluctuations of size fractions mainly of flocs were only observed in r2 and r3 3 3 evolution of the bacterial community composition from inoculation to stable state the microbial communities were monitored over 426 days for the four reactors 267 samples 12 millions of reads fig 4 the microbial communities developed differently in r1 100 vfa than in r2 r3 and r4 with the latter two being very similar to each other the microbial community in r2 complex synthetic ww was rather similar to the ones of r3 and r4 although some differences could be observed in r1 an initial increase of the gammaproteobacteria with successive changes within this class was observed dechloromonas was progressively replaced by other betaproteobacteriales such as azoarcus or zoogloea whose relative abundance fluctuated greatly during the experiment the proportion of actinobacteria here comprising mainly putative fermenting bacteria gradually decreased to below 2 after day 119 tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter represented 8 and 3 of the inocula communities respectively in r1 the abundance of tetrasphaera decreased progressively and was 0 5 after 100 days whereas the abundance of ca accumulibacter fluctuated between 0 1 and 8 in r2 r3 and r4 actinobacteria became abundant 30 50 during the two first weeks of operation and stabilised at around 10 after 200 days of operation the abundance of tetrasphaera remained quite stable during the first 130 days in these reactors and then decreased to 1 3 whereas abundance of ca accumulibacter was always 3 the evolution of the microbial communities according to the different wws are represented in the pcoa of the bray curtis distance matrix of the bacterial otus 97 relative abundance fig 5 in all reactors the bacterial community quickly changed first after inoculation transition phase and then stabilised stable state the bacterial communities of r3 and r4 municipal ww evolved towards a similar stable state the bacterial community of r1 evolved very differently from r3 and r4 the evolution of the bacterial community of r2 was different from the one of r1 and quite close to the ones in reactors r3 and r4 the time to reach stable state significantly varied from one reactor to another in r1 and r3 the bacterial community stabilised after 231 days while 178 and 120 days were required for r2 and r4 respectively the evolution of bacterial communities of r4 was similar during run 1 and run 2 the shannon diversity index decreased during the transition phase in particular for the reactors treating synthetic ww supplementary information fig s8 the index was higher in the samples of the stable states in comparison to the samples of the transition phases which supports the pertinence of the criterion applied to determine the stable state a comparison of the proportions of each genus was performed in order to identify the taxa responsible for the differences between the different microbial communities of the four ags systems and the inocula supplementary information fig s11 out of the total 422 taxa 38 were identified as discriminant some of the discriminant taxa were characteristic for ags fed with the simple ww r1 such as meganema or members of the rhodobacteraceae family supplementary information fig s11 other taxa were mainly abundant in the ags fed with real ww inocula r3 and r4 such as propioniciclava iamia acidovorax kouleothrix ca epiflobacter and sulfuritalea several taxa were more abundant in ags treating complex ww whether synthetic or municipal microlunatus the fermentative gao micropruina or the fermentative pao tetrasphaera the following genera were abundant and present in the core community of the systems but not discriminant the pao ca accumulibacter the gao cpb c22 f32 ca microthrix saprospiraceae f rhodobacter thauera and thiotrix finally the proportions of the bacterial taxa of r1 and r2 were compared separately with those of r3 and r4 combined this comparison was performed to assess the effect of synthetic vs real ww on the microbial communities of ags among the 29 abundant taxa in r3 or r4 23 were found in significantly lower proportions in r1 in r2 the number of underrepresented taxa dropped to only 15 supplementary information table s9 3 4 bacterial communities of granules and flocs the presence of non diffusible organic substrate in the ww resulted in 20 40 of flocs in the ags it is thus relevant to understand to what extent the microbial communities in flocs and granules are similar the relative abundances of the main genera in flocs and granules were compared to detect potential enrichment of some genera between those two types of microbial aggregate fig 6 at stable state zoogloea flavobacterium cycu 0281 thauera and trichococcus were enriched in flocs whereas nitrospira ca competibacter rhodobacter terrimonas and cpb cs1 were enriched in granules however only few of these differences were significant supplementary information table s10 when considered separately e g nitrospira in r1 and r4 and thauera in r4 hence in term of microbial community composition flocs are quite similar to granules 3 5 nutrient removal performance overall good substrate nutrient removal and effluent quality was observed for all systems despite significant differences in the sludge properties and granulation process table 2 very low tss concentrations were measured in the effluent of r1 and r2 20 mgtss l 1 as well as in the effluent of r4 run 1 15 mgtss l 1 the highest tss concentration was measured in the effluent of r3 45 mg tss l 1 during run 2 of r4 tss effluent concentrations 34 mgtss l 1 were lower than in r3 but still higher in comparison to r4 run 1 as well as r1 and r2 excellent cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were observed in all reactors except r3 for r1 r2 and r4 the cod and nh4 n removal efficiencies were consistently larger than 90 and 95 respectively the sludge loss in the effluent of r3 43 21 mgtss l 1 increased the average cod concentration in its effluent effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were consistently low in all reactors high tn removal 77 via simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was observed in r1 only which was indicated by the lowest no3 n effluent concentrations larger no3 n effluent concentrations measured in the effluent of r2 r3 and r4 resulted from a larger accumulation of no3 n during the aerobic phase compared to r1 since full nitrification was observed in all systems it can be concluded that the higher no3 n effluent concentrations result from a lower simultaneous denitrification rate during aerobic bulk conditions po4 p removal was constant and high 90 for ags of r1 and r2 only ags of r4 run 1 and run 2 showed lower po4 p removal of 61 and 78 on average respectively the lowest po4 p removal was observed for ags of r3 however po4 p removal of r3 and r4 run 2 improved up to 95 after introducing anaerobic pf mixing at day 357 and 289 respectively overall successful start up of the reactors in terms of substrate nutrient removal was achieved long before achieving good settling properties full cod and nh4 n removal were observed right after inoculation of the systems high p removal was observed without delay for r1 and r2 while stable and high biological phosphorus removal was reached after 77 and 93 days for r3 and r4 run 2 respectively r4 run 1 was not able to recover high p removal performance before the restart 3 6 correlations between settling properties nutrient removal performances and microbial community composition multiple factor analysis mfa indicates a correlation between the proportion of soluble cod in the influent a high proportion of medium to big granules and a svi30 10 ratio close to 1 suggesting good granulation and settleability fig 7 the proportion of soluble influent cod also correlated with good nutrient removal performances such as nitrogen total phosphorus or phosphate removal efficiencies tn tp and po4 p removal the projection of the samples in the two dimensional mfa space provides information about the global similarity between samples fig 7b overall samples of r2 are close to the ones of r1 and closer to samples of r4 than r3 at stable state the bacterial communities settling properties size distribution of the sludge and the nutrient removal performances show different individual distributions in the two dimensional space supplementary information fig s17 bacterial communities of ags of r3 and r4 are very similar at stable state and close to the communities of the inoculum supplementary information fig s17a microbial communities of r3 and r4 are clearly distinct from the ones of the reactors treating synthetic ww however closer to the ones of r2 than to those of r1 the projection of the samples forms a gradient from r1 to r3 with r2 and r4 in between based on settling properties and size distribution of the sludge supplementary information fig s17b the links between the microbial communities and the size and density of the biomass is confirmed by the correlation of 0 65 between the two corresponding bray curtis distance matrices supplementary information table s13 and table s12 based on the nutrient removal performance data a majority of samples mainly from r1 r2 and r4 grouped together outliers mainly from r3 surrounded this group supplementary information fig s17c this reflects the fact that ags of r3 had lower nutrient removal performances than ags of the other three reactors even at stable state weak correlation 0 05 between the bray curtis distance matrices of the bacterial communities and the nutrient removal performances supplementary information fig s17 is observed at stable state 3 7 identification of correlations between the discriminant taxa and the sludge size distributions the settling properties and the nutrient removal performances three different clusters were identified by correlating the discriminant taxa with the different properties of the sludge fig 8 cluster i correlated with a high proportion of big and medium size granules good settling properties and good nutrient removal it includes the pao ca accumulibacter and its gao competitors from the family competibacteraceae ca competibacter ca contendobacter cpb cs1 aerobic filamentous meganema zoogloea potentially filamentous flavobacterium bacteria and the nitrifying nitrospira also belong to this cluster numerous putative denitrifiers are also part of cluster i zoogloea ca competibacter ca contendobacter ca accumulibacter cluster ii correlates with high proportions of small granules and flocs relatively good settling properties good p removal and partial tn removal it is composed of the aerobic bacteria terrimonas which has the ability to hydrolyse various substrates and amaricoccus which can store carbon in the form of pha it also comprises fermentative or putatively fermentative bacteria such as microlunatus and mesorhizobium for which in situ physiology is not well described yet the bacteria belonging to this cluster were relatively abundant in the reactor treating complex synthetic ww r2 cluster iii contains taxa correlated with high proportions of small granules and flocs poorer settling properties and lower nutrient removal this cluster contains one third of novel or poorly characterised genera such as p58 or dokdonella it also includes fermentative bacteria including tetrasphaera micropruina propioniciclava kouleotrix and trichococcus as cluster i it contains various potential denitrifiers such as iamia sulfuritalea microthrix or acidovorax cluster iii also comprises bacteria likely able to degrade macromolecules e g ca epiflobacter cycu 0281 and members of the family chitinophagaceae these bacteria are more abundant in the systems treating municipal ww inocula r3 r4 members of the genera ca microthrix and trichococcus and the family caldilineaceaepresent in cluster iii can be filamentous and thus impair the settleability of the sludge and be at least in part responsible for the poorer settleability associated with this cluster 4 discussion 4 1 diffusibility of organic substrates has significant influence on formation of ags wastewater composition in terms of diffusible non diffusible organic substrate significantly influences the formation of ags a comparison between the four reactors fed with different amounts of diffusible non diffusible organic substrate helped validating the conceptual model presented above fig 1 fast granulation was observed with wws containing high amounts of diffusible organic substrate r1 and r2 thus resulting in excellent settling properties and stable nutrient removal performances on the other hand a low amount of diffusible organic substrate resulted in slow granulation poorer settling properties and often partial nutrient removal granulation results from the selection of slower growing carbon storing microorganisms over oho de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 vjayan and vadivelu 2017 the high proportions of diffusible organic substrate in r1 and r2 promoted the growth of organisms that can store or use carbon under anaerobic conditions storing microorganisms such as ca accumulibacter classical pao and ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 classical gaos represented an important part of the microbial community of r1 fig 4 in r2 the fermentative pao tetrasphaera and the fermentative gao micropruina were abundant in particular during granulation the influent composition specifically favoured the growth of these organisms which coincided with the rapid development of well settling ags however the size of the granules which developed in r1 and r2 was very different with large granules dominating ags of r1 while smaller granules were observed in r2 if diffusibility of substrate is very high bacterial growth in the deep layers is then promoted ultimately leading to the formation of dense large granules as in r1 granule size is in theory linked to deep substrate penetration into the granule which is influenced by the substrate concentration gradient uptake rate and diffusibility of substrate morgenroth 2008 rittman and mccarty 1981 the nature and content of extracellular polymeric substances eps associated with granule densification is influenced by substrate type and loading and has strong implications on the granule size and settling rusanowska et al 2019 deep substrate diffusion and conversion occurred in r1 as indicated by the high snd measured for this system during the aeration phase denitrification occurred in the anoxic zones of the granules due to previous anaerobic storage of diffusible organic substrate classical pao and gao enriched in the ags of r1 were able to grow under both anoxic and aerobic conditions thus favouring the densification of the granules the lower fractions of diffusible organic substrate in r2 influent resulted in a limited growth in the core of the granules and ultimately in the formation of smaller granules the different properties of the granules of r1 and r2 settling granule size and biomass fractionation etc can thus be explained by the amount and nature of the diffusible and non diffusible substrates vfa fermentable soluble and particulate organic substrate granulation can therefore be linked to two aspects 1 the diffusibility of the substrate governs its availability within the granules and 2 the nature of the substrates determines the microbial community composition and the aggregates densification on the contrary the high proportions of non diffusible xb in the influent of r3 and r4 hampered the granulation process several phenomena lead to the conclusion that hydrolysis is only partial during anaerobic plug flow feeding 1 ww particles are often large from several μm up to 1 2 mm levine et al 1985 dimock and morgenroth 2006 2 hydrolysis is a very slow process benneouala et al 2017 morgenroth et al 2002 jabari et al 2016 and 3 the anaerobic feeding duration of 1 2 h typically applied in ags systems is insufficient to provide full hydrolysis of xb wagner et al 2015 jabari et al 2016 therefore partial anaerobic conversion of xb is unavoidable and results in a high availability of substrate during the subsequent aerobic phase which in turn supports the growth of oho wagner et al 2015 oho growth leads to poorer settling properties due to filamentous outgrowth floc formation or a decrease of p removal novák et al 1993 suresh et al 2018 weissbrodt et al 2014 pronk et al 2015a de kreuk et al 2010 extensive oho growth outcompeting slower growing storing organisms is the most likely reason for the slow development of granules bad settling properties and overall lower nutrient removal performance observed for ags of r3 and r4 in comparison to r1 and r2 classical pao and gao were outcompeted by fermentative pao and gao in r3 and r4 and similarly in r2 the enrichment of fermentative pao and gao in those systems is the result of lower influent vfa concentrations combined with large amounts of fermentable substrates stemming from both influent wws and produced via hydrolysis of non diffusible compounds 4 2 start up high concentrations of diffusible organic substrate as found in the synthetic wws of r1 and r2 led to faster granulation 1 month compared to granulation in r3 1 year or r4 5 months a main finding of our study is that different characteristic times were required to establish stable microbial communities stable physical properties of the ags or steady substrate nutrient removal characteristic time to establish full substrate nutrient removal was the quickest around few days weeks while characteristic time to establish a stable microbial community was the slowest several months complete substrate and nutrient removal was observed without any delay right after inoculation with activated sludge for all reactors maintaining high conversion rates after inoculation required an appropriate start up strategy our selected start up strategy relied on applying a low washout stress to avoid a too harsh washout of slow growing organisms full nitrification without no2 accumulation was observed after start up while no or a very short loss of biological p removal was noticed sustained nutrient removal after inoculation was also observed by lochmatter and holliger 2014 who applied a similar start up strategy of low washout stress on slow settling biomass low amounts of diffusible organic substrate in the ww must thus be balanced by a less harsh washout of flocs during start up aggressive washout of slow settling biomass as strategy to start up ags systems using either 100 vfa or municipal ww as influent can result in very short start up times down to 1 and 3 weeks respectively with settleability of svi10 40 ml g 1 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 the current study did not apply aggressive washout of slow settling biomass flocs during start up resulting in significantly slower granule formation since granulation was achieved in all reactors the start up strategy in the current study is viable and relevant even in unfavourable influent ww conditions such as low strength municipal ww maintaining high substrate nutrient conversion rates over long term ultimately resulted in the formation of granules the different kinetics of ags formation confirm the general trend observed in previous studies start up is typically shorter with diffusible only influent ww consisting of 100 vfa 1 4 weeks de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 lochmatter and holliger 2014 weissbrodt et al 2014 than with ww containing non diffusible polymeric compounds such as municipal or industrial ww 3 weeks more than 1 year de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 liu et al 2010 giesen et al 2013 the faster granulation of ags in r4 compared to ags of r3 confirms that higher organic loads facilitate the granulation process nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2017 li et al 2008 rusanowska et al 2019 establishing a stable microbial community required between 4 and 8 months for all systems during this period different transient bacterial communities were observed the transient bacterial community was dominated by zoogloea in r1 fed with 100 vfa ww we propose that the presence of zoogloea in r1 is an indirect consequence of the excellent settling properties of the ags which led to preferential flow and bypass of soluble cod into the aerobic phase supplementary information s15 the growth of zoogloea during the early stage of granulation in r1 likely resulted from the presence of vfa in the aerobic phase weissbrodt et al 2013 similar to the study of weissbrodt et al 2013 the high abundance of zoogloea observed in r1 was associated with a high proportion of granules and a thin settled bed during feeding several studies however suggested that zoogloea plays a positive role in the formation of granules in vfa rich influent ww by producing specific eps li et al 2008 larsen et al 2008 kang et al 2018 therefore the availability of diffusible substrates under aerobic conditions might not automatically be detrimental to granulation in the reactors fed with complex ww r2 r3 and r4 actinobacteria dominated the transitional bacterial community in particular micropruina was very abundant in these three reactors and was concomitant to the formation of granules its role in granulation in complex ww fed ags systems is yet to be determined 4 3 stable state the list of potential organisms that play a functional role in ags systems can be extended based on this study considering their effect on nutrient removal and taking into account the role of different influent compositions however a core microbial community of ags systems cannot be established yet during stable state operation dominant species in r1 were reported as abundant in other 100 vfa fed ags systems such as zoogloea thauera rhodobacter meganema and nitrospira in systems fed with vfas only the pao guild mainly consisted of ca accumulibacter while the gao guild was mostly composed of members of the competibacteraceae family e g ca competibacter cpb c22 f32 weissbrodt et al 2013 he et al 2016a henriet et al 2016 such simple microbial community greatly differs from the ones of r2 r3 and r4 abundant taxa detected in r2 r3 and r4 were previously detected in ags fed with complex ww like e g cycu 0281 dokdonella flavobacterium haliangium nitrospira rhodobacter thauera thrichococcus unclassified genera related to xanthomonadaceae and zoogloea kang et al 2018 szabó et al 2017a świątczak and cydzik kwiatkowska 2018 fermentative bacteria were present in both r2 and r3 r4 in particular the pao tetrasphaera and the gao micropruina the sole presence of both diffusible and non diffusible organic substrate independent of their nature resulted in relatively similar microbial communities yet the remaining differences between those systems could stem from continuous inoculation of the sludge by bacteria present in the influent ww indeed the similarity of the bacterial communities of r3 and r4 is stronger within ags sampled during the same date than after the same number of days of reactor operation parts of the microbial communities thus stem from immigration of bacteria via the influent ww saunders et al 2016 filamentous oho detected in high proportions in r3 and r4 e g trichococcus and the family caldilineaceae can have a negative impact on the settling properties of the sludge those filamentous oho are characterised by a high affinity for aerobic carbon degradation which is consistent with the presence of slowly biodegradable substrates in the influent of those reactors yet many genera known to have hydrolysing capabilities such as ca epiflobacter cycu 0281 and kouleothrix correlated with low settling properties because they are linked to the presence of xb but not necessarily because they are filamentous during stable state the bacterial communities selected in the different ags systems had multiple taxa in common with the core communities of ebpr activated sludge e g ca accumulibacter micropruina tetrasphaera zoogloea saunders et al 2016 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 but many taxa that are not yet characterised at the genus level were identified they belong to the family of xanthomonadaceae caldilineaceae cytophagaceae or to the phylum of saccharibacteria however their function in ags systems is yet to be determined the grouping of r1 vs r2 r3 r4 based on microbial community also reflected differences in tn removal which was lower in the reactors fed with complex ww tn removal in the systems can occur either via 1 pre denitrification of remaining no3 from the previous cycle during the feeding and subsequent anoxic anaerobic mixing phase or 2 snd during aerobic bulk conditions the latter process requires denitrifying bacteria available cod and the presence of substantial anoxic zones within the granules numerous putative denitrifying bacteria were detected in ags of all reactors but only r1 gathered all the conditions to perform snd resulting in low effluent no3 large granule size and a high proportion of diffusible organic substrate in the influent further research is required to identify the influence of each of these factors on snd and to improve snd in ags systems fed by complex influent ww decreased p removal was observed in ags systems treating municipal ww r3 r4 possibly due to low influent diffusible organic substrate especially vfa in combination with carbon leakage and low influent po4 p concentrations guimarães et al 2018 short term loss of p removal was also observed in r1 concomitantly to bypassing of substrate during pf feeding in addition low ortho p concentrations of the municipal ww received by r3 r4 did not promote the growth of paos de kreuk et al 2010 indeed the proportion of paos was above 5 in the four reactors at stable state these proportions are much lower than the average proportion reported in danish ebpr wwtp 13 and may have made the four systems less robust in terms of p removal nielsen et al 2010 yet the anaerobic carbon uptake and therewith p removal were enhanced by the introduction of an anoxic anaerobic mixed phase after pf feeding 4 4 the role of flocs in ags systems our results indicate that the presence of flocs 20 40 is representative of ags systems fed with wws that contain non diffusible xb fig 3 flocs were observed several months after the establishment of good stable settling properties and substrate nutrient removal flocs fractions ranging from 16 to 40 of tss were also reported in literature for pilot and full scale ags plants derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015b van dijk et al 2018 our results thus indicate that ags systems are hybrid systems composed of both flocs and granules rather than biofilm only systems the presence of flocs in ags systems results from both short term and long term mechanisms short term exposure of the granules to non diffusible xb triggers filamentous outgrowth de kreuk et al 2010 xb attaches to the granule surface and is then partially hydrolysed during the anaerobic phase de kreuk et al 2010 the fraction of xb that is not converted anaerobically is then degraded under aerobic conditions thus promoting the growth of oho and filamentous outgrowth finger type pronk et al 2015a such short term mechanism might however not be relevant for real ags systems in which the sludge is exposed to xb over long term several months years over long term the presence of xb in the influent favours the presence of flocs filamentous structures in turn do not develop on the surface of granules as xb is likely captured degraded by flocs derlon et al 2016 wagner et al 2015 xb attachment onto the granules surface is likely limited during anaerobic pf feeding while the hydrolysis rate is in addition very low especially under anaerobic conditions jabari et al 2016 for these reasons it is expected that significant amount of xb remain available during the mixed aerobic phase we hypothesized that under mixed conditions flocs would have a competitive advantage over granules for capturing and then degrading xb wagner et al 2015 derlon et al 2016 the surface to volume ratio of the flocs is much larger than the one of the regular and round shaped granules andreadakis 1993 mihciokur and oguz 2016 we propose that the availability of xb during the mixed aerobic phase combined with its selective capture by flocs is the main reason for their presence in ags systems treating municipal ww we ultimately suggest that flocs might in fact be beneficial during treatment of complex ww with elevated levels of non diffusible xb using ags technology the microbial communities in the flocs and granules differed only for some particular genera at stable state thus the microbial community structures evolved in a similar manner in both fractions probably due to a constant exchange of biomass between the two fractions liu et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 for the four reactors our results indicate a higher fraction of zoogloea in flocs than in granules the enrichment of zoogloea in flocs was particularly pronounced in the ags of r1 where the proportion of flocs was the lowest 5 and where filamentous outgrowth was often observed the presence of zoogloea in flocs likely resulted from erosion of the granules surface szabó et al 2017b erosion of the granule s surfaces might have been favoured by the low cohesion of filamentous structures resulting from the growth of zoogloea on the contrary the higher abundance of slow growing organisms in granules e g nitrospira likely resulted from favourable growth conditions in the core of the granule the srt gradually increases over the granule s depth thus providing suitable growth conditions for slow growing organisms such as nitrifiers high cohesion within granules also reduces the detachment rate and thus the exchange of bacteria from the granules to the flocs in this case the differences between the bacterial communities of granules and flocs can become significant because both fractions offer different niches and have different retention times winkler et al 2012 it is therefore expected that slow growing bacteria are progressively enriched in the granules the mechanism is confirmed by our measurements of relative abundance of nitrospira ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 moreover the lowest differences between the microbial communities of flocs and granules in r3 can be explained by granulation being more recent compared to the other systems 4 5 implications for research and practice our findings have relevant implications for both research and engineering practice the complex synthetic ww resulted in the development of ags that was more similar to ags fed by municipal ww rather than ags fed by100 vfa we therefore advise the use of complex synthetic ww vfa diffusible fermentable substrate and high non diffusible xb contents as surrogate of municipal ww the proportion and composition of xb can be tuned and modified to address specific research questions in terms of implications for engineering practice our study provides relevant information for the start up of ags systems the superior performance of ags in r4 over ags in r3 indicates that an increased loading was beneficial for granulation and nutrient removal despite the increased fraction of xb in the influent however a balance must be found between applying a sufficient loading while limiting operating costs e g aeration start up time was likely extended due to the chosen start up strategy low washout stress and low vww during pf feeding in comparison to other studies derlon et al 2016 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 but operating the system at low vww also helped maintaining high substrate and nutrient removal rates during the entire experimental phase as observed in the present study and reported in literature derlon et al 2016 lochmatter and holliger 2014 applying a higher selective pressure by gradually increasing the vww during pf feeding would accelerate the formation of granules but based on our experience increasing the selective pressure applied via vcrit is coupled with an increased risk of biomass loss due to the sensitivity of ags systems fed by low strength municipal ww a fine balance between maintaining high srt conditions for forming granules and applying a selective sludge removal of slow settling biomass must be found in terms of nutrient removal partial denitrification due to poor snd proved to be representative of ags systems fed with non diffusible xb an increased tn removal in those systems was achieved by implementing an additional mixed phase following the pf feeding denitrification during this phase likely benefited po4 p removal as observed for r3 and r4 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are 1 the wastewater composition in terms of diffusible and non diffusible organic substrates governs both the microbial community composition granulation kinetics settling properties and nutrient removal of ags high fractions of diffusible organic substrates result in fast granulation and excellent settleability of ags whereas presence of non diffusible xb in the influent hampers granulation reduces settleability and results in the presence of substantial fractions 20 40 of flocs the bacterial communities of flocs and granules were globally very similar within the same reactor but several taxa were enriched in flocs or granules respectively 2 ags fed by vfa based synthetic ww resulted as expected in a specialized bacterial community containing classical pao and gao e g ca accumulibacter ca competibacter or cpb c22 f32 that led to fast granulation excellent settling performance stable nutrient removal large granules and a quasi absence of flocs 3 ags fed by complex substrates containing non diffusible xb revealed bacterial communities characterised by a high abundance of fermenting bacteria including fermentative pao and gao high amounts of diffusible organic substrate and total organic load were key factors to enhance the settleability and granulation kinetics of the sludge as well as the stability of nutrient removal performances 4 an increased floc fraction was constitutive in ags reactors fed with complex ww and was attributed to the presence of non diffusible xb in the influent it is neither possible nor desirable to wash out all flocs in ags systems fed with complex ww 5 complex synthetic ww led to ags with characteristics resembling those treating raw municipal ww hence the often applied 100 vfa synthetic ww should be replaced by complex synthetic ww as a surrogate of municipal ww in future lab scale experiments studying ags declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

20012,hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion this paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate in order to optimize the formation of sulfur it is crucial to understand the relations between the sob microbial composition kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency hence a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula the resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance the model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process i e flavocytochrome c and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase fcc and sqr the model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key enzyme ratios hence we introduce a new model parameter α to whereby α describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of fcc and sqr enzymes our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low α values keywords sulfur oxidizing bacteria biological gas desulfurization physiologically based kinetics flavocytochrome c sulfide quinone oxidoreductase 1 introduction during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater biogas is produced from organic matter driessen et al 2011 lettinga 1995 when sulfate is present in the wastewater this will be converted to sulfide and a fraction hereof will transfer to the biogas h2s concentrations in the biogas generally range between 100 and 40 000 ppm v driessen et al 2011 to be able to use this biogas strict specifications have to be applied with respect to hydrogen sulfide h2s levels in natural gas the h2s concentration has to be below 3 ppm v the release of h2s to the environment is regulated due to its toxic and corrosive properties schnele et al 2016 world health organization 2003 thus removal of h2s is required nowadays a variety of desulfurization processes are available to remove h2s from sour gas streams among these technologies the biological conversion of h2s is the most environmentally friendly because no toxic chemicals are required and the process is operated at ambient conditions i e no high pressures or temperatures a biotechnological process for the removal of h2s was developed in the 1990s which has been applied in different industrial sectors worldwide buisman et al 1990 driessen et al 2011 the process is based on the absorption of h2s from sour gas streams in an haloalkaline solvent with a salinity between 0 5 2 m na and a ph between 8 10 janssen et al 2009 van den bosch et al 2007 the dissolved bisulfide hs is subsequently directed to a bioreactor where haloalkaline sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob consume reduced sulfur ions and produce elemental sulfur s8 as the end product eq 1 buisman et al 1989 1 hs ½ o2 ⅛ s8 oh in addition a small part of the sulfide is oxidized to sulfate according to 2 hs 2 o2 so4 2 h next to biological sulfide oxidation chemical oxidation can take place 3 hs o2 ½ s2o3 2 ½ h2o the formation of sulfur is preferred as hydroxide ions are re generated which are required to absorb hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream driessen et al 2011 in addition the formed sulfur particles can be used as a fertilizer and for sulfuric acid production a j h janssen a de keizer lettinga 1994 on the other hand thio sulfate production leads to acidification of the reactor suspension which requires the addition of sodium hydroxide to maintain the ph for the bacterial optimum conditions and adsorption of sulfide hence in order to optimize the formation of sulfur the oxygen supply should be carefully controlled janssen et al 1995 haloalkaline sob are naturally occurring microorganisms that can be found in alkaline and highly saline environments such as soda lakes sorokin et al 2013 sorokin and kuenen 2005 most known haloalkaline sob are members of the gammaproteobacteria class belonging to the genera ectothiorodospira thioalkalivibrio thioalkalimicrobium and thioalkalispira foti et al 2007 bacteria from ectothiorodospira genus are phototrophic sulfur purple bacteria whereas the other three genera are obligate chemolithoautotrophs using various reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as an electron donor ghosh and dam 2009 sob can use two groups of enzymes for sulfide oxidation the periplasmic fad containing flavocytochrome c fcc and the membrane bound sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr donating electrons to the uq pool griesbeck et al 2000 when bi sulfide oxidation is mediated by fcc bi sulfide is oxidized to sulfane s0 using oxidized cytochrome c cyt as an electron acceptor dahl 2006 griesbeck et al 2000 4 hs 2 cyt s0 2 cyt h subsequently the reduced cytochrome c cyt is oxidized through the reduction of oxygen to water and governed by cytochrome c oxidase mitchell and moyle 1967 5 4 cyt 4 h o2 4 cyt 2h2o however the role of fcc as the major responsible enzyme for sulfide oxidation has been questioned as many sob species lack this protein kappler 2007 the sqr pathway is energetically more favorable and less sensitive to inhibition by toxic compounds for example methanethiol brune 1989 the sqr mediated sulfide oxidation end product is a soluble polysulfide griesbeck et al 2002 the sqr route prevails when sulfide oxidation takes place at oxygen limiting conditions klok et al 2013 in addition it is postulated that sob may contain both enzymes and the environmental conditions regulate which enzyme activity prevails to be able to grow the haloalkaliphilic chemolithoautotrophic sob must have specially adapted bioenergetics muyzer et al 2011 in full scale gas biodesulfurization installations differences between microbial community compositions were observed roman et al 2016b expression of sulfide oxidizing routes which define reaction kinetics and observed bacterial growth rates influence the process efficiency the aim of this study is to understand the relation between the bacterial community composition biological sulfide oxidation kinetics and the biodesulfurization process efficiency to optimize sulfur formation 2

which a stable reactor performance was achieved sampling was done in technical triplicates at regular time intervals in our experiments ph and temperature were kept constant oxidation reduction potential orp set point value was chosen at 390 mv to suppress sulfate formation roman et al 2016b 2 2 biomass sources biomass samples for inoculation were collected from four different full scale systems for gas biodesulfurization which have been in operation for more than ten years each biomass was studied separately one by one under similar experimental conditions the lab scale setup was inoculated with cells obtained by centrifugation 15 min at 16 000 x g of a 2 5 l culture collected from full scale installation these full scale systems were selected based on the feed gas composition it treats and on the industry of application table 2 provides a brief overview of the selected installations two full scale systems which treat sour gas from the anaerobic digestion of the wastewater from the paper pulp industry were sampled in this paper the various biomasses will be denoted by the location of the sampling installation 2 3 medium composition the haloalkaline medium for inoculum

solution as described in pfennig and lippert 1966 the ph of the medium was 8 50 0 05 at 35 c for the respiration test the medium contained carbonate bicarbonate buffer only trace elements were excluded because they enhance the chemical oxidation of sulfide luther et al 2011 2 4 respiration test respiration tests also known as biological activity monitoring bom tests were performed to measure biological sulfide oxidation reaction rates in an air saturated medium a similar setup was used by roman et al 2015 consisting of a glass mini reactor 45 ml a magnetic stirrer and a teflon piston to avoid any oxygen ingress fig 2 sulfide was added to the reactor from a freshly prepared stock solution na2s x 9h2o sigma aldrich the netherlands with a glass syringe passing through the piston the concentration of the prepared stock solution was verified with a sulfide methylene blue cuvette test lck653 if the stock was used for several days the concentration of the stock was verified every time before use the sulfide oxidation rate was calculated from measuring the oxygen removal rate with a dissolved oxygen do sensor oxymax cos22d endress hauser germany the do concentration was recorded using a multiparameter transmitter liquiline cm442 1102 0 endress hauser the netherlands all experiments were performed at 35 c dc10 thermo haake germany which is in agreement with the conditions in the lab scale fed batch setup as temperature and medium composition were similar to previous studies a proper comparison of our results can be performed de graaff et al 2012 klok et al 2013 roman et al 2015 van den bosch et al 2009 at the end of each fed batch bioreactor run the tested biomass was collected to measure specific biomass activities biomass was centrifuged and separated from sulfur particles salts by washing with a 1 m carbonate bicarbonate buffer hereafter biomass was ready to be used for the respiration tests at constant concentration 2 mg n l 1 firstly biomass was aerated as described elsewhere van den bosch et al 2009 experiments started by injection of sulfide and the initial slope of the recorded oxygen consumption profile was used to calculate the oxygen consumption rate biological reaction rates were determined by subtracting the chemical oxidation rates from the measured overall oxygen consumption rates chemical rates were measured in the absence of biomass in addition we calculated the endogenous oxygen consumption rate based on the respiration measurements without sulfide addition van den bosch et al 2009 2 5 application of a physiologically based kinetic model the proposed model klok et al 2013 describes both oxidation rates of sulfide through fcc and sqr enzymes i e primary dehydrogenases involved in biological sulfide oxidation and the effect on end product formation i e sulfur and sulfate the calculated maximum sulfide oxidation rate μ of the involved enzymes was determined by the results from respiration tests the electrons released from hs are transferred to the oxidized form of intermediate acceptors i e either cytochrome c or ubiquinones the reduced co factors are subsequently oxidized through other enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase cco and quinol oxidases sqrox klok et al 2013 irrespective of the type of sulfide dehydrogenase employed part of the electrons is transferred to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad the kinetic model contains expressions for the rates of four respiratory enzymes μ fcc μ sqr μ cco μ sqrox in mmol s mg n 1 h 1 and the associated affinity constants k fcc k sqr k cco k sqrox in mm in addition cco is inhibited by sulfide and therefore an inhibition constant is included k i in mm lastly the reduction degree f of cytochrome c and quinone q pool is included in the rates equations which change instantaneously according to sulfide and oxygen levels i e quasi steady state klok et al 2013 the rates for the oxidation of dissolved bi sulfide and reduction of dissolved oxygen are described by 6 q f c c μ f c c 1 f h s k f c c h s 7 q c c o μ c c o f o 2 k c c o o 2 k i k i h s 8 q s q r μ s q r 1 q h s k s q r h s 9 q s q r o x μ s q r o x q o 2 k s q r o x o 2 with q in mmol s mgn 1 h 1 h s in mm and o 2 in mm expression levels for both fcc and sqr were estimated from respiration tests for all tested biomasses described in table 2 the maximum rates for sulfide oxidation through fcc i e μ f c c and μ c c o and sqr i e μ s q r and μ s q r o x were estimated using a non linear least squares estimation routine as fcc and sqr expression levels do not describe the reduction of oxygen it was assumed that increased expression levels of the sulfide oxidizing enzyme systems would lead to a homologous increase of expression levels of the oxidase enzymes associated with the oxidizing sulfide enzymes i e cco is associated with fcc and sqrox is associated with sqr the affinity constants for sulfide and oxygen remained equal to the parameters estimated by klok et al 2013 table 3 more details concerning the parameter estimation and associated standard deviations can be found in appendix b the reduction degree of cco dictates the formation rate of sulfate in the kinetic model the stronger the oxidation degree of the cytochrome pool i e smaller f the higher the potential for the formation of sulfate klok et al 2013 visser et al 1997 we hypothesize that the ratio of expression of oxidation routes of sulfide through either fcc requiring cytochrome c as a cofactor and sqr require quinones as a cofactor is an indicator for the sulfate forming and thus sulfur forming potential of sob under oxygen limiting conditions hence we postulate that the ratio of μ f c c and μ s q r is a predictor of sulfur forming potential therefore we introduce the parameter α defined as α μ f c c μ s q r based on the dependencies between sulfate formation the overall biological activity under oxygen limiting conditions and the oxidation state of the cytochrome system we hypothesize that the smaller the value of α the higher the potential for sulfur formation as the end product 2 6 analytical techniques two types of samples were prepared i e filtrated and precipitated with zinc acetate for anions measurements and non filtrate for biomass quantification and toc analysis all liquid samples were stored at 4 c before being analyzed about three days biomass quantification was based on the amount of organic nitrogen that was oxidized to nitrate by peroxodisulphate lck238 and lck338 hach lange the netherlands the cell pellet was washed twice at 20 238 x g for 5 min with the nitrogen free medium to remove any nitrogen present in the medium sulfate and thiosulfate were measured by ion chromatography metrohm compact ic 761 switzerland with an anion column metrohm metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 mm switzerland equipped with a pre column metrohm metrosep a supp 4 5 guard switzerland immediately after sampling all solids were removed by filtration over a 0 45 μm membrane syringe filter hpf millex merck the netherlands and mixed with 0 2 m zinc acetate in a 1 1 ratio to prevent any chemical sulfide oxidation produced and accumulated sulfur concentration was calculated from the molar sulfur mass balance which is based on the supplied sulfide load and measured sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations at each sampling time point by following this equation 10 d s0 d h2s supplied vliquid d so4 2 2 d s2o3 2 sx 2 initial sulfur concentration is assumed to be 0 concentrations of dissolved sulfide and polysulfides were not taken into account as their combined contribution to the total concentration of sulfur species is negligible kleinjan et al 2005 van den bosch et al 2009 sulfide and bisulfide were measured as total sulfide s2 tot using the methylene blue method with a cuvette test lck653 hach lange usa total sulfide quantification was carried out immediately after sampling and samples were diluted in oxygen free milli q water sparged with n2 stream for 30 min to exclude chemical sulfide oxidation roman et al 2016c in addition to sulfur containing anions sodium and potassium concentration were measured with ion chromatography as described earlier roman et al 2015 using a metrohm metrosep c4 150 4 0 mm column with three mm hno3 as the eluent at 0 9 ml min 1 to close the electron balance as described by roman et al 2016b carbonate and bicarbonate ions concentration were established using the henderson hasselbalch equation po and senozan 2001 for that liquid samples were analyzed on total inorganic carbon using high temperature catalytic oxidation at 680 c with toc vcph cpn analyzer shimadzu the netherlands the gas phase h2s n2 co2 and o2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph varian cp4900 micro gc agilent the netherlands equipped with two separate column modules namely a 10 m long mol sieve 5a plot ms5 and a 10 m long poraplot u ppu 2 7 dna extraction and 16s rrna sequencing biomass samples were collected for microbial community analysis at the beginning and the end of each experimental run the samples were washed twice with a buffer solution of ph 8 5 and 0 5 m na to prevent the occurrence of an osmotic shock afterward the genomic dna was extracted from the washed biomass using the dneasy powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions all the above procedures were performed in technical duplicates for each sample and average values with standard deviations are presented library construction and next generation sequencing were carried out at the european genome and diagnostics center eurofins gatc biotech gmbh constance germany the workflow started from 16s rrna gene amplification in the v3 v5 variable region using 357f 5 cctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 926r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragt 3 primer set afterward merging read pairs by overlapping was performed using flash magoč and salzberg 2011 with maximum mismatch density of 0 25 the next step was to cluster sequences based on the similarity with chimera removal with uchime edgar et al 2011 using a full length good quality and non chimeric 16s rrna gene reference database cleaned and clustered sequences were blastn altschul et al 1990 analyzed using non redundant 16s rrna reference sequences with an e value cutoff of 10 6 only good quality and unique 16s rrna sequences were taxonomically assigned to the operational taxonomic unit otu to the clusters the taxonomic classification was based on the ncbi database www ncbi nlm nih gov taxonomy the embl ebi accession number for presented 16s rrna sequencing set is prjeb27163 3 results 3 1 biodesulfurization process performance an overview of the results is shown in table 4 the calculated selectivities for sulfur sulfate and thiosulfate are presented as an average value the term selectivity describes the mol fractions of products formed from a reactant or substrate detailed information on the obtained experimental data and determination of product selectivities can be found in appendix c the lowest selectivity for thiosulfate formation 0 8 0 2 mol was obtained for experiments with landfill biomass and the highest with paper mill 1 biomass 17 6 0 3 mol sulfate selectivity was the lowest for paper mill 1 system operation 1 1 0 1 mol and the highest for paper mill 2 and landfill operation with 7 2 0 4 mol and 7 0 0 9 mol respectively the highest sulfur selectivity was achieved with biomass from installations treating landfill and oilfield gasses 92 2 0 9 mol and 91 0 0 2 mol respectively the o2 h2s supply ratio is a critical parameter to control product formation van den bosch et al 2009 this parameter can be calculated from the supplied gas flows as no accumulation of o2 nor h2s was observed indicating that all supplied compounds are indeed were consumed the o2 h2s supply ratio is compared with the value obtained from the formed products based on the reaction s stoichiometry the electron balance was validated by comparing the o2 h2s ratios versus the formed products and that no significant differences were found table 4 hence we conclude that the mass balance for sulfur compounds is closed albeit that at very low concentrations compounds could be formed that were not analyzed by us we studied the rates of underlying biological and chemical reactions by performing respiration tests to better understand the formation of various end products therefore biological kinetic rates were measured using respiration tests our results show that the highest maximum biological oxidation rate r max was achieved with oilfield biomass 0 79 0 03 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 and the lowest r max value was achieved with landfill biomass 0 30 0 02 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 nevertheless both biomasses showed about 90 mol of sulfur formation in the lab scale experiments in addition the specific substrate loading rate of bacteria is in the same order of magnitude hence the achieved end product selectivities cannot be solely explained by r max next to maximum rates the observed reaction kinetics are controlled by substrate affinities marangoni 2003 in respiration tests oxygen levels are typically elevated 100 of do i e o 2 k c c o whereas in gas biodesulfurization process do levels are below the detection limit i e o 2 k c c o hence we have applied a physiologically based kinetic model to describe sulfide oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions moreover to correlate biological kinetics obtained from respiration tests to values measured in the biodesulfurization process parameter α was introduced this parameter is defined as α μ f c c μ s q r and indicates the relative expression levels of sulfate formation routes high relative expression levels of the μfcc and cco resulted in higher production of sulfate which in turn is responsible for cytochrome c pool re generation whereas high levels of the μsqr yield in the high formation of sulfur klok et al 2013 the parameters in the physiologically based model proposed by klok et al 2013 were recalibrated for four inocula originated from full scale installations based on the obtained respiration data table 5 fig 3 results show that paper mill 1 biomass has a high potential for sulfate formation α at 1 23 0 17 hence using paper mill 1 biomass under oxygen limiting conditions orp 390 mv results in low biomass activity and consequently in high chemical oxidation rates 17 6 0 3 mol the other three biomasses showed significantly lower α values indicating a higher potential for sulfur formation under oxygen limiting conditions in addition the calibrated model was used to predict sulfur selectivities for four tested biomasses at various oxygen concentrations appendix d 3 2 bacterial community analyses total dna was extracted and analyzed using next generation sequencing of the 16s rrna gene at the beginning and at the end of the experimental runs to enable monitoring of the microbial community change the most dominant species of the microbial communities in the paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill inocula were thiolalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus with an estimated abundance of 92 6 96 5 and 82 7 respectively fig 4 in contrast in the oilfield inoculum a heterotrophic gammaproteobacterium halomonas shengliensis was the most abundant species with 43 1 in comparison to 39 3 of tv sulfidiphilus fig 4 halomonas species become abundant when organic hydrocarbons are present in the feed streams peyton et al 2004 oilfield biomass is fed by a gas stream originating from crude oil extraction which can explain the presence of halomonas species in landfill biomass the second dominant species was an anoxygenic purple nonsulfur producing alphaproteobacterium roseibaca ekhonensis with 15 5 abundancy whereas its population decreased by a factor of two at the end of the process operation the least abundant in paper mill 1 biomass inoculum were lithoautotrophic sob thiomicrospira thyasirae and heterotrophic halomonas meridiana with only 3 and 2 3 respectively in paper mill 2 prominent biomass species were halomonas campaniensis 1 3 and two haloalkaliphilic anaerobes 0 7 each sulfur reducing desulfurispirillum alkaliphilum and fermentative clostridium anoxynatronum sibiricum desulfurispirillum has been described previously as a dominant sulfur reducing bacterium in the eerbeek plant paper mill 1 sorokin et al 2007 while a close relative of anoxynatronum sibiricum has been enriched and isolated in pure culture from eerbeek plant in 2009 using thiosulfate as electron acceptor sorokin unpublished results this indicates that a full sulfur cycle might be functional in micro aerophilic biodesulfurization bioreactors maintaining highly negative redox potential minor changes in the microbial composition were noticed in the samples collected at the end of the experiments with paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill biomass in landfill biomass r ekhonensis abundance decreased to 7 8 but the other two species thiomicrospira thyasirae and thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum became detectable with 1 3 and 1 2 microbial compositions in paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 biomass at the end of the experiments were similar to the inoculum in contrast the oilfield biomass underwent a profound shift in the microbial community during the performed experiments the population of halomonas shengliensis decreased from 43 1 to 3 8 and was overtaken by lithoautotrophic thiolalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus 66 also two other haloalkaliphilic sob species proliferated thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum and roseibaca ekhonensis with 16 6 and 6 0 respectively changes in the microbial composition of the oilfield biomass are probably caused by a change in the feed gas composition that was lacking an organic carbon source 4 discussion from our experiments it can be seen that the sulfur selectivity was above 90 mol for biomasses that originates from oilfield and landfill full scale installations whilst the consortia that come from paper mill 1 shows lower sulfur selectivity and a significantly higher thiosulfate formation in gas biodesulfurization systems thiosulfate is usually formed chemically when the enzymatic oxidation capacity is limited thus it can be used as an indication of limited biological oxidative capacity jørgensen and bak 1991 chemically formed thiosulfate can be further oxidized to sulfate by sob sorokin et al 2008 however in our lab scale gas biodesulfurization set up thiosulfate only accumulated in the process liquid when the abiotic formation rates of thiosulfate were higher than the biological oxidation rates to understand the observed differences in formed end products by different biomasses we investigated the underlying biological reaction mechanism and kinetics such as maximum biological respiration rates our results of the kinetic experiments are in good agreement with reported literature our measurements of r max 0 64 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 corresponds to data reported by van den bosch et al 2009 klok et al 2012 and roman et al 2016c who tested paper mill 1 biomass in their studies and observed r max in the order of 0 3 0 6 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 differences between these reported values can be explained by fluctuations in the operating conditions over time for example at paper mill 1 we learned that the solutions ph buffer capacity sulfide concentration in the gas feed and orp set point fluctuated significantly in the period before the inoculum was collected personal communication with the plant manager it is known that variations in orp set point value in time will vary the oxygen supply rates and thus the o2 h2s ratio this in turn will affect the selectivities for the various end products van den bosch et al 2007 for example in the work of roman et al 2015 paper mill 1 inoculum was also used in their studies thiosulfate selectivity was reported two times lower than found in this study a possible explanation is the observed operational fluctuations since 2016 at the paper mill 1 full scale installation that affected the potential of the biomass for sulfate and sulfur formation at different orp set points it can be expected that changes in the biological activity are explained by the differences in microbial physiology in this study parameter α is introduced to link physiology of biological sulfide oxidation and formation of end products in the biodesulfurization process in fig 5 the relation between the formed products and α is presented for systems operated at oxygen limiting conditions orp 390 mv it can be seen that the highest selectivity for sulfur formation 92 2 mol was found for the lowest α values i e 0 35 0 7 whilst the highest selectivity for sulfate formation 7 2 mol was found for the highest α value above 0 8 the highest α was found for paper mill 1 biomass 1 23 0 17 which correlates to a high potential for sulfate formation however under oxygen limiting conditions paper mill 1 biomass has low biomass activity thus the formation of thiosulfate is high 17 6 mol and sulfate is almost not formed due to oxygen limitation from these it follows that α can be an effective parameter to screen biomasses which are able to generate elemental sulfur under oxygen limiting conditions higher biomass growth rates were found at increasing selectivities for sulfate formation because more energy is liberated from sulfide oxidation compared to the sulfur formation buisman et al 1991 janssen et al 1998 klok et al 2013 however growth rates are also dependent on the microbial community composition as different species have different growth rates and oxidation capacities for example the highest measured biomass growth 0 52 0 03 mg n l 1 h 1 was observed for landfill biomass but the highest measured selectivity for sulfate production 7 2 0 4 was observed for paper mill 2 biomass table 4 as well as growth rates of oilfield and paper mill 2 are similar but selectivity for sulfate is two fold different this deviation is possibly caused by the abundance of thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum in oilfield biomass thioalkalimicrobium species are known for their high capacity for sulfide oxidation and fast but inefficiently opportunistic growth during short periods of substrate excess sorokin and kuenen 2005 in contrast highly abundant thioalkalivibrio species in paper mill 1 are slow growing with high growth yield and survive longer during substrate limitation sorokin et al 2007 hence in the absence of sulfate formation the relatively low energy yield from sulfide oxidation was used for cell maintenance rather than paper mill 1 biomass growth to deepen our understanding of the process performance a relation between microbial composition and process conditions need to be established microbial community composition was determined with 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and showed that thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus was the dominant sob species in samples from paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill also sorokin et al found that thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus was dominant in paper mill 1 2012 the gas composition fed to the paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 full scale plants are almost the same but operating conditions differ table 2 microbial composition of the landfill biomass was different from that to paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 it is known that feed gas composition at landfill installations contains hydrocarbons impurities bove and lunghi 2005 hence it possibly triggered a shift in the microbial composition of the landfill biomass a second dominant species in the inoculum is roseibaca ekhonensis described as marine aerobic heterotrophic and alkalitolerant alphaproteobacterium labrenz et al 2009 which also might have taken advantage of the presence of organic compounds in the landfill plant as supplied gas composition in the lab scale setup differs from the full scale installation we observe a microbial composition shift with the reduction of heterotrophs in favor of chemolithoautotrophic sob in comparison to the three tested biomasses the oilfield original community changed the most fig 4 inoculum from the full scale oilfield plant contained about 43 1 of halomonas shengliensis alkalitolerant heterotroph capable of utilizing hydrocarbons that are present in the feed gas wang et al 2007 its relative abundance drastically decreased as feed gas composition at lab scale biodesulfurization system contained sulfide only second dominant species was tv sulfidiphilus with an abundance of 39 3 it is known that tv sulfidiphilus is the most dominant sob in gas biodesulfurization bioreactors when the only sulfide is supplied roman et al 2016a sorokin et al 2008 thus at the end of the process operation abundance of tv sulfidiphilus increased 65 in addition a fast growing haloalkaliphilic sob thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum also proliferated as it grows in the presence of thiosulfate and sulfide sorokin et al 2001 5 conclusions in this work we show that α can be used as a screening parameter that is applied for the biomass selection in order to predict process performance thus to achieve desired products formation factor α represents the ratio between the rates of two enzymatic routes for sulfide oxidation we found that this parameter is a good indicator for the assessment of the end product formation under oxygen limiting conditions in practice this means that the biomass composition is linked to the process performance and sudden changes in process conditions e g mixing will not instantaneously change the s8 forming potential of the biomass in addition α will be more determined by the process conditions rather than the bacterial community composition as process conditions will eventually structure the community composition moreover using process parameters such as oxygen and sulfide concentration together with biomass concentration and its activity its possible to predict the relative formation of biological end products sulfate and sulfur despite showed variations in four tested biomasses at the inoculum stage it is expected that under the similar experimental conditions all microbial communities will converge to a similar end composition we further calibrated an existing kinetic model based on the measured sulfide oxidation rates in batch experiments the kinetic model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in sulfide oxidation i e flavocytochrome c and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase fcc and sqr the updated kinetic model can be used as a tool to evaluate process performance estimate relative formation of biological end products and as an indicator to select inocula for full scale

20012,hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion this paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate in order to optimize the formation of sulfur it is crucial to understand the relations between the sob microbial composition kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency hence a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula the resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance the model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process i e flavocytochrome c and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase fcc and sqr the model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key enzyme ratios hence we introduce a new model parameter α to whereby α describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of fcc and sqr enzymes our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low α values keywords sulfur oxidizing bacteria biological gas desulfurization physiologically based kinetics flavocytochrome c sulfide quinone oxidoreductase 1 introduction during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater biogas is produced from organic matter driessen et al 2011 lettinga 1995 when sulfate is present in the wastewater this will be converted to sulfide and a fraction hereof will transfer to the biogas h2s concentrations in the biogas generally range between 100 and 40 000 ppm v driessen et al 2011 to be able to use this biogas strict specifications have to be applied with respect to hydrogen sulfide h2s levels in natural gas the h2s concentration has to be below 3 ppm v the release of h2s to the environment is regulated due to its toxic and corrosive properties schnele et al 2016 world health organization 2003 thus removal of h2s is required nowadays a variety of desulfurization processes are available to remove h2s from sour gas streams among these technologies the biological conversion of h2s is the most environmentally friendly because no toxic chemicals are required and the process is operated at ambient conditions i e no high pressures or temperatures a biotechnological process for the removal of h2s was developed in the 1990s which has been applied in different industrial sectors worldwide buisman et al 1990 driessen et al 2011 the process is based on the absorption of h2s from sour gas streams in an haloalkaline solvent with a salinity between 0 5 2 m na and a ph between 8 10 janssen et al 2009 van den bosch et al 2007 the dissolved bisulfide hs is subsequently directed to a bioreactor where haloalkaline sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob consume reduced sulfur ions and produce elemental sulfur s8 as the end product eq 1 buisman et al 1989 1 hs ½ o2 ⅛ s8 oh in addition a small part of the sulfide is oxidized to sulfate according to 2 hs 2 o2 so4 2 h next to biological sulfide oxidation chemical oxidation can take place 3 hs o2 ½ s2o3 2 ½ h2o the formation of sulfur is preferred as hydroxide ions are re generated which are required to absorb hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream driessen et al 2011 in addition the formed sulfur particles can be used as a fertilizer and for sulfuric acid production a j h janssen a de keizer lettinga 1994 on the other hand thio sulfate production leads to acidification of the reactor suspension which requires the addition of sodium hydroxide to maintain the ph for the bacterial optimum conditions and adsorption of sulfide hence in order to optimize the formation of sulfur the oxygen supply should be carefully controlled janssen et al 1995 haloalkaline sob are naturally occurring microorganisms that can be found in alkaline and highly saline environments such as soda lakes sorokin et al 2013 sorokin and kuenen 2005 most known haloalkaline sob are members of the gammaproteobacteria class belonging to the genera ectothiorodospira thioalkalivibrio thioalkalimicrobium and thioalkalispira foti et al 2007 bacteria from ectothiorodospira genus are phototrophic sulfur purple bacteria whereas the other three genera are obligate chemolithoautotrophs using various reduced inorganic sulfur compounds as an electron donor ghosh and dam 2009 sob can use two groups of enzymes for sulfide oxidation the periplasmic fad containing flavocytochrome c fcc and the membrane bound sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr donating electrons to the uq pool griesbeck et al 2000 when bi sulfide oxidation is mediated by fcc bi sulfide is oxidized to sulfane s0 using oxidized cytochrome c cyt as an electron acceptor dahl 2006 griesbeck et al 2000 4 hs 2 cyt s0 2 cyt h subsequently the reduced cytochrome c cyt is oxidized through the reduction of oxygen to water and governed by cytochrome c oxidase mitchell and moyle 1967 5 4 cyt 4 h o2 4 cyt 2h2o however the role of fcc as the major responsible enzyme for sulfide oxidation has been questioned as many sob species lack this protein kappler 2007 the sqr pathway is energetically more favorable and less sensitive to inhibition by toxic compounds for example methanethiol brune 1989 the sqr mediated sulfide oxidation end product is a soluble polysulfide griesbeck et al 2002 the sqr route prevails when sulfide oxidation takes place at oxygen limiting conditions klok et al 2013 in addition it is postulated that sob may contain both enzymes and the environmental conditions regulate which enzyme activity prevails to be able to grow the haloalkaliphilic chemolithoautotrophic sob must have specially adapted bioenergetics muyzer et al 2011 in full scale gas biodesulfurization installations differences between microbial community compositions were observed roman et al 2016b expression of sulfide oxidizing routes which define reaction kinetics and observed bacterial growth rates influence the process efficiency the aim of this study is to understand the relation between the bacterial community composition biological sulfide oxidation kinetics and the biodesulfurization process efficiency to optimize sulfur formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and design the laboratory setup consisted of a falling film gas absorber integrated with a gas lift reactor fig 1 roman et al 2016a gases were supplied to the gas absorber using mass flow controllers type el flow model f 201dv agd 33 k e bronkhorst the netherlands for each gas a mass flow controller was selected based on the dosing rate for hydrogen

carbon dioxide dosing rates were pulse wise controlled with a multiparameter transmitter liquiline cm442 1102 0 endress hauser germany based on the signals from a redox sensor equipped with an internal ag agcl reference electrode orbisint 12d 7pa41 endress hauser germany and a ph sensor orbisint 11d 7aa41 endress hauser germany a digital gear pump was used to assure liquid recirculation between the bioreactor and the gas absorber ew 75211 30 cole palmer usa at a constant flow of 0 166 l min 1 a gas compressor n 820 ft 18 knf laboport usa was used to continuously recycle gas 20 l min 1 over the bioreactor the gas absorber and the bioreactor temperature were regulated at 35 c by a thermostat bath dc10 thermo haake germany the system was sampled in gas and liquid phases liquid samples were taken from two sampling points located at the bottom section of the absorber and in the bioreactor fig 1 gas phase samples were taken from three locations gas inlet bioreactor headspace and absorber outlet we conducted four similar experimental runs under stable operating conditions table 1 with different inocula section 2 2 each experimental run lasted for about six days during which a stable reactor performance was achieved sampling was done in technical triplicates at regular time intervals in our experiments ph and temperature were kept constant oxidation reduction potential orp set point value was chosen at 390 mv to suppress sulfate formation roman et al 2016b 2 2 biomass sources biomass samples for inoculation were collected from four different full scale systems for gas biodesulfurization which have been in operation for more than ten years each biomass was studied separately one by one under similar experimental conditions the lab scale setup was inoculated with cells obtained by centrifugation 15 min at 16 000 x g of a 2 5 l culture collected from full scale installation these full scale systems were selected based on the feed gas composition it treats and on the industry of application table 2 provides a brief overview of the selected installations two full scale systems which treat sour gas from the anaerobic digestion of the wastewater from the paper pulp industry were sampled in this paper the various biomasses will be denoted by the location of the sampling installation 2 3 medium composition the haloalkaline medium for inoculum was buffered with 0 045 m na2co3 and 0 91 m nahco3 the medium contained 1 0 g k2hpo4 0 20 g mgcl2 x 6h2o and 0 60g urea each per 1 l of ultrapure water millipore the netherlands and trace elements solution as described in pfennig and lippert 1966 the ph of the medium was 8 50 0 05 at 35 c for the respiration test the medium contained carbonate bicarbonate buffer only trace elements were excluded because they enhance the chemical oxidation of sulfide luther et al 2011 2 4 respiration test respiration tests also known as biological activity monitoring bom tests were performed to measure biological sulfide oxidation reaction rates in an air saturated medium a similar setup was used by roman et al 2015 consisting of a glass mini reactor 45 ml a magnetic stirrer and a teflon piston to avoid any oxygen ingress fig 2 sulfide was added to the reactor from a freshly prepared stock solution na2s x 9h2o sigma aldrich the netherlands with a glass syringe passing through the piston the concentration of the prepared stock solution was verified with a sulfide methylene blue cuvette test lck653 if the stock was used for several days the concentration of the stock was verified every time before use the sulfide oxidation rate was calculated from measuring the oxygen removal rate with a dissolved oxygen do sensor oxymax cos22d endress hauser germany the do concentration was recorded using a multiparameter transmitter liquiline cm442 1102 0 endress hauser the netherlands all experiments were performed at 35 c dc10 thermo haake germany which is in agreement with the conditions in the lab scale fed batch setup as temperature and medium composition were similar to previous studies a proper comparison of our results can be performed de graaff et al 2012 klok et al 2013 roman et al 2015 van den bosch et al 2009 at the end of each fed batch bioreactor run the tested biomass was collected to measure specific biomass activities biomass was centrifuged and separated from sulfur particles salts by washing with a 1 m carbonate bicarbonate buffer hereafter biomass was ready to be used for the respiration tests at constant concentration 2 mg n l 1 firstly biomass was aerated as described elsewhere van den bosch et al 2009 experiments started by injection of sulfide and the initial slope of the recorded oxygen consumption profile was used to calculate the oxygen consumption rate biological reaction rates were determined by subtracting the chemical oxidation rates from the measured overall oxygen consumption rates chemical rates were measured in the absence of biomass in addition we calculated the endogenous oxygen consumption rate based on the respiration measurements without sulfide addition van den bosch et al 2009 2 5 application of a physiologically based kinetic model the proposed model klok et al 2013 describes both oxidation rates of sulfide through fcc and sqr enzymes i e primary dehydrogenases involved in biological sulfide oxidation and the effect on end product formation i e sulfur and sulfate the calculated maximum sulfide oxidation rate μ of the involved enzymes was determined by the results from respiration tests the electrons released from hs are transferred to the oxidized form of intermediate acceptors i e either cytochrome c or ubiquinones the reduced co factors are subsequently oxidized through other enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase cco and quinol oxidases sqrox klok et al 2013 irrespective of the type of sulfide dehydrogenase employed part of the electrons is transferred to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad the kinetic model contains expressions for the rates of four respiratory enzymes μ fcc μ sqr μ cco μ sqrox in mmol s mg n 1 h 1 and the associated affinity constants k fcc k sqr k cco k sqrox in mm in addition cco is inhibited by sulfide and therefore an inhibition constant is included k i in mm lastly the reduction degree f of cytochrome c and quinone q pool is included in the rates equations which change instantaneously according to sulfide and oxygen levels i e quasi steady state klok et al 2013 the rates for the oxidation of dissolved bi sulfide and reduction of dissolved oxygen are described by 6 q f c c μ f c c 1 f h s k f c c h s 7 q c c o μ c c o f o 2 k c c o o 2 k i k i h s 8 q s q r μ s q r 1 q h s k s q r h s 9 q s q r o x μ s q r o x q o 2 k s q r o x o 2 with q in mmol s mgn 1 h 1 h s in mm and o 2 in mm expression levels for both fcc and sqr were estimated from respiration tests for all tested biomasses described in table 2 the maximum rates for sulfide oxidation through fcc i e μ f c c and μ c c o and sqr i e μ s q r and μ s q r o x were estimated using a non linear least squares estimation routine as fcc and sqr expression levels do not describe the reduction of oxygen it was assumed that increased expression levels of the sulfide oxidizing enzyme systems would lead to a homologous increase of expression levels of the oxidase enzymes associated with the oxidizing sulfide enzymes i e cco is associated with fcc and sqrox is associated with sqr the affinity constants for sulfide and oxygen remained equal to the parameters estimated by klok et al 2013 table 3 more details concerning the parameter estimation and associated standard deviations can be found in appendix b the reduction degree of cco dictates the formation rate of sulfate in the kinetic model the stronger the oxidation degree of the cytochrome pool i e smaller f the higher the potential for the formation of sulfate klok et al 2013 visser et al 1997 we hypothesize that the ratio of expression of oxidation routes of sulfide through either fcc requiring cytochrome c as a cofactor and sqr require quinones as a cofactor is an indicator for the sulfate forming and thus sulfur forming potential of sob under oxygen limiting conditions hence we postulate that the ratio of μ f c c and μ s q r is a predictor of sulfur forming potential therefore we introduce the parameter α defined as α μ f c c μ s q r based on the dependencies between sulfate formation the overall biological activity under oxygen limiting conditions and the oxidation state of the cytochrome system we hypothesize that the smaller the value of α the higher the potential for sulfur formation as the end product 2 6 analytical techniques two types of samples were prepared i e filtrated and precipitated with zinc acetate for anions measurements and non filtrate for biomass quantification and toc analysis all liquid samples were stored at 4 c before being analyzed about three days biomass quantification was based on the amount of organic nitrogen that was oxidized to nitrate by peroxodisulphate lck238 and lck338 hach lange the netherlands the cell pellet was washed twice at 20 238 x g for 5 min with the nitrogen free medium to remove any nitrogen present in the medium sulfate and thiosulfate were measured by ion chromatography metrohm compact ic 761 switzerland with an anion column metrohm metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 mm switzerland equipped with a pre column metrohm metrosep a supp 4 5 guard switzerland immediately after sampling all solids were removed by filtration over a 0 45 μm membrane syringe filter hpf millex merck the netherlands and mixed with 0 2 m zinc acetate in a 1 1 ratio to prevent any chemical sulfide oxidation produced and accumulated sulfur concentration was calculated from the molar sulfur mass balance which is based on the supplied sulfide load and measured sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations at each sampling time point by following this equation 10 d s0 d h2s supplied vliquid d so4 2 2 d s2o3 2 sx 2 initial sulfur concentration is assumed to be 0 concentrations of dissolved sulfide and polysulfides were not taken into account as their combined contribution to the total concentration of sulfur species is negligible kleinjan et al 2005 van den bosch et al 2009 sulfide and bisulfide were measured as total sulfide s2 tot using the methylene blue method with a cuvette test lck653 hach lange usa total sulfide quantification was carried out immediately after sampling and samples were diluted in oxygen free milli q water sparged with n2 stream for 30 min to exclude chemical sulfide oxidation roman et al 2016c in addition to sulfur containing anions sodium and potassium concentration were measured with ion chromatography as described earlier roman et al 2015 using a metrohm metrosep c4 150 4 0 mm column with three mm hno3 as the eluent at 0 9 ml min 1 to close the electron balance as described by roman et al 2016b carbonate and bicarbonate ions concentration were established using the henderson hasselbalch equation po and senozan 2001 for that liquid samples were analyzed on total inorganic carbon using high temperature catalytic oxidation at 680 c with toc vcph cpn analyzer shimadzu the netherlands the gas phase h2s n2 co2 and o2 was analyzed with a gas chromatograph varian cp4900 micro gc agilent the netherlands equipped with two separate column modules namely a 10 m long mol sieve 5a plot ms5 and a 10 m long poraplot u ppu 2 7 dna extraction and 16s rrna sequencing biomass samples were collected for microbial community analysis at the beginning and the end of each experimental run the samples were washed twice with a buffer solution of ph 8 5 and 0 5 m na to prevent the occurrence of an osmotic shock afterward the genomic dna was extracted from the washed biomass using the dneasy powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions all the above procedures were performed in technical duplicates for each sample and average values with standard deviations are presented library construction and next generation sequencing were carried out at the european genome and diagnostics center eurofins gatc biotech gmbh constance germany the workflow started from 16s rrna gene amplification in the v3 v5 variable region using 357f 5 cctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 926r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragt 3 primer set afterward merging read pairs by overlapping was performed using flash magoč and salzberg 2011 with maximum mismatch density of 0 25 the next step was to cluster sequences based on the similarity with chimera removal with uchime edgar et al 2011 using a full length good quality and non chimeric 16s rrna gene reference database cleaned and clustered sequences were blastn altschul et al 1990 analyzed using non redundant 16s rrna reference sequences with an e value cutoff of 10 6 only good quality and unique 16s rrna sequences were taxonomically assigned to the operational taxonomic unit otu to the clusters the taxonomic classification was based on the ncbi database www ncbi nlm nih gov taxonomy the embl ebi accession number for presented 16s rrna sequencing set is prjeb27163 3 results 3 1 biodesulfurization process performance an overview of the results is shown in table 4 the calculated selectivities for sulfur sulfate and thiosulfate are presented as an average value the term selectivity describes the mol fractions of products formed from a reactant or substrate detailed information on the obtained experimental data and determination of product selectivities can be found in appendix c the lowest selectivity for thiosulfate formation 0 8 0 2 mol was obtained for experiments with landfill biomass and the highest with paper mill 1 biomass 17 6 0 3 mol sulfate selectivity was the lowest for paper mill 1 system operation 1 1 0 1 mol and the highest for paper mill 2 and landfill operation with 7 2 0 4 mol and 7 0 0 9 mol respectively the highest sulfur selectivity was achieved with biomass from installations treating landfill and oilfield gasses 92 2 0 9 mol and 91 0 0 2 mol respectively the o2 h2s supply ratio is a critical parameter to control product formation van den bosch et al 2009 this parameter can be calculated from the supplied gas flows as no accumulation of o2 nor h2s was observed indicating that all supplied compounds are indeed were consumed the o2 h2s supply ratio is compared with the value obtained from the formed products based on the reaction s stoichiometry the electron balance was validated by comparing the o2 h2s ratios versus the formed products and that no significant differences were found table 4 hence we conclude that the mass balance for sulfur compounds is closed albeit that at very low concentrations compounds could be formed that were not analyzed by us we studied the rates of underlying biological and chemical reactions by performing respiration tests to better understand the formation of various end products therefore biological kinetic rates were measured using respiration tests our results show that the highest maximum biological oxidation rate r max was achieved with oilfield biomass 0 79 0 03 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 and the lowest r max value was achieved with landfill biomass 0 30 0 02 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 nevertheless both biomasses showed about 90 mol of sulfur formation in the lab scale experiments in addition the specific substrate loading rate of bacteria is in the same order of magnitude hence the achieved end product selectivities cannot be solely explained by r max next to maximum rates the observed reaction kinetics are controlled by substrate affinities marangoni 2003 in respiration tests oxygen levels are typically elevated 100 of do i e o 2 k c c o whereas in gas biodesulfurization process do levels are below the detection limit i e o 2 k c c o hence we have applied a physiologically based kinetic model to describe sulfide oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions moreover to correlate biological kinetics obtained from respiration tests to values measured in the biodesulfurization process parameter α was introduced this parameter is defined as α μ f c c μ s q r and indicates the relative expression levels of sulfate formation routes high relative expression levels of the μfcc and cco resulted in higher production of sulfate which in turn is responsible for cytochrome c pool re generation whereas high levels of the μsqr yield in the high formation of sulfur klok et al 2013 the parameters in the physiologically based model proposed by klok et al 2013 were recalibrated for four inocula originated from full scale installations based on the obtained respiration data table 5 fig 3 results show that paper mill 1 biomass has a high potential for sulfate formation α at 1 23 0 17 hence using paper mill 1 biomass under oxygen limiting conditions orp 390 mv results in low biomass activity and consequently in high chemical oxidation rates 17 6 0 3 mol the other three biomasses showed significantly lower α values indicating a higher potential for sulfur formation under oxygen limiting conditions in addition the calibrated model was used to predict sulfur selectivities for four tested biomasses at various oxygen concentrations appendix d 3 2 bacterial community analyses total dna was extracted and analyzed using next generation sequencing of the 16s rrna gene at the beginning and at the end of the experimental runs to enable monitoring of the microbial community change the most dominant species of the microbial communities in the paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill inocula were thiolalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus with an estimated abundance of 92 6 96 5 and 82 7 respectively fig 4 in contrast in the oilfield inoculum a heterotrophic gammaproteobacterium halomonas shengliensis was the most abundant species with 43 1 in comparison to 39 3 of tv sulfidiphilus fig 4 halomonas species become abundant when organic hydrocarbons are present in the feed streams peyton et al 2004 oilfield biomass is fed by a gas stream originating from crude oil extraction which can explain the presence of halomonas species in landfill biomass the second dominant species was an anoxygenic purple nonsulfur producing alphaproteobacterium roseibaca ekhonensis with 15 5 abundancy whereas its population decreased by a factor of two at the end of the process operation the least abundant in paper mill 1 biomass inoculum were lithoautotrophic sob thiomicrospira thyasirae and heterotrophic halomonas meridiana with only 3 and 2 3 respectively in paper mill 2 prominent biomass species were halomonas campaniensis 1 3 and two haloalkaliphilic anaerobes 0 7 each sulfur reducing desulfurispirillum alkaliphilum and fermentative clostridium anoxynatronum sibiricum desulfurispirillum has been described previously as a dominant sulfur reducing bacterium in the eerbeek plant paper mill 1 sorokin et al 2007 while a close relative of anoxynatronum sibiricum has been enriched and isolated in pure culture from eerbeek plant in 2009 using thiosulfate as electron acceptor sorokin unpublished results this indicates that a full sulfur cycle might be functional in micro aerophilic biodesulfurization bioreactors maintaining highly negative redox potential minor changes in the microbial composition were noticed in the samples collected at the end of the experiments with paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill biomass in landfill biomass r ekhonensis abundance decreased to 7 8 but the other two species thiomicrospira thyasirae and thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum became detectable with 1 3 and 1 2 microbial compositions in paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 biomass at the end of the experiments were similar to the inoculum in contrast the oilfield biomass underwent a profound shift in the microbial community during the performed experiments the population of halomonas shengliensis decreased from 43 1 to 3 8 and was overtaken by lithoautotrophic thiolalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus 66 also two other haloalkaliphilic sob species proliferated thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum and roseibaca ekhonensis with 16 6 and 6 0 respectively changes in the microbial composition of the oilfield biomass are probably caused by a change in the feed gas composition that was lacking an organic carbon source 4 discussion from our experiments it can be seen that the sulfur selectivity was above 90 mol for biomasses that originates from oilfield and landfill full scale installations whilst the consortia that come from paper mill 1 shows lower sulfur selectivity and a significantly higher thiosulfate formation in gas biodesulfurization systems thiosulfate is usually formed chemically when the enzymatic oxidation capacity is limited thus it can be used as an indication of limited biological oxidative capacity jørgensen and bak 1991 chemically formed thiosulfate can be further oxidized to sulfate by sob sorokin et al 2008 however in our lab scale gas biodesulfurization set up thiosulfate only accumulated in the process liquid when the abiotic formation rates of thiosulfate were higher than the biological oxidation rates to understand the observed differences in formed end products by different biomasses we investigated the underlying biological reaction mechanism and kinetics such as maximum biological respiration rates our results of the kinetic experiments are in good agreement with reported literature our measurements of r max 0 64 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 corresponds to data reported by van den bosch et al 2009 klok et al 2012 and roman et al 2016c who tested paper mill 1 biomass in their studies and observed r max in the order of 0 3 0 6 mm o2 mg n 1 h 1 differences between these reported values can be explained by fluctuations in the operating conditions over time for example at paper mill 1 we learned that the solutions ph buffer capacity sulfide concentration in the gas feed and orp set point fluctuated significantly in the period before the inoculum was collected personal communication with the plant manager it is known that variations in orp set point value in time will vary the oxygen supply rates and thus the o2 h2s ratio this in turn will affect the selectivities for the various end products van den bosch et al 2007 for example in the work of roman et al 2015 paper mill 1 inoculum was also used in their studies thiosulfate selectivity was reported two times lower than found in this study a possible explanation is the observed operational fluctuations since 2016 at the paper mill 1 full scale installation that affected the potential of the biomass for sulfate and sulfur formation at different orp set points it can be expected that changes in the biological activity are explained by the differences in microbial physiology in this study parameter α is introduced to link physiology of biological sulfide oxidation and formation of end products in the biodesulfurization process in fig 5 the relation between the formed products and α is presented for systems operated at oxygen limiting conditions orp 390 mv it can be seen that the highest selectivity for sulfur formation 92 2 mol was found for the lowest α values i e 0 35 0 7 whilst the highest selectivity for sulfate formation 7 2 mol was found for the highest α value above 0 8 the highest α was found for paper mill 1 biomass 1 23 0 17 which correlates to a high potential for sulfate formation however under oxygen limiting conditions paper mill 1 biomass has low biomass activity thus the formation of thiosulfate is high 17 6 mol and sulfate is almost not formed due to oxygen limitation from these it follows that α can be an effective parameter to screen biomasses which are able to generate elemental sulfur under oxygen limiting conditions higher biomass growth rates were found at increasing selectivities for sulfate formation because more energy is liberated from sulfide oxidation compared to the sulfur formation buisman et al 1991 janssen et al 1998 klok et al 2013 however growth rates are also dependent on the microbial community composition as different species have different growth rates and oxidation capacities for example the highest measured biomass growth 0 52 0 03 mg n l 1 h 1 was observed for landfill biomass but the highest measured selectivity for sulfate production 7 2 0 4 was observed for paper mill 2 biomass table 4 as well as growth rates of oilfield and paper mill 2 are similar but selectivity for sulfate is two fold different this deviation is possibly caused by the abundance of thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum in oilfield biomass thioalkalimicrobium species are known for their high capacity for sulfide oxidation and fast but inefficiently opportunistic growth during short periods of substrate excess sorokin and kuenen 2005 in contrast highly abundant thioalkalivibrio species in paper mill 1 are slow growing with high growth yield and survive longer during substrate limitation sorokin et al 2007 hence in the absence of sulfate formation the relatively low energy yield from sulfide oxidation was used for cell maintenance rather than paper mill 1 biomass growth to deepen our understanding of the process performance a relation between microbial composition and process conditions need to be established microbial community composition was determined with 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and showed that thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus was the dominant sob species in samples from paper mill 1 paper mill 2 and landfill also sorokin et al found that thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus was dominant in paper mill 1 2012 the gas composition fed to the paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 full scale plants are almost the same but operating conditions differ table 2 microbial composition of the landfill biomass was different from that to paper mill 1 and paper mill 2 it is known that feed gas composition at landfill installations contains hydrocarbons impurities bove and lunghi 2005 hence it possibly triggered a shift in the microbial composition of the landfill biomass a second dominant species in the inoculum is roseibaca ekhonensis described as marine aerobic heterotrophic and alkalitolerant alphaproteobacterium labrenz et al 2009 which also might have taken advantage of the presence of organic compounds in the landfill plant as supplied gas composition in the lab scale setup differs from the full scale installation we observe a microbial composition shift with the reduction of heterotrophs in favor of chemolithoautotrophic sob in comparison to the three tested biomasses the oilfield original community changed the most fig 4 inoculum from the full scale oilfield plant contained about 43 1 of halomonas shengliensis alkalitolerant heterotroph capable of utilizing hydrocarbons that are present in the feed gas wang et al 2007 its relative abundance drastically decreased as feed gas composition at lab scale biodesulfurization system contained sulfide only second dominant species was tv sulfidiphilus with an abundance of 39 3 it is known that tv sulfidiphilus is the most dominant sob in gas biodesulfurization bioreactors when the only sulfide is supplied roman et al 2016a sorokin et al 2008 thus at the end of the process operation abundance of tv sulfidiphilus increased 65 in addition a fast growing haloalkaliphilic sob thioalkalimicrobium sibiricum also proliferated as it grows in the presence of thiosulfate and sulfide sorokin et al 2001 5 conclusions in this work we show that α can be used as a screening parameter that is applied for the biomass selection in order to predict process performance thus to achieve desired products formation factor α represents the ratio between the rates of two enzymatic routes for sulfide oxidation we found that this parameter is a good indicator for the assessment of the end product formation under oxygen limiting conditions in practice this means that the biomass composition is linked to the process performance and sudden changes in process conditions e g mixing will not instantaneously change the s8 forming potential of the biomass in addition α will be more determined by the process conditions rather than the bacterial community composition as process conditions will eventually structure the community composition moreover using process parameters such as oxygen and sulfide concentration together with biomass concentration and its activity its possible to predict the relative formation of biological end products sulfate and sulfur despite showed variations in four tested biomasses at the inoculum stage it is expected that under the similar experimental conditions all microbial communities will converge to a similar end composition we further calibrated an existing kinetic model based on the measured sulfide oxidation rates in batch experiments the kinetic model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in sulfide oxidation i e flavocytochrome c and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase fcc and sqr the updated kinetic model can be used as a tool to evaluate process performance estimate relative formation of biological end products and as an indicator to select inocula for full scale

and van der wal 2010 lee et al 2006 li et al 2008 but membrane cost is potentially prohibitive biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 alternatively electrodes can be coated with charged polyelectrolytes or fabricated with charged binders to cover macropores ion selective layer of low resistance to retain co ions ahualli et al 2017 kim et al 2019b while polyelectrolyte coating could serve as a cost effective means promoting counter ion flux into and out of electric double layers it remains unclear if selectivity enhancements observed under constant voltage charging would hold under constant current operation in which charge efficiency is limited by salt residue from preceding discharge strokes hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 in addition to establishing ion selective layers significant efforts have been made to expand the design landscape of cdi architecture one such architecture is flow through cdi ft cdi which involves the flow of solution through the porous electrode parallel to the applied field ft cdi requires the use of monolithic electrodes with multi scale pores to enable advective flow through the electrode macropores and salt adsorption within micropores e suss et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 this electrode architecture enables a reduction in ion diffusion length due to advection increasing the diffusion kinetics as compared to fb cdi a foundational study by on ft cdi demonstrated a 4 to 10 times increase in the sorption rate as compared to fb cdi with a mean sorption rate of 1 mg g 1 min 1 e suss et al 2012 laser perforation within the ft electrode macrostructure have been shown to enhance the permeability due to an increase in macroporosity e guyes et al 2017 ft cdi however could have higher faradaic reactions leading to anode oxidation remillard et al 2018 and flowing through the electrode could incur elevated pumping energy requirements due to head loss in the electrodes there have been studies on effect of the composite electrode design on cdi cell performance previous studies have demonstrated that a decrease in electrode thickness increases the rate of sorption and that thicker electrodes had higher desalination times without affecting the energy consumed per mol of salt adsorbed dykstra et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 etching patterns in the electrode macrostructure has been shown to enhance the energy storage performance of capacitive and insertion electrodes by increasing effective ionic conductivity and creating a bi tortuous bt electrolyte diffusion pathway bae et al 2013 cobb and blanco 2014 cobb and solberg 2017 nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 reale and smith 2018 2018 bt electrodes have not been studied yet for their desalination performance reduction in tortuosity by introducing macropores could significantly reduce the resistance and increase the capacitance of the cell thereby enhancing the performance of fb cdi cells utilizing bt electrodes in cdi could also improve the thermodynamic efficiency by improving energy recovery and reducing the impacts of salt residue on charge efficiency in the present work the performance of bi tortuous electrodes in an fb cdi cell is tested in constant current operation and is compared to that of conventional unpatterned electrodes asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes were adsorbed onto the electrode films to provide charge selectivity and to maintain the patterned macroporous electrode structure the objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of bi tortuosity on various cdi cell performance metrics at various current densities and cut off voltages 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication electrodes were prepared as described previously reale and smith 2018 briefly yp 50 activated carbon kuraray corporation japan was used as

min using the standard mode of operation for the thinky are 310 planetary mixer to ensure thorough mixing followed by 5 min on the deaeration setting to ensure removal of air bubbles electrodes were cast into a well carved within a graphite current collector l w h 3 cm 0 5 cm 0 25 mm using a film applicator elcometer united kingdom the cast electrodes were submerged in deionized water for wet phase inversion for 1 h to allow water to replace nmp the electrodes were air dried at 22 c for at least 2 h to allow the water and dilute nmp to evaporate two types of electrodes were prepared for the study unpatterned up and bi tortuous bt bi tortuous electrodes were prepared by machining the unpatterned electrodes with macroporous patterns macropores were cut using a 100 μm diameter flat micro mill harvey tool company united states at a spindle speed of 1200 rpm and one inch per minute as previously described reale and smith 2018 the depth of the macropores was targeted at 75 of the electrode thickness a precision limit placed by the macro mill used which had a resolution of 25 μm based on previous studies and simulations the spacing of the macropores covered 25 of the electrode area nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 the electrodes were immersed in deionized water to wet the microstructure and to remove any air bubbles scanning electron microscopy sem was used to characterize the top view of the macropore patterns and compare them to unpatterned electrodes fig 1 2 2 polyelectrolyte coating charged polyelectrolytes were adsorbed onto porous carbon films in the present study not only to introduce ion selectivity at the electrode flow channel diffusion interface but also to maintain the macroporous profiled structure of bi tortuous electrodes ahualli et al 2017 polyelectrolyte coating was formed by submerging the negative and positive electrodes respectively in 100 mm solution of poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac molecular weight 100 000 millipore sigma united states and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss molecular weight 200 000 millipore sigma united states for 24 h followed by drying over night the presence of the coating was confirmed by elemental mapping of a cross section of coated electrodes using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds for presence of sodium and sulfur for pss and chlorine for pdadmac fig 1 for the cross sectional images samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen before sectioning 2 3 experimental setup and desalination experiments two fb cdi cells one containing two unpatterned electrodes and the other containing two bi tortuous electrodes each coated with polyelectrolytes were used for the desalination experiments fig 1c and d uncoated bi tortuous and uncoated unpatterned electrode cells were also evaluated but due to poor performance caused by co ion repulsion table 2 our analysis focused on polyelectrolyte coated electrodes composite activated carbon electrodes were cast into a well etched within a graphite current collector with a 0 25 mm thickness and a projected area of 1 5 cm2 l w 3 cm 0 5 cm there was a reduction in electrode mass due to the etching of macrochannels the area normalized mass of the bi tortuous electrodes both anode and cathode was 14 27 mg cm 2 while that of both the unpatterned electrodes was 15 67 mg cm 2 within the flow cell electrodes were separated using a glass microfiber separator porosity εfc 0 7 and thickness 250 μm and the flow channel was sealed using a gasket of 125 μm thickness the feed solution 50 mm deaerated nacl was pumped through the cell at a flow rate of 0 2 ml per minute using a syringe pump harvard apparatus holliston ma effluent concentration was calculated by using a conductivity calibration curve effluent conductivity was measured using an in line conductivity flow cell ed916 edaq australia experimental residence time in unpatterned and bi tortuous flow cells were measured by an nacl tracer test using a pulse input method by measuring the effluent conductivity and were 32 s and 12 s for the bi tortuous and unpatterned cell respectively the residence time for the bi tortuous electrode cell was higher than unpatterned because of the added volume created by etching the macropores residence times in the reactors were used for the calculation of flow efficiency described in the next section hawks et al 2018 during desalination cycling experiments the fb cdi cells were charged and discharged at constant current densities of 5 10 12 15 20 and 25 a m 2 normalized to the projected area of the electrodes 1 5 cm2 using a galvanostat bio logic inc france constant current cc operation was utilized rather than constant voltage cv to assess the impact of bt electrodes on round trip energy efficiency and net energy consumption qu et al 2016 the cell was charged until a specified cut off voltage was reached followed by reversing cell current at equal density until the voltage reached 0 v the charge and discharge cycles immediately followed each other with no time in between for hydraulic flushing comparison between unpatterned up and bi tortuous bt electrodes was performed with a cut off voltage of 0 8 v up 0 8 v and bt 0 8 v including the use of a duplicate set of electrodes the cut off voltage was kept at 0 8 v to eliminate any faradaic and parasitic reactions that could affect the electrode performance the performance of bi tortuous electrodes was further tested for cut off voltages of 1 0 v and 1 2 v bt 1 0 v and bt 1 2 v a minimum of 10 cycles were run for each condition data were analyzed after a minimum of 5 continuous cycles once steady state had been reached the length and depth of desalination curves did not change at least four curves within the dynamic steady state were analyzed and averaged error bars indicate one standard deviation above and below the mean respectively uncoated electrodes up uncoated and bt uncoated were tested at a current density of 10 a m 2 and voltage window of 0 8 v for comparison to the polyelectrolyte coated electrodes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed to characterize differences in resistance tortuosity and capacitance between unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes and to demonstrate the impact of polyelectrolyte coating potentiostatic eis scan was performed from 100 khz to 10 mhz with 6 points analyzed per decade three eis scans were analyzed to report the mean and standard deviation macmullin number m c directly relates to tortuosity and was determined by fitting the eis data to the transmission

performance metrics and calculations the performance of cdi cells with unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes was characterized in terms of both capacitive energy storage and desalination the equivalent series resistance esr in ω cm2 of the cells was calculated by dividing the initial increase cell voltage by the current density chen et al 2018 capacitance was measured from the slope of

by i considering only the energy consumed during the charging cycle without recovery and ii accounting for the energy during cell discharge with recovery enas was calculated as the amount of salt

n e o u t w i t h r e cov e r y 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bi tortuosity on capacitance resistance and round trip energy efficiency the introduction of macro porous channels increased the effective ionic conductivity within bt electrodes resulting in an average of 27 higher observed capacitance and a 56 lower equivalent circuit resistance fig 2 a and b the ratio of bi tortuous to unpatterned cell capacitance as measured from the slope of the discharge stroke at a charging cut off voltage of 0 8 v ranged from 1 21 at 5 a m 2 to 1 32 at 25 a m 2 raising the charging cut off voltage for bi tortuous electrodes to 1 0 and 1 2 v increased capacitance at lower current densities but also increased esr by an average of 80 and the rate of capacity decay as operating current increased the reduction in the equivalent circuit resistance in etched electrodes provides evidence that the ionic conductivity was higher in bt electrodes alignment of esr values for unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes can be seen with the real impedance values from eis plots fig s2 bi tortuous electrodes showed significantly lower ohmic resistance high frequency region as compared to their unpatterned counterparts fig s2 tortuosity is proportional to macmullin number which can be determined by fitting the eis data into the analytical version of the transmission line model given in the previous study reale and smith 2018 macmullin numbers were determined for uncoated electrodes using the above mentioned model and were found to be 6 4 0 15 and 8 2 0 07 for bi tortuous and unpatterned electrode cells respectively a reduction in macmullin number indicates a reduction in tortuosity for bi tortuous electrodes the macmullin numbers for polyelectrolyte coated electrodes could not be determined because of the overlap between electrode and charged polymer elements in the eis in the mid frequency region fig s2 cusick et al 2013 długołęcki et al 2010 the observed increase in esr at higher voltage windows could be caused by both faradaic reactions and ohmic resistance fig 2b at higher voltage windows the transition of current from capacitive to faradaic leads to an increase in leakage current at low current densities due to longer charging times shang et al 2017 at low current densities faradaic reactions e g water splitting oxygen reduction and carbon corrosion occurring at higher voltage windows would cause ph gradients to establish leading to a more significant initial voltage jump zhang et al 2019 when charged at higher current densities a more significant concentration gradient across the polyelectrolyte ion selective diffusion interface and associated donnan potential may have contributed to the esr and the capacity decay enhancing energy recovery or round trip efficiency has been shown to improve specific energy consumption of deionization długołęcki and van der wal 2013 dykstra et al 2018 the round trip efficiencies observed for cdi cells with bi tortuous electrodes charged at 0 8 v bt 0 8v remained consistently high at all the operating current densities fig 2c between 71 and 80 of energy consumed during the desalination charge stroke could be recovered during the discharge cycle for the bt electrodes whereas the round trip efficiencies for the unpatterned electrodes were between 52 and 71 the bi tortuous electrodes had lower resistive energy losses due to a reduction in equivalent series resistance increasing both the amount of energy that is stored and recoverable as compared to up electrodes increasing the cut off charging voltage of bi tortuous electrodes to 1 0 and 1 2 v led to slightly lower observed η rte fig 2c while the trends in η rte were similar for 0 8 and 1 0 v charging the bi tortuous electrodes to 1 2 v at lower current densities caused a steep decline the recoverable energy this is likely due to a transition from capacitive to faradaic current above 1 0 v the curvature observed in the voltage and sac profiles of the bi tortuous electrodes charged at 1 2 v provide qualitative evidence for the transition toward faradaic current fig 3 e and f round trip efficiencies for the bi tortuous electrodes compare favorably with previous studies on mcdi systems despite the fact that there will be depletion within the electrode structure as compared to no depletion in mcdi when covered with iems previous studies on cdi systems have reported round trip efficiencies up to 65 garcía quismondo et al 2013 2016 for fb mcdi zhao et al previously reported approximately 15 40 round trip efficiency at current densities higher than 25 a m 2 in other studies długołęcki and van der wal 2013 observed a rapid reduction in round trip efficiency from 80 to 20 and kim et al 2019a also observed a reduction in round trip efficiency from 70 to 45 at much lower current densities 2 10 a m 2 these declines were very similar to that of up electrodes while electrode depletion is not expected for mcdi the use of discrete membranes introduces additional ohmic and diffusive impedance which may have limited round trip efficiency in these studies cusick et al 2013 długołęcki et al 2010a these findings highlight how both the bt electrode macrostructure and polyelectrolyte coating promoted energy recovery while enhancing salt removal performance 3 2 effect of bi tortuosity on charging time salt adsorption capacity and rate the higher working capacitance of bi tortuous electrodes also translated to improvements in salt adsorption capacity and rate figs 3 and 4 despite having less active material than up electrodes due to the creation of macrochannels the charging times for the bi tortuous electrodes at 0 8 v were 14 4 longer at 5 a m 2 to 23 8 longer at 25 a m 2 leading to a greater amount of salt adsorbed per charge stroke fig 3 the maximum salt adsorption capacity sac was an average of 42 68 higher for the bi tortuous electrodes 4 1 9 7 mg g 1 as compared to their unpatterned counterparts 2 4 6 8 mg g 1 fig 4 despite longer cycle times the average salt adsorption rate asar for the bi tortuous electrodes was also 21 greater fig 4 implying that the macro channels increased the rate of diffusive flux into and out of the carbon films while the tortuosity of polyelectrolyte coated electrodes could not be accurately modeled using a three element equivalent circuit transmission line modeling the increase in flux can be clearly observed in the cumulative sac for each condition fig 3 further comparing different cut off voltages at 5 a m 2 the charging times for bt electrodes charged at 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 v were 1 298 3 1 635 1 and 2 275 1 s respectively fig 3 leading to the highest salt adsorption of 17 4 0 31 mg g 1 1 2 v fig 4 despite the observance of reverse ionic flux and faradaic reactions fig s1 the rate and capacity of salt adsorption for polyelectrolyte coated bt electrodes compared favorably with previous constant current mcdi studies table 1 improvements in diffusion kinetics and sorption rate for bt electrodes due to the presence of macroporous channels are similar to ft cdi electrodes without having to use highly macroporous specialized monolithic electrodes the 20 increase in sorption rate for bt electrodes is less than yet comparable to the increase in rate by using ft cdi previous studies have demonstrated a 4 to 10 times increase in sorption rate in ft cdi cells as compared to their fb cdi counterparts e suss et al 2012 while in ft cdi architecture advection through the macropores is used to overcome diffusional limitations to increase the sorption rate bt cdi electrodes uses macropores to increase ionic conductivity by reducing the effective diffusion length 3 3 effect of bi tortuous electrodes on charge and energy efficiency co ion repulsion was observed for uncoated electrodes and as expected adding polyelectrolyte coatings improved charge and energy efficiency for both up and bt electrodes ahualli et al 2014 2017 polyelectrolyte coatings significantly improved the performance for both up and bt electrodes by retaining co ions within the electrode macropores table 2 desalination capacity was highest for bt electrode coated with asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes due to the synergistic effect of reduced impedance and ion selectivity however improvements in η ce were significantly lower than previously reported values for electrodes with distributed fixed charge e g charged carbon charged binder and polyelectrolyte coating that were operated under constant voltage gao et al 2015 2016 m kim et al 2019b due to flow efficiency losses commonly associated with constant current operation of cdi cells hawks et al 2018 the charge efficiency of the unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes was impacted by the discharge of retained brine this is because the polyelectrolyte coatings provide incomplete coverage throughout the porous electrode thickness rather than discrete membrane layer fig 1c since polyelectrolyte coated electrodes permit mixing between macropores and flow channel solution under galvanostatic operation a portion of the charge stroke is associated with adsorption and release of residual brine into the flow channel the initial dip in the cumulative sac curves is attributed to the release and subsequent desalination of residual brine from the discharge stroke fig 3 b d and f desalination of salt residue in the flow channel and electrode pores can contribute to significant losses in charge and flow efficiency shang et al 2017 the differences in hydraulic residence times is likely responsible for the disparity in flow efficiency observed between up and bt at higher current densities hawks et al 2018 it is also possible that the structure of bt electrode macrochannels may have hindered mixing due to the presence of vertical channels as opposed to a planar surface despite flow efficiencies of 61 93 for bt 0 8 v as compared to 79 97 for up 0 8 v overall charge efficiency values of bi tortuous electrodes were about 10 higher due to a longer charging times and higher rates of adsorption bi tortuous electrodes demonstrate an sac and asar comparable to the literature despite charge efficiency that are relatively low in comparison to mcdi fig 4 table 1 choi 2015 kim and yoon 2015 kim and choi 2010 zhao et al 2012 this indicates that the adsorption capacity and rate capability of the bi tortuous electrode cdi cells could be further increased by improving the permselectivity of the iem coating while also maintaining the macroporous structure improvements in round trip efficiency and salt adsorption capacity of the bi tortuous electrodes led to a four fold increase in salt normalized energy consumption and thermodynamic efficiency fig 5 c f this increase in enas and η te values with energy recovery elucidates elevated round trip efficiency as a key benefit of bt electrode macrostructures and reinforcing the importance of developing effective strategies for energy recovery chen et al 2018 długołęcki and van der wal 2013 tan et al 2018 even when energy recovery is excluded bi tortuous electrodes demonstrated higher enas values than several previously published reports for mcdi długołęcki and van der wal 2013 kim and choi 2010 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013b and ft cdi hemmatifar et al 2016 qu et al 2016 enforcing the importance connection between internal resistance and specific energy consumption table 1 the highest thermodynamic efficiency was observed for bt 0 8 v and bt 1 0 v at 10 15 a m 2 fig 5e and f as compared to the peak enas which was observed for the lowest current density fig 5c and d while enas only decreases with increases in current density thermodynamic efficiency peaks at 10 and 15 a m 2 for the unpatterned and bi tortuous charged at 0 8 v and follows the trend shown by a previous study for cdi hemmatifar et al 2018 this is because resistive energy losses dominate at high current densities and faradaic energy losses dominate at lower current densities these losses lower the thermodynamic efficiency at high and low currents respectively leading to a peak at an optimal current density the thermodynamic efficiencies measured in the current study compare favorably with previous reports table 1 a previously reported study demonstrates thermodynamic efficiencies of 2 3 2 7 with recovery for various current conditions between 1 7 and 10 2 a m 2 for an mcdi stack reactor długołęcki and van der wal 2013 while the present study shows a higher thermodynamic efficiency 4 for a similar current density of 10 a m 2 fig 5f a recent study reported a maximum thermodynamic efficiency of 9 for a traditional cdi when significant efforts are made to minimize contact resistance hemmatifar et al 2018 indicating the possibility of further enhancing the performance of bt electrodes the contrast of exceptionally high enas and fairly low thermodynamic efficiency is likely attributed to the feeding rate and influent concentration used in this study which led to low thermodynamic separation minimums eq 10 4 conclusions bi tortuous electrodes demonstrate lower equivalent series resistance in the tested range of current densities improvements in this key but rarely reported circuit parameter translated to improved capacitance and higher energy recovery at all current densities reduced electrode tortuosity also increased the rate of salt adsorption and when coupled to higher energy recovery led to a four fold increase in thermodynamic efficiency uncoated bi tortuous electrodes performed significantly worse than polyelectrolyte coated electrodes demonstrating that ion exchange coatings were necessary to promote counter ion flux a limitation of this approach was the use of polyelectrolyte coating which led to charge efficiencies that are lower than mcdi systems these coatings result in a reverse ion flux faradaic reactions and cdi like diffusion limitations as opposed to an mcdi system with discrete membranes an indication that future work should focus on depositing discrete iem coatings onto bt electrodes in summary the heightened performance of fb cdi with coated bt electrodes elucidates that both esr and η c e are key indicators of energy efficiency desalination declaration of interest none of the authors have any

20013,capacitive deionization cdi with electric double layers is an electrochemical desalination technology in which porous carbon electrodes are polarized to reversibly store ions planar composite cdi electrodes exhibit poor energetic performance due the resistance associated with salt depletion and tortuous diffusion in the macroporous structure in this work we investigate the impact of bi tortuosity on desalination performance by etching macroporous patterns along the length of activated carbon porous electrodes in a flow by cdi architecture capacitive electrodes were also coated with thin asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes to improve ion selectivity while maintaining the bitortuous macroporous channels under constant current operation the equivalent circuit resistance in cdi

porada et al 2013 the simplicity of this architecture could translate to low system costs and fouling potential however the charge efficiency ratio of charge equivalent of salt adsorbed to the charge

energy available for recovery during discharge ion exchange membranes can be used to create a selective charge barrier to block co ion transport and thereby improve the charge efficiency biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 lee et al 2006 li et al 2008 but membrane cost is potentially prohibitive biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 alternatively electrodes can be coated with charged polyelectrolytes or fabricated with charged binders to cover macropores ion selective layer of low resistance to retain co ions ahualli et al 2017 kim et al 2019b while polyelectrolyte coating could serve as a cost effective means promoting counter ion flux into and out of electric double layers it remains unclear if selectivity enhancements observed under constant voltage charging would hold under constant current operation in which charge efficiency is limited by salt residue from preceding discharge strokes hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 in addition to establishing ion selective layers significant efforts have been made to expand the design landscape of cdi architecture one such architecture is flow through cdi ft cdi which involves the flow of solution through the porous electrode parallel to the applied field ft cdi requires the use of monolithic electrodes with multi scale pores to enable advective flow through the electrode macropores and salt adsorption within micropores e suss et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 this electrode architecture enables a reduction in ion diffusion length due to advection increasing the diffusion kinetics as compared to fb cdi a foundational study by on ft cdi demonstrated a 4 to 10 times increase in the sorption rate as compared to fb cdi with a mean sorption rate of 1 mg g 1 min 1 e suss et al 2012 laser perforation within the ft electrode macrostructure have been shown to enhance the permeability due to an increase in macroporosity e guyes et al 2017 ft cdi however could have higher faradaic reactions leading to anode oxidation remillard et al 2018 and flowing through the electrode could incur elevated pumping energy requirements due to head loss in the electrodes there have been studies on effect of the composite electrode design on cdi cell performance previous studies have demonstrated that a decrease in electrode thickness increases the rate of sorption and that thicker electrodes had higher desalination times without affecting the energy consumed per mol of salt adsorbed dykstra et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 etching patterns in the electrode macrostructure has been shown to enhance the energy storage performance of capacitive and insertion electrodes by increasing effective ionic conductivity and creating a bi tortuous bt electrolyte diffusion pathway bae et al 2013 cobb and blanco 2014 cobb and solberg 2017 nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 reale and smith 2018 2018 bt electrodes have not been studied yet for their desalination performance reduction in tortuosity by introducing macropores could significantly reduce the resistance and increase the capacitance of the cell thereby enhancing the performance of fb cdi cells utilizing bt electrodes in cdi could also improve the thermodynamic efficiency by improving energy recovery and reducing the impacts of salt residue on charge efficiency in the present work the performance of bi tortuous electrodes in an fb cdi cell is tested in constant current operation and is compared to that of conventional unpatterned electrodes asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes were adsorbed onto the electrode films to provide charge selectivity and to maintain the patterned macroporous electrode structure the objective of this study is to demonstrate the effect of bi tortuosity on various cdi cell performance metrics at various current densities and cut off voltages 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication electrodes were prepared as described previously reale and smith 2018 briefly yp 50 activated carbon kuraray corporation japan was used as

min using the standard mode of operation for the thinky are 310 planetary mixer to ensure thorough mixing followed by 5 min on the deaeration setting to ensure removal of air bubbles electrodes were cast into a well carved within a graphite current collector l w h 3 cm 0 5 cm 0 25 mm using a film applicator elcometer united kingdom the cast electrodes were submerged in deionized water for wet phase inversion for 1 h to allow water to replace nmp the electrodes were air dried at 22 c for at least 2 h to allow the water and dilute nmp to evaporate two types of electrodes were prepared for the study unpatterned up and bi tortuous bt bi tortuous electrodes were prepared by machining the unpatterned electrodes with macroporous patterns macropores were cut using a 100 μm diameter flat micro mill harvey tool company united states at a spindle speed of 1200 rpm and one inch per minute as previously described reale and smith 2018 the depth of the macropores was targeted at 75 of the electrode thickness a precision limit placed by the macro mill used which had a resolution of 25 μm based on previous studies and simulations the spacing of the macropores covered 25 of the electrode area nemani et al 2015 reale and smith 2018 the electrodes were immersed in deionized water to wet the microstructure and to remove any air bubbles scanning electron microscopy sem was used to characterize the top view of the macropore patterns and compare them to unpatterned electrodes fig 1 2 2 polyelectrolyte coating charged polyelectrolytes were adsorbed onto porous carbon films in the present study not only to introduce ion selectivity at the electrode flow channel diffusion interface but also to maintain the macroporous profiled structure of bi tortuous electrodes ahualli et al 2017 polyelectrolyte coating was formed by submerging the negative and positive electrodes respectively in 100 mm solution of poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac molecular weight 100 000 millipore sigma united states and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss molecular weight 200 000 millipore sigma united states for 24 h followed by drying over night the presence of the coating was confirmed by elemental mapping of a cross section of coated electrodes using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds for presence of sodium and sulfur for pss and chlorine for pdadmac fig 1 for the cross sectional images samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen before sectioning 2 3 experimental setup and desalination experiments two fb cdi cells one containing two unpatterned electrodes and the other containing two bi tortuous electrodes each coated with polyelectrolytes were used for the desalination experiments fig 1c and d uncoated bi tortuous and uncoated unpatterned electrode cells were also evaluated but due to poor performance caused by co ion repulsion table 2 our analysis focused on polyelectrolyte coated electrodes composite activated carbon electrodes were cast into a well etched within a graphite current collector with a 0 25 mm thickness and a projected area of 1 5 cm2 l w 3 cm 0 5 cm there was a reduction in electrode mass due to the etching of macrochannels the area normalized mass of the bi tortuous electrodes both anode and cathode was 14 27 mg cm 2 while that of both the unpatterned electrodes was 15 67 mg cm 2 within the flow cell electrodes were separated using a glass microfiber separator porosity εfc 0 7 and thickness 250 μm and the flow channel was sealed using a gasket of 125 μm thickness the feed solution 50 mm deaerated nacl was pumped through the cell at a flow rate of 0 2 ml per minute using a syringe pump harvard apparatus holliston ma effluent concentration was calculated by using a conductivity calibration curve effluent conductivity was measured using an in line conductivity flow cell ed916 edaq australia experimental residence time in unpatterned and bi tortuous flow cells were measured by an nacl tracer test using a pulse input method by measuring the effluent conductivity and were 32 s and 12 s for the bi tortuous and unpatterned cell respectively the residence time for the bi tortuous electrode cell was higher than unpatterned because of the added volume created by etching the macropores residence times in the reactors were used for the calculation of flow efficiency described in the next section hawks et al 2018 during desalination cycling experiments the fb cdi cells were charged and discharged at constant current densities of 5 10 12 15 20 and 25 a m 2 normalized to the projected area of the electrodes 1 5 cm2 using a galvanostat bio logic inc france constant current cc operation was utilized rather than constant voltage cv to assess the impact of bt electrodes on round trip energy efficiency and net energy consumption qu et al 2016 the cell was charged until a specified cut off voltage was reached followed by reversing cell current at equal density until the voltage reached 0 v the charge and discharge cycles immediately followed each other with no time in between for hydraulic flushing comparison between unpatterned up and bi tortuous bt electrodes was performed with a cut off voltage of 0 8 v up 0 8 v and bt 0 8 v including the use of a duplicate set of electrodes the cut off voltage was kept at 0 8 v to eliminate any faradaic and parasitic reactions that could affect the electrode performance the performance of bi tortuous electrodes was further tested for cut off voltages of 1 0 v and 1 2 v bt 1 0 v and bt 1 2 v a minimum of 10 cycles were run for each condition data were analyzed after a minimum of 5 continuous cycles once steady state had been reached the length and depth of desalination curves did not change at least four curves within the dynamic steady state were analyzed and averaged error bars indicate one standard deviation above and below the mean respectively uncoated electrodes up uncoated and bt uncoated were tested at a current density of 10 a m 2 and voltage window of 0 8 v for comparison to the polyelectrolyte coated electrodes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed to characterize differences in resistance tortuosity and capacitance between unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes and to demonstrate the impact of polyelectrolyte coating potentiostatic eis scan was performed from 100 khz to 10 mhz with 6 points analyzed per decade three eis scans were analyzed to report the mean and standard deviation macmullin number m c directly relates to tortuosity and was determined by fitting the eis data to the transmission

performance metrics and calculations the performance of cdi cells with unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes was characterized in terms of both capacitive energy storage and desalination the equivalent series resistance esr in ω cm2 of the cells was calculated by dividing the initial increase cell voltage by the current density chen et al 2018 capacitance was measured from the slope of

by i considering only the energy consumed during the charging cycle without recovery and ii accounting for the energy during cell discharge with recovery enas was calculated as the amount of salt

n e o u t w i t h r e cov e r y 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of bi tortuosity on capacitance resistance and round trip energy efficiency the introduction of macro porous channels increased the effective ionic conductivity within bt electrodes resulting in an average of 27 higher observed capacitance and a 56 lower equivalent circuit resistance fig 2 a and b the ratio of bi tortuous to unpatterned cell capacitance as measured from the slope of the discharge stroke at a charging cut off voltage of 0 8 v ranged from 1 21 at 5 a m 2 to 1 32 at 25 a m 2 raising the charging cut off voltage for bi tortuous electrodes to 1 0 and 1 2 v increased capacitance at lower current densities but also increased esr by an average of 80 and the rate of capacity decay as operating current increased the reduction in the equivalent circuit resistance in etched electrodes provides evidence that the ionic conductivity was higher in bt electrodes alignment of esr values for unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes can be seen with the real impedance values from eis plots fig s2 bi tortuous electrodes showed significantly lower ohmic resistance high frequency region as compared to their unpatterned counterparts fig s2 tortuosity is proportional to macmullin number which can be determined by fitting the eis data into the analytical version of the transmission line model given in the previous study reale and smith 2018 macmullin numbers were determined for uncoated electrodes using the above mentioned model and were found to be 6 4 0 15 and 8 2 0 07 for bi tortuous and unpatterned electrode cells respectively a reduction in macmullin number indicates a reduction in tortuosity for bi tortuous electrodes the macmullin numbers for polyelectrolyte coated electrodes could not be determined because of the overlap between electrode and charged polymer elements in the eis in the mid frequency region fig s2 cusick et al 2013 długołęcki et al 2010 the observed increase in esr at higher voltage windows could be caused by both faradaic reactions and ohmic resistance fig 2b at higher voltage windows the transition of current from capacitive to faradaic leads to an increase in leakage current at low current densities due to longer charging times shang et al 2017 at low current densities faradaic reactions e g water splitting oxygen reduction and carbon corrosion occurring at higher voltage windows would cause ph gradients to establish leading to a more significant initial voltage jump zhang et al 2019 when charged at higher current densities a more significant concentration gradient across the polyelectrolyte ion selective diffusion interface and associated donnan potential may have contributed to the esr and the capacity decay enhancing energy recovery or round trip efficiency has been shown to improve specific energy consumption of deionization długołęcki and van der wal 2013 dykstra et al 2018 the round trip efficiencies observed for cdi cells with bi tortuous electrodes charged at 0 8 v bt 0 8v remained consistently high at all the operating current densities fig 2c between 71 and 80 of energy consumed during the desalination charge stroke could be recovered during the discharge cycle for the bt electrodes whereas the round trip efficiencies for the unpatterned electrodes were between 52 and 71 the bi tortuous electrodes had lower resistive energy losses due to a reduction in equivalent series resistance increasing both the amount of energy that is stored and recoverable as compared to up electrodes increasing the cut off charging voltage of bi tortuous electrodes to 1 0 and 1 2 v led to slightly lower observed η rte fig 2c while the trends in η rte were similar for 0 8 and 1 0 v charging the bi tortuous electrodes to 1 2 v at lower current densities caused a steep decline the recoverable energy this is likely due to a transition from capacitive to faradaic current above 1 0 v the curvature observed in the voltage and sac profiles of the bi tortuous electrodes charged at 1 2 v provide qualitative evidence for the transition toward faradaic current fig 3 e and f round trip efficiencies for the bi tortuous electrodes compare favorably with previous studies on mcdi systems despite the fact that there will be depletion within the electrode structure as compared to no depletion in mcdi when covered with iems previous studies on cdi systems have reported round trip efficiencies up to 65 garcía quismondo et al 2013 2016 for fb mcdi zhao et al previously reported approximately 15 40 round trip efficiency at current densities higher than 25 a m 2 in other studies długołęcki and van der wal 2013 observed a rapid reduction in round trip efficiency from 80 to 20 and kim et al 2019a also observed a reduction in round trip efficiency from 70 to 45 at much lower current densities 2 10 a m 2 these declines were very similar to that of up electrodes while electrode depletion is not expected for mcdi the use of discrete membranes introduces additional ohmic and diffusive impedance which may have limited round trip efficiency in these studies cusick et al 2013 długołęcki et al 2010a these findings highlight how both the bt electrode macrostructure and polyelectrolyte coating promoted energy recovery while enhancing salt removal performance 3 2 effect of bi tortuosity on charging time salt adsorption capacity and rate the higher working capacitance of bi tortuous electrodes also translated to improvements in salt adsorption capacity and rate figs 3 and 4 despite having less active material than up electrodes due to the creation of macrochannels the charging times for the bi tortuous electrodes at 0 8 v were 14 4 longer at 5 a m 2 to 23 8 longer at 25 a m 2 leading to a greater amount of salt adsorbed per charge stroke fig 3 the maximum salt adsorption capacity sac was an average of 42 68 higher for the bi tortuous electrodes 4 1 9 7 mg g 1 as compared to their unpatterned counterparts 2 4 6 8 mg g 1 fig 4 despite longer cycle times the average salt adsorption rate asar for the bi tortuous electrodes was also 21 greater fig 4 implying that the macro channels increased the rate of diffusive flux into and out of the carbon films while the tortuosity of polyelectrolyte coated electrodes could not be accurately modeled using a three element equivalent circuit transmission line modeling the increase in flux can be clearly observed in the cumulative sac for each condition fig 3 further comparing different cut off voltages at 5 a m 2 the charging times for bt electrodes charged at 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 v were 1 298 3 1 635 1 and 2 275 1 s respectively fig 3 leading to the highest salt adsorption of 17 4 0 31 mg g 1 1 2 v fig 4 despite the observance of reverse ionic flux and faradaic reactions fig s1 the rate and capacity of salt adsorption for polyelectrolyte coated bt electrodes compared favorably with previous constant current mcdi studies table 1 improvements in diffusion kinetics and sorption rate for bt electrodes due to the presence of macroporous channels are similar to ft cdi electrodes without having to use highly macroporous specialized monolithic electrodes the 20 increase in sorption rate for bt electrodes is less than yet comparable to the increase in rate by using ft cdi previous studies have demonstrated a 4 to 10 times increase in sorption rate in ft cdi cells as compared to their fb cdi counterparts e suss et al 2012 while in ft cdi architecture advection through the macropores is used to overcome diffusional limitations to increase the sorption rate bt cdi electrodes uses macropores to increase ionic conductivity by reducing the effective diffusion length 3 3 effect of bi tortuous electrodes on charge and energy efficiency co ion repulsion was observed for uncoated electrodes and as expected adding polyelectrolyte coatings improved charge and energy efficiency for both up and bt electrodes ahualli et al 2014 2017 polyelectrolyte coatings significantly improved the performance for both up and bt electrodes by retaining co ions within the electrode macropores table 2 desalination capacity was highest for bt electrode coated with asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes due to the synergistic effect of reduced impedance and ion selectivity however improvements in η ce were significantly lower than previously reported values for electrodes with distributed fixed charge e g charged carbon charged binder and polyelectrolyte coating that were operated under constant voltage gao et al 2015 2016 m kim et al 2019b due to flow efficiency losses commonly associated with constant current operation of cdi cells hawks et al 2018 the charge efficiency of the unpatterned and bi tortuous electrodes was impacted by the discharge of retained brine this is because the polyelectrolyte coatings provide incomplete coverage throughout the porous electrode thickness rather than discrete membrane layer fig 1c since polyelectrolyte coated electrodes permit mixing between macropores and flow channel solution under galvanostatic operation a portion of the charge stroke is associated with adsorption and release of residual brine into the flow channel the initial dip in the cumulative sac curves is attributed to the release and subsequent desalination of residual brine from the discharge stroke fig 3 b d and f desalination of salt residue in the flow channel and electrode pores can contribute to significant losses in charge and flow efficiency shang et al 2017 the differences in hydraulic residence times is likely responsible for the disparity in flow efficiency observed between up and bt at higher current densities hawks et al 2018 it is also possible that the structure of bt electrode macrochannels may have hindered mixing due to the presence of vertical channels as opposed to a planar surface despite flow efficiencies of 61 93 for bt 0 8 v as compared to 79 97 for up 0 8 v overall charge efficiency values of bi tortuous electrodes were about 10 higher due to a longer charging times and higher rates of adsorption bi tortuous electrodes demonstrate an sac and asar comparable to the literature despite charge efficiency that are relatively low in comparison to mcdi fig 4 table 1 choi 2015 kim and yoon 2015 kim and choi 2010 zhao et al 2012 this indicates that the adsorption capacity and rate capability of the bi tortuous electrode cdi cells could be further increased by improving the permselectivity of the iem coating while also maintaining the macroporous structure improvements in round trip efficiency and salt adsorption capacity of the bi tortuous electrodes led to a four fold increase in salt normalized energy consumption and thermodynamic efficiency fig 5 c f this increase in enas and η te values with energy recovery elucidates elevated round trip efficiency as a key benefit of bt electrode macrostructures and reinforcing the importance of developing effective strategies for energy recovery chen et al 2018 długołęcki and van der wal 2013 tan et al 2018 even when energy recovery is excluded bi tortuous electrodes demonstrated higher enas values than several previously published reports for mcdi długołęcki and van der wal 2013 kim and choi 2010 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013b and ft cdi hemmatifar et al 2016 qu et al 2016 enforcing the importance connection between internal resistance and specific energy consumption table 1 the highest thermodynamic efficiency was observed for bt 0 8 v and bt 1 0 v at 10 15 a m 2 fig 5e and f as compared to the peak enas which was observed for the lowest current density fig 5c and d while enas only decreases with increases in current density thermodynamic efficiency peaks at 10 and 15 a m 2 for the unpatterned and bi tortuous charged at 0 8 v and follows the trend shown by a previous study for cdi hemmatifar et al 2018 this is because resistive energy losses dominate at high current densities and faradaic energy losses dominate at lower current densities these losses lower the thermodynamic efficiency at high and low currents respectively leading to a peak at an optimal current density the thermodynamic efficiencies measured in the current study compare favorably with previous reports table 1 a previously reported study demonstrates thermodynamic efficiencies of 2 3 2 7 with recovery for various current conditions between 1 7 and 10 2 a m 2 for an mcdi stack reactor długołęcki and van der wal 2013 while the present study shows a higher thermodynamic efficiency 4 for a similar current density of 10 a m 2 fig 5f a recent study reported a maximum thermodynamic efficiency of 9 for a traditional cdi when significant efforts are made to minimize contact resistance hemmatifar et al 2018 indicating the possibility of further enhancing the performance of bt electrodes the contrast of exceptionally high enas and fairly low thermodynamic efficiency is likely attributed to the feeding rate and influent concentration used in this study which led to low thermodynamic separation minimums eq 10 4 conclusions bi tortuous electrodes demonstrate lower equivalent series resistance in the tested range of current densities improvements in this key but rarely reported circuit parameter translated to improved capacitance and higher energy recovery at all current densities reduced electrode tortuosity also increased the rate of salt adsorption and when coupled to higher energy recovery led to a four fold increase in thermodynamic efficiency uncoated bi tortuous electrodes performed significantly worse than polyelectrolyte coated electrodes demonstrating that ion exchange coatings were necessary to promote counter ion flux a limitation of this approach was the use of polyelectrolyte coating which led to charge efficiencies that are lower than mcdi systems these coatings result in a reverse ion flux faradaic reactions and cdi like diffusion limitations as opposed to an mcdi system with discrete membranes an indication that future work should focus on depositing discrete iem coatings onto bt electrodes in summary the heightened performance of fb cdi with coated bt electrodes elucidates that both esr and η c e are key indicators of energy efficiency desalination declaration of interest none of the authors have any

synthetic polymer materials 5 mm in size and other small anthropogenic litter as particles fibers and microbeads here we determined the microplastic loads and removal efficiencies of three wastewater

previously published rates of microplastic generation in washing machines using measured wwtp flow rates and mp counts we find a combined load of mps leaving all three wwtps with discharged effluent

metropolitan area s surface waters on an annual mass basis when land based mis managed plastic waste sources are also considered however the potential for sorption of chemicals present in wastewater

microplastic microlitter wastewater treatment plants source modeling removal efficiency 1 introduction investigations into the abundance and risks associated with small plastic particles and fibers that are less than 5 mm in size called microplastics have accelerated worldwide in recent years microplastics originate from various primary and secondary sources primary microplastics are specifically engineered to be small such as microbeads that are used for cosmetic medicinal and industrial purposes secondary microplastics derive from the fragmentation of larger plastics such as by sunlight wind and water or other chemical biological or mechanical forces andrady 2011 weinstein et al 2016 primary and secondary microplastics may enter the environment via direct release from shipping fisheries and shoreline activities and untreated sewage treated effluents from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and stormwater runoff jambeck et al 2015 while plastic materials that are inexpensive strong and lightweight offer many advantages for consumer goods most plastics have a limited useful lifespan and they may adversely affect the health of terrestrial and aquatic systems when introduced into the environment thompson et al 2009 the risks posed by plastics will depend on their size composition and life history wright et al 2013 koelmans

synthetic fibers from synthetic clothes washing prata 2018 field observations have found higher counts of microplastics in water and sediment near or downstream of wastewater treatment plants e g browne et al 2011 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 recently several studies have reported microplastic in treated effluent from wwtps around the world with some studies also calculating removal efficiency of microplastics through treatment processes recent reviews of the existing literature on microplastics in wastewater treatment plants are available ziajahromi et al 2016 prata 2018 a compilation of microplastic counts and removal efficiencies from the primary literature provided in table s1 finds that there is a 4 order of magnitude range in microplastic counts per liter of treated effluent within a single study of 12 wwtps by mason et al 2016 microplastic concentrations in treated effluent were observed to vary among facilities by a factor of 50 while variation would be expected due to differences in the service areas and operations of wastewater treatment plants comparing across studies is additionally complicated by variation in sample collection and processing methodologies these observations demonstrate the difficulty in estimating the overall contribution of microplastics by wwtps and underscore a need to continue research towards understanding the methodological socio economic and technological factors influencing microplastic loading and removal through wastewater treatment the objective of the present study was to characterize the loading of microplastic to and from three wastewater treatment plants directly and locally discharging to the charleston harbor estuary in south carolina usa and to determine whether there is a difference in the treatment effectiveness between wwtps or variability over time previous studies in charleston harbor have measured 3 to 11 mp l in the sea surface microlayer with the majority found classified as fibers gray et al 2018 using data collected from local clean ups it has been estimated that there are 7 tons of macroplastic littering the shorelines of charleston harbor wertz 2015 and conditions in the tidal marshes are conducive for degradation to microplastic weinstein et al 2016 the present study is a component of on going efforts to characterize the sources and scale of microplastics in this vital estuarine watershed therefore by extension this work allows the potential loading of microplastic from wwtps to be compared to other sources to the estuary and enables evaluation of best practices for the management of microplastic to prevent entry and dispersal in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location three wwtps in the charleston harbor watershed were included in the present study 2 serving the city of mount pleasant sc and 1 serving the city of charleston and nearby unincorporated communities map in fig s1 mount pleasant waterworks operates two conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants center street and rifle range road which both treat predominantly residential waste with treated effluent discharged into the rebellion reach channel leading into the charleston harbor charleston water system operates one conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant plum island which receives residential commercial and industrial waste plum island discharges treated effluent into the charleston harbor the characteristics of the service areas for the three wwtps as well as treatment steps are compared in table 1 2 2 microplastic sampling and analysis influent and effluent were collected from each wwtp over the course of a year influent was sampled directly downstream of the headworks i e bar or perforated screens but upstream of sludge waste return flows at each facility and effluent was sampled post disinfection immediately prior to treated effluent discharge points sampling was conducted in june and october of 2016 and january april and july of 2017 additional samples were taken at rifle range road in june and july of 2017 to assess intra month variability sampling dates and time for each plant are listed in table s2 the strategy to sample over the course of a year was chosen to observe potential seasonal trends samples at the influent and effluent ends of each mount pleasant waterworks facility were collected as 3 6 l 24 h flow weighted composite samples in glass jars with teflon lined lids samples at the influent and effluent ends of plum island were also collected as 24 h flow weighted composite samples but galvanized steel containers with lids were used to accommodate larger sampling volumes 7 5 11 5 l for influent and 30 l for effluent composite sampling of a larger sample volume especially for treated effluent has been emphasized in other studies to limit the intra day influence of source loading and peak flows talvitie et al 2017a the different sample sizes between wwtps were chosen according to preliminary data indicating expected differences in microplastic concentrations in effluent flow data for treated effluent discharge and sludge wasting rate were collected by plant operators to inform calculations of microplastic loading inflow flow rate was assumed to be the sum of outflow and sludge wasting rate table s2 quality assurance and control steps were implemented to prevent contamination of samples cotton laboratory coats and glass or metal equipment were used when possible during sample collection and laboratory procedures glassware and filtration equipment were thoroughly rinsed with deionized di water prior to use and routinely inspected under the microscope to check for contamination samples were covered with glass fiber filters tclp filter fisher scientific stainless steel mesh or aluminum foil when not being handled procedural blanks consisting of di water 3 6 3 8 l were processed alongside each sample batch to quantify background contamination of microplastics methodology for analyzing wastewater treatment plant samples for microplastics was adapted from previously published methods nor and obbard 2014 masura et al 2015 steps to isolate and enumerate microplastics from the wastewater matrices involved 1 physical separation by filtration 2 chemical digestion to remove interferences in the matrix and 3 counting and characterization duplicate subsamples of each wastewater influent 0 5 l and effluent 1 5 15 5 l sample were filtered through a 43 μm stainless steel mesh filter argus steel richmond va to separate solids the mesh filters with retained solids were then transferred to petri dishes submerged in di water sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and thoroughly rinsed with di water to separate solids the mesh filters were viewed under the microscope to ensure all solids were transferred sonication of this type has been recommended for separating microplastics from matrices collard et al 2015 samples in petri dishes were dried for 24 hours at 65 c while lightly covered samples were then treated with five 10 ml aliquots of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 aq reacting for 30 min at 65 c on a hot plate for each addition to remove organic material from the sample matrix next 6 ml of 1 m hcl was added to dried samples and reacted over 30 min at 65 c to dissolve inorganics and non plastic materials e g cellulosic and semi synthetic textiles like cotton rayon and viscose found in preliminary trials to interfere with plastic enumeration an evaluation of the hydrogen peroxide and hcl additions employed in this method to remove fibers silk rayon nylon polyester viscose cotton and a polyester cotton blend is presented in appendix a supplementary data after acid treatment samples were reconstituted in di water and filtered by vacuum filtration through three stainless steel mesh screens in succession to result in three size fractions 418 μm 178 418 μm and 60 178 μm the filter for each size fraction was transferred into separate petri dishes for a final round of sonication and rinsing then the solids separated from the mesh filters were either transferred to a clean glass petri dish or a gridded colored green nonsterile cellulose membrane filter sartorius stedim germany millipore france and dried in an oven while covered with glass fiber filters to prevent contamination microplastics were visually counted on glass petri dishes underlain by a grid or on the gridded cellulose filter using a dissecting stereomicroscope leica stereozoom s9d fitted with both uv stereo microscope fluorescence adapter electron microscopy sciences hatfield pa and white light and a digital camera jenoptik progres gryphax to count microplastics characteristics derived from nor and obbard 2014 were adapted to fit the structure of this project fibers and particles were identified as microplastics if 1 there were no cellular or organic structures visible 2 colors appeared homogenous throughout 3 fibers were not segmented nor appeared as flat twisted ribbon and 4 fibers or particles did not fragment when pressed there is potential for fiber damage and degradation during digestion so shine and tapering additional characteristics used by nor and obbard 2014 were not appropriate for this study in addition to morphology fiber or particle color was noted examples of identified microplastics are shown in fig s2 during method development a melting point analyzer was used to confirm thermoplastics with melting behavior which was useful for evaluating the digestion method and training for optical identification fourier transform infrared microscopy micro ftir bruker hyperion with germanium attenuated total reflectance atr crystal was also attempted on select fibers and particles retained on filters following digestion in summary over the course of this study there were 5 sampling dates for each of three wwtps and 3 additional sampling dates at the rifle range road facility 2 positions were sampled within each plant influent and effluent and duplicate subsamples processed through 3 sieve fractions more than 200 microplastic sample counts and characterizations were performed over the 1 year study period 2 3 microplastic load and source estimates the total number of microplastics counted in influent and effluent samples was blank corrected and then expressed as microplastic concentrations mp l removal efficiencies re for each wwtp were calculated using the concentrations of mps counted for influent cmp infl and effluent cmp effl eq 1 1 r e c m p i n f l c m p e f f l c m p inf l 100 flow rates 106 l d 1 for influent qinfl and effluent qeffl table s2 were applied to calculate microplastic material loading where influent loading is equal to c m p i n f l q i n f l and loading to charleston harbor in treated effluent is equal to c m p e f f l q e f f l microplastic loads entering wwtps in sewage influent and discharged from wwtps in treated effluents to surface waters millions of mps per day were evaluated in the context of domestic sources and environmental sources respectively based on data and models available in the published literature as detailed in appendix a supplementary data 2 4 statistics standard statistics were performed to determine averages and variance of microplastic concentrations and one way anova followed by tukey s test used to analyze for differences between wwtps statistics were performed using jmp pro version 12 1 0 sas institute inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality control blanks average fiber and particle counts in di water blanks n 2 each date over the study period are presented in the supplementary data in june 2016 there was an average of 26 mps in duplicate blank samples with 71 comprising fibers and most found in the smallest size fraction tables s3 s4 for the remainder of the study only 3 5 to 8 mp total were detected in blanks and the improvement was seen across each size fraction the decrease in mp counts in blanks over time can be attributed to the more stringent anti contamination methods that were introduced after the june 2016 sampling specifically covering samples with glass fiber filters during digestion and drying and using glass pasteur pipettes instead of plastic wash bottles for rinsing glassware and mesh filters with di water as also evidenced in the literature microplastic contamination of samples needs to be carefully monitored and mitigated for example in a study of microplastic in fish foekema et al 2013 found small textile fibers in every sample that were largely attributed to contamination from atmospheric fallout the authors subtracted fibers from all samples and took additional precautions to prevent fiber contamination 3 2 microplastics in wwtp influent average microplastic counts per liter influent by fiber and particle type and the total microplastic daily load in each size fraction for the three wwtps are shown in fig 1 a and b all flow rates and microplastic count data in mp l by date sieve fraction and type is provided in appendix a supplementary material average influent microplastic concentrations were similar between treatment plants fig 1a statistics in table s5 however accounting for flow rates plum island received the highest load of microplastics per day in influent 8000 million mp d to 20 000 million mp d rifle range and center st each received 1000 million to 4000 million mp d fig 1b and table s6 fibers were more prevalent than particles in influent across wwtps and sampling dates fig 1a and table s6 and over 75 of microplastics were observed in the two smaller size fractions fig 1b mp color profiles were similar across the study and are represented in fig s3 as a combined average profile the most common color was white translucent 60 followed by black 22 blue green 13 and red 5 microplastic concentrations in influent varied within a factor of 2 5 at each wwtp over the course of the year fig 1a additional weekly sampling over 4 weeks at rifle range from late june to july 2017 found influent counts that varied by a similar factor this series of samples indicates that within season variability was similar to the degree of variability observed over the course of the year higher sampling frequency may be needed to detect seasonal dependence if present seasonal trends in influent mp concentrations therefore could not be observed plum island showed the highest average mps per day emitted per capita in sewage influent based on the service population with 83 500 29 200 mps per capita per day followed by center st and rifle range with 53 500 28 400 and 49 600 15 400 mps per capita per day respectively table s6 microfibers constituted the majority of counts in samples 60 70 table s6 the validity of influent loading estimates can be cross checked with published studies that have estimated the quantity of fibers released from synthetic clothing in washing machines for instance napper and thompson 2016 estimate that one 6 kg load of laundry can release 138 000 728 000 fibers depending on the type of synthetic textiles we used these estimates to calculate how many loads of synthetic wash would produce the microplastic fiber loads per capita that were observed in the present study appendix a supplementary data table 2 generation of microplastic is dependent on the composition of textiles being washed the type of washing machine and laundering preferences e g water temperature and therefore is variable from wash to wash and from household to household hartline et al 2016 salvador cesa et al 2017 kruschwitz et al 2014 estimate based on a survey in germany that 4 5 kg 5 9 kg of clothes were washed per person per week depending on the number of people in the household in the united states the average household of 2 6 people washes 289 loads per year resulting in an average of 2 1 loads per person per week pakula and stamminger 2010 therefore we reasonably find that depending on textile type on average 0 3 to 2 5 6 kg loads of synthetic textiles per capita per week washed by the populations in each sewer service area would result in the influent fiber loads observed in the present study influent is the raw wastewater that is collected from residences commercial businesses and industries for treatment since the waste stream is characterized by the individuals and businesses that produce it and by alterations during the course of travel in the sewer pipe network variability in mp influent counts should be explained by factors that are external to wwtps service demographics types of businesses or industry and consumer behavior therefore must play an important role influent mp concentrations were statistically similar between plants but at plum island wwtp the average per person loading rate of microplastic was elevated compared to the other wwtps and fiber loading was statistically significantly higher fibers person day table s5 plum island treats a more diverse waste stream which includes residential commercial and industrial waste while rifle range and center st treat mostly residential and commercial waste since some industrial and commercial activities such as media blasting or professional laundering are known to include mps this may contribute to higher amounts of mp per day a further look at the profiles of commercial or industrial customers in the service areas and in the behaviors of residences may improve understanding of the difference in microplastic loading to wwtps 3 3 microplastics in wwtp effluent average microplastics per liter effluent by fiber and particle and the total microplastic daily loads in each size fraction emitted in effluent for the three wwtps are shown in fig 2 a and b all microplastic count data in mp l by date sieve fraction and type is provided in appendix a supplementary material average microplastic concentrations at plum island were statistically significantly lower than for rifle range and center st table s5 fibers accounted for an average of 75 or more in all samples fibers have been seen to dominate the effluent microplastic or microlitter profile in many studies e g 61 89 of all microplastic in treated effluents were fibers in michielssen et al 2016 and 99 were fibers in dris et al 2016 but others have found particles or fragments to dominate e g 20 30 were fibers in talvitie et al 2017b and murphy et al 2016 for all wwtps and sampling dates an average of 75 or more of microplastics in effluent were observed in the two smaller size fractions talvitie et al 2017a found even higher prevalence of small size fractions with 70 in effluent in the size range 20 100 μm and 95 in the range of 20 300 μm these results emphasize the importance of monitoring smaller size classes mp color profiles in effluent were similar across wwtps and were also similar to influent mp except with a lower proportion of white transparent 50 fig s3 mintenig et al 2017 also found a high proportion of transparent fibers in their analysis of treated wastewater average 61 microplastic concentrations in effluent shown in fig 2a each collected as 24 h flow weighted composites varied within a factor of 4 8 and 4 1 at rifle range and center st respectively and within a factor of 2 7 at plum island over the course of the year over the course of four weeks in july at rifle range effluent microplastic concentrations varied by only a factor of 1 6 therefore there was more long term variation in effluent at rifle range and center st while the lowest effluent mp concentrations were observed in october 2016 the variation over the year did not follow any recognizable seasonal pattern across wwtps michielssen et al 2016 also found no seasonal variation in treated effluent concentrations of small anthropogenic litter and reported that effluent counts from an activated sludge wwtp with primary clarification similar to plum island varied by a factor of 2 over time lares et al 2018 reported microplastic counts that varied within a factor of 10 in treated effluent collected over 7 sampling dates in a 3 month period however the authors note that their grab sampling technique likely contributed to the variation observed in the present study effluent concentrations across all three wwtps ranged 1 30 mp counts l which is within the range of several other studies reviewed in table s1 differences in mp concentrations in final effluent could be explained by a multitude of factors i differences between wwtps i e treatment process and technology flow rate service population service compositions ii differences in sampling and processing methods i e grab vs composite sampling microplastic isolation and analysis methods and iii sampling frequency after accounting for flow rates releases of microplastics per day in treated effluents were found to be similar across wwtps plum island discharged 291 596 million mp d rifle range 104 578 million mp d and center st 86 308 million mp d fig 2b the combined loading of microplastic from all three wwtps to charleston harbor results in an estimated 500 million to 1 billion microplastics released in treated effluent per day to compare the mp load per day from the combined wwtps to plastics potentially entering charleston harbor from non point sources we employed a model for mismanaged plastic waste entering coastal oceans see appendix a supplementary data for detailed calculations recent estimates show that 8 million metric tons of plastic wastes are mismanaged each year and enter coastal waterways globally jambeck et al 2015 jambeck et al 2015 estimate that there are 0 1 million metric tons of plastic added to surface waters in the u s annually which is a result of the activities of the 110 million people living within 50 km of u s coasts the combined population served by the plum island rifle range and center st wwtps was calculated as a fraction of the entire coastal population of the united states and then this fractional population multiplied by 0 1 million metric tons of plastic waste to determine this population s potential contribution assuming no regional bias in plastic mis management we estimate that the population living within the service areas of these three wwtps in the charleston area could be responsible for the release of 235 metric tons of plastic per year to coastal waterways which in this area would flow predominately into the charleston harbor watershed as reported above a range of approximately 500 million to 1 billion microplastic particles were released per day in combined treated effluents from the three wwtps making approximations about microplastic geometry and density that err towards overestimation this count value is converted to a mass of microplastic per year of 0 1 0 2 metric tons or about 0 34 0 68 g mp per capita per year the magnitude of this microplastic mass loading in treated effluents is supported by a second derivation approach as detailed in appendix a and comparison to a recent study estimating danish wwtps emit 0 56 g mp per capita per year simon et al 2018 while this analysis is subject to the assumptions outlined herein and in jambeck et al 2015 an order of magnitude level of comparison can be justified therefore according to these estimates plastic from wwtps may account for 0 1 of the mismanaged plastic waste source to charleston harbor surface waters the relative contribution of wwtps to the microplastic load in charleston harbor however will depend on the fragmentation behavior of this litter resulting in microplastic generation the comparison does not include emissions from sanitary sewer overflow events or other potential sources of microplastic microplastic released by wwtps will have different immediate bioaccessibility and chemical bioavailability that also needs to be factored into risk assessment of plastic sources 3 4 microplastic removal efficiency removal efficiencies re of microplastics were calculated for plum island rifle range and center st wwtps in october of 2016 and january april and july of 2017 plum island had the highest re ranging from 95 9 to 98 1 while rifle range and center st res ranged from 74 8 to 97 1 weekly sampling at rifle range from june 30 2016 to july 21 2017 showed consistent removal 77 6 88 0 removal fig 3 results at rifle range and center st were lower than most other published studies which have found microplastic res at wwtps to be typically greater than 95 minimum literature value of 71 table s1 differences in study methodologies may complicate comparisons however an additional factor in our study is that the influent sampler pumps were located downstream of the headworks of the wwtps after influent screens grit removal which may have resulted in lower counts in influent samples and skewed towards lower calculated removal efficiencies though we did not find a clear trend in this study or a factor to explain why variation in treatment efficacy occurs the longitudinal data inform our understanding of loading rates and removal effectiveness at individual facilities variations in res across wwtps are likely due to differences in treatment units in addition to potential variation in the treatment efficiencies in the headworks across plants that would affect influent mp concentrations plum island has four large rectangular primary clarifiers with hydraulic detention times of 2 h the purpose of primary clarification is to promote solid settling before biological treatment each primary clarifier is also equipped with surface skimmers to skim floating solids off the surface of the supernatant water prior to secondary treatment depending on density mps have the potential to be removed by sedimentation or flotation during primary clarification this suggests that additional mps may be removed at plum island via primary clarification michielssen et al 2016 found that primary screening and primary clarification removed 84 88 of microlitter similarly murphy et al 2016 found that primary treatment removed up to 78 of microplastics at a wwtp in glasgow scotland uk particles were more effectively removed than fibers in all wwtps in this study table 3 while we hypothesized that fibers would be more effectively removed due to greater surface area for flocculation that was not observed also finding higher removal of particles than fibers michielssen et al 2016 reported removal efficiencies of 99 and 97 for particles and fibers during treatment respectively however on the other hand lares et al 2018 found higher removal efficiency for fibers 99 1 than particles 89 9 unit operations at facilities sampling and sample processing steps likely influence these comparisons fiber removal rates have been estimated between 66 and 99 in previous studies michielssen et al 2016 3 5 microplastic or small anthropogenic litter currently methods for mp sampling isolation and enumeration are not standardized and studies such as those focused on wastewater treatment plants table s1 collect grab or composite samples isolate microplastics via various digestion or separation techniques or omit altogether and classify with varying size fractions grab sampling is a technique that is useful to capture waste during peak flows or to detect changes over short time periods but it may not provide a representative sample of the waste stream digesting samples to remove organics and other interferences can improve visibility and selectivity during microplastic enumeration wet peroxide oxidation is often used to remove organics and cellular material before microplastic enumeration but cellular material may still remain in the sample matrix dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 based on our method development appendix a adding a small acid digestion step following hydrogen peroxide treatment reduces interferences from cotton and semi synthetic textiles although this may also reduce microplastic polymer types that are sensitive to acids studies using mesh screens 125 μm may underreport microplastics since the present study among others finds a high contribution of smaller size fractions the majority of studies including the present have relied on visual sensory identification to confirm and count microplastics using a set of qualitative characteristics even studies employing ft ir microscopy to confirm polymer composition typically analyze only sub samples while chemical oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and acid was employed to remove interferences the presence of any remaining natural materials appearing visually like microplastic may confound results both positive and negative biases are possible when visual sensory traits alone are used to classify microplastic without confirmation of polymer identity results may represent microlitter or small anthropogenic litter more broadly terms used in previous studies at wastewater treatment plants by talvitie et al 2017a and michielssen et al 2016 respectively although in analyses that did not involve digestion or separation steps in methods especially white translucent fibers and smaller size fractions may be evaluated as potential microplastics in the present study we attempted to use ft ir microscopy with attenuated total reflectance atr to identify plastic composition for fibers and particles however we encountered difficulties in adjusting the atr crystal contact with mp to obtain useful spectra similar difficulties were observed by mintenig et al 2017 during the identification of plastic material 500 μm the authors cite fiber thinness spherical shapes and protrusion of fibers as complications to identification similarly leslie et al 2017 confirmed by ft ir analysis that all spheres and colored fibers in a subsample of those isolated from sediment and biota samples had been correctly identified as microplastic 300 μm mesh using optical microscopy however ft ir spectra could not be obtained for 75 of very thin colorless fibers in the present study in the absence of advanced analytical confirmation the findings are supported by rigorous quality control method development that included melting point analysis and laundry source modeling methods to identify plastic composition and to discern synthetic from non or semi synthetic materials especially for fibers and smaller size classes by ft ir raman spectroscopy or other analytical instrumentation is a crucial research need lares et al 2018 however even cellulosic or semi synthetic anthropogenic microlitter may present similar risks to human and ecological health as microplastic remy et al 2015 polymer typing may help in identifying and mitigating sources and in evaluating the potential for toxicological harm posed by materials broad initiatives to survey microplastics through wastewater treatment using consistent validated methodologies could lead to better understanding of the needs for source management in wastewater 4 conclusions municipal sewage contains high levels of microplastic and other anthropogenic microlitter and therefore although wastewater treatment plants are effective at removing these through treatment operations the small fraction of microplastic released factored with large treatment volumes equates to a significant environmental source of microplastic higher removal efficiency observed in the present study at the wwtp employing primary clarification suggests that retrofitting secondary plants with primary clarifiers could improve microplastic removal while also likely improving treatment of other contaminants of concern upgrading plants to include primary clarification is dependent on site specific factors such as existing plant design service composition service population cost and co benefits which have to be considered before investments in capital improvements occur the high loading of microplastics into wastewater treatment plants presents a point of intervention at the level of the individual consumer given information and opportunity households choice of clothing washing machine models or wash temperatures and frequency could collectively aim to reduce this microplastic source to wastewater treatment plants and ultimately the environment however we estimate that wastewater treatment plants may contribute 0 1 of total plastic mass into waterways such as charleston harbor and therefore the introduction of mismanaged plastic waste into the environment and fragmentation over time is another concern plastics of different size and composition may present acute or chronic risks to different receptor organisms microplastics emitted from wastewater treatment plants may present unique toxicological risks posed by their immediate bioaccessibility and their potential to have relatively high concentrations of sorbed pharmaceuticals and other chemicals found in wastewater compared to natural organic matter or dietary items found in the environment depending on factors such as sorption capacity and desorption kinetics beckingham and ghosh 2017 li et al 2018 seidensticker et al 2017 in order to reduce the dispersal and potential harmful effects of microplastic pollution a broad view on managing point and

synthetic polymer materials 5 mm in size and other small anthropogenic litter as particles fibers and microbeads here we determined the microplastic loads and removal efficiencies of three wastewater treatment plants wwtps with different treatment sizes operations and service compositions discharging to charleston harbor south carolina usa over the course of a year overall we found that mp concentrations counts per l varied within a factor of 2 5 in influent and 4 8 in effluent at each wwtp and that neither concentrations nor removal efficiencies demonstrated a seasonal trend the largest wastewater treatment plant in the study which also employed primary clarification had the highest mp removal efficiency of 97 6 1 2 the other two smaller facilities had average removal efficiencies of 85 2 6 0 and 85 5 9 1 we demonstrate through source modeling that microplastic fiber loads in influent were consistent with service area populations laundering textiles given previously published rates of microplastic generation in washing machines using measured wwtp flow rates and mp counts we find a combined load of mps leaving all three wwtps with discharged effluent totaling 500 1000 million mps per day we estimate from this the emission of 0 34 0 68 g mp per capita per year in treated wastewater which may only account for 0 1 of plastic debris input to this metropolitan area s surface waters on an annual mass basis when land based mis managed plastic waste sources are also considered however the potential for sorption of chemicals present in wastewater to microplastics and their small size which confers immediate bioaccessibility may present unique toxicological risks for microplastics discharged from wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic microlitter wastewater treatment plants source modeling removal efficiency 1 introduction investigations into the abundance and risks associated with small plastic particles and fibers that are less than 5 mm in size called microplastics have accelerated worldwide in recent years microplastics originate from various primary and secondary sources primary microplastics are specifically engineered to be small such as microbeads that are used for cosmetic medicinal and industrial purposes secondary microplastics derive from the fragmentation of larger plastics such as by sunlight wind and water or other chemical biological or mechanical forces andrady 2011 weinstein et al 2016 primary and secondary microplastics may enter the environment via direct release from shipping fisheries and shoreline activities and untreated sewage treated effluents from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and stormwater runoff jambeck et al 2015 while plastic materials that are inexpensive strong and lightweight offer many advantages for consumer goods most plastics have a limited useful lifespan and they may adversely affect the health of terrestrial and aquatic systems when introduced into the environment thompson et al 2009 the risks posed by plastics will depend on their size composition and life history wright et al 2013 koelmans et al 2017 jahnke et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants serve to collect and treat wastes that are known to include microplastic sources such as microplastic particles from personal care products and synthetic fibers from synthetic clothes washing prata 2018 field observations have found higher counts of microplastics in water and sediment near or downstream of wastewater treatment plants e g browne et al 2011 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 recently several studies have reported microplastic in treated effluent from wwtps around the world with some studies also calculating removal efficiency of microplastics through treatment processes recent reviews of the existing literature on microplastics in wastewater treatment plants are available ziajahromi et al 2016 prata 2018 a compilation of microplastic counts and removal efficiencies from the primary literature provided in table s1 finds that there is a 4 order of magnitude range in microplastic counts per liter of treated effluent within a single study of 12 wwtps by mason et al 2016 microplastic concentrations in treated effluent were observed to vary among facilities by a factor of 50 while variation would be expected due to differences in the service areas and operations of wastewater treatment plants comparing across studies is additionally complicated by variation in sample collection and processing methodologies these observations demonstrate the difficulty in estimating the overall contribution of microplastics by wwtps and underscore a need to continue research towards understanding the methodological socio economic and technological factors influencing microplastic loading and removal through wastewater treatment the objective of the present study was to characterize the loading of microplastic to and from three wastewater treatment plants directly and locally discharging to the charleston harbor estuary in south carolina usa and to determine whether there is a difference in the treatment effectiveness between wwtps or variability over time previous studies in charleston harbor have measured 3 to 11 mp l in the sea surface microlayer with the majority found classified as fibers gray et al 2018 using data collected from local clean ups it has been estimated that there are 7 tons of macroplastic littering the shorelines of charleston harbor wertz 2015 and conditions in the tidal marshes are conducive for degradation to microplastic weinstein et al 2016 the present study is a component of on going efforts to characterize the sources and scale of microplastics in this vital estuarine watershed therefore by extension this work allows the potential loading of microplastic from wwtps to be compared to other sources to the estuary and enables evaluation of best practices for the management of microplastic to prevent entry and dispersal in the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location three wwtps in the charleston harbor watershed were included

conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants center street and rifle range road which both treat predominantly residential waste with treated effluent discharged into the rebellion reach channel leading into the charleston harbor charleston water system operates one conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant plum island which receives residential commercial and industrial waste plum island discharges treated effluent into the charleston harbor the characteristics of the service areas for the three wwtps as well as treatment steps are compared in table 1 2 2 microplastic sampling and analysis influent and effluent were collected from each wwtp over the course of a year influent was sampled directly downstream of the headworks i e bar or perforated screens but upstream of sludge waste return flows at each facility and effluent was sampled post disinfection immediately prior to treated effluent discharge points sampling was conducted in june and october of 2016 and january april and july of 2017 additional samples were taken at rifle range road in june and july of 2017 to assess intra month variability sampling dates and time for each plant are listed in table s2 the strategy to sample over the course of a year was chosen to observe potential seasonal trends samples at the influent and effluent ends of each mount pleasant waterworks facility were collected as 3 6 l 24 h flow weighted composite samples in glass jars with teflon lined lids samples at the influent and effluent ends of plum island were also collected as 24 h flow weighted composite samples but galvanized steel containers with lids were used to accommodate larger sampling volumes 7 5 11 5 l for influent and 30 l for effluent composite sampling of a larger sample volume especially for treated effluent has been emphasized in other studies to limit the intra day influence of source loading and peak flows talvitie et al 2017a the different sample sizes between wwtps were chosen according to preliminary data indicating expected differences in microplastic concentrations in effluent flow data for treated effluent discharge and sludge wasting rate were collected by plant operators to inform calculations of microplastic loading inflow flow rate was assumed to be the sum of outflow and sludge wasting rate table s2 quality assurance and control steps were implemented to prevent contamination of samples cotton laboratory coats and glass or metal equipment were used when possible during sample collection and laboratory procedures glassware and filtration equipment were thoroughly rinsed with deionized di water prior to use and routinely inspected under the microscope to check for contamination samples were covered with glass fiber filters tclp filter fisher scientific stainless steel mesh or aluminum foil when not being handled procedural blanks consisting of di water 3 6 3 8 l were processed alongside each sample batch to quantify background contamination of microplastics methodology for analyzing wastewater treatment plant samples for microplastics was adapted from previously published methods nor and obbard 2014 masura et al 2015 steps to isolate and enumerate microplastics from the wastewater matrices involved 1 physical separation by filtration 2 chemical digestion to remove interferences in the matrix and 3 counting and characterization duplicate subsamples of each wastewater influent 0 5 l and effluent 1 5 15 5 l sample were filtered through a 43 μm stainless steel mesh filter argus steel richmond va to separate solids the mesh filters with retained solids were then transferred to petri dishes submerged in di water sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and thoroughly rinsed with di water to separate solids the mesh filters were viewed under the microscope to ensure all solids were transferred sonication of this type has been recommended for separating microplastics from matrices collard et al 2015 samples in petri dishes were dried for 24 hours at 65 c while lightly covered samples were then treated with five 10 ml aliquots of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 aq reacting for 30 min at 65 c on a hot plate for each addition to remove organic material from the sample matrix next 6 ml of 1 m hcl was added to dried samples and reacted over 30 min at 65 c to dissolve inorganics and non plastic materials e g cellulosic and semi synthetic textiles like cotton rayon and viscose found in preliminary trials to interfere with plastic enumeration an evaluation of the hydrogen peroxide and hcl additions employed in this method to remove fibers silk rayon nylon polyester viscose cotton and a polyester cotton blend is presented in appendix a supplementary data after acid treatment samples were reconstituted in di water and filtered by vacuum filtration through three stainless steel mesh screens in succession to result in three size fractions 418 μm 178 418 μm and 60 178 μm the filter for each size fraction was transferred into separate petri dishes for a final round of sonication and rinsing then the solids separated from the mesh filters were either transferred to a clean glass petri dish or a gridded colored green nonsterile cellulose membrane filter sartorius stedim germany millipore france and dried in an oven while covered with glass fiber filters to prevent contamination microplastics were visually counted on glass petri dishes underlain by a grid or on the gridded cellulose filter using a dissecting stereomicroscope leica stereozoom s9d fitted with both uv stereo microscope fluorescence adapter electron microscopy sciences hatfield pa and white light and a digital camera jenoptik progres gryphax to count microplastics characteristics derived from nor and obbard 2014 were adapted to fit the structure of this project fibers and particles were identified as microplastics if 1 there were no cellular or organic structures visible 2 colors appeared homogenous throughout 3 fibers were not segmented nor appeared as flat twisted ribbon and 4 fibers or particles did not fragment when pressed there is potential for fiber damage and degradation during digestion so shine and tapering additional characteristics used by nor and obbard 2014 were not appropriate for this study in addition to morphology fiber or particle color was noted examples of identified microplastics are shown in fig s2 during method development a melting point analyzer was used to confirm thermoplastics with melting behavior which was useful for evaluating the digestion method and training for optical identification fourier transform infrared microscopy micro ftir bruker hyperion with germanium attenuated total reflectance atr crystal was also attempted on select fibers and particles retained on filters following digestion in summary over the course of this study there were 5 sampling dates for each of three wwtps and 3 additional sampling dates at the rifle range road facility 2 positions were sampled within each plant influent and effluent and duplicate subsamples processed through 3 sieve fractions more than 200 microplastic sample counts and characterizations were performed over the 1 year study period 2 3 microplastic load and source estimates the total number of microplastics counted in influent and effluent samples was blank corrected and then expressed as microplastic concentrations mp l removal efficiencies re for each wwtp were calculated using the concentrations of mps counted for influent cmp infl and effluent cmp effl eq 1 1 r e c m p i n f l c m p e f f l c m p inf l 100 flow rates 106 l d 1 for influent qinfl and effluent qeffl table s2 were applied to calculate microplastic material loading where influent loading is equal to c m p i n f l q i n f l and loading to charleston harbor in treated effluent is equal to c m p e f f l q e f f l microplastic loads entering wwtps in sewage influent and discharged from wwtps in treated effluents to surface waters millions of mps per day were evaluated in the context of domestic sources and environmental sources respectively based on data and models available in the published literature as detailed in appendix a supplementary data 2 4 statistics standard statistics were performed to determine averages and variance of microplastic concentrations and one way anova followed by tukey s test used to analyze for differences between wwtps statistics were performed using jmp pro version 12 1 0 sas institute inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality control blanks average fiber and particle counts in di water blanks n 2 each date over the study period are presented in the supplementary data in june 2016 there was an average of 26 mps in duplicate blank samples with 71 comprising fibers and most found in the smallest size fraction tables s3 s4 for the remainder of the study only 3 5 to 8 mp total were detected in blanks and the improvement was seen across each size fraction the decrease in mp counts in blanks over time can be attributed to the more stringent anti contamination methods that were introduced after the june 2016 sampling specifically covering samples with glass fiber filters during digestion and drying and using glass pasteur pipettes instead of plastic wash bottles for rinsing glassware and mesh filters with di water as also evidenced in the literature microplastic contamination of samples needs to be carefully monitored and mitigated for example in a study of microplastic in fish foekema et al 2013 found small textile fibers in every sample that were largely attributed to contamination from atmospheric fallout the authors subtracted fibers from all samples and took additional precautions to prevent fiber contamination 3 2 microplastics in wwtp influent average microplastic counts per liter influent by fiber and particle type and the total microplastic daily load in each size fraction for the three wwtps are shown in fig 1 a and b all flow rates and microplastic count data in mp l by date sieve fraction and type is provided in appendix a supplementary material average influent microplastic concentrations were similar between treatment plants fig 1a statistics in table s5 however accounting for flow rates plum island received the highest load of microplastics per day in influent 8000 million mp d to 20 000 million mp d rifle range and center st each received 1000 million to 4000 million mp d fig 1b and table s6 fibers were more prevalent than particles in influent across wwtps and sampling dates fig 1a and table s6 and over 75 of microplastics were observed in the two smaller size fractions fig 1b mp color profiles were similar across the study and are represented in fig s3 as a combined average profile the most common color was white translucent 60 followed by black 22 blue green 13 and red 5 microplastic concentrations in influent varied within a factor of 2 5 at each wwtp over the course of the year fig 1a additional weekly sampling over 4 weeks at rifle range from late june to july 2017 found influent counts that varied by a similar factor this series of samples indicates that within season variability was similar to the degree of variability observed over the course of the year higher sampling frequency may be needed to detect seasonal dependence if present seasonal trends in influent mp concentrations therefore could not be observed plum island showed the highest average mps per day emitted per capita in sewage influent based on the service population with 83 500 29 200 mps per capita per day followed by center st and rifle range with 53 500 28 400 and 49 600 15 400 mps per capita per day respectively table s6 microfibers constituted the majority of counts in samples 60 70 table s6 the validity of influent loading estimates can be cross checked with published studies that have estimated the quantity of fibers released from synthetic clothing in washing machines for instance napper and thompson 2016 estimate that one 6 kg load of laundry can release 138 000 728 000 fibers depending on the type of synthetic textiles we used these estimates to calculate how many loads of synthetic wash would produce the microplastic fiber loads per capita that were observed in the present study appendix a supplementary data table 2 generation of microplastic is dependent on the composition of textiles being washed the type of washing machine and laundering preferences e g water temperature and therefore is variable from wash to wash and from household to household hartline et al 2016 salvador cesa et al 2017 kruschwitz et al 2014 estimate based on a survey in germany that 4 5 kg 5 9 kg of clothes were washed per person per week depending on the number of people in the household in the united states the average household of 2 6 people washes 289 loads per year resulting in an average of 2 1 loads per person per week pakula and stamminger 2010 therefore we reasonably find that depending on textile type on average 0 3 to 2 5 6 kg loads of synthetic textiles per capita per week washed by the populations in each sewer service area would result in the influent fiber loads observed in the present study influent is the raw wastewater that is collected from residences commercial businesses and industries for treatment since the waste stream is characterized by the individuals and businesses that produce it and by alterations during the course of travel in the sewer pipe network variability in mp influent counts should be explained by factors that are external to wwtps service demographics types of businesses or industry and consumer behavior therefore must play an important role influent mp concentrations were statistically similar between plants but at plum island wwtp the average per person loading rate of microplastic was elevated compared to the other wwtps and fiber loading was statistically significantly higher fibers person day table s5 plum island treats a more diverse waste stream which includes residential commercial and industrial waste while rifle range and center st treat mostly residential and commercial waste since some industrial and commercial activities such as media blasting or professional laundering are known to include mps this may contribute to higher amounts of mp per day a further look at the profiles of commercial or industrial customers in the service areas and in the behaviors of residences may improve understanding of the difference in microplastic loading to wwtps 3 3 microplastics in wwtp effluent average microplastics per liter effluent by fiber and particle and the total microplastic daily loads in each size fraction emitted in effluent for the three wwtps are shown in fig 2 a and b all microplastic count data in mp l by date sieve fraction and type is provided in appendix a supplementary material average microplastic concentrations at plum island were statistically significantly lower than for rifle range and center st table s5 fibers accounted for an average of 75 or more in all samples fibers have been seen to dominate the effluent microplastic or microlitter profile in many studies e g 61 89 of all microplastic in treated effluents were fibers in michielssen et al 2016 and 99 were fibers in dris et al 2016 but others have found particles or fragments to dominate e g 20 30 were fibers in talvitie et al 2017b and murphy et al 2016 for all wwtps and sampling dates an average of 75 or more of microplastics in effluent were observed in the two smaller size fractions talvitie et al 2017a found even higher prevalence of small size fractions with 70 in effluent in the size range 20 100 μm and 95 in the range of 20 300 μm these results emphasize the importance of monitoring smaller size classes mp color profiles in effluent were similar across wwtps and were also similar to influent mp except with a lower proportion of white transparent 50 fig s3 mintenig et al 2017 also found a high proportion of transparent fibers in their analysis of treated wastewater average 61 microplastic concentrations in effluent shown in fig 2a each collected as 24 h flow weighted composites varied within a factor of 4 8 and 4 1 at rifle range and center st respectively and within a factor of 2 7 at plum island over the course of the year over the course of four weeks in july at rifle range effluent microplastic concentrations varied by only a factor of 1 6 therefore there was more long term variation in effluent at rifle range and center st while the lowest effluent mp concentrations were observed in october 2016 the variation over the year did not follow any recognizable seasonal pattern across wwtps michielssen et al 2016 also found no seasonal variation in treated effluent concentrations of small anthropogenic litter and reported that effluent counts from an activated sludge wwtp with primary clarification similar to plum island varied by a factor of 2 over time lares et al 2018 reported microplastic counts that varied within a factor of 10 in treated effluent collected over 7 sampling dates in a 3 month period however the authors note that their grab sampling technique likely contributed to the variation observed in the present study effluent concentrations across all three wwtps ranged 1 30 mp counts l which is within the range of several other studies reviewed in table s1 differences in mp concentrations in final effluent could be explained by a multitude of factors i differences between wwtps i e treatment process and technology flow rate service population service compositions ii differences in sampling and processing methods i e grab vs composite sampling microplastic isolation and analysis methods and iii sampling frequency after accounting for flow rates releases of microplastics per day in treated effluents were found to be similar across wwtps plum island discharged 291 596 million mp d rifle range 104 578 million mp d and center st 86 308 million mp d fig 2b the combined loading of microplastic from all three wwtps to charleston harbor results in an estimated 500 million to 1 billion microplastics released in treated effluent per day to compare the mp load per day from the combined wwtps to plastics potentially entering charleston harbor from non point sources we employed a model for mismanaged plastic waste entering coastal oceans see appendix a supplementary data for detailed calculations recent estimates show that 8 million metric tons of plastic wastes are mismanaged each year and enter coastal waterways globally jambeck et al 2015 jambeck et al 2015 estimate that there are 0 1 million metric tons of plastic added to surface waters in the u s annually which is a result of the activities of the 110 million people living within 50 km of u s coasts the combined population served by the plum island rifle range and center st wwtps was calculated as a fraction of the entire coastal population of the united states and then this fractional population multiplied by 0 1 million metric tons of plastic waste to determine this population s potential contribution assuming no regional bias in plastic mis management we estimate that the population living within the service areas of these three wwtps in the charleston area could be responsible for the release of 235 metric tons of plastic per year to coastal waterways which in this area would flow predominately into the charleston harbor watershed as reported above a range of approximately 500 million to 1 billion microplastic particles were released per day in combined treated effluents from the three wwtps making approximations about microplastic geometry and density that err towards overestimation this count value is converted to a mass of microplastic per year of 0 1 0 2 metric tons or about 0 34 0 68 g mp per capita per year the magnitude of this microplastic mass loading in treated effluents is supported by a second derivation approach as detailed in appendix a and comparison to a recent study estimating danish wwtps emit 0 56 g mp per capita per year simon et al 2018 while this analysis is subject to the assumptions outlined herein and in jambeck et al 2015 an order of magnitude level of comparison can be justified therefore according to these estimates plastic from wwtps may account for 0 1 of the mismanaged plastic waste source to charleston harbor surface waters the relative contribution of wwtps to the microplastic load in charleston harbor however will depend on the fragmentation behavior of this litter resulting in microplastic generation the comparison does not include emissions from sanitary sewer overflow events or other potential sources of microplastic microplastic released by wwtps will have different immediate bioaccessibility and chemical bioavailability that also needs to be factored into risk assessment of plastic sources 3 4 microplastic removal efficiency removal efficiencies re of microplastics were calculated for plum island rifle range and center st wwtps in october of 2016 and january april and july of 2017 plum island had the highest re ranging from 95 9 to 98 1 while rifle range and center st res ranged from 74 8 to 97 1 weekly sampling at rifle range from june 30 2016 to july 21 2017 showed consistent removal 77 6 88 0 removal fig 3 results at rifle range and center st were lower than most other published studies which have found microplastic res at wwtps to be typically greater than 95 minimum literature value of 71 table s1 differences in study methodologies may complicate comparisons however an additional factor in our study is that the influent sampler pumps were located downstream of the headworks of the wwtps after influent screens grit removal which may have resulted in lower counts in influent samples and skewed towards lower calculated removal efficiencies though we did not find a clear trend in this study or a factor to explain why variation in treatment efficacy occurs the longitudinal data inform our understanding of loading rates and removal effectiveness at individual facilities variations in res across wwtps are likely due to differences in treatment units in addition to potential variation in the treatment efficiencies in the headworks across plants that would affect influent mp concentrations plum island has four large rectangular primary clarifiers with hydraulic detention times of 2 h the purpose of primary clarification is to promote solid settling before biological treatment each primary clarifier is also equipped with surface skimmers to skim floating solids off the surface of the supernatant water prior to secondary treatment depending on density mps have the potential to be removed by sedimentation or flotation during primary clarification this suggests that additional mps may be removed at plum island via primary clarification michielssen et al 2016 found that primary screening and primary clarification removed 84 88 of microlitter similarly murphy et al 2016 found that primary treatment removed up to 78 of microplastics at a wwtp in glasgow scotland uk particles were more effectively removed than fibers in all wwtps in this study table 3 while we hypothesized that fibers would be more effectively removed due to greater surface area for flocculation that was not observed also finding higher removal of particles than fibers michielssen et al 2016 reported removal efficiencies of 99 and 97 for particles and fibers during treatment respectively however on the other hand lares et al 2018 found higher removal efficiency for fibers 99 1 than particles 89 9 unit operations at facilities sampling and sample processing steps likely influence these comparisons fiber removal rates have been estimated between 66 and 99 in previous studies michielssen et al 2016 3 5 microplastic or small anthropogenic litter currently methods for mp sampling isolation and enumeration are not standardized and studies such as those focused on wastewater treatment plants table s1 collect grab or composite samples isolate microplastics via various digestion or separation techniques or omit altogether and classify with varying size fractions grab sampling is a technique that is useful to capture waste during peak flows or to detect changes over short time periods but it may not provide a representative sample of the waste stream digesting samples to remove organics and other interferences can improve visibility and selectivity during microplastic enumeration wet peroxide oxidation is often used to remove organics and cellular material before microplastic enumeration but cellular material may still remain in the sample matrix dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 based on our method development appendix a adding a small acid digestion step following hydrogen peroxide treatment reduces interferences from cotton and semi synthetic textiles although this may also reduce microplastic polymer types that are sensitive to acids studies using mesh screens 125 μm may underreport microplastics since the present study among others finds a high contribution of smaller size fractions the majority of studies including the present have relied on visual sensory identification to confirm and count microplastics using a set of qualitative characteristics even studies employing ft ir microscopy to confirm polymer composition typically analyze only sub samples while chemical oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and acid was employed to remove interferences the presence of any remaining natural materials appearing visually like microplastic may confound results both positive and negative biases are possible when visual sensory traits alone are used to classify microplastic without confirmation of polymer identity results may represent microlitter or small anthropogenic litter more broadly terms used in previous studies at wastewater treatment plants by talvitie et al 2017a and michielssen et al 2016 respectively although in analyses that did not involve digestion or separation steps in methods especially white translucent fibers and smaller size fractions may be evaluated as potential microplastics in the present study we attempted to use ft ir microscopy with attenuated total reflectance atr to identify plastic composition for fibers and particles however we encountered difficulties in adjusting the atr crystal contact with mp to obtain useful spectra similar difficulties were observed by mintenig et al 2017 during the identification of plastic material 500 μm the authors cite fiber thinness spherical shapes and protrusion of fibers as complications to identification similarly leslie et al 2017 confirmed by ft ir analysis that all spheres and colored fibers in a subsample of those isolated from sediment and biota samples had been correctly identified as microplastic 300 μm mesh using optical microscopy however ft ir spectra could not be obtained for 75 of very thin colorless fibers in the present study in the absence of advanced analytical confirmation the findings are supported by rigorous quality control method development that included melting point analysis and laundry source modeling methods to identify plastic composition and to discern synthetic from non or semi synthetic materials especially for fibers and smaller size classes by ft ir raman spectroscopy or other analytical instrumentation is a crucial research need lares et al 2018 however even cellulosic or semi synthetic anthropogenic microlitter may present similar risks to human and ecological health as microplastic remy et al 2015 polymer typing may help in identifying and mitigating sources and in evaluating the potential for toxicological harm posed by materials broad initiatives to survey microplastics through wastewater treatment using consistent validated methodologies could lead to better understanding of the needs for source management in wastewater 4 conclusions municipal sewage contains high levels of microplastic and other anthropogenic microlitter and therefore although wastewater treatment plants are effective at removing these through treatment operations the small fraction of microplastic released factored with large treatment volumes equates to a significant environmental source of microplastic higher removal efficiency observed in the present study at the wwtp employing primary clarification suggests that retrofitting secondary plants with primary clarifiers could improve microplastic removal while also likely improving treatment of other contaminants of concern upgrading plants to include primary clarification is dependent on site specific factors such as existing plant design service composition service population cost and co benefits which have to be considered before investments in capital improvements occur the high loading of microplastics into wastewater treatment plants presents a point of intervention at the level of the individual consumer given information and opportunity households choice of clothing washing machine models or wash temperatures and frequency could collectively aim to reduce this microplastic source to wastewater treatment plants and ultimately the environment however we estimate that wastewater treatment plants may contribute 0 1 of total plastic mass into waterways such as charleston harbor and therefore the introduction of mismanaged plastic waste into the environment and fragmentation over time is another concern plastics of different size and composition may present acute or chronic risks to different receptor organisms microplastics emitted from wastewater treatment plants may present unique toxicological risks posed by their immediate bioaccessibility and their potential to have relatively high concentrations of sorbed pharmaceuticals and other chemicals found in wastewater compared to natural organic matter or dietary items found in the environment depending on factors such as sorption capacity and desorption kinetics beckingham and ghosh 2017 li et al 2018 seidensticker et al 2017 in order to reduce the dispersal and potential harmful effects of microplastic pollution a broad view on managing point and
