7890,study region campine canals in the north eastern part of the flanders region of belgium between the meuse river and the port of antwerp the region is densely populated with limited water resources and vulnerable for water shortages study focus the impact of climate change on salt intrusion in the albert canal the area s major surface water source for drinking water production is studied salt intrusion simulations are conducted by means of a conceptual mass balance model for the canal network combined with a solute transport model for the relevant canal reaches a 110 year long time series of observed discharge at the upstream boundary is applied to simulate reference conditions for the current climate and is adjusted to account for future climate scenarios new hydrological insights for the region salt water intrusion up to the drinking water inlets is rare under current climate conditions but its occurrence will increase in the future up to 1 2 of the time by 2050 and up to 3 10 of the time by 2100 for mid and high impact climate scenarios respectively chloride concentrations will more often exceed the working limits of water production these findings illustrate the need for a shift in canal management from the current main focus on inland navigation to a more holistic approach taking climate trends and water quality problems into account graphical abstract ga1 keywords salt intrusion climate change drinking water production flanders region belgium 1 introduction water availability can become critical as a consequence of anthropogenic factors even for regions with a moderate climate an example is belgium which lacks large natural water resources or reservoirs combined with a high population density belgium invariably ranks high in lists of country vulnerability for water availability issues it has for example a high baseline water stress ranking according to the world resources institute in 2019 hofste et al 2019 besides the direct impact on water availability by reducing the catchment runoff and river flow quantities during dry summers climate change may also affect the water quality reduced river flows would lead to increased pollutant concentrations in rivers due to the reduced dilution for the same pollutant load moreover rainfall intensities of extreme rainfall events may increase leading to increased frequency of floods or sewage overflows which can further deteriorate the quality of surface waters temperature plays another important role as it has an influence on the kinetics of physico chemical reaction processes there are many more mechanisms that can play a role delpla et al 2009 performed a literature review on mechanisms through which climate change can impact the quality of water resources and conclude that there is a significant risk of reduced water quality and consequential health issues due to climate change leveque et al 2021 came to similar conclusions when investigating water quality and availability in quebec as an example for northern regions one water quality aspect that can be affected strongly by the impact of climate change is the increased salinization of both surface water and coastal aquifers when focusing on surface water a combination of sea level rise and a reduction of upstream discharges in tidal rivers can cause the saltwater wedge to move inland possibly threatening drinking water inlets or natural systems upstream these phenomena are commonly studied using physically based models to describe transport of chloride ions to keep the computational efforts feasible a one dimensional approach is often used in combination with limiting simulations to single reference years that represent for example wet moderate or dry conditions examples of the use of this methodology in europe are zwolsman and becker 2012 and augustijn et al 2011 it is however often interesting to perform long term simulations that span multiple years to take a wider variety of boundary conditions into account and to allow for statistical analysis of the salinization risks van den brink et al 2019 use a one dimensional modeling approach with 50 years of discharge data for current and future climate conditions to study the risk of salinization of the drinking water inlets of the lek river in the netherlands and conclude that the inlet locations will suffer from increased chloride concentrations a higher fresh water discharge in the river of at least 10 m³ s is proposed as a mitigation measure to reduce the risk of insufficient water quality at the inlet locations it is however not studied whether this induces any water quantity or quality issues in connected river branches as the model is limited to the affected branch of the lek river the same argument of high computational cost leads to the indirect effect of climate change on increased salt intrusion being seldom considered these effects can for example be caused when mitigation measures are taken to reduce the risk of water quantity problems without taking their effect on the water quality into account conrads et al 2010 use artificial neural networks trained with streamflow and sea level time series to study this effect on the risk of an increasing salinity of the savannah river in the united states data driven models can be very computationally efficient tools for performing long term simulations but are often considered not reliable for predictions that lie out of the sample range of the calibration data this may be problematic when studying changing boundary conditions such as climate change or the effect of mitigation measures conceptual models can be seen as a compromise technique that describes the physical processes in the modelled system but on a much more macroscopic scale than physically based models their fundamental principle is a representation of the water system by storage cells and the use of the continuity equation that describes the change of stored volume in each cell as due to water exchanges with other cells or with boundary conditions to close the water balance explicitly conceptual models have successfully been used to model river hydrodynamics for making accurate and fast flood predictions van daal rombouts et al 2016 wolfs et al 2015 for use in model predictive control of retention basins vermuyten et al 2018 and conceptual sewer systems wolfs et al 2013 and water quality models nguyen et al 2018 keupers and willems 2017 woldegiorgis 2017 praetorius et al 2012 mannina and viviani 2010 this work proposes the use of an ensemble of conceptual water quantity models with detailed physics based models as a suitable method to study the vulnerability of drinking water inlets to increasing salinity in a complex surface water system with a focus on scenario analyses of climate change and upstream mitigation measure impacts the proposed methodology is demonstrated and tested for one of the major surface water sources for drinking water production in belgium the albert canal which is fed by the meuse river the models are validated using conductivity observations from two recent dry summers 2019 and 2020 during which mitigation measures in the canal system were used without taking water quality issues into account scenario analyses are conducted with long term simulations to account for the strong temporal natural variability climate scenarios are applied to asses future conditions and statistical analysis is performed to obtain impact frequencies final results are changes of critical concentrations at the water inlets under current and planned management strategies of the canal the outline of the remainder of this article is the following the complex hydrology of the case study is described in section 2 including an explanation of the management practice of the canal s operators in times of drought as these management strategies are the main cause for the increased salinization risk section 3 describes the proposed methodology including both the conceptual mass balance for the entire canal network and the detailed physics based model for the affected reaches this section additionally explains the used boundary conditions and climate change scenarios section 4 presents and evaluates the results of the scenario analyses concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 description of study area 2 1 campine canal network the campine canals form a network of navigable waterways in the north east of belgium roughly between liège and antwerp and form a connection between the river basins of the meuse and scheldt rivers the meuse river is a fresh water river that drains the runoff flows from a large upstream basin of about 35 000 km² of which about 16 670 km² upstream of liège lambert et al 2017 this basin is located for a large part in the walloon region of belgium where it receives its highest precipitation amounts in the low mountain range of the ardennes smaller fractions of the meuse basin are situated in the northeast of france and in the netherlands the river is mostly rain fed ward et al 2008 which means it has high temporal variability in river flows from very high flows in wet winter periods to very low flows in dry summer periods the region was confronted with sequential droughts in 2018 2020 which raised concerns about current and future water availability the scheldt is a tidal river part of the scheldt estuary along the north sea the river receives upstream flows from a catchment area of about 21 800 km² which has a rather low gradient charriau et al 2009 an overview of the canal network is given in fig 1 the system is supplied by the meuse river flows through a complex interaction with an open connection at monsin liège and several locks and supply channels near maastricht it connects with the scheldt river through a number of locks at the port of antwerp the largest canal in the network is the albert canal with a length of 130 km and navigable by ships of cemt class vi the canal overcomes a height difference of 56 m by means of six lock complexes each accounting for about 10 m except for the most downstream complex at wijnegem which accounts only for 5 7 m this has the consequence that for a similar traffic volume at all locks and when neglecting other water usages in each of the reaches a water surplus exists in the final reach upstream of the open connection with the docks of the port of antwerp each lock complex consists of one larger lock with maximum allowed dimensions for ships of 200 m by 23 m and two smaller locks with allowed dimensions of 135 m by 15 m the main function of the albert canal is inland navigation but it is also used as a water source for multiple industrial sites along its course and water is used to a lesser extent for agriculture nature and recreation purposes the discharge in the canal at the bifurcation of the meuse at monsin is determined by the downstream water demand for this reach at the different lock complexes and the direct water extractions from this most upstream reach next to water usage by the locks the discharge in the canal network is dependent on bypass channels that are used to manage the target water level in each reach the final reach of the albert canal downstream of wijnegem ends as an open connection with the docks of the port of antwerp this final reach together with the docks can be seen as a large reservoir where the dominant in and outflow of water occurs at the large tide locks connecting to the scheldt river additionally fresh water is supplied from the albert canal and the zoommeer lake in the netherlands the docks are managed with the objective of maintaining their target water levels surplus water can be drained to the scheldt river during low tide while salt water can enter the docks through several channels during high tide periods when a water deficit in the docks is imminent this interaction between the docks and the tidal river scheldt leads to a high chloride concentration in the docks 2 2 drinking water production the water surplus in the second to last canal reach of the albert canal allows using this to produce drinking water water production is executed by the water company water link at two locations a first production site along the albert canal near the broechem reservoir and a second site notmeir walem along the nete canal the nete canal is a side branch of the same canal reach of the albert canal and is supplied through the lock of viersel see also a sketch of these production locations in fig 1 which presents an overview of the study area and in fig 2 which presents a schematized map of the albert canal in 2019 the water captured from both canals amounted to 155 608 m³ and 258 892 m³ respectively drinking water production from these canals accounts for about 40 of the total drinking water volumes produced in flanders flanders environment agency 2019 2 3 canal management during water shortages besides the campine canal network in flanders the meuse supplies several major shipping canals and drinking water production sites in the netherlands and has additionally an important ecological function a treaty was signed in 1995 between the netherlands and the flemish region to regulate the distribution of available meuse water among those three usages flanders the netherlands and nature when the water demand in the campine canals exceeds this allowed flow rate restrictive measures need to be taken while limiting shipping and other water usage as little as possible in the dry summer months of 2019 and 2020 for example ships on the albert canal were forced to pass the locks simultaneously leading to higher queuing times but saving the amount of water used per transferred ship another measure taken by the canal manager was the construction of hydropower stations at the lock complexes which can be used as pumping stations to comply with the treaty these pumping stations bring water from downstream to upstream canal reaches and compensate for the shipping losses and are the cause for the salinization risk of the drinking water inlets along the canal water link monitored the use of these pumps in 2019 and 2020 by performing frequent conductivity measurements along the canal between the docks and their water inlet point these observations are presented in fig 3 along with the pumping flow rate at wijnegem from these graphs it can be observed that salt intrusion reached upstream of the complex of wijnegem in 2019 which entails the risk of having to shut down the production site of water link in 2020 intrusion was less critical due to an earlier start of the pumping in august when concentrations in the docks are typically less high the concentrations in the docks typically reach their highest yearly maxima around early october since the massive volume of the docks reacts to the higher concentrations in the scheldt with a delay this advanced intrusion during the summer of 2019 illustrates how vulnerable the system is for droughts in the meuse basin if similar events will occur more frequently in a changing climate the water production plant may need to temporary shut down due to too high concentrations in the canal 3 materials and methods 3 1 water balance model of canal network 3 1 1 conceptual mass balance model discharges and water levels in the canal network are simulated using a conceptual model it is a reservoir type model similar to a model principle that is used in various hydrologic willems 2014 hydrodynamic wolfs et al 2015 and water quality models keupers and willems 2017 mannina and viviani 2010 the main principles are a division of the modelled system in reservoirs or storage cells defining mass exchanges between these cells in function of the system s state and imposing conservation of mass by closing the continuity equation eq 1 1 d s i dt i i t s q i t s the time derivative of the volume s i stored in cell i equals the difference between the total in and outflow of that cell i i and q i respectively both i i and q i are time dependent and depend on the state of the system s the division of a river network in storage cells is often an iterative process where boundaries are located preferably at locations where the mass exchange is known or are based on insight in the system s behaviour that can change at a certain location e g the reach of tidal influence in an estuary or locations of bifurcations or tributaries in the river network the structure and management of the canal network however already resembles the principle of a conceptual model as it is divided in reservoirs by the locks and it is managed based on the canal s water levels direct mass in and outflows in the model per reservoir are based on measurements or permits for water usage exchanges between reservoirs are partly known as ship traffic at the lock complexes or as flow rate registrations from hydropower pumping stations the remainder is calculated based on the assumption that the canal is managed to keep water levels between a maximum and minimum value both to assure shipping traffic and the stability of the banks the upstream boundary is the observed discharge in the meuse river at monsin while water level observations in the scheldt river are the downstream boundaries of the model the total model comprises 34 reservoir cells and data of 43 lock complexes is used the model is set up with data for 2016 2019 and flow rate and water level observations throughout the canal network are used for model validation 3 1 2 model adjustment for scenario analyses historical registrations of water usage and discharges along the canal network are not available when performing scenario calculations with the model which therefore requires to be adjusted time series of known water fluxes to and from the canal are replaced by constant values based on the mean of the most recent data available an exception is made for discharges of waste water treatment plants wwtp s and the extractions for drinking water production both of which are included based on the average per day of the year to take their strong seasonal variation into account water usage by lock operations are averaged per month and per day of the week to incorporate both their seasonal and weakly variation the meuse treaty limits the total water usage allowed in the canals during extreme low flow conditions the operators react to this treaty by taking measures to reduce the necessary intake from the meuse when using the model to perform scenario analyses the activation of such drought measures has to be incorporated in the calculation scheme of the model restriction measures in the simulation are activated in the following order sparing lock operations activation of pumping stations and reduction of other water usage in the canals this scheme resembles the actual order of the deployment of measures by the authorities during the droughts of 2019 and 2020 a traffic model is developed for the lock complexes to model spare lock operations as registrations for transferred ships are available for every individual lock these can be combined to a list of ships that request to be processed by the lock complex e g consisting of three locks on the albert canal either in upstream or downstream direction ordered by increasing time of arrival at the lock the traffic model transforms this list to operations per individual lock of the complex pumps at the lock complexes of the albert canal are modelled sequentially when the water level in a reservoir drops water is attracted from the upstream reservoir when this is not allowed since this would violate the treaty or simply because the upstream reservoir has a shortage as well a pump is activated to extract water from the downstream canal reach simultaneously any discharge towards the downstream reach to supply a shortage there is stopped which could activate the next pump the pumping stations are set to a flow rate needed to account for the water demand in each canal reach with a maximum of 12 m³ s at the wijnegem complex and 15 m³ s at the other complexes of the albert canal this corresponds with the actual maximum capacity of the pumps already installed or the foreseen capacity in the stations planned for construction in the near future a water reduction for other users is imposed by limiting the total inflow to the flemish canals to the amount allowed by the meuse treaty and by shutting down al water usage in a canal reach once the water level drops 30 cm under the target level 3 2 hydrodynamic and solute transport model the transport of chloride ions in the albert canal is modelled for its two most downstream canal reaches this study area spans from the lock complex of olen to the open connection with the antwerp docks at the n1 viaduct as indicated in the schematization of fig 2 the water depth flow velocity and solute concentrations are assumed to be uniform across the channel cross section and vertical flow is neglected so a 1d formulation of the flow and transport equations can be used this set of equations consists of the fluid mass continuity and momentum equations and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport the equations are formulated in integral form for a canal section between longitudinal coordinates x1 and x2 as follows eq 2 sanders et al 2001 2 t x 1 x 2 u dx x 1 x 2 f dx x 1 x 2 s dx u a av ac f av v 2 a ga y avc ad c x s i q i δ x x i f e ga s 0 s f i c i q i δ x x i with a the canal s cross sectional area v the cross sectional averaged flow velocity c the solute concentration g the gravitational acceleration y the depth of the cross section s centroid under the free surface d the longitudinal dispersion coefficient q i the discharge rate of point source i along the canal c i the solute concentration of point source i f c the longitudinal component of the hydrostatic force exerted by the channel walls in a non prismatic channel s 0 the bottom slope and s f the friction slope a numerical solution for these equations is found using a finite volume method fvm scheme in this study we use the method proposed by sanders et al 2001 which applies hancock s predictor corrector approach in time stepping in order to achieve second order accuracy in space and time this scheme explicitly conserves water and solute mass and is suited for dealing with high concentration gradients cross sections are assumed to be rectangular characterised by the channel width b and are defined at the cell interfaces these section widths are derived from the topographical reference map for flanders agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2020 and vary between 61 m and 120 m in the studied area friction slopes are calculated using the manning formula with empirical roughness coefficient n 0 025 s m 1 3 which was estimated using the guide provided by arcement and schneider 1989 the dispersion coefficient d is assumed to vary along the channel s course since some of the various factors that can influence dispersion e g channel width shipping traffic industrial activity and others are not uniform along the canal d is set as a piecewise linear function of the longitudinal coordinate and is determined using an automatic calibration procedure for intermediate steps of 1 km the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is used to identify the optimal values for d efficiently the objective function f d used in the procedure to evaluate the parameter set s performance is formulated as follows eq 3 3 f d volumes c model x d c obs x c obs x 2 using this function the calibration should lead to a good correspondence between simulation results and observations averaged over the calibration period c model and c obs respectively this choice is motivated by the uncertainty on the boundary conditions of the mass balance model on a smaller timescale hours or days which could lead to a poor approximation of instantaneous values due to a shift in the timing of the discharge simulations compared to reality observations for the summer of 2020 are used as calibration data while observations for 2019 are used to validate the calibrated model in both periods mobile pumping stations were used to compensate losses due to shipping traffic however only in 2020 the waterway manager registered the actual usage of the available pumps as well as their pumping rates while only the installed capacity of the pumps was available for 2019 since downtime for example due to fuel shortages or mechanical issues was not registered in 2019 the total pumping rate is likely to be overestimated in the model this may cause an overestimation of the chloride concentrations simulated for that period the model is therefore calibrated using the more reliable 2020 data while the 2019 data is used for validation purposes with the remark that an overestimation of the chloride concentrations by the model is expected for that period the sce ua method is applied using 6 complexes and the algorithm tries to minimize the objective function until convergence is reached the procedure is stopped when no reduction of the objective function more significant than 0 1 is found in ten subsequent optimization cycles or if the normalized geometric range of the population of points has converged to a value smaller than 0 001 of the feasible parameter space no absolute threshold for the objective function is defined a priori the ability of the model to predict the average concentrations in the canal is evaluated by means of the relative error re on the time averaged concentration as given by eq 4 4 re c model x c obs x c obs x this re gives an indication on how well the model can estimate the severity of salt intrusion along the canal during an entire summer period values closer to zero indicate a good correspondence of simulation results with the observations positive values of re would indicate an overestimation of reality by the model while negative values indicate an underestimation of the chloride ion concentrations 3 3 water balance and chloride model of docks the solute transport model for the albert canal is limited to the canal itself although it has an open connection with the port docks in antwerp this choice is motivated by the limited variation in chloride concentration in the docks and the focus of this study on the water extraction sites for drinking water production along the canal due to this choice the downstream boundary conditions of the solute transport model are the water level and chloride concentration in the antwerp docks at the connection with the canal the concentration in the docks mainly depends on the concentration in the scheldt through the functioning of the locks and the intake of scheldt water to compensate losses a pollutant mass balance on a monthly timescale is used to account for this interaction fig 4 plots the chloride concentration calculated using high resolution conductivity and water temperature observations in the scheldt at liefkenshoek together with the upstream discharge in the river the salinity of the scheldt at the location of the locks is estimated with an empirical model that accounts for the variability in concentration due to both the river base flow and the tide the concentration gradient to account for the differences in concentrations between the central area in the docks and the boundary of the study area is modelled using a 1d fvm model considering the dock cross sections it is calibrated using observations in the docks for the period 2016 2020 note that the main goal of this model is to predict the peak concentrations at the downstream boundary during summer while a good approximation of the lower concentrations is less important 3 4 climate change scenarios the intrusion of chlorides from the port area and its impact on the production plant s reliability is not only dependent on the meuse discharge the duration of the drought and the antecedent conditions in the canal system are equally important factors the impact of climate change on the reliability of the production plant is therefore analysed by means long term simulations based on a 110 years long series of daily discharge observations in the meuse at monsin 1911 2020 this time series is assumed to be representative for the current climate simulations with these data will yield concentration values that should be interpreted as the response of the current idealised canal system and not as historical values in a similar fashion will the impact of climate change be analysed using perturbed versions of this discharge series as elaborated in the following paragraphs no estimations of future shipping traffic changing infrastructure and water usage or adapted management of the canals are considered for the climate change impact analysis similar simulations are conducted with the upstream boundary condition discharge of the meuse at monsin perturbed based on a set of selected climate scenarios simulation results for the perturbed 110 year long discharge series per climate scenario are then statistically analysed and the results give predictions for the salinization conditions corresponding with the projected time horizon and climate scenario these scenarios were developed by tabari et al 2015 following the methodology by ntegeka et al 2014 it is based on a statistical analysis of the climate change signals for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration et0 obtained from a large ensemble of global regional and local climate models these signals consist for precipitation of the changes in the wet day intensities as a function of the empirical return period and the number of wet days per month for et0 they consist of the mean monthly changes the quantile perturbation method willems and vrac 2011 is applied to alter the available precipitation and et0 input series of a hydrological model of the meuse basin according to these climate change signals this hydrological model is an implementation of the conceptual rainfall runoff model nam and was calibrated to daily meuse river discharge data at monsin this was done in the framework of other impact studies in the meuse basin vansteenkiste et al 2009 following the model calibration methodology described in vansteenkiste et al 2014 this involves model parameter optimization based on simulated versus observed peak flows low flows and cumulative volumes only the mid impact and high impact scenarios are considered corresponding with the median and the upper boundary of the 95 confidence interval of the relevant model impact results minimum discharges in this case obtained from the full ensemble of climate change signals in the perturbation approach the future climate scenarios are considered for two time horizons 2050 and 2100 the results for 2100 are summarised in fig 5 where the yearly minimal 7 day averaged discharge is presented versus their empirical return period for the current climate and the two climate scenarios the empirical return period is computed as the length of the historical series divided by the discharge rank 1 for the lowest discharge 2 for the second lowest the recent summers of 2019 and 2020 clearly appear in the more extreme portion of the data see also table 1 the most extreme observation occurred during the severe drought of 1976 the same method was applied for the boundary conditions along the scheldt river to obtain climate change impact results on the scheldt low flows the empirical model presented in section 3 3 was applied to transfer these in impact results for the scheldt chloride concentrations for the chloride concentration at the meuse river boundary it is composed of a background concentration and the result of industrial effluents to the meuse and its tributaries which make the concentration at monsin dependent on the discharge van craenenbroeck 1982 validated a linear relation and could attribute the majority of chlorides to effluents in the samber river an important tributary this study is limited to an impact analysis on intrusion from the docks due to the shipping focused management of the canal therefore a fixed concentration of 48 mg l based on the long term average is used as upstream boundary condition in the model simulations both for current and future climate conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation results the mass balance model of the canal network is evaluated using the discharge observation of kanne located upstream in the canal network see figs 1 and 2 the flow rate at this measuring station is representative for most of the water usage in the campine canals the cumulative simulated and observed discharge are compared to evaluate whether the mass balance model is able to approximate the true water demand of the water system the model overestimates the total cumulative inflow of water in kanne for the entire period 2016 2019 with less than 2 m³ it can therefore be concluded that the estimation of water usage along the canal network is sufficiently accurate the model s capability to estimate the seasonal variation in water usage can be evaluated using fig 6 a where the 30 day moving average of the discharge at kanne is compared for the model and observation a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 is found between this 30 day averaged simulated and observed discharge the model is validated additionally at the measurement station of grobbendonk downstream of the olen locks and thus located in the area covered by the solute transport model see fig 2 both the 30 day averaged discharge and the cumulative volume for the period 2018 2019 are considered given in fig 7 note that only limited observations are available for this location while the model underestimates the discharge in the canal for the winter period of 2018 2019 the low flow conditions are simulated satisfactory by the conceptual model a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 82 is found between the 30 day averaged simulated and observed discharge the underestimation in the wet period could possibly be explained by a usage of the canal to evacuate excess water in the meuse such excess water is not registered in the data logs of the locks as described in section 3 2 the calibration of the solute transport model intends to achieve a good correspondence between the mean simulated and observed chloride concentrations along the course of the canal this criterion is evaluated with the relative error re whose values are presented in table 2 to evaluate whether the model can simulate the concentration dynamics the pearson correlation coefficient p r is calculated and is presented in table 2 as well the locations of table 2 correspond with the indicated locations in figs 8 and 9 where the simulated concentrations for the calibration and validation periods are presented to allow for a visual evaluation of the model s performance the average chloride concentrations along the course of the canal show a good correspondence with the observations for 2020 while the expected overestimation of concentrations in the validation period can be observed in the relatively high positive values for the re in 2019 the calibrated dispersion coefficient ranges between 150 m² s near the connection with the docks to around 15 m² s at the olen locks these higher values near the antwerp area can be explained by the occurrence of salt intrusion in the canal through density currents a phenomenon not explicitly described in the one dimensional modelling approach but implicitly captured by higher values of the dispersion coefficient similar values were found by vanderkimpen et al 2012 a constant dispersion of 200 m² s for the canal reach and vijverberg et al 2010 a dispersion coefficient ranging between 55 and 550 m² s when studying salt intrusion on the ghent terneuzen canal a comparable shipping canal between flanders and the netherlands the dynamics of the concentrations are captured reasonably well by the model especially when the uncertainty in the discharge boundary conditions for the canal network is taken into account an exception is location d where a value for p r 10 3 is found and to a lesser extent location e with a p r of 0 342 for the summer of 2020 a single high peak concentration was observed here that was not simulated by the model a possible explanation is the occurrence of a high flow rate of the pumping station of wijnegem combined with lower water use by the lock complex however an erroneous measurement is another possible reason 4 2 climate change impact the occurrence of salt intrusion from the docks can be observed in the simulation results as an exceedance of the imposed constant upstream concentration of 48 mg l as every exceedance indicates an influence of chloride ions intruding from the dock area a threshold value of 1 mg l is used when evaluating this exceedance to avoid that numerical instabilities and rounding errors in the simulation results are influencing the interpretation three locations were selected for which the percentage of time that intrusion occurs is analysed the lock complex wijnegem the water inlet for drinking water production in broechem and the lock of viersel fig 10 presents the results for the present climate and the mid and high impact climate scenarios under current climate conditions intrusion up to the locks of wijnegem is rare as it occurs for less than 2 of the time this will rise with a factor 2 4 by 2050 and with a factor 5 10 by the end of the century the occurrence of intrusion up to the water inlet of broechem is negligible in the present climate but can become more frequent reaching up to 2 of the time by 2050 by 2100 intrusion reaches the water inlet up to 10 of the time for the high impact climate scenario the total water production is jeopardized when intrusion reaches also the second water inlet this remains exceptional less than 2 of the time for 2050 but the probability increases to between 2 and 8 of the time for 2100 to analyse extreme high impact conditions that can occur along the course of the canal fig 11 presents the 99 percentile of the cell averaged concentration per simulated year and for specific return periods the 99 percentile results are obtained as follows simulation years are ordered based on the yearly maxima of the simulated concentration at the location of the water production intake point this ranking allows to determine the empirical return period of the maximum concentration for each year as a reference the maxima of the observations for 2019 and 2020 for each location are shown as well these figures make clear that the lock complex of wijnegem acts as a barrier for salt intrusion from the docks however it loses its obstructive capacity in the more extreme scenarios when extensive pumping is needed to maintain a sufficient water level in the canal for shipping in the most extreme years with empirical return periods higher than 50 years a combination of high chloride concentrations in the docks and usage of the pumps for long periods of time will lead to an almost uniform concentration in the downstream canal section there is no longer a sufficient fresh water inflow to the docks from the canal to maintain a concentration gradient the return period of this situation decreases for 2100 to about 20 years for the mid impact scenario and even 10 years for the high impact scenario these results are also summarized in table 3 for the three locations discussed above previous results on extreme situations allow to assess the future probability of reaching critical concentrations at the production site but it does not allow to fully evaluate the plant s reliability a shorter occurrence of peak concentrations can probably be bridged by using the water reserves or by increasing the production at an alternative site a long or frequently reoccurring exceedance of the plant s working limits on the other hand would put more stress on the system since it requires extensive water reserves the production site at broechem includes a reservoir that allows to continue production in case of accidental pollution in the canal which can also be used to bridge periods of elevated chloride concentrations the reservoir has sufficient capacity to supply water for approximately 27 days table 4 summarizes the reliability calculated as the number of days the simulated concentration at the broechem water inlet exceeds the working limits of the production installation it additionally shows the number of periods during which the limit was exceeded for the 110 year long simulation period and the number of those periods that are longer than 27 days one can conclude that by 2050 shutting down the drinking water production plant due to salt intrusion up to broechem is likely to become a realistic threat but it will still be exceptional by the end of the century ceasing production at broechem can become a recurring event with 16 50 of such periods simulated these results are consistent with the findings of van den brink et al 2019 and zwolsman and becker 2012 who both found that a decrease of river discharges are likely to lead to increased salinization of drinking water inlets along the river branches in the meuse rhine delta by 2050 bonte and zwolsman 2010 come to similar conclusions for the artificial lake ijselmeer another important drinking water source in the netherlands where model simulations predict that a reduced discharge in the rhine river combined with increased intrusion of seawater at the tidal closure dam can threat drinking water production by 2050 based on a high climate change scenario drought measures along the canal are imposed when water usage exceeds the limit as determined by the meuse treaty to evaluate whether there is some margin to mitigate acute salt intrusion by violation of the treaty the impact analysis above was repeated with adjusted models in which the total available meuse discharge was used as boundary condition instead of the allowed amount this cannot be interpreted as a feasible scenario since both inland navigation and drinking water production in the netherlands depend heavily on the meuse it rather is a scenario to assess the minimum of salinization in the canal that will occur for the current water usage and management rules along the canal network in absence of the treaty the results indicate that under unchanged water abstractions there is no acute salt intrusion up to the water inlets if the treaty is not respected the reliability of the production site at broechem is in that case 100 for all scenario s except for the high impact climate scenario for which the reliability drops to 99 72 see also fig 12 for calculated percentages of the time the upstream concentration is exceeded this result shows that a temporary violation of the treaty can be considered to resolve acute problems in the future but cannot be considered a sustainable or robust solution for the salinization problem as it would probably cause water shortages elsewhere in the system a dynamic control of the intrusion based on real time observations to obtain minimal discharges required to maintain the target concentration levels could perhaps be a more efficient alternative as demonstrated by augustijn et al 2011 for the volkerak zoom lake in the netherlands the above climate change impact results do represent the assessed relative impact of the climate scenarios compared to the current situation but for the current management of the canal system and water usage these may also change in the future and there are several options to further enhance the model and modelling approach firstly the mass balance model of the canal system is an idealized representation of the current canal system and management measures to mitigate the impact of drought on shipping are imposed immediately when needed e g the pumping stations which are partly still under construction and the canal manager relies on temporary installations secondly increased chloride concentrations in the meuse river is another aspect not considered here while this is expected to contribute as well to an increased chloride concentration at the water inlets during low discharge events for example van den brink et al 2019 studied the possible increase of salinity in the lek river in the netherlands due to climate change and found up to 2 increase due to increased concentration in the upstream water of the rhine river by 2050 le et al 2019 found an increase of the mean conductivity in surface waters in germany between 10 and 15 for the period 2070 2100 attributed to reduced river discharges it is reasonable to assume similar effects for the meuse and albert canal thirdly an increase in water demand or shipping traffic was not accounted for finally sea level rise is likely to increase the chloride concentration in the scheldt river which will consequently impact concentrations in the docks the modelling tools that were developed for this study are however very well suited to further investigate these effects 5 conclusions in this study a conceptual mass balance model of the campine canal system was combined with a detailed physics based solute transport model of selected canal reaches to study the possible salinization of drinking water inlets the intention was to obtain a method that can take a wide variety of management decisions in a complex river canal network into account when performing scenario analyses while remaining both accurate robust and computationally efficient the model ensemble was used to study how climate change can have an impact on the reliability of the drinking water availability of the flanders region in belgium discharge observations for the meuse were perturbed to account for climate change for two future horizons and for mid impact and high impact climate scenarios this 110 year long time series was used to perform long term simulations with the developed models it was shown that the salinization risk is small under current climate conditions as the working limits of the drinking water production plant at broechem are exceeded twice in the 110 year simulation period by the year 2050 7 11 periods with an exceedance of the maximum allowed concentrations at the water inlet location would occur in the 110 year period depending on the climate change impact scenario by the year 2100 this frequency further increases to 16 50 occurrences in 110 years about half of these occurrences are longer than what can be bridged by the water reserves this study makes clear that an integrated management of the canal system and surrounding surface waters focussing on both shipping and other water users will be crucial to limit the future water shortage risk in the area the developed models and insight in the effect of climate change can support the operators of the canal network in their planning of future management strategies another mechanism that can cause an increased salinity of the drinking water inlets and which was not considered in this work is an increased salinity of the scheldt river due to lower base flow during droughts and rising sea level as a consequence of climate change a future increase in shipping traffic in the canal network as foreseen by the belgian government federaal planbureau and federale overheidsdienst mobiliteit en vervoer 2019 would put even further stress on the system a two way coupling between the water balance and solute transport simulations where the water quantity component of the model takes simulated chloride concentrations into account would allow for scenario analyses where mitigation measures along the canal take the salinity into account this is not yet possible in the current one way coupling of the models where the water balance model is run first and its simulation results are regarded only as boundary conditions in the solute transport model a possible future improvement for this model is to replace the detailed physics based solute transport model with a conceptualized version the availability of the detailed fvm model would allow for an efficient calibration of the conceptual model using simulated rather than observed concentrations while several authors present methods for conceptual water quality models further work is required to allow for a robust modelling of the rapid changing of the flow direction in the canal network due to the de activation of pumps at the lock complexes conceptualizing the solute transport component could further improve the computational efficiency of the model which would for example be useful when the model is used for optimization studies to determine optimal strategies of implementing mitigation measures in the canal network

resources and vulnerable for water shortages study focus the impact of climate change on salt intrusion in the albert canal the area s major surface water source for drinking water production is studied salt intrusion simulations are conducted by means of a conceptual mass balance model for the canal network combined with a solute transport model for the relevant canal reaches a 110 year long time series of observed discharge at the upstream boundary is applied to simulate reference conditions for the current climate and is adjusted to account for future climate scenarios new hydrological insights for the region salt water intrusion up to the drinking water inlets is rare under current climate conditions but its occurrence will increase in the future up to 1 2 of the time by 2050 and up to 3 10 of the time by 2100 for mid and high impact climate scenarios respectively chloride concentrations will more often exceed the working limits of water production these findings illustrate the need for a shift in canal management from the current main focus on inland navigation to a more holistic approach taking climate trends and water quality problems into account graphical abstract ga1 keywords salt intrusion climate change drinking water production flanders region belgium 1 introduction water availability can become critical as a consequence of anthropogenic factors even for regions with a moderate climate an example is belgium which lacks large natural water resources or reservoirs combined with a high population density belgium invariably ranks high in lists of country vulnerability for water availability issues it has for example a high baseline water stress ranking according to the world resources institute in 2019 hofste et al 2019 besides the direct impact on water availability by reducing the catchment runoff and river flow quantities during dry summers climate change may also affect the water quality reduced river flows would lead to increased pollutant concentrations in rivers due to the reduced dilution for the same pollutant load moreover rainfall intensities of extreme rainfall events may increase leading to increased frequency of floods or sewage overflows which can further deteriorate the quality of surface waters temperature plays another important role as it has an influence on the kinetics of physico chemical reaction processes there are many more mechanisms that can play a role delpla et al 2009 performed a literature review on mechanisms through which climate change can impact the quality of water resources and conclude that there is a significant risk of reduced water quality and consequential health issues due to climate change leveque et al 2021 came to similar conclusions when investigating water quality and availability in quebec as an example for northern regions one water quality aspect that can be affected strongly by the impact of climate change is the increased salinization of both surface water and coastal aquifers when focusing on surface water a combination of sea level rise and a reduction of upstream discharges in tidal rivers can cause the saltwater wedge to move inland possibly threatening drinking water inlets or natural systems upstream these phenomena are commonly studied using physically based models to describe transport of chloride ions to keep the computational efforts feasible a one dimensional approach is often used in combination with limiting simulations to single reference years that represent for example wet moderate or dry conditions examples of the use of this methodology in europe are zwolsman and becker 2012 and augustijn et al 2011 it is however often interesting to perform long term simulations that span multiple years to take a wider variety of boundary conditions into account and to allow for statistical analysis of the salinization risks van den brink et al 2019 use a one dimensional modeling approach with 50 years of discharge data for current and future climate conditions to study the risk of salinization of the drinking water inlets of the lek river in the netherlands and conclude that the inlet locations will suffer from increased chloride concentrations a higher fresh water discharge in the river of at least 10 m³ s is proposed as a mitigation measure to reduce the risk of insufficient water quality at the inlet locations it is however not studied whether this induces any water quantity or quality issues in connected river branches as the model is limited to the affected branch of the lek river the same argument of high computational cost leads to the indirect effect of climate change on increased salt intrusion being seldom considered these effects can for example be caused when mitigation measures are taken to reduce the risk of water quantity problems without taking their effect on the water quality into account conrads et al 2010 use artificial neural networks trained with streamflow and sea level time series to study this effect on the risk of an increasing salinity of the savannah river in the united states data driven models can be very computationally efficient tools for performing long term simulations but are often considered not reliable for predictions that lie out of the sample range of the calibration data this may be problematic when studying changing boundary conditions such as climate change or the effect of mitigation measures conceptual models can be seen as a compromise technique that describes the physical processes in the modelled system but on a much more macroscopic scale than physically based models their fundamental principle is a representation of the water system by storage cells and the use of the continuity equation that describes the change of stored volume in each cell as due to water exchanges with other cells or with boundary conditions to close the water balance explicitly conceptual models have successfully been used to model river hydrodynamics for making accurate and fast flood predictions van daal rombouts et al 2016 wolfs et al 2015 for use in model predictive control of retention basins vermuyten et al 2018 and conceptual sewer systems wolfs et al 2013 and water quality models nguyen et al 2018 keupers and willems 2017 woldegiorgis 2017 praetorius et al 2012 mannina and viviani 2010 this work proposes the use of an ensemble of conceptual water quantity models with detailed physics based models as a suitable method to study the vulnerability of drinking water inlets to increasing salinity in a complex surface water system with a focus on scenario analyses of climate change and upstream mitigation measure impacts the proposed methodology is demonstrated and tested for one of the major surface water sources for drinking water production in belgium the albert canal which is fed by the meuse river the models are validated using conductivity observations from two recent dry summers 2019 and 2020 during which mitigation measures in the canal system were used without taking water quality issues into account scenario analyses are conducted with long term simulations to account for the strong temporal natural variability climate scenarios are applied to asses future conditions and statistical analysis is performed to obtain impact frequencies final results are changes of critical concentrations at the water inlets under current and planned management strategies of the canal the outline of the remainder of this article is the following the complex hydrology of the case study is described in section 2 including an explanation of the management practice of the canal s operators in times of drought as these management strategies are the main cause for the increased salinization risk section 3 describes the proposed methodology including both the conceptual mass balance for the entire canal network and the detailed physics based model for the affected reaches this section additionally explains the used boundary conditions and climate change scenarios section 4 presents and evaluates the results of the scenario analyses concluding remarks are presented in section 5 2 description of study area 2 1 campine canal network the campine canals form a network of navigable waterways in the north east of belgium roughly between liège and antwerp and form a connection between the river basins of the meuse and scheldt rivers the meuse river is a fresh water river that drains the runoff flows from a large upstream basin of about 35 000 km² of which about 16 670 km² upstream of liège lambert et al 2017 this basin is located for a large part in the walloon region of belgium where it receives its highest precipitation amounts in the low mountain range of the ardennes smaller fractions of the meuse basin are situated in the northeast of france and in the netherlands the river is mostly rain fed ward et al 2008 which means it has high temporal variability in river flows from very high flows in wet winter periods to very low flows in dry summer periods the region was confronted with sequential droughts in 2018 2020 which raised concerns about current and future water availability the scheldt is a tidal river part of the scheldt estuary along the north sea the river receives upstream flows from a catchment area of about 21 800 km² which has a rather low gradient charriau et al 2009 an overview of the canal network is given in fig 1 the system is supplied by the meuse river flows through a complex interaction with an open connection at monsin liège and several locks and supply channels near maastricht it connects with the scheldt river through a number of locks at the port of antwerp the largest canal in the network is the albert canal with a length of 130 km and navigable by ships of cemt class vi the canal overcomes a height difference of 56 m by means of six lock complexes each accounting for about 10 m except for the most downstream complex at wijnegem which accounts only for 5 7 m this has the consequence that for a similar traffic volume at all locks and when neglecting other water usages in each of the reaches a water surplus exists in the final reach upstream of the open connection with the docks of the port of antwerp each lock complex consists of one larger lock with maximum allowed dimensions for ships of 200 m by 23 m and two smaller locks with allowed dimensions of 135 m by 15 m the main function of the albert canal is inland navigation but it is also used as a water source for multiple industrial sites along its course and water is used to a lesser extent for agriculture nature and recreation purposes the discharge in the canal at the bifurcation of the meuse at monsin is determined by the downstream water demand for this reach at the different lock complexes and the direct water extractions from this most upstream reach next to water usage by the locks the discharge in the canal network is dependent on bypass channels that are used to manage the target water level in each reach the final reach of the albert canal downstream of wijnegem ends as an open connection with the docks of the port of antwerp this final reach together with the docks can be seen as a large reservoir where the dominant in and outflow of water occurs at the large tide locks connecting to the scheldt river additionally fresh water is supplied from the albert canal and the zoommeer lake in the netherlands the docks are managed with the objective of maintaining their target water levels surplus water can be drained to the scheldt river during low tide while salt water can enter the docks through several channels during high tide periods when a water deficit in the docks is imminent this interaction between the docks and the tidal river scheldt leads to a high chloride concentration in the docks 2 2 drinking water production the water surplus in the second to last canal reach of the albert canal allows using this to produce drinking water water production is executed by the water company water link at two locations a first production site along the albert canal near the broechem reservoir and a second site notmeir walem along the nete canal the nete canal is a side branch of the same canal reach of the albert canal and is supplied through the lock of viersel see also a sketch of these production locations in fig 1 which presents an overview of the study area and in fig 2 which presents a schematized map of the albert canal in 2019 the water captured from both canals amounted to 155 608 m³ and 258 892 m³ respectively drinking water production from these canals accounts for about 40 of the total drinking water volumes produced in flanders flanders environment agency 2019 2 3 canal management during water shortages besides the campine canal network in flanders the meuse supplies several major shipping canals and drinking water production sites in the netherlands and has additionally an important ecological function a treaty was signed in 1995 between the netherlands and the flemish region to regulate the distribution of available meuse water among those three usages flanders the netherlands and nature when the water demand in the campine canals exceeds this allowed flow rate restrictive measures need to be taken while limiting shipping and other water usage as little as possible in the dry summer months of 2019 and 2020 for example ships on the albert canal were forced to pass the locks simultaneously leading to higher queuing times but saving the amount of water used per transferred ship another measure taken by the canal manager was the construction of hydropower stations at the lock complexes which can be used as pumping stations to comply with the treaty these pumping stations bring water from downstream to upstream canal reaches and compensate for the shipping losses and are the cause for the salinization risk of the drinking water inlets along the canal water link monitored the use of these pumps in 2019 and 2020 by performing frequent conductivity measurements along the canal between the docks and their water inlet point these observations are presented in fig 3 along with the pumping flow rate at wijnegem from these graphs it can be observed that salt intrusion reached upstream of the complex of wijnegem in 2019 which entails the risk of having to shut down the production site of water link in 2020 intrusion was less critical due to an earlier start of the pumping in august when concentrations in the docks are typically less high the concentrations in the docks typically reach their highest yearly maxima around early october since the massive volume of the docks reacts to the higher concentrations in the scheldt with a delay this advanced intrusion during the summer of 2019 illustrates how vulnerable the system is for droughts in the meuse basin if similar events will occur more frequently in a changing climate the water production plant may need to temporary shut down due to too high concentrations in the canal 3 materials and methods 3 1 water balance model of canal network 3 1 1 conceptual mass balance model discharges and water levels in the canal network are simulated using a conceptual model it is a reservoir type model similar to a model principle that is used in various hydrologic willems 2014 hydrodynamic wolfs et al 2015 and water quality models keupers and willems 2017 mannina and viviani 2010 the main principles are a division of the modelled system in reservoirs or storage cells defining mass exchanges between these cells in function of the system s state and imposing conservation of mass by closing the continuity equation eq 1 1 d s i dt i i t s q i t s the time derivative of the volume s i stored in cell i equals the difference between the total in and outflow of that cell i i and q i respectively both i i and q i are time dependent and depend on the state of the system s the division of a river network in storage cells is often an iterative process where boundaries are located preferably at locations where the mass exchange is known or are based on insight in the system s behaviour that can change at a certain location e g the reach of tidal influence in an estuary or locations of bifurcations or tributaries in the river network the structure and management of the canal network however already resembles the principle of a conceptual model as it is divided in reservoirs by the locks and it is managed based on the canal s water levels direct mass in and outflows in the model per reservoir are based on measurements or permits for water usage exchanges between reservoirs are partly known as ship traffic at the lock complexes or as flow rate registrations from hydropower pumping stations the remainder is calculated based on the assumption that the canal is managed to keep water levels between a maximum and minimum value both to assure shipping traffic and the stability of the banks the upstream boundary is the observed discharge in the meuse river at monsin while water level observations in the scheldt river are the downstream boundaries of the model the total model comprises 34 reservoir cells and data of 43 lock complexes is used the model is set up with data for 2016 2019 and flow rate and water level observations throughout the canal network are used for model validation 3 1 2 model adjustment for scenario analyses historical registrations of water usage and discharges along the canal network are not available when performing scenario calculations with the model which therefore requires to be adjusted time series of known water fluxes to and from the canal are replaced by constant values based on the mean of the most recent data available an exception is made for discharges of waste water treatment plants wwtp s and the extractions for drinking water production both of which are included based on the average per day of the year to take their strong seasonal variation into account water usage by lock operations are averaged per month and per day of the week to incorporate both their seasonal and weakly variation the meuse treaty limits the total water usage allowed in the canals during extreme low flow conditions the operators react to this treaty by taking measures to reduce the necessary intake from the meuse when using the model to perform scenario analyses the activation of such drought measures has to be incorporated in the calculation scheme of the model restriction measures in the simulation are activated in the following order sparing lock operations activation of pumping stations and reduction of other water usage in the canals this scheme resembles the actual order of the deployment of measures by the authorities during the droughts of 2019 and 2020 a traffic model is developed for the lock complexes to model spare lock operations as registrations for transferred ships are available for every individual lock these can be combined to a list of ships that request to be processed by the lock complex e g consisting of three locks on the albert canal either in upstream or downstream direction ordered by increasing time of arrival at the lock the traffic model transforms this list to operations per individual lock of the complex pumps at the lock complexes of the albert canal are modelled sequentially when the water level in a reservoir drops water is attracted from the upstream reservoir when this is not allowed since this would violate the treaty or simply because the upstream reservoir has a shortage as well a pump is activated to extract water from the downstream canal reach simultaneously any discharge towards the downstream reach to supply a shortage there is stopped which could activate the next pump the pumping stations are set to a flow rate needed to account for the water demand in each canal reach with a maximum of 12 m³ s at the wijnegem complex and 15 m³ s at the other complexes of the albert canal this corresponds with the actual maximum capacity of the pumps already installed or the foreseen capacity in the stations planned for construction in the near future a water reduction for other users is imposed by limiting the total inflow to the flemish canals to the amount allowed by the meuse treaty and by shutting down al water usage in a canal reach once the water level drops 30 cm under the target level 3 2 hydrodynamic and solute transport model the transport of chloride ions in the albert canal is modelled for its two most downstream canal reaches this study area spans from the lock complex of olen to the open connection with the antwerp docks at the n1 viaduct as indicated in the schematization of fig 2 the water depth flow velocity and solute concentrations are assumed to be uniform across the channel cross section and vertical flow is neglected so a 1d formulation of the flow and transport equations can be used this set of equations consists of the fluid mass continuity and momentum equations and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport the equations are formulated in integral form for a canal section between longitudinal coordinates x1 and x2 as follows eq 2 sanders et al 2001 2 t x 1 x 2 u dx x 1 x 2 f dx x 1 x 2 s dx u a av ac f av v 2 a ga y avc ad c x s i q i δ x x i f e ga s 0 s f i c i q i δ x x i with a the canal s cross sectional area v the cross sectional averaged flow velocity c the solute concentration g the gravitational acceleration y the depth of the cross section s centroid under the free surface d the longitudinal dispersion coefficient q i the discharge rate of point source i along the canal c i the solute concentration of point source i f c the longitudinal component of the hydrostatic force exerted by the channel walls in a non prismatic channel s 0 the bottom slope and s f the friction slope a numerical solution for these equations is found using a finite volume method fvm scheme in this study we use the method proposed by sanders et al 2001 which applies hancock s predictor corrector approach in time stepping in order to achieve second order accuracy in space and time this scheme explicitly conserves water and solute mass and is suited for dealing with high concentration gradients cross sections are assumed to be rectangular characterised by the channel width b and are defined at the cell interfaces these section widths are derived from the topographical reference map for flanders agentschap informatie vlaanderen 2020 and vary between 61 m and 120 m in the studied area friction slopes are calculated using the manning formula with empirical roughness coefficient n 0 025 s m 1 3 which was estimated using the guide provided by arcement and schneider 1989 the dispersion coefficient d is assumed to vary along the channel s course since some of the various factors that can influence dispersion e g channel width shipping traffic industrial activity and others are not uniform along the canal d is set as a piecewise linear function of the longitudinal coordinate and is determined using an automatic calibration procedure for intermediate steps of 1 km the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is used to identify the optimal values for d efficiently the objective function f d used in the procedure to evaluate the parameter set s performance is formulated as follows eq 3 3 f d volumes c model x d c obs x c obs x 2 using this function the calibration should lead to a good correspondence between simulation results and observations averaged over the calibration period c model and c obs respectively this choice is motivated by the uncertainty on the boundary conditions of the mass balance model on a smaller timescale hours or days which could lead to a poor approximation of instantaneous values due to a shift in the timing of the discharge simulations compared to reality observations for the summer of 2020 are used as calibration data while observations for 2019 are used to validate the calibrated model in both periods mobile pumping stations were used to compensate losses due to shipping traffic however only in 2020 the waterway manager registered the actual usage of the available pumps as well as their pumping rates while only the installed capacity of the pumps was available for 2019 since downtime for example due to fuel shortages or mechanical issues was not registered in 2019 the total pumping rate is likely to be overestimated in the model this may cause an overestimation of the chloride concentrations simulated for that period the model is therefore calibrated using the more reliable 2020 data while the 2019 data is used for validation purposes with the remark that an overestimation of the chloride concentrations by the model is expected for that period the sce ua method is applied using 6 complexes and the algorithm tries to minimize the objective function until convergence is reached the procedure is stopped when no reduction of the objective function more significant than 0 1 is found in ten subsequent optimization cycles or if the normalized geometric range of the population of points has converged to a value smaller than 0 001 of the feasible parameter space no absolute threshold for the objective function is defined a priori the ability of the model to predict the average concentrations in the canal is evaluated by means of the relative error re on the time averaged concentration as given by eq 4 4 re c model x c obs x c obs x this re gives an indication on how well the model can estimate the severity of salt intrusion along the canal during an entire summer period values closer to zero indicate a good correspondence of simulation results with the observations positive values of re would indicate an overestimation of reality by the model while negative values indicate an underestimation of the chloride ion concentrations 3 3 water balance and chloride model of docks the solute transport model for the albert canal is limited to the canal itself although it has an open connection with the port docks in antwerp this choice is motivated by the limited variation in chloride concentration in the docks and the focus of this study on the water extraction sites for drinking water production along the canal due to this choice the downstream boundary conditions of the solute transport model are the water level and chloride concentration in the antwerp docks at the connection with the canal the concentration in the docks mainly depends on the concentration in the scheldt through the functioning of the locks and the intake of scheldt water to compensate losses a pollutant mass balance on a monthly timescale is used to account for this interaction fig 4 plots the chloride concentration calculated using high resolution conductivity and water temperature observations in the scheldt at liefkenshoek together with the upstream discharge in the river the salinity of the scheldt at the location of the locks is estimated with an empirical model that accounts for the variability in concentration due to both the river base flow and the tide the concentration gradient to account for the differences in concentrations between the central area in the docks and the boundary of the study area is modelled using a 1d fvm model considering the dock cross sections it is calibrated using observations in the docks for the period 2016 2020 note that the main goal of this model is to predict the peak concentrations at the downstream boundary during summer while a good approximation of the lower concentrations is less important 3 4 climate change scenarios the intrusion of chlorides from the port area and its impact on the production plant s reliability is not only dependent on the meuse discharge the duration of the drought and the antecedent conditions in the canal system are equally important factors the impact of climate change on the reliability of the production plant is therefore analysed by means long term simulations based on a 110 years long series of daily discharge observations in the meuse at monsin 1911 2020 this time series is assumed to be representative for the current climate simulations with these data will yield concentration values that should be interpreted as the response of the current idealised canal system and not as historical values in a similar fashion will the impact of climate change be analysed using perturbed versions of this discharge series as elaborated in the following paragraphs no estimations of future shipping traffic changing infrastructure and water usage or adapted management of the canals are considered for the climate change impact analysis similar simulations are conducted with the upstream boundary condition discharge of the meuse at monsin perturbed based on a set of selected climate scenarios simulation results for the perturbed 110 year long discharge series per climate scenario are then statistically analysed and the results give predictions for the salinization conditions corresponding with the projected time horizon and climate scenario these scenarios were developed by tabari et al 2015 following the methodology by ntegeka et al 2014 it is based on a statistical analysis of the climate change signals for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration et0 obtained from a large ensemble of global regional and local climate models these signals consist for precipitation of the changes in the wet day intensities as a function of the empirical return period and the number of wet days per month for et0 they consist of the mean monthly changes the quantile perturbation method willems and vrac 2011 is applied to alter the available precipitation and et0 input series of a hydrological model of the meuse basin according to these climate change signals this hydrological model is an implementation of the conceptual rainfall runoff model nam and was calibrated to daily meuse river discharge data at monsin this was done in the framework of other impact studies in the meuse basin vansteenkiste et al 2009 following the model calibration methodology described in vansteenkiste et al 2014 this involves model parameter optimization based on simulated versus observed peak flows low flows and cumulative volumes only the mid impact and high impact scenarios are considered corresponding with the median and the upper boundary of the 95 confidence interval of the relevant model impact results minimum discharges in this case obtained from the full ensemble of climate change signals in the perturbation approach the future climate scenarios are considered for two time horizons 2050 and 2100 the results for 2100 are summarised in fig 5 where the yearly minimal 7 day averaged discharge is presented versus their empirical return period for the current climate and the two climate scenarios the empirical return period is computed as the length of the historical series divided by the discharge rank 1 for the lowest discharge 2 for the second lowest the recent summers of 2019 and 2020 clearly appear in the more extreme portion of the data see also table 1 the most extreme observation occurred during the severe drought of 1976 the same method was applied for the boundary conditions along the scheldt river to obtain climate change impact results on the scheldt low flows the empirical model presented in section 3 3 was applied to transfer these in impact results for the scheldt chloride concentrations for the chloride concentration at the meuse river boundary it is composed of a background concentration and the result of industrial effluents to the meuse and its tributaries which make the concentration at monsin dependent on the discharge van craenenbroeck 1982 validated a linear relation and could attribute the majority of chlorides to effluents in the samber river an important tributary this study is limited to an impact analysis on intrusion from the docks due to the shipping focused management of the canal therefore a fixed concentration of 48 mg l based on the long term average is used as upstream boundary condition in the model simulations both for current and future climate conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation results the mass balance model of the canal network is evaluated using the discharge observation of kanne located upstream in the canal network see figs 1 and 2 the flow rate at this measuring station is representative for most of the water usage in the campine canals the cumulative simulated and observed discharge are compared to evaluate whether the mass balance model is able to approximate the true water demand of the water system the model overestimates the total cumulative inflow of water in kanne for the entire period 2016 2019 with less than 2 m³ it can therefore be concluded that the estimation of water usage along the canal network is sufficiently accurate the model s capability to estimate the seasonal variation in water usage can be evaluated using fig 6 a where the 30 day moving average of the discharge at kanne is compared for the model and observation a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 is found between this 30 day averaged simulated and observed discharge the model is validated additionally at the measurement station of grobbendonk downstream of the olen locks and thus located in the area covered by the solute transport model see fig 2 both the 30 day averaged discharge and the cumulative volume for the period 2018 2019 are considered given in fig 7 note that only limited observations are available for this location while the model underestimates the discharge in the canal for the winter period of 2018 2019 the low flow conditions are simulated satisfactory by the conceptual model a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 82 is found between the 30 day averaged simulated and observed discharge the underestimation in the wet period could possibly be explained by a usage of the canal to evacuate excess water in the meuse such excess water is not registered in the data logs of the locks as described in section 3 2 the calibration of the solute transport model intends to achieve a good correspondence between the mean simulated and observed chloride concentrations along the course of the canal this criterion is evaluated with the relative error re whose values are presented in table 2 to evaluate whether the model can simulate the concentration dynamics the pearson correlation coefficient p r is calculated and is presented in table 2 as well the locations of table 2 correspond with the indicated locations in figs 8 and 9 where the simulated concentrations for the calibration and validation periods are presented to allow for a visual evaluation of the model s performance the average chloride concentrations along the course of the canal show a good correspondence with the observations for 2020 while the expected overestimation of concentrations in the validation period can be observed in the relatively high positive values for the re in 2019 the calibrated dispersion coefficient ranges between 150 m² s near the connection with the docks to around 15 m² s at the olen locks these higher values near the antwerp area can be explained by the occurrence of salt intrusion in the canal through density currents a phenomenon not explicitly described in the one dimensional modelling approach but implicitly captured by higher values of the dispersion coefficient similar values were found by vanderkimpen et al 2012 a constant dispersion of 200 m² s for the canal reach and vijverberg et al 2010 a dispersion coefficient ranging between 55 and 550 m² s when studying salt intrusion on the ghent terneuzen canal a comparable shipping canal between flanders and the netherlands the dynamics of the concentrations are captured reasonably well by the model especially when the uncertainty in the discharge boundary conditions for the canal network is taken into account an exception is location d where a value for p r 10 3 is found and to a lesser extent location e with a p r of 0 342 for the summer of 2020 a single high peak concentration was observed here that was not simulated by the model a possible explanation is the occurrence of a high flow rate of the pumping station of wijnegem combined with lower water use by the lock complex however an erroneous measurement is another possible reason 4 2 climate change impact the occurrence of salt intrusion from the docks can be observed in the simulation results as an exceedance of the imposed constant upstream concentration of 48 mg l as every exceedance indicates an influence of chloride ions intruding from the dock area a threshold value of 1 mg l is used when evaluating this exceedance to avoid that numerical instabilities and rounding errors in the simulation results are influencing the interpretation three locations were selected for which the percentage of time that intrusion occurs is analysed the lock complex wijnegem the water inlet for drinking water production in broechem and the lock of viersel fig 10 presents the results for the present climate and the mid and high impact climate scenarios under current climate conditions intrusion up to the locks of wijnegem is rare as it occurs for less than 2 of the time this will rise with a factor 2 4 by 2050 and with a factor 5 10 by the end of the century the occurrence of intrusion up to the water inlet of broechem is negligible in the present climate but can become more frequent reaching up to 2 of the time by 2050 by 2100 intrusion reaches the water inlet up to 10 of the time for the high impact climate scenario the total water production is jeopardized when intrusion reaches also the second water inlet this remains exceptional less than 2 of the time for 2050 but the probability increases to between 2 and 8 of the time for 2100 to analyse extreme high impact conditions that can occur along the course of the canal fig 11 presents the 99 percentile of the cell averaged concentration per simulated year and for specific return periods the 99 percentile results are obtained as follows simulation years are ordered based on the yearly maxima of the simulated concentration at the location of the water production intake point this ranking allows to determine the empirical return period of the maximum concentration for each year as a reference the maxima of the observations for 2019 and 2020 for each location are shown as well these figures make clear that the lock complex of wijnegem acts as a barrier for salt intrusion from the docks however it loses its obstructive capacity in the more extreme scenarios when extensive pumping is needed to maintain a sufficient water level in the canal for shipping in the most extreme years with empirical return periods higher than 50 years a combination of high chloride concentrations in the docks and usage of the pumps for long periods of time will lead to an almost uniform concentration in the downstream canal section there is no longer a sufficient fresh water inflow to the docks from the canal to maintain a concentration gradient the return period of this situation decreases for 2100 to about 20 years for the mid impact scenario and even 10 years for the high impact scenario these results are also summarized in table 3 for the three locations discussed above previous results on extreme situations allow to assess the future probability of reaching critical concentrations at the production site but it does not allow to fully evaluate the plant s reliability a shorter occurrence of peak concentrations can probably be bridged by using the water reserves or by increasing the production at an alternative site a long or frequently reoccurring exceedance of the plant s working limits on the other hand would put more stress on the system since it requires extensive water reserves the production site at broechem includes a reservoir that allows to continue production in case of accidental pollution in the canal which can also be used to bridge periods of elevated chloride concentrations the reservoir has sufficient capacity to supply water for approximately 27 days table 4 summarizes the reliability calculated as the number of days the simulated concentration at the broechem water inlet exceeds the working limits of the production installation it additionally shows the number of periods during which the limit was exceeded for the 110 year long simulation period and the number of those periods that are longer than 27 days one can conclude that by 2050 shutting down the drinking water production plant due to salt intrusion up to broechem is likely to become a realistic threat but it will still be exceptional by the end of the century ceasing production at broechem can become a recurring event with 16 50 of such periods simulated these results are consistent with the findings of van den brink et al 2019 and zwolsman and becker 2012 who both found that a decrease of river discharges are likely to lead to increased salinization of drinking water inlets along the river branches in the meuse rhine delta by 2050 bonte and zwolsman 2010 come to similar conclusions for the artificial lake ijselmeer another important drinking water source in the netherlands where model simulations predict that a reduced discharge in the rhine river combined with increased intrusion of seawater at the tidal closure dam can threat drinking water production by 2050 based on a high climate change scenario drought measures along the canal are imposed when water usage exceeds the limit as determined by the meuse treaty to evaluate whether there is some margin to mitigate acute salt intrusion by violation of the treaty the impact analysis above was repeated with adjusted models in which the total available meuse discharge was used as boundary condition instead of the allowed amount this cannot be interpreted as a feasible scenario since both inland navigation and drinking water production in the netherlands depend heavily on the meuse it rather is a scenario to assess the minimum of salinization in the canal that will occur for the current water usage and management rules along the canal network in absence of the treaty the results indicate that under unchanged water abstractions there is no acute salt intrusion up to the water inlets if the treaty is not respected the reliability of the production site at broechem is in that case 100 for all scenario s except for the high impact climate scenario for which the reliability drops to 99 72 see also fig 12 for calculated percentages of the time the upstream concentration is exceeded this result shows that a temporary violation of the treaty can be considered to resolve acute problems in the future but cannot be considered a sustainable or robust solution for the salinization problem as it would probably cause water shortages elsewhere in the system a dynamic control of the intrusion based on real time observations to obtain minimal discharges required to maintain the target concentration levels could perhaps be a more efficient alternative as demonstrated by augustijn et al 2011 for the volkerak zoom lake in the netherlands the above climate change impact results do represent the assessed relative impact of the climate scenarios compared to the current situation but for the current management of the canal system and water usage these may also change in the future and there are several options to further enhance the model and modelling approach firstly the mass balance model of the canal system is an idealized representation of the current canal system and management measures to mitigate the impact of drought on shipping are imposed immediately when needed e g the pumping stations which are partly still under construction and the canal manager relies on temporary installations secondly increased chloride concentrations in the meuse river is another aspect not considered here while this is expected to contribute as well to an increased chloride concentration at the water inlets during low discharge events for example van den brink et al 2019 studied the possible increase of salinity in the lek river in the netherlands due to climate change and found up to 2 increase due to increased concentration in the upstream water of the rhine river by 2050 le et al 2019 found an increase of the mean conductivity in surface waters in germany between 10 and 15 for the period 2070 2100 attributed to reduced river discharges it is reasonable to assume similar effects for the meuse and albert canal thirdly an increase in water demand or shipping traffic was not accounted for finally sea level rise is likely to increase the chloride concentration in the scheldt river which will consequently impact concentrations in the docks the modelling tools that were developed for this study are however very well suited to further investigate these effects 5 conclusions in this study a conceptual mass balance model of the campine canal system was combined with a detailed physics based solute transport model of selected canal reaches to study the possible salinization of drinking water inlets the intention was to obtain a method that can take a wide variety of management decisions in a complex river canal network into account when performing scenario analyses while remaining both accurate robust and computationally efficient the model ensemble was used to study how climate change can have an impact on the reliability of the drinking water availability of the flanders region in belgium discharge observations for the meuse were perturbed to account for climate change for two future horizons and for mid impact and high impact climate scenarios this 110 year long time series was used to perform long term simulations with the developed models it was shown that the salinization risk is small under current climate conditions as the working limits of the drinking water production plant at broechem are exceeded twice in the 110 year simulation period by the year 2050 7 11 periods with an exceedance of the maximum allowed concentrations at the water inlet location would occur in the 110 year period depending on the climate change impact scenario by the year 2100 this frequency further increases to 16 50 occurrences in 110 years about half of these occurrences are longer than what can be bridged by the water reserves this study makes clear that an integrated management of the canal system and surrounding surface waters focussing on both shipping and other water users will be crucial to limit the future water shortage risk in the area the developed models and insight in the effect of climate change can support the operators of the canal network in their planning of future management strategies another mechanism that can cause an increased salinity of the drinking water inlets and which was not considered in this work is an increased salinity of the scheldt river due to lower base flow during droughts and rising sea level as a consequence of climate change a future increase in shipping traffic in the canal network as foreseen by the belgian government federaal planbureau and federale overheidsdienst mobiliteit en vervoer 2019 would put even further stress on the system a two way coupling between the water balance and solute transport simulations where the water quantity component of the model takes simulated chloride concentrations into account would allow for scenario analyses where mitigation measures along the canal take the salinity into account this is not yet possible in the current one way coupling of the models where the water balance model is run first and its simulation results are regarded only as boundary conditions in the solute transport model a possible future improvement for this model is to replace the detailed physics based solute transport model with a conceptualized version the availability of the detailed fvm model would allow for an efficient calibration of the conceptual model using simulated rather than observed concentrations while several authors present methods for conceptual water quality models further work is required to allow for a robust modelling of the rapid changing of the flow direction in the canal network due to the de activation of pumps at the lock complexes conceptualizing the solute transport component could further improve the computational efficiency of the model which would for example be useful when the model is used for optimization studies to determine optimal strategies of implementing mitigation measures in the canal network

range and straddling the continental divide montana fig 1a includes part of the intermountain west and the ngp the northwest and southwest regions fig 1b are characterized by mountains valleys milder winters cooler summers and more year round precipitation while the central and eastern regions are characterized by warmer summers colder winters and less precipitation silverman et al 2017 the topographic and climatic gradients across montana have a strong influence on sf and lu the western watersheds tend to be smaller but considerably wetter than the eastern watersheds resulting in most of the state s surface water flowing into the columbia river basin mt dnrc 2014 the topography of the western watersheds is a factor in the distribution of land properties that favors smaller farms and ranches located in the mountain valleys the central and eastern watersheds are considerably larger and the agricultural land holdings more extensive but surface water is less accessible except along the main river corridors while dryland and irrigated agriculture are practiced across the state most of the irrigated acreage occurs in western montana while eastern montana is primarily rainfed

a major contributor to montana s gross domestic product and critical in supporting rural livelihoods according to the 2017 census of agriculture alfalfa barley spring wheat and winter wheat dominate montana s agriculture both in nr and lu these four crops collectively accounted for over 2 billion in revenues and over 54 of the total cropland area usda nass 2017 alfalfa pd mainly to support the

barley was in teton county approximately 76 of all spring wheat pd occurred in the north central and northeast regions much of which was non irrigated while winter wheat was produced across the state a cluster of 11 counties in the north central and central regions known as the golden triangle accounted for approximately 81 of the state s total pd with chouteau county alone accounting for 24 although irrigation of winter wheat occurred in 11 counties in the eastern half of the state the acreage values were low and therefore our study assumes all winter wheat is rainfed 3 methods 3 1 hydro economic model in our analysis we applied a stochastic hydro economic modeling framework that integrates climate surface and subsurface hydrology agronomy economics of agricultural production and institutional constraints maneta et al 2020 a comprehensive description of the model and the calibration method is provided in appendices a b and c but here we present an overview of the structure and processes simulated relevant to interpret the results our hydro economic model integrates a semi distributed hydrologic model that simulates the rainfall runoff and water routing processes through the hydrologic network of the study region fig 1a we implemented a gridded version of the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model bergström and forsman 1973 bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 to simulate daily sub catchment runoff fig a1 in combination with the muskingum cunge model cunge 1969 to route daily streamflows through the river network the agroeconomic component of the model simulates agricultural water demands which are used to calculate wd at specific river nodes fig 1a the river network propagates the effects of agricultural wd downstream in the form of reduced sf available to downstream users the agroeconomic component of the model relies on the assumption that farmers have historically allocated resources land and water to the crops they chose to grow with the objective of maximizing farm level nr subject to land and water constraints eq b1 the constraints in eq b1 require that the total lu and wu for all crops in the region is less than or equal to the total land and water available for cultivation as well as standard non negativity constraints the production function that simulates crop growth is a generalized constant elasticity of substitution ces production function that maps resource allocation land and water to pd eq b2 our model accommodates both irrigated and rainfed crops by separating water provided via precipitation which is costless to the farmer from water applied via supplemental irrigation which does incur costs maneta et al 2020 water availability can be constrained by policy rules or by physical water availability at diversion points as simulated by the hydrologic component limits on land availability can be restricted to less than the physical agricultural land in the county to simulate the effect of fallow on crop rotations or extend the available land to simulate double cropping fig 2 a production function embedded in the economic model relates lu and wu to pd and is used in conjunction with information on production costs crop prices and water and land availability to calculate county scale revenues the hydrologic and economic components interact through water diversions for supplemental irrigation seasonal wu calculated by the economic component for each crop is transformed into daily diversion rates according to the crop development state and irrigation and conveyance efficiency factors eq b 4 these diversion rates are subtracted from streamflows at corresponding diversion nodes of the hydrologic network daily diverted water rates are proportionally redistributed over pixels marked as cropland in a predefined crop mask eq b 3 in total there are eight inputs necessary to run the hydro economic model table 1 the hydrologic component required precipitation and temperature data fig b1 the economic component required data on natural crop water use cwu which we define as water consumed by crops not coming from supplemental irrigation crop prices variable unit costs of cultivating land and cost of applying water usda nass 2017 planting and harvesting dates used to calculate crop growth stage were derived from the u s bureau of reclamation 2016 agrimet tables irrigation system efficiencies were derived from mt dnrc 2017 data using brouwer et al 1989 he et al 2019 calculated baseline total water used by each crop from natural sources cwubase from remote sensing data over fields known to be rainfed end of century total natural crop water use cwueoc was estimated by adjusting cwubase by the projected percent change in mean growing season aridity index ai the growing season april 1st september 30th used was chosen to be inclusive of the usual planting and harvesting dates reported by the usda nass 2010 and because irrigation water rights in montana begin on april 1st of each growing season mt dnrc 2017 ai is defined as the ratio of mean growing season reference evapotranspiration etr to mean growing season precipitation p etr was calculated following the american society of civil engineers asce standardized reference evapotranspiration etr equation walter et al 2000 using downscaled precipitation temperature relative humidity and downwelling solar radiation grids from each of the considered gcms within the maca dataset wind velocity data was obtained from the gridmet dataset and used for all future etr calculations due to the lack of wind velocity grids in the maca datasets for each gcm future etr was calculated for every 4 4 km resolution grid cell for every daily time step over the entire 11 year end of century period then aggregated at the county scale for each growing season cwueoc for each county crop and scenario year was calculated as the difference between cwubase and the inverse of ai multiplied by cwubase if the resulting cwueoc returned a value equal to or less than zero then the cwueoc value was set to the minimum value greater than zero over all scenario years for that county and crop 3 2 spatial discretization of the hydrologic and economic models sub catchments and the structure of the regional drainage network was generated using the usgs gtopo30 digital elevation model dem at 1 km resolution usgs 1996 the location of active usgs national water information system nwis discharge gages were used to place the initial set of nodes to divide the model domain into sub catchments maneta et al 2020 additional ungaged nodes were added to generate more sub catchments and achieve the spatial detail that we considered adequate in resolving spatial variability of sf the final hydrologic system model was represented with 330 sub catchments each sub catchment contains one river reach montana s 56 counties were used as the spatial units for the economic component fig 1b each economic unit county receives irrigation water from one node of the stream network termed diversion nodes selected from the river reach that passes through the county 3 3 model calibration datasets and procedures 3 3 1 hydrologic component calibration the hydrologic model hbv muskingum cunge has a total of 13 hydrologic component parameters which were calibrated using the brute force monte carlo method on 32 pilot sub catchments each containing a usgs nwis discharge gage and a usda natural resources conservation service nrcs snow telemetry snotel station the current version of the model cannot simulate the effect of reservoirs because of this limitation we vetted the usgs nwis gage locations and selected those not impacted by reservoirs this process resulted in the 32 pilot sub catchments used for calibration calibration was done against 10 year historical 2009 2018 usgs nwis discharge gage and snotel stations data using the kling gupta efficiency kge statistical metric gupta et al 2009 as the objective function historical precipitation and air temperature data used during hydrologic model calibration was obtained from the gridded meteorological database gridmet abatzoglou 2013 the 330 sub catchments in the domain were grouped by similarity using a k means clustering analysis hartigan wong 1979 based on eight catchment descriptors total area stream gradient stream length percent land use agriculture forest grassland urban and mean percent clay in upper soil 0 150 cm catchment areas and stream descriptors were calculated from the gtopo30 dem using gis procedures land use and soil classification descriptors were obtained from the usda nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2018 the optimum number of clusters was determined using a silhouette plot rousseeuw 1987 and each of the 330 sub catchments was grouped into one of three clusters cluster 1 2 and 3 included 2 28 and 2 of the 32 pilot sub catchments respectively cluster 2 contained a majority of the headwater sub catchments which have less probability of being impacted by reservoirs and contain the most snotel stations this explains the disproportionate number of pilot sub catchments in cluster 2 the pilot sub catchments assigned to each cluster were calibrated using 10 000 brute force monte carlo simulations using 10 year 2009 2018 historical daily input time series of snow water equivalent and streamflow at the conclusion of the monte carlo simulations the set of parameter values from the model run that achieved the best combined usgs nwis and snotel data kge value was used as the parameter set for all sub catchments within the same cluster table a1 provides additional details on the parameters of the hydrologic component 3 3 2 economic component calibration the economic component was calibrated in a previous study using a using recursive bayesian filter maneta et al 2020 the calibration was done independently of the hydrologic model and involved ingesting historical 2008 2018 information of production costs and crop prices and remote sensing observations of area planted crop type crop yields and crop evapotranspiration as an approximation of crop water use to determine the parameters of eq b1 under the assumption that resource allocation is driven by maximizing profit past observations of lu and wu to each crop i are solutions to the objective function that maximizes farm nr eq b1 the calibration of the economic component using the bayesian filter yields the probability distribution of parameter values that satisfy the first and second order conditions that solve eq b1 for a maximum at the observed probability distributions of lu wu and pd the nonlinear optimization program that solves eq b1 treats the model parameters as an ensemble of stochastic variables that are recursively adjusted by the sequence of agricultural observations using a recursive bayesian filter the result of the process is an ensemble of parameters conditioned to the history of observations of lu and wu in each economic unit county an example of the dynamics of the model parameter ensemble for one county is provided in fig b1 the range in the values of the parameter ensemble approximates the probability distribution of optimal parameters given the uncertainty of the historical observations in this analysis we reconstructed the probability distribution of each parameter using ensembles sizes of 300 members description of the economic component s data sources is provided in appendix c 3 4 model application the application of our

irrigation efficiency no new sources of available water and now new agricultural policies that alter the amount of water farmers can legally access under these projections and assumptions our results represent the net impact of on farm adaptation strategies when no other mitigating action is taken our aim was to isolate the hydro economic effects of farmers adaptive behavior in response to climate change this scenario provides water resource managers and policy makers a worst case limit on the economic impacts of climate on agriculture 3 4 1 climate and economic scenarios baseline 2008 2018 and

variance equal to the variance of the data during the 11 year record for each climate scenario and period the hydro economic model was run 11 times once for each of the 11 economic scenarios this generated 121 years of hydro economic information 11 years of gcm simulation x 11 agricultural market scenarios for each of the five gcms and each of the periods baseline and end of century section 3 4 3 describes how the ensemble was processed to reconstruct the final model forecast probabilities 3 4 2 model spin up for each gcm and each climate scenario the model was spun up by rerunning the hydrologic component enough times to allow the hbv water storage compartments to achieve steady state conditions then for each of the 11 economic scenarios the spun up hydro economic model was spun up once more by running one full cycle through all 11 climate scenario years this step permits the hydrologic model to stabilize again under the new economic scenario once these spin up runs were completed the model was run again and model results were collected for analysis 3 4 3 propagation of model uncertainties and reduction of forecast ensembles the stochastic nature of our hydro economic model permits to propagate uncertainties from different sources used and generates probabilistic forecasts of sf wd lu wu pd and nr for the 56 counties of the state of montana the uncertainty in any single model forecast reflects the uncertainty from the economic model parameters which in turn reflects the uncertainty in the observations of agricultural activity used to calibrate the model as well as the uncertainty associated with the interannual variability of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and the interannual variability of crop prices production costs and water available for irrigation the final ensemble of model forecasts also reflects the uncertainty associated with the spread in climate model projections disagreements between gcms the model forecasts do not consider the effect of uncertainties in the hydrologic model parameters due to computational limitations however sf forecasts reflect uncertainties associated with interannual variability of precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as the effects of the spread disagreements between climate models the way we have handled uncertainty and aggregated the ensemble of model simulations is described here to represent the total uncertainty in the system associated with climate and economic variability and with gcm projection disagreements we run all combinations of economic and climate scenarios from 5 gcms resulting in 605 simulated years 11 years of climate records per period x 11 economic scenarios x 5 gcms per period baseline and end of century these 605 simulated years span the range of precipitation temperature natural crop evapotranspiration and agricultural market conditions of the baseline and forecast periods including variations associated with gcm disagreements total uncertainty in the forecasts of daily sf and wd for each period was obtained by stacking the 605 years to generate an ensemble of daily sf and wd we used this ensemble to approximate the probability distribution of daily sf and wd each period and to calculate the probability distribution of relative change between them these ensembles represent the interannual variability in each climate scenario gcm the variability between gcms and the variability induced by varying wd associated with farmer adaptation to the economic and climatic conditions the effect of the uncertainty in the hydrologic parameters was not factored in total uncertainty in the forecasts of lu wu pd and nr for each crop and county were calculated differently this is because these forecasts are annual and because for each of the 605 simulated years in each period the economic component also produced a 300 member ensemble forecast that reflect the uncertainty in the calibrated economic model parameters to reduce the size of the ensemble we calculated the median of each ith member across all 605 simulated years in each period and used the resulting consolidated ensembles in each period to calculate the ensemble of relative change in these variables between baseline and end of century 4 results 4 1 changes in climate aridity all five gcms agreed mean growing season average temperature t avg would increase by end of century and that the western portion of the state would increase more than the eastern portion on a percent change basis supplementary material fig d 1 among all five gcms t avg was expected to increase 31 state wide there was little model agreement in end of century p the canesm2 model projected increased p state wide the gfdl esm2g model projected decreased p state wide and the other three models projected regional changes none of which agreed on spatial patterns supplementary material fig d 2 among all five gcms p was expected to increase 4 9 state wide all five gcms agreed etr would increase state wide but there was little spatial agreement on which regions would experience the largest percent change supplementary material fig d 3 among all five gcms etr was expected to increase 20 state wide as with p there was little model agreement in end of century ai fig 3 among all five gcms ai was expected to increase 21 state wide the most extreme end member gcms were the gfdl esm2g and canesm2 models the gfdl esm2g model projected a 57 state wide increase in ai however the canesm2 model projected a 3 5 state wide reduction in ai albeit with high spatial variability and some counties showed an increase the only spatial uniformity among all five gcms was in the northwest counties where all projected increased ai although there was little spatial agreement among the gcms the magnitude of projected changes was important as indicated on the colorbar in fig 3 the range across all gcms spanned 19 102 the canesm2 model was balanced ranging from 19 17 but the other models were unbalanced towards more arid conditions by the end of the century 4 2 water diversions and water use the overarching result in sf projections from our model align with previous studies that analyzed streamflow variations in the western u s bales et al 2006 das et al 2011 li et al 2017 mccabe and clark 2005 pederson et al 2011 rauscher et al 2008 regonda et al 2005 further hydrology results analysis and hydrographs for all counties are provided in supplementary material appendix e projected changes in total wd for irrigated agriculture showed a high level of uncertainty both statistically and spatially ravalli county for instance is a productive irrigated region that relies on water from the bitterroot river fig 4b simulated mean total wd for agriculture in the bitterroot river intensified by approximately 2 4 throughout the growing season but projections showed a very large spread that reflected both the uncertainty in the economic model parameters and the disagreements in p and ai among the gcms the majority of counties 63 projected an increase in the maximum mean percent change in wd fig 5a the dominant temporal trend in mean total wd showed lower changes in the early and late growing season and higher changes in the middle portion when crops were in full coverage and irrigation requirements were higher figs 4b c 5b c overall average state wide median projections in wu showed a slight decrease for irrigated alfalfa and large increases for irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat table 2 therefore collectively our results projected increased total wu for the state the spatial patterns of median percent change in wu showed increases for irrigated alfalfa across the majority of counties in the northwest and southwest regions slight changes both positive and negative in the central region and predominantly decreases across the rest of the state fig 6a as a whole less than half of the counties increased wu for irrigated alfalfa 29 the majority of counties projected increased wu for irrigated barley 73 however the gallatin southwest region marias central region and most of the lower missouri river corridor counties central and northeast regions projected slight decreases fig 6b the vast majority of counties projected increased wu for irrigated spring wheat 95 with the western and eastern ends of the state projected to increase the most fig 6c table 3 shows the regional average values of projected changes in wu for each irrigated crop type projections showed the northwest and southwest regions to increase wu for irrigated alfalfa while the other five regions all projected decreases the northwest and southwest regions have more abundant water and closer sources of water reducing total irrigation costs farms and ranches outside of the northwest and southwest regions are larger in area with nearby water sources less abundant which historically resulted in lower adoption of irrigation infrastructure due to the high cost of installation and water conveyance these factors as well as wheat and barley being more dominant in other regions resulted in the northwest and southwest regions prioritizing and intensifying irrigated alfalfa the other regions prioritized irrigated barley and spring wheat fig 6a 6c historically the southwest region devoted the most land to irrigated alfalfa and our projections showed the largest change in wu for irrigated alfalfa in that region the north central and southwest regions were the largest producers of irrigated barley and our projections showed increased wu the northwest region was projected to have the largest change in wu for irrigated barley which resulted from the low acreage of irrigated barley grown in the region historically therefore the comparatively small increase in the volume of irrigation water translated into the large percent change in wu the northeast region projected the largest increase in wu for irrigated spring wheat more than two times the state wide average likewise the northwest region projected significantly increased wu for spring wheat all seven regions projected increased wu for irrigated barley and spring wheat 4 3 land allocations on the state wide and regional scale average values of the median percent changes in lu to all non irrigated crops were projected to decrease table 2 4 that decrease applied to the majority of the state with a small number of counties two to six projected to increase lu for non irrigated crops fig 7b d f g conversely average state wide projections showed increased lu for all irrigated crops table 2 regionally irrigated alfalfa projected mixed spatial results four of seven regions projected increases irrigated barley projected increases in all regions and irrigated spring wheat projected increases in all but the north central region table 4 there was no distinct spatial pattern in lu for irrigated crops fig 7a c e but the majority of counties increased lu for irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat 66 and less than half of the counties increased lu for irrigated alfalfa 43 4 4 crop production not all counties that increased lu and or wu increased pd fig 8 for irrigated alfalfa only seven counties showed increased pd fig 8a and all seven increased both lu and wu fig 7a 6a respectively twenty counties showed increased pd of irrigated barley fig 8c all of which increased lu fig 8c but only 16 of those 20 increased wu fig 7b fifty three counties increased wu for irrigated spring wheat but only 19 increased pd fig 8e and all 19 increased both lu and wu fig 7e 6c respectively only sheridan county increased pd of any non irrigated crop and only for winter wheat fig 8g sheridan county increased lu for winter wheat by 10 3 fig 7g but only increased pd by 0 5 regionally only the southwest region projected increased pd for both irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat table 5 state wide average projections showed decreased pd of all crops table 2 4 5 farm net revenue taking into account all predicted changes in lu wu and pd only 20 of 56 counties projected increased nr across any crops fig 9 regionally only irrigated barley in the southeast region projected an increase in nr table 6 historically the southeast region grew significantly less irrigated barley and therefore used less water than the other regions model results showed the southeast region would increase lu for irrigated barley by 8 0 table 4 increase wu by 19 2 table 3 which only resulted in a 0 8 increase in nr table 6 overall average state wide projections showed decreased nr for all crops and all non irrigated crops decreased more than any irrigated crop table 2 4 6 projection uncertainty of resource allocation in order to convey the uncertainty in the model results the probability distributions of economic variables for each crop type in ravalli and richland counties are presented here fig 10 and 11 respectively the probability distributions for all counties are presented in supplementary material appendix f ravalli county was chosen as representative of the northern rockies region because it has large lu and wu devoted to irrigated agriculture and model results showed increased wu for all irrigated crops richland county was chosen as representative of the ngp region because it has the most lu for irrigated spring wheat in the state even with our methodology of producing the aggregated ensembles the lu and wu distributions in both counties spanned large projected changes and zero percent change was within the 95 confidence interval the changes in wu distributions were skewed right figs 10 11 signifying modestly higher probabilities of large increases in wu for irrigation the probability distributions of the change in pd were quite narrow these narrow changes in pd probability distributions did not directly translate to narrow changes in nr probability distributions as with the changes in lu and wu probability distributions the change in pd and nr probability distributions spanned zero percent change which lies within the 95 confidence interval the uncertainty around these values was largely due to the model s response to the different climate projections represented by the gcms but also incorporated the effects of parameter uncertainty in the economic component 5 discussion 5 1 climate change uncertainty differences in the gcms projections of p contributed to the large potential range of hydro economic outcomes across montana as evidenced by large uncertainty envelopes around sf and wd changes spatial and magnitude uncertainty in ai and wide probability distributions for lu wu pd and nr projections of precipitation changes across the western u s were similarly uncertain u s global change research program 2017 which makes water resource management planning difficult groves et al 2008 tanaka et al 2006 conversely there was agreement that temperatures will increase in montana and across the western u s u s global change research program 2017 increased temperatures can impact agricultural productivity in numerous ways for example optimal crop growth occurs within specific intermediate temperature intervals and excessive heat is detrimental to physiological processes which therefore decrease crop yield anderson 2016 schauberger et al 2017 on the other hand warmer spring temperatures may allow for earlier planting dates which could increase crop productivity lanning et al 2010 but at the risk of damaging frosts kim et al 2014 while increasing temperatures could impact crop production the aridity index might be a better proxy for the viability of future agricultural productivity paltasingh et al 2012 however the complexities of plant water use efficiency of photosynthesis with changing atmospheric co2 concentrations has been shown to alter relations between hydrology and ecology parameters greve et al 2019 roderick et al 2015 future modeled projections of changes in annual aridity index showed increasing trends more arid conditions across most of the western u s ficklin novick 2017 fu feng 2014 scheff frierson 2015 sherwood fu 2014 while our results did show disagreements in end of century ai among the five gcms the overall magnitude of change after aggregating all projections indicated more arid conditions by the end of the century the more arid conditions were driven by increased atmospheric evaporative demands i e increased etr supplementary material fig d 3 wurster et al 2020 examined historic 1979 2016 etr price and precipitation anomalies impact on crop production in montana and surrounding states their results highlighted that alfalfa production was most sensitive to etr anomalies across the majority of montana although irrigation largely decoupled alfalfa production from climate conditions winter wheat production in the western and eastern border counties were most sensitive to etr anomalies maxwell et al 2017 stated the possibility of a transition to winter wheat from spring wheat as a result of warmer winter temperatures our results did not match the maxwell et al 2017 prediction and evidence of that transition was not observed in the 2008 2018 usda nass data as new observations of agricultural activity become available our hydro economic model may capture that transition if present 5 2 land use and water use in montana and throughout the intermountain west agricultural lands are still prevalent in counties that are rapidly urbanizing adjacent to and upstream of more urban counties are counties dominated by farming and ranching for example missoula county is rapidly urbanizing agricultural water demands are decreasing but projected upstream intensification of agricultural wd in ravalli and powell counties fig 4b 5b respectively would impact missoula s available water supply increases in agricultural water demand could amplify climate change impacts on summer sf this is especially true in western montana where our results showed summer sf would decrease fig 4b 5b while the certainty around summer sf decreasing in the eastern plains were less conclusive the majority of counties in the central and north central region projected slight decreases in maximum wd but these regions still showed decreasing sf fig 5a climate projections play a role but upstream increases in wu could be the more significant translation of downstream water shortages therefore the decisions farmers make in the headwater counties could have significant impact on counties situated downstream continuing historical trends experienced in the western u s end of century projected decreases in snowpack growing season sf quantities and shifts to earlier peak spring runoff bales et al 2006 das et al 2011 li et al 2017 mccabe clark 2005 pederson et al 2011 rauscher et al 2008 regonda et al 2005 udall and overpeck 2017 will add further stress to agricultural water demands cross et al 2017 pathak et al 2018 t avg was projected to increase more in the mountainous western portion of montana supplementary material fig d 1 which is where the majority of irrigation takes place mt dnrc 2014 increasing temperatures could require increased irrigation to avoid crop stress and counteract increased evaporation asseng et al 2013 döll 2002 fischer et al 2007 xiao et al 2005 there is little room for increased surface water diversions from any basin across the state as the percentage of basin totals are already diverted at 95 or greater mt dnrc 2014 5 3 adaptation strategies our methodology considers a limited set of the adaptation strategies available to farmers e g farmers could only change lu and or wu but not change irrigation technology or introduce new crop varieties combining that with the variations in farming costs and crop market prices resulted in considerable noise surrounding our predictions of farmers response to climate change medellín azuara et al 2011 isolated how land and water allocations crop prices and agricultural revenues in california would change under a mid century climate change scenario they estimated larger reductions in lu compared to our results reductions in wu state wide moderate increases in crop prices and a reduction in total gross revenues however their study showed that shifting to higher value crops over less land may translate into increased revenue per unit area in california likewise farmers may choose to fallow their land and sell or lease their water to other users ghosh et al 2014 howitt et al 2012 montana has a limited crop portfolio and does not have a climate suitable for widespread production of high value crops that can be used to mitigate economic losses in the way california could if in fact crop prices increase and or farming costs decrease resulting in marginal land becoming economically viable then montana farmers may increase the extent of land area under production wurster et al 2020 documented historical price anomaly impacts on crop production and showed that the majority of eastern montana s barley production and the majority of central montana s winter wheat production were the most sensitive to price anomalies therefore shifts in market demands for barley and wheat by the end of the century could have implications for lu and wu that are not captured by our model 5 4 assumptions and limitations economic results indicated that most counties could experience pd and nr losses across all crops by the end of century under an rcp 8 5 carbon emissions scenario the rcp 8 5 is increasingly considered an unrealistic scenario hausfather peters 2020 therefore model outputs reflect the relatively extreme worst case outcome our results focused on isolating the net climatic effects on agriculture therefore we assumed there would be no significant changes in production costs or crop market prices another assumption in these results was the timing of planting and irrigating there is the potential that farmers will be able to produce more by end of century given warmer temperatures will allow for earlier planting dates crop productivity could increase with elevated co2 concentrations but studies are inconclusive on the benefits of higher co2 when accounting for other factors e g higher temperatures disease weather extremes tubiello et al 2007 finally this study assumed farmers will not plant new crop types with changing temperatures precipitation and aridity patterns farmers may have genetically modified species and or begin to grow other crops better suited for arid climates such crops include sorghum and pearl millet chipanshi et al 2003 jukanti et al 2016 silungwe et al 2018 in addition to the assumptions made in this study the hydro economic model has important limitations first the model did not simulate dams nor irrigation water derived from pumping groundwater montana s dams are important for water storage and flood mitigation and inclusion of these water storage basins could impact results in many counties currently approximately 98 of montana s water withdrawals come from surface water therefore baseline results are deemed appropriate on the other hand groundwater use increases during drought periods taylor et al 2013 and the severity and duration of western u s droughts are expected to increase gutzler robbins 2011 trenberth et al 2014 silverman et al 2017 therefore groundwater use for irrigation in montana is expected to expand by the end of the century brown et al 2013 however the effects of these model limitations on the current analysis are limited because we did not use sf to estimate water available for irrigation or to calibrate the economic component farmer response was calibrated using water availability constraints derived from remote sensing estimates of actual crop water use during years of maximum irrigation rather than water available in the streams maneta et al 2020 in fact sf provides a poor metric of irrigation water constraints because access to irrigation water is most often set by water regulations and not by the physical availability of water regarding alfalfa production the model optimized for nr based on market prices alfalfa sold on the market is valued much lower than barley or wheat however much of the alfalfa grown in montana is used on farm for cattle production which provides a far higher value to the farmer since we did not incorporate the indirect revenues generated from cattle sales in the price of alfalfa we interpreted the alfalfa market price as an opportunity cost if a farmer chooses to use alfalfa for cattle rather than sell it on the market then the observed price reflects a lower bound on the value of alfalfa for cattle production 6 conclusion we applied an innovative satellite informed integrated hydro economic model that overcame limitations of previous studies while filling an important knowledge gap about the impacts of climate change on streamflows land and water use crop production and farm net revenues the uncertainty in climate projections and diversity of farmer adaptation responses to climate change resulted in wide uncertainty in predicted states of streamflow agricultural water use and net revenues by the end of the century the majority of rivers across montana would experience streamflow declines of 10 30 during the summer months our simulations showed a state wide increase of 1 6 in land area devoted to irrigated crops accompanied by an 18 2 increase in agricultural water use montana is the headwaters to three major watersheds therefore declines in growing season water availability and increases in agricultural water demand would have far reaching impacts downstream even accounting for the increases in irrigated land and water use irrigated crop production and farm net revenues were expected to decline by 0 5 and 1 5 respectively projections for rainfed crops were more dire collectively state wide land allocated to rainfed crops declined 6 5 production declined 2 7 and net revenue declined 7 2 while our study simulated the hydro economic impacts of climate change in montana our results are representative of what many regions in the intermountain west would experience our study filled important knowledge gaps by incorporating a wide range of economic and

projections it is critical to understand the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of the regional agricultural system and hydrologic impacts of climate change adaptation we applied a stochastic

agricultural water use decreased summer water availability with increased demand could have far reaching impacts downstream land use for irrigated crops increased 1 6 while rainfed crops decreased 6 5

western united states u s is critical to the nation s cattle barley and wheat production production of these commodities in the arid and semi arid west is highly dependent on seasonal precipitation and irrigation ongoing climate change coupled with growing water demands is placing the region s water system under increased pressure in many cases the water demands already exceed average supplies anderson et al 2018 averyt et al 2013 ficklin et al 2013 grantham and viers 2014 slaughter et al 2010 ward et al 2006 throughout the west farmers respond to temporal variations in climate water availability and market and policy signals by changing water allocations crops grown and land apportionment to each of the crops irrigation in the western u s has generally increased over the last century but at varying paces across different agricultural regions edwards smith 2018 in arid and semi arid regions irrigation water availability allows farmers to reduce exposure to periods of precipitation shortfall and to meet increasing demands for agricultural products hanjra et al 2009 schaible et al 2010 tack et al 2017 warrick and gardner 1983 however potential climate change impact on water supplies is increasing the risk for farmers with current water sources committed and fewer opportunities to develop new sources irrigators and water managers will need to become more efficient with existing water supplies hydro economic models have been utilized by water resource managers for decades brouwer and hofkes 2008 harou et al 2009 these models are used at various spatial

range and straddling the continental divide montana fig 1a includes part of the intermountain west and the ngp the northwest and southwest regions fig 1b are characterized by mountains valleys milder winters cooler summers and more year round precipitation while the central and eastern regions are characterized by warmer summers colder winters and less precipitation silverman et al 2017 the topographic and climatic gradients across montana have a strong influence on sf and lu the western watersheds tend to be smaller but considerably wetter than the eastern watersheds resulting in most of the state s surface water flowing into the columbia river basin mt dnrc 2014 the topography of the western watersheds is a factor in the distribution of land properties that favors smaller farms and ranches located in the mountain valleys the central and eastern watersheds are considerably larger and the agricultural land holdings more extensive but surface water is less accessible except along the main river corridors while dryland and irrigated agriculture are practiced across the state most of the irrigated acreage occurs in western montana while eastern montana is primarily rainfed mt dnrc 2014 usda nass 2017 roughly 96 of total water withdrawals are used for irrigated agriculture and 98 of those withdrawals come from surface waters u s geological survey usgs 2018 agriculture is a major contributor to montana s gross domestic product and critical in supporting rural livelihoods according to the 2017 census of agriculture alfalfa barley spring wheat and winter wheat dominate montana s agriculture both in nr and lu these four crops collectively accounted for over 2 billion in revenues and over 54 of the total cropland area usda nass 2017 alfalfa pd mainly to support the cattle industry is ubiquitous state wide with the central and southwest regions fig 1b being the most productive the north central region was dominated by barley pd roughly 27 of all lu to irrigated barley was in teton county approximately 76 of all spring wheat pd occurred in the north central and northeast regions much of which was non irrigated while winter wheat was produced across the state a cluster of 11 counties in the north central and central regions known as the golden triangle accounted for approximately 81 of the state s total pd with chouteau county alone accounting for 24 although irrigation of winter wheat occurred in 11 counties in the eastern half of the state the acreage values were low and therefore our study assumes all winter wheat is rainfed 3 methods 3 1 hydro economic model in our analysis we applied a stochastic hydro economic modeling framework that integrates climate surface and subsurface hydrology agronomy economics of agricultural production and institutional constraints maneta et al 2020 a comprehensive description of the model and the calibration method is provided in appendices a b and c but here we present an overview of the structure and processes simulated relevant to interpret the results our hydro economic model integrates a semi distributed hydrologic model that simulates the rainfall runoff and water routing processes through the hydrologic network of the study region fig 1a we implemented a gridded version of the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model bergström and forsman 1973 bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 to simulate daily sub catchment runoff fig a1 in combination with the muskingum cunge model cunge 1969 to route daily streamflows through the river network the agroeconomic component of the model simulates agricultural water demands which are used to calculate wd at specific river nodes fig 1a the river network propagates the effects of agricultural wd downstream in the form of reduced sf available to downstream users the agroeconomic component of the model relies on the assumption that farmers have historically allocated resources land and water to the crops they chose to grow with the objective of maximizing farm level nr subject to land and water constraints eq b1 the constraints in eq b1 require that the total lu and wu for all crops in the region is less than or equal to the total land and water available for cultivation as well as standard non negativity constraints the production function that simulates crop growth is a generalized constant elasticity of substitution ces production function that maps resource allocation land and water to pd eq b2 our model accommodates both irrigated and rainfed crops by separating water provided via precipitation which is costless to the farmer from water applied via supplemental irrigation which does incur costs maneta et al 2020 water availability can be constrained by policy rules or by physical water availability at diversion points as simulated by the hydrologic component limits on land availability can be restricted to less than the physical agricultural land in the county to simulate the effect of fallow on crop rotations or extend the available land to simulate double cropping fig 2 a production function embedded in the economic model relates lu and wu to pd and is used in conjunction with information on production costs crop prices and water and land availability to calculate county scale revenues the hydrologic and economic components interact through water diversions for supplemental irrigation seasonal wu calculated by the economic component for each crop is transformed into daily diversion rates according to the crop development state and irrigation and conveyance efficiency factors eq b 4 these diversion rates are subtracted from streamflows at corresponding diversion nodes of the hydrologic network daily diverted water rates are proportionally redistributed over pixels marked as cropland in a predefined crop mask eq b 3 in total there are eight inputs necessary to run the hydro economic model table 1 the hydrologic component required precipitation and temperature data fig b1 the economic component required data on natural crop water use cwu which we define as water consumed by crops not coming from supplemental irrigation crop prices variable unit costs of cultivating land and cost of applying water usda nass 2017 planting and harvesting dates used to calculate crop growth stage were derived from the u s bureau of reclamation 2016 agrimet tables irrigation system efficiencies were derived from mt dnrc 2017 data using brouwer et al 1989 he et al 2019 calculated baseline total water used by each crop from natural sources cwubase from remote sensing data over fields known to be rainfed end of century total natural crop water use cwueoc was estimated by adjusting cwubase by the projected percent change in mean growing season aridity index ai the growing season april 1st september 30th used was chosen to be inclusive of the usual planting and harvesting dates reported by the usda nass 2010 and because irrigation water rights in montana begin on april 1st of each growing season mt dnrc 2017 ai is defined as the ratio of mean growing season reference evapotranspiration etr to mean growing season precipitation p etr was calculated following the american society of civil engineers asce standardized reference evapotranspiration etr equation walter et al 2000 using downscaled precipitation temperature relative humidity and downwelling solar radiation grids from each of the considered gcms within the maca dataset wind velocity data was obtained from the gridmet dataset and used for all future etr calculations due to the lack of wind velocity grids in the maca datasets for each gcm future etr was calculated for every 4 4 km resolution grid cell for every daily time step over the entire 11 year end of century period then aggregated at the county scale for each growing season cwueoc for each county crop and scenario year was calculated as the difference between cwubase and the inverse of ai multiplied by cwubase if the resulting cwueoc returned a value equal to or less than zero then the cwueoc value was set to the minimum value greater than zero over all scenario years for that county and crop 3 2 spatial discretization of the hydrologic and economic models sub catchments and the structure of the regional drainage network was generated using the usgs gtopo30 digital elevation model dem at 1 km resolution usgs 1996 the location of active usgs national water information system nwis discharge gages were used to place the initial set of nodes to divide the model domain into sub catchments maneta et al 2020 additional ungaged nodes were added to generate more sub catchments and achieve the spatial detail that we considered adequate in resolving spatial variability of sf the final hydrologic system model was represented with 330 sub catchments each sub catchment contains one river reach montana s 56 counties were used as the spatial units for the economic component fig 1b each economic unit county receives irrigation water from one node of the stream network termed diversion nodes selected from the river reach that passes through the county 3 3 model calibration datasets and procedures 3 3 1 hydrologic component calibration the hydrologic model hbv muskingum cunge has a total of 13 hydrologic component parameters which were calibrated using the brute force monte carlo method on 32 pilot sub catchments each containing a usgs nwis discharge gage and a usda natural resources conservation service nrcs snow telemetry snotel station the current version of the model cannot simulate the effect of reservoirs because of this limitation we vetted the usgs nwis gage locations and selected those not impacted by reservoirs this process resulted in the 32 pilot sub catchments used for calibration calibration was done against 10 year historical 2009 2018 usgs nwis discharge gage and snotel stations data using the kling gupta efficiency kge statistical metric gupta et al 2009 as the objective function historical precipitation and air temperature data used during hydrologic model calibration was obtained from the gridded meteorological database gridmet abatzoglou 2013 the 330 sub catchments in the domain were grouped by similarity using a k means clustering analysis hartigan wong 1979 based on eight catchment descriptors total area stream gradient stream length percent land use agriculture forest grassland urban and mean percent clay in upper soil 0 150 cm catchment areas and stream descriptors were calculated from the gtopo30 dem using gis procedures land use and soil classification descriptors were obtained from the usda nrcs soil survey geographic database ssurgo soil survey staff 2018 the optimum number of clusters was determined using a silhouette plot rousseeuw 1987 and each of the 330 sub catchments was grouped into one of three clusters cluster 1 2 and 3 included 2 28 and 2 of the 32 pilot sub catchments respectively cluster 2 contained a majority of the headwater sub catchments which have less probability of being impacted by reservoirs and contain the most snotel stations this explains the disproportionate number of pilot sub catchments in cluster 2 the pilot sub catchments assigned to each cluster were calibrated using 10 000 brute force monte carlo simulations using 10 year 2009 2018 historical daily input time series of snow water equivalent and streamflow at the conclusion of the monte carlo simulations the set of parameter values from the model run that achieved the best combined usgs nwis and snotel data kge value was used as the parameter set for all sub catchments within the same cluster table a1 provides additional details on the parameters of the hydrologic component 3 3 2 economic component calibration the economic component was calibrated in a previous study using a using recursive bayesian filter maneta et al 2020 the calibration was done independently of the hydrologic model and involved ingesting historical 2008 2018 information of production costs and crop prices and remote sensing observations of area planted crop type crop yields and crop evapotranspiration as an approximation of crop water use to determine the parameters of eq b1 under the assumption that resource allocation is driven by maximizing profit past observations of lu and wu to each crop i are solutions to the objective function that maximizes farm nr eq b1 the calibration of the economic component using the bayesian filter yields the probability distribution of parameter values that satisfy the first and second order conditions that solve eq b1 for a maximum at the observed probability distributions of lu wu and pd the nonlinear optimization program that solves eq b1 treats the model parameters as an ensemble of stochastic variables that are recursively adjusted by the sequence of agricultural observations using a recursive bayesian filter the result of the process is an ensemble of parameters conditioned to the history of observations of lu and wu in each economic unit county an example of the dynamics of the model parameter ensemble for one county is provided in fig b1 the range in the values of the parameter ensemble approximates the probability distribution of optimal parameters given the uncertainty of the historical observations in this analysis we reconstructed the probability distribution of each parameter using ensembles sizes of 300 members description of the economic component s data sources is provided in appendix c 3 4 model application the application of our calibrated hydro economic model for montana compares end of century climate change projections 2080 2090 from hindcast 2008 2018 conditions simulated by five downscaled global climate models gcms under the high risk rcp 8 5 carbon emissions scenario our analysis assumes that no new crop types including genetically modified varieties are introduced in the future no new technologies that affect irrigation efficiency no new sources of available water and now new agricultural policies that alter the amount of water farmers can legally access under these projections and assumptions our results represent the net impact of on farm adaptation strategies when no other mitigating action is taken our aim was to isolate the hydro economic effects of farmers adaptive behavior in response to climate change this scenario provides water resource managers and policy makers a worst case limit on the economic impacts of climate on agriculture 3 4 1 climate and economic scenarios baseline 2008 2018 and end of century 2080 2090 climatological daily precipitation and temperature datasets needed to run the model were drawn from a 4 4 km gridded statistical downscaling of five gcm outputs using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca method abatzoglou 2013 the five gcms chosen for this study supplementary material table d 1 were participants in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 and were chosen based on their overall low relative error simulating historical mean temperature and precipitation in the u s pacific northwest rupp et al 2013 each of the five gcms provides a climate scenario with 11 years of historical baseline data and 11 years of end of century data to represent economic conditions we used 11 years 2008 2018 of agricultural market observations of crop prices and production costs each year was considered an independent economic scenario with mean crop prices and input costs equal to the observed value each year and a common variance equal to the variance of the data during the 11 year record for each climate scenario and period the hydro economic model was run 11 times once for each of the 11 economic scenarios this generated 121 years of hydro economic information 11 years of gcm simulation x 11 agricultural market scenarios for each of the five gcms and each of the periods baseline and end of century section 3 4 3 describes how the ensemble was processed to reconstruct the final model forecast probabilities 3 4 2 model spin up for each gcm and each climate scenario the model was spun up by rerunning the hydrologic component enough times to allow the hbv water storage compartments to achieve steady state conditions then for each of the 11 economic scenarios the spun up hydro economic model was spun up once more by running one full cycle through all 11 climate scenario years this step permits the hydrologic model to stabilize again under the new economic scenario once these spin up runs were completed the model was run again and model results were collected for analysis 3 4 3 propagation of model uncertainties and reduction of forecast ensembles the stochastic nature of our hydro economic model permits to propagate uncertainties from different sources used and generates probabilistic forecasts of sf wd lu wu pd and nr for the 56 counties of the state of montana the uncertainty in any single model forecast reflects the uncertainty from the economic model parameters which in turn reflects the uncertainty in the observations of agricultural activity used to calibrate the model as well as the uncertainty associated with the interannual variability of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and the interannual variability of crop prices production costs and water available for irrigation the final ensemble of model forecasts also reflects the uncertainty associated with the spread in climate model projections disagreements between gcms the model forecasts do not consider the effect of uncertainties in the hydrologic model parameters due to computational limitations however sf forecasts reflect uncertainties associated with interannual variability of precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as the effects of the spread disagreements between climate models the way we have handled uncertainty and aggregated the ensemble of model simulations is described here to represent the total uncertainty in the system associated with climate and economic variability and with gcm projection disagreements we run all combinations of economic and climate scenarios from 5 gcms resulting in 605 simulated years 11 years of climate records per period x 11 economic scenarios x 5 gcms per period baseline and end of century these 605 simulated years span the range of precipitation temperature natural crop evapotranspiration and agricultural market conditions of the baseline and forecast periods including variations associated with gcm disagreements total uncertainty in the forecasts of daily sf and wd for each period was obtained by stacking the 605 years to generate an ensemble of daily sf and wd we used this ensemble to approximate the probability distribution of daily sf and wd each period and to calculate the probability distribution of relative change between them these ensembles represent the interannual variability in each climate scenario gcm the variability between gcms and the variability induced by varying wd associated with farmer adaptation to the economic and climatic conditions the effect of the uncertainty in the hydrologic parameters was not factored in total uncertainty in the forecasts of lu wu pd and nr for each crop and county were calculated differently this is because these forecasts are annual and because for each of the 605 simulated years in each period the economic component also produced a 300 member ensemble forecast that reflect the uncertainty in the calibrated economic model parameters to reduce the size of the ensemble we calculated the median of each ith member across all 605 simulated years in each period and used the resulting consolidated ensembles in each period to calculate the ensemble of relative change in these variables between baseline and end of century 4 results 4 1 changes in climate aridity all five gcms agreed mean growing season average temperature t avg would increase by end of century and that the western portion of the state would increase more than the eastern portion on a percent change basis supplementary material fig d 1 among all five gcms t avg was expected to increase 31 state wide there was little model agreement in end of century p the canesm2 model projected increased p state wide the gfdl esm2g model projected decreased p state wide and the other three models projected regional changes none of which agreed on spatial patterns supplementary material fig d 2 among all five gcms p was expected to increase 4 9 state wide all five gcms agreed etr would increase state wide but there was little spatial agreement on which regions would experience the largest percent change supplementary material fig d 3 among all five gcms etr was expected to increase 20 state wide as with p there was little model agreement in end of century ai fig 3 among all five gcms ai was expected to increase 21 state wide the most extreme end member gcms were the gfdl esm2g and canesm2 models the gfdl esm2g model projected a 57 state wide increase in ai however the canesm2 model projected a 3 5 state wide reduction in ai albeit with high spatial variability and some counties showed an increase the only spatial uniformity among all five gcms was in the northwest counties where all projected increased ai although there was little spatial agreement among the gcms the magnitude of projected changes was important as indicated on the colorbar in fig 3 the range across all gcms spanned 19 102 the canesm2 model was balanced ranging from 19 17 but the other models were unbalanced towards more arid conditions by the end of the century 4 2 water diversions and water use the overarching result in sf projections from our model align with previous studies that analyzed streamflow variations in the western u s bales et al 2006 das et al 2011 li et al 2017 mccabe and clark 2005 pederson et al 2011 rauscher et al 2008 regonda et al 2005 further hydrology results analysis and hydrographs for all counties are provided in supplementary material appendix e projected changes in total wd for irrigated agriculture showed a high level of uncertainty both statistically and spatially ravalli county for instance is a productive irrigated region that relies on water from the bitterroot river fig 4b simulated mean total wd for agriculture in the bitterroot river intensified by approximately 2 4 throughout the growing season but projections showed a very large spread that reflected both the uncertainty in the economic model parameters and the disagreements in p and ai among the gcms the majority of counties 63 projected an increase in the maximum mean percent change in wd fig 5a the dominant temporal trend in mean total wd showed lower changes in the early and late growing season and higher changes in the middle portion when crops were in full coverage and irrigation requirements were higher figs 4b c 5b c overall average state wide median projections in wu showed a slight decrease for irrigated alfalfa and large increases for irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat table 2 therefore collectively our results projected increased total wu for the state the spatial patterns of median percent change in wu showed increases for irrigated alfalfa across the majority of counties in the northwest and southwest regions slight changes both positive and negative in the central region and predominantly decreases across the rest of the state fig 6a as a whole less than half of the counties increased wu for irrigated alfalfa 29 the majority of counties projected increased wu for irrigated barley 73 however the gallatin southwest region marias central region and most of the lower missouri river corridor counties central and northeast regions projected slight decreases fig 6b the vast majority of counties projected increased wu for irrigated spring wheat 95 with the western and eastern ends of the state projected to increase the most fig 6c table 3 shows the regional average values of projected changes in wu for each irrigated crop type projections showed the northwest and southwest regions to increase wu for irrigated alfalfa while the other five regions all projected decreases the northwest and southwest regions have more abundant water and closer sources of water reducing total irrigation costs farms and ranches outside of the northwest and southwest regions are larger in area with nearby water sources less abundant which historically resulted in lower adoption of irrigation infrastructure due to the high cost of installation and water conveyance these factors as well as wheat and barley being more dominant in other regions resulted in the northwest and southwest regions prioritizing and intensifying irrigated alfalfa the other regions prioritized irrigated barley and spring wheat fig 6a 6c historically the southwest region devoted the most land to irrigated alfalfa and our projections showed the largest change in wu for irrigated alfalfa in that region the north central and southwest regions were the largest producers of irrigated barley and our projections showed increased wu the northwest region was projected to have the largest change in wu for irrigated barley which resulted from the low acreage of irrigated barley grown in the region historically therefore the comparatively small increase in the volume of irrigation water translated into the large percent change in wu the northeast region projected the largest increase in wu for irrigated spring wheat more than two times the state wide average likewise the northwest region projected significantly increased wu for spring wheat all seven regions projected increased wu for irrigated barley and spring wheat 4 3 land allocations on the state wide and regional scale average values of the median percent changes in lu to all non irrigated crops were projected to decrease table 2 4 that decrease applied to the majority of the state with a small number of counties two to six projected to increase lu for non irrigated crops fig 7b d f g conversely average state wide projections showed increased lu for all irrigated crops table 2 regionally irrigated alfalfa projected mixed spatial results four of seven regions projected increases irrigated barley projected increases in all regions and irrigated spring wheat projected increases in all but the north central region table 4 there was no distinct spatial pattern in lu for irrigated crops fig 7a c e but the majority of counties increased lu for irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat 66 and less than half of the counties increased lu for irrigated alfalfa 43 4 4 crop production not all counties that increased lu and or wu increased pd fig 8 for irrigated alfalfa only seven counties showed increased pd fig 8a and all seven increased both lu and wu fig 7a 6a respectively twenty counties showed increased pd of irrigated barley fig 8c all of which increased lu fig 8c but only 16 of those 20 increased wu fig 7b fifty three counties increased wu for irrigated spring wheat but only 19 increased pd fig 8e and all 19 increased both lu and wu fig 7e 6c respectively only sheridan county increased pd of any non irrigated crop and only for winter wheat fig 8g sheridan county increased lu for winter wheat by 10 3 fig 7g but only increased pd by 0 5 regionally only the southwest region projected increased pd for both irrigated barley and irrigated spring wheat table 5 state wide average projections showed decreased pd of all crops table 2 4 5 farm net revenue taking into account all predicted changes in lu wu and pd only 20 of 56 counties projected increased nr across any crops fig 9 regionally only irrigated barley in the southeast region projected an increase in nr table 6 historically the southeast region grew significantly less irrigated barley and therefore used less water than the other regions model results showed the southeast region would increase lu for irrigated barley by 8 0 table 4 increase wu by 19 2 table 3 which only resulted in a 0 8 increase in nr table 6 overall average state wide projections showed decreased nr for all crops and all non irrigated crops decreased more than any irrigated crop table 2 4 6 projection uncertainty of resource allocation in order to convey the uncertainty in the model results the probability distributions of economic variables for each crop type in ravalli and richland counties are presented here fig 10 and 11 respectively the probability distributions for all counties are presented in supplementary material appendix f ravalli county was chosen as representative of the northern rockies region because it has large lu and wu devoted to irrigated agriculture and model results showed increased wu for all irrigated crops richland county was chosen as representative of the ngp region because it has the most lu for irrigated spring wheat in the state even with our methodology of producing the aggregated ensembles the lu and wu distributions in both counties spanned large projected changes and zero percent change was within the 95 confidence interval the changes in wu distributions were skewed right figs 10 11 signifying modestly higher probabilities of large increases in wu for irrigation the probability distributions of the change in pd were quite narrow these narrow changes in pd probability distributions did not directly translate to narrow changes in nr probability distributions as with the changes in lu and wu probability distributions the change in pd and nr probability distributions spanned zero percent change which lies within the 95 confidence interval the uncertainty around these values was largely due to the model s response to the different climate projections represented by the gcms but also incorporated the effects of parameter uncertainty in the economic component 5 discussion 5 1 climate change uncertainty differences in the gcms projections of p contributed to the large potential range of hydro economic outcomes across montana as evidenced by large uncertainty envelopes around sf and wd changes spatial and magnitude uncertainty in ai and wide probability distributions for lu wu pd and nr projections of precipitation changes across the western u s were similarly uncertain u s global change research program 2017 which makes water resource management planning difficult groves et al 2008 tanaka et al 2006 conversely there was agreement that temperatures will increase in montana and across the western u s u s global change research program 2017 increased temperatures can impact agricultural productivity in numerous ways for example optimal crop growth occurs within specific intermediate temperature intervals and excessive heat is detrimental to physiological processes which therefore decrease crop yield anderson 2016 schauberger et al 2017 on the other hand warmer spring temperatures may allow for earlier planting dates which could increase crop productivity lanning et al 2010 but at the risk of damaging frosts kim et al 2014 while increasing temperatures could impact crop production the aridity index might be a better proxy for the viability of future agricultural productivity paltasingh et al 2012 however the complexities of plant water use efficiency of photosynthesis with changing atmospheric co2 concentrations has been shown to alter relations between hydrology and ecology parameters greve et al 2019 roderick et al 2015 future modeled projections of changes in annual aridity index showed increasing trends more arid conditions across most of the western u s ficklin novick 2017 fu feng 2014 scheff frierson 2015 sherwood fu 2014 while our results did show disagreements in end of century ai among the five gcms the overall magnitude of change after aggregating all projections indicated more arid conditions by the end of the century the more arid conditions were driven by increased atmospheric evaporative demands i e increased etr supplementary material fig d 3 wurster et al 2020 examined historic 1979 2016 etr price and precipitation anomalies impact on crop production in montana and surrounding states their results highlighted that alfalfa production was most sensitive to etr anomalies across the majority of montana although irrigation largely decoupled alfalfa production from climate conditions winter wheat production in the western and eastern border counties were most sensitive to etr anomalies maxwell et al 2017 stated the possibility of a transition to winter wheat from spring wheat as a result of warmer winter temperatures our results did not match the maxwell et al 2017 prediction and evidence of that transition was not observed in the 2008 2018 usda nass data as new observations of agricultural activity become available our hydro economic model may capture that transition if present 5 2 land use and water use in montana and throughout the intermountain west agricultural lands are still prevalent in counties that are rapidly urbanizing adjacent to and upstream of more urban counties are counties dominated by farming and ranching for example missoula county is rapidly urbanizing agricultural water demands are decreasing but projected upstream intensification of agricultural wd in ravalli and powell counties fig 4b 5b respectively would impact missoula s available water supply increases in agricultural water demand could amplify climate change impacts on summer sf this is especially true in western montana where our results showed summer sf would decrease fig 4b 5b while the certainty around summer sf decreasing in the eastern plains were less conclusive the majority of counties in the central and north central region projected slight decreases in maximum wd but these regions still showed decreasing sf fig 5a climate projections play a role but upstream increases in wu could be the more significant translation of downstream water shortages therefore the decisions farmers make in the headwater counties could have significant impact on counties situated downstream continuing historical trends experienced in the western u s end of century projected decreases in snowpack growing season sf quantities and shifts to earlier peak spring runoff bales et al 2006 das et al 2011 li et al 2017 mccabe clark 2005 pederson et al 2011 rauscher et al 2008 regonda et al 2005 udall and overpeck 2017 will add further stress to agricultural water demands cross et al 2017 pathak et al 2018 t avg was projected to increase more in the mountainous western portion of montana supplementary material fig d 1 which is where the majority of irrigation takes place mt dnrc 2014 increasing temperatures could require increased irrigation to avoid crop stress and counteract increased evaporation asseng et al 2013 döll 2002 fischer et al 2007 xiao et al 2005 there is little room for increased surface water diversions from any basin across the state as the percentage of basin totals are already diverted at 95 or greater mt dnrc 2014 5 3 adaptation strategies our methodology considers a limited set of the adaptation strategies available to farmers e g farmers could only change lu and or wu but not change irrigation technology or introduce new crop varieties combining that with the variations in farming costs and crop market prices resulted in considerable noise surrounding our predictions of farmers response to climate change medellín azuara et al 2011 isolated how land and water allocations crop prices and agricultural revenues in california would change under a mid century climate change scenario they estimated larger reductions in lu compared to our results reductions in wu state wide moderate increases in crop prices and a reduction in total gross revenues however their study showed that shifting to higher value crops over less land may translate into increased revenue per unit area in california likewise farmers may choose to fallow their land and sell or lease their water to other users ghosh et al 2014 howitt et al 2012 montana has a limited crop portfolio and does not have a climate suitable for widespread production of high value crops that can be used to mitigate economic losses in the way california could if in fact crop prices increase and or farming costs decrease resulting in marginal land becoming economically viable then montana farmers may increase the extent of land area under production wurster et al 2020 documented historical price anomaly impacts on crop production and showed that the majority of eastern montana s barley production and the majority of central montana s winter wheat production were the most sensitive to price anomalies therefore shifts in market demands for barley and wheat by the end of the century could have implications for lu and wu that are not captured by our model 5 4 assumptions and limitations economic results indicated that most counties could experience pd and nr losses across all crops by the end of century under an rcp 8 5 carbon emissions scenario the rcp 8 5 is increasingly considered an unrealistic scenario hausfather peters 2020 therefore model outputs reflect the relatively extreme worst case outcome our results focused on isolating the net climatic effects on agriculture therefore we assumed there would be no significant changes in production costs or crop market prices another assumption in these results was the timing of planting and irrigating there is the potential that farmers will be able to produce more by end of century given warmer temperatures will allow for earlier planting dates crop productivity could increase with elevated co2 concentrations but studies are inconclusive on the benefits of higher co2 when accounting for other factors e g higher temperatures disease weather extremes tubiello et al 2007 finally this study assumed farmers will not plant new crop types with changing temperatures precipitation and aridity patterns farmers may have genetically modified species and or begin to grow other crops better suited for arid climates such crops include sorghum and pearl millet chipanshi et al 2003 jukanti et al 2016 silungwe et al 2018 in addition to the assumptions made in this study the hydro economic model has important limitations first the model did not simulate dams nor irrigation water derived from pumping groundwater montana s dams are important for water storage and flood mitigation and inclusion of these water storage basins could impact results in many counties currently approximately 98 of montana s water withdrawals come from surface water therefore baseline results are deemed appropriate on the other hand groundwater use increases during drought periods taylor et al 2013 and the severity and duration of western u s droughts are expected to increase gutzler robbins 2011 trenberth et al 2014 silverman et al 2017 therefore groundwater use for irrigation in montana is expected to expand by the end of the century brown et al 2013 however the effects of these model limitations on the current analysis are limited because we did not use sf to estimate water available for irrigation or to calibrate the economic component farmer response was calibrated using water availability constraints derived from remote sensing estimates of actual crop water use during years of maximum irrigation rather than water available in the streams maneta et al 2020 in fact sf provides a poor metric of irrigation water constraints because access to irrigation water is most often set by water regulations and not by the physical availability of water regarding alfalfa production the model optimized for nr based on market prices alfalfa sold on the market is valued much lower than barley or wheat however much of the alfalfa grown in montana is used on farm for cattle production which provides a far higher value to the farmer since we did not incorporate the indirect revenues generated from cattle sales in the price of alfalfa we interpreted the alfalfa market price as an opportunity cost if a farmer chooses to use alfalfa for cattle rather than sell it on the market then the observed price reflects a lower bound on the value of alfalfa for cattle production 6 conclusion we applied an innovative satellite informed integrated hydro economic model that overcame limitations of previous studies while filling an important knowledge gap about the impacts of climate change on streamflows land and water use crop production and farm net revenues the uncertainty in climate projections and diversity of farmer adaptation responses to climate change resulted in wide uncertainty in predicted states of streamflow agricultural water use and net revenues by the end of the century the majority of rivers across montana would experience streamflow declines of 10 30 during the summer months our simulations showed a state wide increase of 1 6 in land area devoted to irrigated crops accompanied by an 18 2 increase in agricultural water use montana is the headwaters to three major watersheds therefore declines in growing season water availability and increases in agricultural water demand would have far reaching impacts downstream even accounting for the increases in irrigated land and water use irrigated crop production and farm net revenues were expected to decline by 0 5 and 1 5 respectively projections for rainfed crops were more dire collectively state wide land allocated to rainfed crops declined 6 5 production declined 2 7 and net revenue declined 7 2 while our study simulated the hydro economic impacts of climate change in montana our results are representative of what many regions in the intermountain west would experience our study filled important knowledge gaps by incorporating a wide range of economic and

7892,study region six wetland sites around iran gavkhoni and hur al azim wetlands gorgan bay and namak urmia and maharloo bakhtegan lakes and their associated hydrological basins study focus the aim was to distinguish the contributions of climatic and non climatic changes including land use land cover lulc to areal decline in six iranian wetlands this was done using data driven quantification methodology that combined comparative change correlation and budyko based analyses of evapotranspiration etb and runoff rb changes in the hydrological basin of each wetland extended to consider explicitly climate driven change in evaporation rate ew from the wetland area and the shift from previous ew to etb caused by the wetland decline itself new hydrological insights for the region comparative correlation analysis revealed an overall stronger correlation of wetland decline with lulc changes mainly cropland urban land than with changes in temperature t or precipitation p across all wetland sites the extended budyko based analysis revealed that the predominant cause of wetland decline across all sites was increased etb with related decrease in rb from basin to wetland whereas changes in ew and in wetland decline shifting ew to etb had only a weak influence in line with the correlation analysis results non climatic drivers were revealed as causing etb increases and rb decreases leading to wetland decline to a greater degree than climate change t p graphical abstract ga1 keywords wetland decline climate change land use cover change evapotranspiration runoff iran 1

changes may thus take place for various reasons čížková et al 2013 and have indeed occurred around the world thorslund et al 2017 davidson 2014 with serious consequences for ecosystem and biodiversity status albert et al 2020 geography and related climate hydrological and land use land cover lulc conditions and changes combine in determining wetland change dynamics ghajarnia et al 2020 åhlén et al 2021 kåresdotter et al 2021 distinguishing main driver effect relationships for wetland decline is essential for fundamental understanding and for effective protection and rehabilitation of wetlands bateman et al 2013 from a climate change perspective changes in precipitation and temperature can both contribute to changing actual evapotranspiration and runoff precipitation changes the total water inflow to a hydrological basin which is further partitioned between the runoff and evapotranspiration outflows from the basin with temperature changes directly influencing the latter overall precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are related at basin level through the overarching basin wise water balance including possible storage change within the basin moshir panahi et al 2020 evapotranspiration and runoff at basin level can also be affected by non climate drivers such as lulc changes associated lulc changes can then primarily affect evapotranspiration and also runoff through the basin wise water balance for any given precipitation level these combined relationships require quantification methodology for assessing and distinguishing the contributions of different change drivers to observed changes in wetland area the aim of this study was to distinguish climatic and non climatic drivers of wetland decline using data driven quantification methodology the methodology developed combined components of comparative change correlation analysis with budyko based distinction of climatic and non climatic drivers of evapotranspiration etb and related runoff rb changes over the hydrological basin of each wetland site the budyko based analysis was extended to consider changes in evaporation ew from the wetland water surface and a feedback component of some part of previous ew being shifted to etb by the wetland decline itself the main novelty of the study is this methodological combination including the ew etb shift component which was tested on observational data for six wetland sites in iran undergoing areal decline madani 2014 madani et al 2016 these wetland sites were selected based on availability of the necessary data for analysis and method testing moshir panahi et al 2020 in combination with wetland change effects being particularly severe in arid semi arid regions such as iran with inherent water shortages shadeed 2013 iran is located in south west asia and more than 70 of its territory has a semi dry to dry climate although the country as a whole also includes other climate types moshir panahi et al 2021 raziei and pereira 2013 iran has undergone major hydrological changes in recent years moshir panahi et al 2020 ashraf et al 2021 and a major effect of this massive shift is a reduction in wetland area across iran madani 2014 madani et al 2016 given the hydrological shift in iran investigating factors causing the reduction in wetland areas is a topic of interest to researchers and politicians in iran and in other parts of the world facing similar hydrological changes studies have been conducted to identify why wetlands are drying up huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a 2018b the most significant case of wetland drying in iran is lake urmia the largest lake in the country and the second largest saline lake in the world which has been the subject of many hydrological studies parsinejad et al 2022 most of this research attention is due to a dramatic decline in the area of this lake over the past decade pouladi et al 2022 which has led to the allocation of special funding for research on lake restoration parsinejad et al 2022 various methods have been applied by researchers to identify the causes of the decline in lake urmia area khazaei et al 2019 chaudhari et al 2018 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 fathian et al 2016 these include investigating trends in surface flow in the basin and the relationship with climatic variables and changes bagheri et al 2019 applying the water balance approach naboureh et al 2021 and using satellite images to study trends in agricultural development and investigate climate change trends at the same time most previous studies on lake urmia basin have emphasized the prominent role of human factors parsinejad et al 2022 pouladi et al 2021 research to determine the role of human drivers in reducing lake area can be divided into two general categories based on the approach used direct investigations of human factors and water resources management processes and indirect investigations of the impact of human factors through direct investigation of changes in climate variables and their weak contribution to lake area change parsinejad et al 2022 other basins in iran containing wetlands at the basin outlet have also been studied e g gavkhouni wetland basin in the center of iran long term studies over 50 years investigating changes in climatic and human variables in gavkhouni wetland have found almost normal conditions in the early part of the study period but severe hydrological drought caused by human activities in recent decades leading to a significant reduction in surface flow in this basin abou zaki et al 2020 azadi et al 2022 in the maharloo bakhtegan lake basin spatiotemporal investigations of climatic variables and of meteorological and hydrological drought have revealed only significant trends in hydrological drought torabi haghighi et al 2020 the main reason for hydrological changes in that basin is expansion of human activities especially irrigated area and associated crop production djamali et al 2009 hur al azim wetland downstream in the karkheh basin in southwestern iran is known as iran s food basket ahmad and giordano 2010 studies using swat modeling fereidoon and koch 2018 and data driven modeling kamali et al 2017 davtalab et al 2017 to assess basin conditions have reported that climate change and changes in drought have had minor effects on the runoff discharged from this basin lake namak basin in northern iran where most of the iranian population is concentrated has also undergone numerous changes in terms of hydrology in this basin harvesting of water especially groundwater due to the expansion of human activities has been identified as a stronger factor than climate change in reducing surface flow into lake namak sheikh et al 2020 emadi et al 2022 gorgan bay basin in northern iran has undergone massive deforestation fazel rastgar 2020 maleki et al 2020 a study by kousali et al 2022 investigated changes in surface inflow to gorgan bay wetland using a non stationary approach in addition to the effects of changes in the upstream basin the relationship between gorgan gulf and the caspian sea has been identified as an effective factor in changes in wetland area gharibreza et al 2018 while many studies on wetland decline have been performed to date there has been no comprehensive study using a consistent approach to investigate and compare factors causing the reduction in wetland area in iran therefore in the present study methodology was developed and applied consistently to the six different iranian wetland sites referred to above i e lake urmia wetland pouladi et al 2020 gavkhoni wetland gohari et al 2013 gorgan bay wetland kakroodi et al 2012 gharibreza et al 2018 hur al azim wetland davtalab et al 2014 lake namak wetland samani et al 2021 and lake maharloo bakhtegan wetland djamali et al 2009 direct observational data on wetland decline were used for the analysis in all cases together with related climate hydrological and lulc data applying the methodology to these six wetlands located in different parts of iran with different climatic and human characteristics and different regimes allowed simultaneous testing of the methodology and comparison of the results and assessment of similarities and differences between the cases 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites fig 1 shows the location of the six wetland sites used for method evaluation and testing in this study and other main basins in iran hydrometric and synoptic stations at the six wetland sites and cities population less or more than 300 000 located in each wetland basin gavkhoni wetland is located at the end of the river zayandehrod which drains into gavkhoni basin basin 42 in fig 1 mean annual temperature in the basin is 15 8 c and mean annual precipitation is 259 mm yr gavkhoni basin includes 69 cities the most important of which is isfahan population 1 6 million which lies along the zayandeh rud river upstream of gavkhouni wetland gorgan bay wetland is located downstream in the gorgan basin part of basins 16 15 in northern iran where mean annual temperature is 15 4 c and mean annual precipitation is 307 mm yr the water level in gorgan bay wetland is determined by basin runoff and by flow through a natural canal towards the caspian sea in the north east fig 1 there are 29 cities in this basin of which gorgan and gonbad e kavus have a population of 350 000 and 200 000 respectively both these cities are located along the rivers leading to gorgan bay hur al azim wetland is located in south west iran downstream in basin 22 which has mean annual temperature of 17 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 388 mm yr the wetland is fed by surrounding rivers there are 58 cities in this basin with the three largest cities kermanshah khorramabad and malayer having a population of around 1 million 400 000 and 200 000 respectively the basin of this wetland is transboundary although this study just focused on the iranian part lake namak is located downstream of a basin with same name basin 41 in central iran with mean annual temperature of 15 1 c and mean annual precipitation of 268 mm yr this basin has the largest resident population of all basins in iran accounting for 28 of the iranian population and it includes 169 cities the most important of these cities are tehran 8 9 million karaj 1 9 million qom 1 2 million hamedan 600 000 arak 550 000 and qazvin 450 000 lake urmia in the north west is the best known case of dramatic lake wetland shrinkage in iran khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 dehghanipour et al 2020 all runoff generated in lake urmia basin basin 30 where mean annual temperature is 11 9 c and annual precipitation is 377 mm yr enters lake urmia in total this basin includes 57 cities with the two main cities tabriz and urmia having a population of 1 6 and 1 million respectively urmia is located near the lake approximately 15 km lakes maharloo bakhtegan are located in central iran downstream in the maharloo bakhtegan basin basin 43 which has mean annual temperature of 17 6 c and mean annual precipitation of 332 mm yr there are 19 cities in the basin of which shiraz with a population of 1 6 million is the largest further characteristics of the six wetlands are presented in table s1 in supplementary material sm 2 2 hydro climate data we considered here the water outflow by runoff rb from the hydrological basin land area ab that feeds water into each associated water covered lake wetland with area aw the latter is not included in ab but in total regional area atot ab aw which encompasses both the basin land and the wetland area for evaluation of rb measured stream water discharge divided by associated hydrological basin land area ab we used rb data time series for the period 1986 2016 compiled by moshir panahi et al 2020 for 30 major basins in iran based on discharge measurements at 213 official hydrometric stations with 372 continuous monthly data observations reported by the iranian ministry of energy ime the hydrometric stations used for calculating basin runoff were the last hydrometric station in each wetland after which all flow goes to the wetland none of these stations was located in the vicinity of a dam pumping station or water regulation structure that could alter the natural stream flow we also considered precipitation p as the main water input flux to each basin and wetland and temperature t as an additional main climate variable for the period 1986 2016 based on measured data at 103 synoptic meteorological stations reported by the iranian meteorological organization irmo these data comprised spatial distributions of p and t values for each study area calculated using the kriging method potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated for each site using the langbein formula pet 325 21 t 0 9 t2 arora 2002 with t being mean annual temperature in c consistent basin evapotranspiration etb time series as the main water outflow from each basin were obtained from panahi et al 2020 etb was calculated from basin scale water balance for each study site as etb p rb ds where ds is annual water storage change as officially reported based on measured data from ime 2 3 wetland area data the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 was used to estimate time series of water covered area for the six study wetlands this freely available dataset contains 30 m resolution class images over 35 years 1984 2018 produced by unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral satellite images from landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the gswd provides information about surface water occurrence and recurrence over the earth s continental land area pekel et al 2016 borja et al 2020 the european commission s joint research centre jrc hosts this dataset and keeps it up to date from this dataset we extracted all relevant observations of surface water extent for our six wetland study sites from the google earth engine at monthly intervals with some occasional gaps in the series because the data are not reported continuously at given time intervals 2 4 land use land cover lulc data to assess lulc changes in the hydrological basins of the six wetlands we used land cover data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci land cover dataset lamarche et al 2017 this dataset is generated from global daily reflectance measurements 1992 2018 acquired from multiple earth observation systems including a medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris 2003 2012 advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr 1992 1999 satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt 1999 2013 and proba vegetation proba v 2014 2015 kganyago and shikwambana 2019 the dataset resolution is 300 m and the data cover the 37 classes in the united nations land cover classification system un lcss over a 23 year period 1992 2016 in this study we aggregated the 37 land cover classes to seven main classes by coding in arcmap defourny et al 2017 these final land cover classes are presented in table s2 in sm 3 methodology the developed data driven method in this study effectively distinguishes between possible climate and non climate drivers of observed wetland decline using two complementary approaches 1 comparative correlation analysis of climate p t and lulc variable relationships with observed wetland decline and 2 budyko based analysis of climate and non climate driven changes in etb and rb moreover this is followed by an extensive analysis to assess the total hydrological change of the wetland basins although climate change may lead to changes in non climatic drivers e g through lulc being affected by climatic changes noszczyk 2019 dale et al 2011 in this study they were assumed to be independent of each other such independence was also assumed in studies by zhang et al 2020 and xue et al 2021 3 1 comparative correlation analysis comparative correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships of climate and lulc variables with wetland area first trend analysis was performed for the two climate variables t p using the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 as done in other studies of hydrological trends khazaei et al 2019 their respective correlations with wetland area were then examined following that areal changes in the six lulc classes and their correlation with wetland area were explored the correlations between variations in wetland area and possible climate and lulc change drivers were assessed using linear regression with pearson s correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 as correlation direction and strength indicator respectively the comparison considered wetland area regression with the climate variables p and t and with different lulc classes cropland forest grass shrub sparsely vegetated urban land the results of this comparative analysis indicated which of the climate and landscape variables if any were more strongly correlated with observed wetland area variation and decline and can thereby be important explanatory drivers 3 2 budyko based analysis of the hydrological basin of each wetland budyko based analysis was used to distinguish climate and non climate drivers of wetland decline with the latter e g representing relevant lulc variables as identified in the comparative correlation analysis independently of the correlation based results the budyko based analysis was applied to identify potential climate and non climate drivers of landscape hydrological changes in etb and rb within each hydrological basin i e over the basin land area etb the budyko space diagram fig 2 has been widely used in previous studies to separate climate and non climate largely directly human driven hydrological changes jaramillo and destouni 2014 gan et al 2020 it considers the long term average water and energy balances over each basin land area ab considering etb p and pet and separates indirect decomposition of rb change into direct non climate mostly human driven and climate drivers wang and hejazi 2011 gan et al 2020 as the basis for the diagram budyko et al 1974 expressed the evaporative ratio etb p over a basin area as 1 et b p pet p tanh p pet 1 exp pet p in the diagram in fig 2 the green curve is determined by eq 1 with the vertical axis representing the ratio etb p i e the average etb outflow from ab relative to the average total p water inflow and the horizontal axis representing energy or water limitation conditions for etb p in terms of the aridity index pet p with value 1 or 1 implying energy or water limitation respectively the dashed black lines show the theoretical energy and water limits of etb pet and etb p respectively for each basin point a in fig 2 represents pre period etb p and pet values located somewhere on a specific budyko curve as described by eq 2 below fu 1981 point b in fig 2 represents the changes in these values due to climate change or non climate drivers such as direct human activity in the basin destouni et al 2013 if the changes in the values are solely due to climate change point b would be located on the same budyko curve as point a the red line and would correspond to point c in fig 2 with the vertical value distance between points c b and a quantifying the change driven solely by climate change if the post period point b is not located on the same budyko curve as point a the value distance between b and a will depend both on climate change and on direct non climate drivers such as human activity changes in the basin e g changes in lulc the vertical value distance between point c with the same aridity index pet p as point b but located on the same budyko curve as point a and point a i e etb p c minus etb p a then quantifies the etb change due to climate change etb p clim while that between point b and point c i e etb p b minus etb p c quantifies the etb change caused by direct human drivers in the basin etb p non clim point b may be located below or above point c on the budyko curve given by the pre change point a using eq 2 the fu equation fu 1981 or a similar equation 2 et b p 1 pet p 1 pet p w 1 w where the index w remains unchanged if only climate conditions change and its possible change is determined by changes in direct human drivers in the basin the value of w for each basin can be calculated by placing the values of other variables eq 2 since their values are known from moshir panahi et al 2020 based on this separation of total basin change etb p into climate and non climate driven parts the associated change in rb is also consistently divided into climate and non climate parts as 3 r b r b c lim r b non c lim 4 r b c lim p et b c lim 5 r b non c lim r b r b c lim 3 3 analysis extension to total hydrological change to analyze total hydrological changes over the study period 1986 2016 the total study period was divided into a pre period part 1986 2000 and a post period part 2001 2016 to calculate changes in hydro climate variables in each basin and enable direct comparison between the six wetland basins the year 2000 was selected as the dividing point of the study period this year has been identified as the point of change in the amount of runoff in iran moshir panahi et al 2020 any change in the water covered area of a wetland from the pre period aw pre to the post period aw post implies a corresponding change in the total evaporation output flow ew from the wetland s surface water area aw for direct comparability of all components of total evapotranspiration of which ew is one ew is normalized as the total regional area atot including both the hydrological basin land area and the area of the wetland which remains constant in time while both the wetland area aw and basin land area ab could change with corresponding shifts from one to the other from the pre to the post period climate related temperature t change can also affect the rate of evaporation ew per unit area of water surface in the water covered wetland area aw post remaining from the pre to post period the decline in wetland area aw implies a corresponding dry land increase in the complementary basin area ab within the total unchanging regional area atot at each study site this basin area ab increase also affects and adds to the climate and non climate driven changes in evapotranspiration etb over ab which in turn alter the runoff rb into the wetland area aw total regional ettot change ettot over the entire regional area atot ab pre aw pre ab post aw post thus includes changes in both the basin land area and the wetland area which can be expressed as destouni et al 2010 6 et tot et tot post et tot pre et b post a b post e w post a w post et b pre a b pre e w pre a w pre a tot this along with the related equations shown below allows ettot and its components to be determined over the basin land area and the wetland area including the change in evaporation ew over the latter based on methodology previously developed and applied to the dramatically shrinking aral sea in central asia by destouni et al 2010 using this methodology we calculated the unknown ew for each wetland area by assuming equilibrium conditions in the pre period between the total inflow of runoff plus precipitation to each wetland area and the outflow of evaporation from the wetland area expressed as 7 e w pre p w pre r b pre a b pre a w pre the last term in eq 7 distributes i e re normalizes for direct comparability the volumetric discharge from rb multiplied by the whole basin area ab pre to the wetland area aw pre over which both ew and pw apply in this equation with the area specific precipitation over the wetland pw being essentially similar to that over the associated hydrological basin i e pw pb p per respective unit area for calculation of ew post we assumed that the change from pre to post period in relative evaporation rate from the wetland δew ew pre is similar to the change in relative evapotranspiration rate from the basin solely due to climate driven change δetb clim eb pre this can be expressed as 8 e w e w pre et b c lim et b pre this assumption can be made since regional climate change affects evaporative rate over both the basin and the wetland area while a possible change component in etb rate due to non climate drivers e g land use change that only prevail in the basin landscape should not affect the evaporation rate ew from just the free water surface of the wetland thereby ew post over the wetland area aw post in the post change period can consistently be expressed as 9 e w post e w pre 1 et b c lim et b pre with etb applying over the changing basin area we can further express the total regional evapotranspiration ettot over the constant total regional area atot as 10a et tot pre et b pre a b pre e w pre a w pre a tot 10b et tot post et b post a b post e w post a w post a tot moreover to distinguish climate and non climate driver contributions to change in etb δetb clim and δetb non clim respectively we can state that 11 et b post et b pre et b c lim et b non c lim where δetb clim and δetb non clim are calculated from complementary budyko based analysis as outlined in section 3 2 finally the change contribution denoted δettot decl to total regional ettot over atot due to the wetland area decline itself with associated conversion of water covered aw to dry basin land ab area cannot simply be assigned to either climate or non climate drivers as it is driven by a mixture of both therefore estimation of δettot decl is considered separately as an additional mixed type of et

wetland area the long term average values of climate and hydrological variables and changes in these between the pre and post period in each wetland basin were presented in table 1 change values are also presented together with the range of fluctuation resulting from standard deviation from the relevant variable in the first and second sub periods fig s1 in sm showed average long term values in the first and second sub periods along with the standard deviation change value and range of fluctuation for each variable in all cases the change in p the main input water flow was negative decrease over the study period the greatest decrease in p was seen in the hur al azim wetland basin 51 7 44 1 mm yr and the maharloo bakhtegan lake basin 49 5 34 4 mm yr while the smallest p decrease was seen in the gavkhoni wetland basin 6 5 15 1 mm yr t has increased in all basins between the sub periods this is implying warmer conditions in the post period 2001 2016 compared to the pre period 1986 2000 four of the wetland basins gavkhoni gorgan namak urmia had temperature increases greater than 0 6 ºc while the t increase in the maharloo bakhtegan and hur al azim wetland basins was 0 53 and 0 32 ºc respectively for p and t time series see fig s2 in sm as pet is a function of t it also increased in all basins in all cases the increase in t exceeded the estimated global increase in wetland surface water temperature of 0 34 c per decade woolway et al 2020 the change in rb outflow from each basin to the associated wetland was negative decrease in all cases the greatest decrease in rb was seen for the lake urmia basin 69 3 43 72 mm yr and the smallest for the lake namak basin 9 7 6 60 mm yr table 1 the change in etb was positive increase in four wetland basins lake urmia 42 0 8 5 mm yr lake namak 19 4 7 9 mm yr gavkhoni wetland 5 6 11 7 mm yr and gorgan bay 1 0 26 4 mm yr the other two basins exhibited a decrease in etb hur al azim wetland 11 3 60 9 mm yr maharloo bakhtegan basin 18 1 12 1 mm yr the positive changes in etb in the gavkhouni gorgan namak and urmia basins where the changes in precipitation main input water flux to the system were negative indicate an abnormal relationship between the components of the water balance equation in a natural system the amount of evapotranspiration can be expected to decrease with decreasing precipitation and in the hur al azim and maharloo bakhtegan basins the etb changes and the precipitation changes were both negative however comparison of the magnitude of change in these hydro climate variables in the two basins revealed differences in the rate of change calculated for all variables by dividing measured change by period length as shown in table s3 in sm the rate of precipitation change was found to be 4 7 fold the etb change in the hur al azim basin and 2 7 fold the etb change in the maharloo bakhtegan basin i e there was no consistent relationship between changes in p and etb a more detailed study of the reason for this as regards both types of etb change increase decrease was performed to determine the effects of precipitation climate changes see section 4 3 comparing the rate of change of the hydro climatic variables table s3 indicated runoff and precipitation have the highest average rate of change respectively the main water outflow from basin to wetland rb reflects the hydrological response of a basin to all change drivers within that basin dey and mishra 2017 jarsjö et al 2012 net positive increase or negative decrease changes in rb also increase or decrease the recipient wetland area time series of annual and seven year moving average values of rb and wetland area revealed short term and longer term variations fig 3 in all wetland basins rb displayed relatively large annual fluctuations while its seven year moving average showed a steady downward trend as expected wetland area responded accordingly to both types of variation in rb as seen for rb at all wetland sites an overall declining trend was also seen for wetland area with no apparent recovery to previous wetter average conditions fig 3 lake urmia fig 3e has attracted much attention in recent years from researchers politicians the media and the public due to its extensive shrinkage khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 nikraftar et al 2021 although other iranian wetlands had also shown dramatic declines fig 3a d f massive reductions in area have taken place in gavkhoni wetland fig 3a and lake namak fig 3d with their area approaching zero in the past few years over the same period the hur al azim wetland fig 3c and maharloo bakhtegan lakes fig 3f have lost more than half their area only gorgan bay fig 3b has experienced a smaller areal reduction in the period possibly due to its canal connection to the caspian sea ranjbar and zaker 2018 4 2 comparative correlation analysis the correlation results for mean annual t and p versus wetland area were shown in table 2 last two rows together with the results of trend change analysis for associated scatter plots see figs s3 and s4 in sm the pearson s r values for the correlation between t and wetland area ranged from 0 57 to 0 12 indicating an inverse negative correlation in all cases this was consistent with the common expectation that increasing t will drive some degree of wetland decline wang et al 2018 also as expected p was positively correlated with wetland area i e decreased p gave some degree of decline in wetland area except in the case of lake urmia basin which exhibited a negative correlation r 0 03 table 2 which might mean weak climate role precipitation change in urmia lake decline overall however the correlations of p and t with wetland area decline were rather weak low r2 table 2 even though t exhibited a significant confidence level γ 0 95 increasing trend in five basins gavkhoni gorgan namak urmia maharloo bakhtegan the only exception the hur al azim basin showed no significant trend γ 0 95 in either t or p table 2 as expected from the overall insignificant γ 0 95 p trends wetland area correlations with t emerge as mostly somewhat stronger than those with p except for the maharloo bakhtegan basin the very weak correlations of both t and p with lake urmia area likely reflected particularly dominant non climate and mainly human drivers of wetland decline which was consistent with previous findings for this basin khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 as changes in lulc could also affect landscape hydrology destouni et al 2013 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a 2018b trang et al 2017 we investigated correlations of lulc with wetland decline using esa cci data for each wetland site reclassified to seven main lulc classes based on chen et al 2019 see table s2 in sm the seventh class no data was omitted from the analysis with cumulative relative change in the six remaining lulc classes calculated for each wetland site correlations between these relative lulc changes and wetland area decline were further investigated using monthly gswd data on wetland area pekel et al 2016 rather than data on the water class in the esa cci dataset because gswd has finer resolution at monthly time scale and longer periods of wetland area estimation cumulative change relative to the initial area values for the main lulc classes see table s2 in sm were shown in fig 4 for direct comparability the first year with lulc data 1992 was used as the starting year for calculation of cumulative change in wetland area fig s5 in sm a common feature of all wetland basins was a high increase in urban land area which in all cases exceeded 140 fig 4 the highest growth in urban land occurred in lake urmia basin 185 and lake namak basin 184 and the lowest in maharloo bakhtegan lake basin 147 and hur al azim basin 140 this urban growth consistent with reported increases in urban population and residential area in iran along with expansion of infrastructure and industrial areas mao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 mansour et al 2020 grassland area change varied from 6 to 6 in five of the basins fig 4 the gavkhoni basin was an exception exhibiting sharp growth and then stabilization at around 75 fig 4a for shrub land the range of variation was 1 3 5 in all cases except maharloo bakhtegan lake basin where there was a sharp increase around 2008 and then stabilization at almost 73 fig 4f cropland mainly related to agricultural activities showed increases 5 12 in all cases except lake namak basin which had a decrease of 24 fig 4d in all six basins sparsely vegetated land mostly bare soil exhibited a decrease ranging from 1 to 26 with the greatest decrease in lake urmia basin and the least in gorgan bay basin fig 4 forest area change ranged from 9 4 in all cases except gorgan bay basin where it was 16 fig 4b due to massive deforestation in gorgan province fazel rastgar 2020 maleki et al 2020 with mostly conversion to cropland wetland area showed a declining trend in all cases as previously shown in fig 3 to 47 in the least affected case gorgan bay and close to 100 almost complete wetland disappearance in the worst affected basins gavkhoni wetland and lake namak the r and r2 values for the correlations of wetland area decline with lulc changes are presented in table 3 changes decrease increase in one lulc class leads to changes in other lulc classes but the relationship is not necessarily linear verburg and veldkamp 2001 noszczyk 2019 table3 showed the correlation between changes in wetland area and the six lulc classes correlations between lulc classes were presented in table s4 in sm there were consistently high negative correlations between wetland area and cropland and urban land for all wetland sites with average pearson s r values of 0 77 and 0 76 and r2 values of 0 62 and 0 60 respectively change in sparsely vegetated land also showed a relatively high correlation with wetland area decline in all cases r 0 59 r2 0 45 on average grassland was negatively correlated with wetland area at all sites except urmia while gavkhoni was the only site with a negative correlation between wetland area and forest land r 0 42 overall increasing cropland area emerged as a likely primary driver of wetland decline table 3 confirming reports by wine and laronne 2020 of a global pattern of decreasing lake area associated with increasing agricultural area in endorheic basins overall the correlations of lulc variables with wetland decline were moderate to strong with the strongest values found for cropland and urban area in agreement with previous findings mao et al 2018 wine and laronne 2020 the correlations of the climate variables p t with wetland decline were considerably weaker than those of most lulc variables and particularly the rather strong correlations found for cropland and urban land table 2 3 the changes in cropland and urban land are directly human driven for food production by expanding agricultural area and for urban residential purposes housing and infrastructure mansour et al 2020 mao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 urban development can lead to hydrological changes in an area by creating and expanding the water supply and distribution system wastewater disposal system and transmission structures rodrigues et al 2019 oudin et al 2018 the effects are intensified when urban development is beyond the ecological capacity of an area regardless of the ecological capacity of the region as cities grow increasing water demand and withdrawal can be expected and this process will intensify and become more complex over time li et al 2018 a clear example of this can be seen in the expansion of cities around the six iranian wetlands studied here fig 1 the high coefficient of determination for wetland declines versus cropland and urban area expansion r2 0 62 for cropland r2 0 6 for urban land compared with that for the main climate variables r2 0 08 for p r2 0 17 for t indicated a more dominant role of these two lulc variables than that of the climate variables in the rb reduction with associated eb increase component that drove the wetland decline at the six study sites fig 3 cropland and urban land expansion the two lulc types with the highest average correlation with decline in wetland area occurs by reducing replacing other lulc classes a review of the correlation coefficients between cropland urban land and other lulc classes table s4 showed that expansion of cropland and also expansion of urban land in all basins except gorgan were mainly associated with a change in the sparse lulc class however some changes were seen in other lulc classes the gorgan bay basin initially had a high density of forest coverage and cropland and urban land expansion in that basin occurred by massive deforestation with the cropland lulc having the highest possible inverse correlation coefficient 1 with forest cover high intensity of deforestation in this area has been reported by raiesi and beheshti 2022 an important point not addressed in previous investigations of lulc changes was the effect on these of climate change perhaps because the relationship between climate and lulc and changes in these is complex noszczyk 2019 dale 2011 in the natural environment lulc is primarily a function of climate conditions and area specification however the rapid rate of expansion of the cropland and urban land lulc classes both created by direct human intervention at the expense of other lulc classes will result in future climate change having weaker effects on lulc changes in the wetland basins than changes due to human interventions this is in line with the independent confirmation of the assumption of climatic and non climatic changes in section 3 4 3 extended budyko based analysis the complementary extended budyko based distinguishes climate and non climate drivers of the changes in the main outflows from each basin etb rb wetland surface evaporation ew and total regional evapotranspiration ettot including the change contribution to the latter from the wetland decline itself δettot decl fig 5 showed the climate and non climate driven contributions to change in average etb between the two sub periods fig 5a and corresponding contributions to total regional change in ettot from total etb change over the original basin area ew change over the remaining post change wetland area and δettot decl due to the dried area part of the original wetland in addition to the mean change value the range of fluctuation in change values was shown in fig 5 it was used to calculate the maximum and minimum values of the variables used with standard deviation in each of the sub periods studied in this way the range of change values and its components were calculated the changes in basin evapotranspiration δetb were in the form of increases in the lake urmia 42 0 8 5 mm yr lake namak 19 4 7 9 mm yr gavkhoni wetland 5 6 11 7 mm yr and gorgan bay 1 0 26 4 mm yr basins with decreases only in the hur al azim 11 3 60 9 mm yr and maharloo bakhtegan lake 18 1 12 1 mm yr basins fig 5a these values were also shown in table 1 based on the mean difference between the two sub periods intervals the climate driven contributions δetb clim were mostly decreases ranging from 8 to 52 1 mm yr except in gavkhoni 2 2 mm yr the predominant climate driven δetb clim decreases thus reflected the decreases in p meaning that less p input water was available for feeding etb rather than effects of increased t i e warming which would instead drive increased etb the only exception was the gavkhoni basin with a small climate driven increase contribution δetb clim reflecting the finding that this basin had by far the smallest decrease in p of only 6 5 mm yr table 1 in contrast all non climate driven contributions δetb non clim were positive i e increases in all basins fig 5a this indicated mainly increased contributions to total etb from the human driven changes in lulc particularly the cropland and urban area increases which replaced other lulc classes within the basins and were most strongly correlated with wetland decline at the different study sites table 3 as expected the contribution δettot decl to change in total regional evapotranspiration ettot due to the drying of wetland area itself was negative i e a decrease across all study sites fig 5b this is because the previously relatively high rate of evaporation from the open wetland water surface ew had shifted to a considerably lower rate of evapotranspiration from dry land etb for the remaining smaller water covered area aw post the climate driven change in evaporation rate δew was positive overall i e increase due to warming but very small less than 2 03 mm yr at any site overall total regional evapotranspiration change δettot was dominated by the change δetb over the hydrological basin draining into each wetland rather than by the mostly much smaller changes in water surface evaporation rate and area decline of the wetland itself fig 5b among the various components of the et change the other etb components had a lower range than the δetb interval this was especially evident on comparing the δetw and δettot decl values the basin change dominance over areal changes in the wetlands themselves was also reflected in the relative climate and non climate contributions δrb clim δrb non clim to total change in runoff δrb from each basin to the associated water receiving wetland fig 6 the contributions of the total runoff change δrb and the dominant non climate driven δrb non clim change were overall negative i e runoff decreases in all basins with δrb non clim in turn being driven by the predominant non climate evapotranspiration increases δetb non clim in all basins in addition the climate driven contributions δrb clim to total runoff change were mostly negative mainly due to associated p decrease with the namak and maharloo bakhtegan basins as exceptions runoff changes due to climate change in the maharloo bakhtegan and namak wetland basin were positive unlike in the other four basins based on the concepts described in section 3 2 fig 2 in the absence of human interventions and due to the reduction in etb clim and the similarity of these basins in the second interval point c in fig 2 to the initial state of the basin point a changes such as compatibility of basin land cover conditions with the new situation would eventually lead to increases in runoff however non climatic changes agricultural and urban growth neutralized these positive changes leading to a runoff reduction in most basins in all cases except the gorgan basin non climate driven contributions δrb non clim were more dominant than climate driven contributions δrb clim in determining total runoff change the complementary budyko based analysis thus supported the indications in the comparative correlation analysis that the observed wetland declines in iran are largely driven by human lulc changes with smaller contributions from climate change 5 conclusions distinguishing and quantifying the causes of wetland decline is essential for fundamental understanding of wetland change dynamics and effective wetland maintenance and restoration the methodology developed in this study comprising a data driven combination of comparative change correlation analysis and extended budyko based analysis was tested on six wetlands iran to assess whether it could explain large recent declines in wetland area and associated hydrological changes at these sites results from the comparative change correlation analysis and extended budyko based analysis both indicated that non climate variables particularly human lulc changes in cropland and urban area were the most important drivers of the observed wetland decline in iran followed by climate changes temperature and precipitation overall this study revealed the important role of human driven landscape development changes in addition to overarching climate change for wetland change dynamics in iran these combined change drivers have led to severe reductions in water inflow runoff from basins to the wetlands the role of climate change should not be ignored or underestimated but in the case of iran it has been a weaker influencing factor to date than non climatic lulc changes climate change can be expected to have a stronger influence in a future drier climate in iran especially since human driven lulc changes have left iranian wetlands vulnerable to additional climate induced change the combined change correlation and extended budyko based methodology developed in this study should be tested for its applicability in distinguishing wetland decline drivers in other regions around the world by consedring the developed method assumed that the interaction between non climatic changes and changes in climatic conditions are locally independent of each other supplementary

7892,study region six wetland sites around iran gavkhoni and hur al azim wetlands gorgan bay and namak urmia and maharloo bakhtegan lakes and their associated hydrological basins study focus the aim was to distinguish the contributions of climatic and non climatic changes including land use land cover lulc to areal decline in six iranian wetlands this was done using data driven quantification methodology that combined comparative change correlation and budyko based analyses of evapotranspiration etb and runoff rb changes in the hydrological basin of each wetland extended to consider explicitly climate driven change in evaporation rate ew from the wetland area and the shift from previous ew to etb caused by the wetland decline itself new hydrological insights for the region comparative correlation analysis revealed an overall stronger correlation of wetland decline with lulc changes mainly cropland urban land than with changes in temperature t or precipitation p across all wetland sites the extended budyko based analysis revealed that the predominant cause of wetland decline across all sites was increased etb with related decrease in rb from basin to wetland whereas changes in ew and in wetland decline shifting ew to etb had only a weak influence in line with the correlation analysis results non climatic drivers were revealed as causing etb increases and rb decreases leading to wetland decline to a greater degree than climate change t p graphical abstract ga1 keywords wetland decline climate change land use cover change evapotranspiration runoff iran 1

2021 kåresdotter et al 2021 distinguishing main driver effect relationships for wetland decline is essential for fundamental understanding and for effective protection and rehabilitation of wetlands bateman et al 2013 from a climate change perspective changes in precipitation and temperature can both contribute to changing actual evapotranspiration and runoff precipitation changes the total water inflow to a hydrological basin which is further partitioned between the runoff and evapotranspiration outflows from the basin with temperature changes directly influencing the latter overall precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are related at basin level through the overarching basin wise water balance including possible storage change within the basin moshir panahi et al 2020 evapotranspiration and runoff at basin level can also be affected by non climate drivers such as lulc changes associated lulc changes can then primarily affect evapotranspiration and also runoff through the basin wise water balance for any given precipitation level these combined relationships require quantification methodology for assessing and distinguishing the contributions of different change drivers to observed changes in wetland area the aim of this study was to distinguish climatic and non climatic drivers of wetland decline using data driven quantification methodology the methodology developed combined components of comparative change correlation analysis with budyko based distinction of climatic and non climatic drivers of evapotranspiration etb and related runoff rb changes over the hydrological basin of each wetland site the budyko based analysis was extended to consider changes in evaporation ew from the wetland water surface and a feedback component of some part of previous ew being shifted to etb by the wetland decline itself the main novelty of the study is this methodological combination including the ew etb shift component which was tested on observational data for six wetland sites in iran undergoing areal decline madani 2014 madani et al 2016 these wetland sites were selected based on availability of the necessary data for analysis and method testing moshir panahi et al 2020 in combination with wetland change effects being particularly severe in arid semi arid regions such as iran with inherent water shortages shadeed 2013 iran is located in south west asia and more than 70 of its territory has a semi dry to dry climate although the country as a whole also includes other climate types moshir panahi et al 2021 raziei and pereira 2013 iran has undergone major hydrological changes in recent years moshir panahi et al 2020 ashraf et al 2021 and a major effect of this massive shift is a reduction in wetland area across iran madani 2014 madani et al 2016 given the hydrological shift in iran investigating factors causing the reduction in wetland areas is a topic of interest to researchers and politicians in iran and in other parts of the world facing similar hydrological changes studies have been conducted to identify why wetlands are drying up huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a 2018b the most significant case of wetland drying in iran is lake urmia the largest lake in the country and the second largest saline lake in the world which has been the subject of many hydrological studies parsinejad et al 2022 most of this research attention is due to a dramatic decline in the area of this lake over the past decade pouladi et al 2022 which has led to the allocation of special funding for research on lake restoration parsinejad et al 2022 various methods have been applied by researchers to identify the causes of the decline in lake urmia area khazaei et al 2019 chaudhari et al 2018 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 fathian et al 2016 these include investigating trends in surface flow in the basin and the relationship with climatic variables and changes bagheri et al 2019 applying the water balance approach naboureh et al 2021 and using satellite images to study trends in agricultural development and investigate climate change trends at the same time most previous studies on lake urmia basin have emphasized the prominent role of human factors parsinejad et al 2022 pouladi et al 2021 research to determine the role of human drivers in reducing lake area can be divided into two general categories based on the approach used direct investigations of human factors and water resources management processes and indirect investigations of the impact of human factors through direct investigation of changes in climate variables and their weak contribution to lake area change parsinejad et al 2022 other basins in iran containing wetlands at the basin outlet have also been studied e g gavkhouni wetland basin in the center of iran long term studies over 50 years investigating changes in climatic and human variables in gavkhouni wetland have found almost normal conditions in the early part of the study period but severe hydrological drought caused by human activities in recent decades leading to a significant reduction in surface flow in this basin abou zaki et al 2020 azadi et al 2022 in the maharloo bakhtegan lake basin spatiotemporal investigations of climatic variables and of meteorological and hydrological drought have revealed only significant trends in hydrological drought torabi haghighi et al 2020 the main reason for hydrological changes in that basin is expansion of human activities especially irrigated area and associated crop production djamali et al 2009 hur al azim wetland downstream in the karkheh basin in southwestern iran is known as iran s food basket ahmad and giordano 2010 studies using swat modeling fereidoon and koch 2018 and data driven modeling kamali et al 2017 davtalab et al 2017 to assess basin conditions have reported that climate change and changes in drought have had minor effects on the runoff discharged from this basin lake namak basin in northern iran where most of the iranian population is concentrated has also undergone numerous changes in terms of hydrology in this basin harvesting of water especially groundwater due to the expansion of human activities has been identified as a stronger factor than climate change in reducing surface flow into lake namak sheikh et al 2020 emadi et al 2022 gorgan bay basin in northern iran has undergone massive deforestation fazel rastgar 2020 maleki et al 2020 a study by kousali et al 2022 investigated changes in surface inflow to gorgan bay wetland using a non stationary approach in addition to the effects of changes in the upstream basin the relationship between gorgan gulf and the caspian sea has been identified as an effective factor in changes in wetland area gharibreza et al 2018 while many studies on wetland decline have been performed to date there has been no comprehensive study using a consistent approach to investigate and compare factors causing the reduction in wetland area in iran therefore in the present study methodology was developed and applied consistently to the six different iranian wetland sites referred to above i e lake urmia wetland pouladi et al 2020 gavkhoni wetland gohari et al 2013 gorgan bay wetland kakroodi et al 2012 gharibreza et al 2018 hur al azim wetland davtalab et al 2014 lake namak wetland samani et al 2021 and lake maharloo bakhtegan wetland djamali et al 2009 direct observational data on wetland decline were used for the analysis in all cases together with related climate hydrological and lulc data applying the methodology to these six wetlands located in different parts of iran with different climatic and human characteristics and different regimes allowed simultaneous testing of the methodology and comparison of the results and assessment of similarities and differences between the cases 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites fig 1 shows the location of the six wetland sites used for method evaluation and testing in this study and other main basins in iran hydrometric and synoptic stations at the six wetland sites and cities population less or more than 300 000 located in each wetland basin gavkhoni wetland is located at the end of the river zayandehrod which drains into gavkhoni basin basin 42 in fig 1 mean annual temperature in the basin is 15 8 c and mean annual precipitation is 259 mm yr gavkhoni basin includes 69 cities the most important of which is isfahan population 1 6 million which lies along the zayandeh rud river upstream of gavkhouni wetland gorgan bay wetland is located downstream in the gorgan basin part of basins 16 15 in northern iran where mean annual temperature is 15 4 c and mean annual precipitation is 307 mm yr the water level in gorgan bay wetland is determined by basin runoff and by flow through a natural canal towards the caspian sea in the north east fig 1 there are 29 cities in this basin of which gorgan and gonbad e kavus have a population of 350 000 and 200 000 respectively both these cities are located along the rivers leading to gorgan bay hur al azim wetland is located in south west iran downstream in basin 22 which has mean annual temperature of 17 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 388 mm yr the wetland is fed by surrounding rivers there are 58 cities in this basin with the three largest cities kermanshah khorramabad and malayer having a population of around 1 million 400 000 and 200 000 respectively the basin of this wetland is transboundary although this study just focused on the iranian part lake namak is located downstream of a basin with same name basin 41 in central iran with mean annual temperature of 15 1 c and mean annual precipitation of 268 mm yr this basin has the largest resident population of all basins in iran accounting for 28 of the iranian population and it includes 169 cities the most important of these cities are tehran 8 9 million karaj 1 9 million qom 1 2 million hamedan 600 000 arak 550 000 and qazvin 450 000 lake urmia in the north west is the best known case of dramatic lake wetland shrinkage in iran khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 dehghanipour et al 2020 all runoff generated in lake urmia basin basin 30 where mean annual temperature is 11 9 c and annual precipitation is 377 mm yr enters lake urmia in total this basin includes 57 cities with the two main cities tabriz and urmia having a population of 1 6 and 1 million respectively urmia is located near the lake approximately 15 km lakes maharloo bakhtegan are located in central iran downstream in the maharloo bakhtegan basin basin 43 which has mean annual temperature of 17 6 c and mean annual precipitation of 332 mm yr there are 19 cities in the basin of which shiraz with a population of 1 6 million is the largest further characteristics of the six wetlands are presented in table s1 in supplementary material sm 2 2 hydro climate data we considered here the water outflow by runoff rb from the hydrological basin land area ab that feeds water into each associated water covered lake wetland with area aw the latter is not included in ab but in total regional area atot ab aw which encompasses both the basin land and the wetland area for evaluation of rb measured stream water discharge divided by associated hydrological basin land area ab we used rb data time series for the period 1986 2016 compiled by moshir panahi et al 2020 for 30 major basins in iran based on discharge measurements at 213 official hydrometric stations with 372 continuous monthly data observations reported by the iranian ministry of energy ime the hydrometric stations used for calculating basin runoff were the last hydrometric station in each wetland after which all flow goes to the wetland none of these stations was located in the vicinity of a dam pumping station or water regulation structure that could alter the natural stream flow we also considered precipitation p as the main water input flux to each basin and wetland and temperature t as an additional main climate variable for the period 1986 2016 based on measured data at 103 synoptic meteorological stations reported by the iranian meteorological organization irmo these data comprised spatial distributions of p and t values for each study area calculated using the kriging method potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated for each site using the langbein formula pet 325 21 t 0 9 t2 arora 2002 with t being mean annual temperature in c consistent basin evapotranspiration etb time series as the main water outflow from each basin were obtained from panahi et al 2020 etb was calculated from basin scale water balance for each study site as etb p rb ds where ds is annual water storage change as officially reported based on measured data from ime 2 3 wetland area data the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 was used to estimate time series of water covered area for the six study wetlands this freely available dataset contains 30 m resolution class images over 35 years 1984 2018 produced by unsupervised classification based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the hue saturation value hsv of multi spectral satellite images from landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli the gswd provides information about surface water occurrence and recurrence over the earth s continental land area pekel et al 2016 borja et al 2020 the european commission s joint research centre jrc hosts this dataset and keeps it up to date from this dataset we extracted all relevant observations of surface water extent for our six wetland study sites from the google earth engine at monthly intervals with some occasional gaps in the series because the data are not reported continuously at given time intervals 2 4 land use land cover lulc data to assess lulc changes in the hydrological basins of the six wetlands we used land cover data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci land cover dataset lamarche et al 2017 this dataset is generated from global daily reflectance measurements 1992 2018 acquired from multiple earth observation systems including a medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris 2003 2012 advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr 1992 1999 satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt 1999 2013 and proba vegetation proba v 2014 2015 kganyago and shikwambana 2019 the dataset resolution is 300 m and the data cover the 37 classes in the united nations land cover classification system un lcss over a 23 year period 1992 2016 in this study we aggregated the 37 land cover classes to seven main classes by coding in arcmap defourny et al 2017 these final land cover classes are presented in table s2 in sm 3 methodology the developed data driven method in this study effectively distinguishes between possible climate and non climate drivers of observed wetland decline using two complementary approaches 1 comparative correlation analysis of climate p t and lulc variable relationships with observed wetland decline and 2 budyko based analysis of climate and non climate driven changes in etb and rb moreover this is followed by an extensive analysis to assess the total hydrological change of the wetland basins although climate change may lead to changes in non climatic drivers e g through lulc being affected by climatic changes noszczyk 2019 dale et al 2011 in this study they were assumed to be independent of each other such independence was also assumed in studies by zhang et al 2020 and xue et al 2021 3 1 comparative correlation analysis comparative correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationships of climate and lulc variables with wetland area first trend analysis was performed for the two climate variables t p using the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 as done in other studies of hydrological trends khazaei et al 2019 their respective correlations with wetland area were then examined following that areal changes in the six lulc classes and their correlation with wetland area were explored the correlations between variations in wetland area and possible climate and lulc change drivers were assessed using linear regression with pearson s correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 as correlation direction and strength indicator respectively the comparison considered wetland area regression with the climate variables p and t and with different lulc classes cropland forest grass shrub sparsely vegetated urban land the results of this comparative analysis indicated which of the climate and landscape variables if any were more strongly correlated with observed wetland area variation and decline and can thereby be important explanatory drivers 3 2 budyko based analysis of the hydrological basin of each wetland budyko based analysis was used to distinguish climate and non climate drivers of wetland decline with the latter e g representing relevant lulc variables as identified in the comparative correlation analysis independently of the correlation based results the budyko based analysis was applied to identify potential climate and non climate drivers of landscape hydrological changes in etb and rb within each hydrological basin i e over the basin land area etb the budyko space diagram fig 2 has been widely used in previous studies to separate climate and non climate largely directly human driven hydrological changes jaramillo and destouni 2014 gan et al 2020 it considers the long term average water and energy balances over each basin land area ab considering etb p and pet and separates indirect decomposition of rb change into direct non climate mostly human driven and climate drivers wang and hejazi 2011 gan et al 2020 as the basis for the diagram budyko et al 1974 expressed the evaporative ratio etb p over a basin area as 1 et b p pet p tanh p pet 1 exp pet p in the diagram in fig 2 the green curve is determined by eq 1 with the vertical axis representing the ratio etb p i e the average etb outflow from ab relative to the average total p water inflow and the horizontal axis representing energy or water limitation conditions for etb p in terms of the aridity index pet p with value 1 or 1 implying energy or water limitation respectively the dashed black lines show the theoretical energy and water limits of etb pet and etb p respectively for each basin point a in fig 2 represents pre period etb p and pet values located somewhere on a specific budyko curve as described by eq 2 below fu 1981 point b in fig 2 represents the changes in these values due to climate change or non climate drivers such as direct human activity in the basin destouni et al 2013 if the changes in the values are solely due to climate change point b would be located on the same budyko curve as point a the red line and would correspond to point c in fig 2 with the vertical value distance between points c b and a quantifying the change driven solely by climate change if the post period point b is not located on the same budyko curve as point a the value distance between b and a will depend both on climate change and on direct non climate drivers such as human activity changes in the basin e g changes in lulc the vertical value distance between point c with the same aridity index pet p as point b but located on the same budyko curve as point a and point a i e etb p c minus etb p a then quantifies the etb change due to climate change etb p clim while that between point b and point c i e etb p b minus etb p c quantifies the etb change caused by direct human drivers in the basin etb p non clim point b may be located below or above point c on the budyko curve given by the pre change point a using eq 2 the fu equation fu 1981 or a similar equation 2 et b p 1 pet p 1 pet p w 1 w where the index w remains unchanged if only climate conditions change and its possible change is determined by changes in direct human drivers in the basin the value of w for each basin can be calculated by placing the values of other variables eq 2 since their values are known from moshir panahi et al 2020 based on this separation of total basin change etb p into climate and non climate driven parts the associated change in rb is also consistently divided into climate and non climate parts as 3 r b r b c lim r b non c lim 4 r b c lim p et b c lim 5 r b non c lim r b r b c lim 3 3 analysis extension to total hydrological change to analyze total hydrological changes over the study period 1986 2016 the total study period was divided into a pre period part 1986 2000 and a post period part 2001 2016 to calculate changes in hydro climate variables in each basin and enable direct comparison between the six wetland basins the year 2000 was selected as the dividing point of the study period this year has been identified as the point of change in the amount of runoff in iran moshir panahi et al 2020 any change in the water covered area of a wetland from the pre period aw pre to the post period aw post implies a corresponding change in the total evaporation output flow ew from the wetland s surface water area aw for direct comparability of all components of total evapotranspiration of which ew is one ew is normalized as the total regional area atot including both the hydrological basin land area and the area of the wetland which remains constant in time while both the wetland area aw and basin land area ab could change with corresponding shifts from one to the other from the pre to the post period climate related temperature t change can also affect the rate of evaporation ew per unit area of water surface in the water covered wetland area aw post remaining from the pre to post period the decline in wetland area aw implies a corresponding dry land increase in the complementary basin area ab within the total unchanging regional area atot at each study site this basin area ab increase also affects and adds to the climate and non climate driven changes in evapotranspiration etb over ab which in turn alter the runoff rb into the wetland area aw total regional ettot change ettot over the entire regional area atot ab pre aw pre ab post aw post thus includes changes in both the basin land area and the wetland area which can be expressed as destouni et al 2010 6 et tot et tot post et tot pre et b post a b post e w post a w post et b pre a b pre e w pre a w pre a tot this along with the related equations shown below allows ettot and its components to be determined over the basin land area and the wetland area including the change in evaporation ew over the latter based on methodology previously developed and applied to the dramatically shrinking aral sea in central asia by destouni et al 2010 using this methodology we calculated the unknown ew for each wetland area by assuming equilibrium conditions in the pre period between the total inflow of runoff plus precipitation to each wetland area and the outflow of evaporation from the wetland area expressed as 7 e w pre p w pre r b pre a b pre a w pre the last term in eq 7 distributes i e re normalizes for direct comparability the volumetric discharge from rb multiplied by the whole basin area ab pre to the wetland area aw pre over which both ew and pw apply in this equation with the area specific precipitation over the wetland pw being essentially similar to that over the associated hydrological basin i e pw pb p per respective unit area for calculation of ew post we assumed that the change from pre to post period in relative evaporation rate from the wetland δew ew pre is similar to the change in relative evapotranspiration rate from the basin solely due to climate driven change δetb clim eb pre this can be expressed as 8 e w e w pre et b c lim et b pre this assumption can be made since regional climate change affects evaporative rate over both the basin and the wetland area while a possible change component in etb rate due to non climate drivers e g land use change that only prevail in the basin landscape should not affect the evaporation rate ew from just the free water surface of the wetland thereby ew post over the wetland area aw post in the post change period can consistently be expressed as 9 e w post e w pre 1 et b c lim et b pre with etb applying over the changing basin area we can further express the total regional evapotranspiration ettot over the constant total regional area atot as 10a et tot pre et b pre a b pre e w pre a w pre a tot 10b et tot post et b post a b post e w post a w post a tot moreover to distinguish climate and non climate driver contributions to change in etb δetb clim and δetb non clim respectively we can state that 11 et b post et b pre et b c lim et b non c lim where δetb clim and δetb non clim are calculated from complementary budyko based analysis as outlined in section 3 2 finally the change contribution denoted δettot decl to total regional ettot over atot due to the wetland area decline itself with associated conversion of water covered aw to dry basin land ab area cannot simply be assigned to either climate or non climate drivers as it is driven by a mixture of both therefore estimation of δettot decl is considered separately as an additional mixed type of et change δettot decl occurring over the total regional area atot expressed as 12 et tot decl et b post e w pre a b post a b pre a tot 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in hydroclimate variables and wetland area the long term average values of climate and hydrological variables and changes in these between the pre and post period in each wetland basin were presented in table 1 change values are also presented together with the range of fluctuation resulting from standard deviation from the relevant variable in the first and second sub periods fig s1 in sm showed average long term values in the first and second sub periods along with the standard deviation change value and range of fluctuation for each variable in all cases the change in p the main input water flow was negative decrease over the study period the greatest decrease in p was seen in the hur al azim wetland basin 51 7 44 1 mm yr and the maharloo bakhtegan lake basin 49 5 34 4 mm yr while the smallest p decrease was seen in the gavkhoni wetland basin 6 5 15 1 mm yr t has increased in all basins between the sub periods this is implying warmer conditions in the post period 2001 2016 compared to the pre period 1986 2000 four of the wetland basins gavkhoni gorgan namak urmia had temperature increases greater than 0 6 ºc while the t increase in the maharloo bakhtegan and hur al azim wetland basins was 0 53 and 0 32 ºc respectively for p and t time series see fig s2 in sm as pet is a function of t it also increased in all basins in all cases the increase in t exceeded the estimated global increase in wetland surface water temperature of 0 34 c per decade woolway et al 2020 the change in rb outflow from each basin to the associated wetland was negative decrease in all cases the greatest decrease in rb was seen for the lake urmia basin 69 3 43 72 mm yr and the smallest for the lake namak basin 9 7 6 60 mm yr table 1 the change in etb was positive increase in four wetland basins lake urmia 42 0 8 5 mm yr lake namak 19 4 7 9 mm yr gavkhoni wetland 5 6 11 7 mm yr and gorgan bay 1 0 26 4 mm yr the other two basins exhibited a decrease in etb hur al azim wetland 11 3 60 9 mm yr maharloo bakhtegan basin 18 1 12 1 mm yr the positive changes in etb in the gavkhouni gorgan namak and urmia basins where the changes in precipitation main input water flux to the system were negative indicate an abnormal relationship between the components of the water balance equation in a natural system the amount of evapotranspiration can be expected to decrease with decreasing precipitation and in the hur al azim and maharloo bakhtegan basins the etb changes and the precipitation changes were both negative however comparison of the magnitude of change in these hydro climate variables in the two basins revealed differences in the rate of change calculated for all variables by dividing measured change by period length as shown in table s3 in sm the rate of precipitation change was found to be 4 7 fold the etb change in the hur al azim basin and 2 7 fold the etb change in the maharloo bakhtegan basin i e there was no consistent relationship between changes in p and etb a more detailed study of the reason for this as regards both types of etb change increase decrease was performed to determine the effects of precipitation climate changes see section 4 3 comparing the rate of change of the hydro climatic variables table s3 indicated runoff and precipitation have the highest average rate of change respectively the main water outflow from basin to wetland rb reflects the hydrological response of a basin to all change drivers within that basin dey and mishra 2017 jarsjö et al 2012 net positive increase or negative decrease changes in rb also increase or decrease the recipient wetland area time series of annual and seven year moving average values of rb and wetland area revealed short term and longer term variations fig 3 in all wetland basins rb displayed relatively large annual fluctuations while its seven year moving average showed a steady downward trend as expected wetland area responded accordingly to both types of variation in rb as seen for rb at all wetland sites an overall declining trend was also seen for wetland area with no apparent recovery to previous wetter average conditions fig 3 lake urmia fig 3e has attracted much attention in recent years from researchers politicians the media and the public due to its extensive shrinkage khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 nikraftar et al 2021 although other iranian wetlands had also shown dramatic declines fig 3a d f massive reductions in area have taken place in gavkhoni wetland fig 3a and lake namak fig 3d with their area approaching zero in the past few years over the same period the hur al azim wetland fig 3c and maharloo bakhtegan lakes fig 3f have lost more than half their area only gorgan bay fig 3b has experienced a smaller areal reduction in the period possibly due to its canal connection to the caspian sea ranjbar and zaker 2018 4 2 comparative correlation analysis the correlation results for mean annual t and p versus wetland area were shown in table 2 last two rows together with the results of trend change analysis for associated scatter plots see figs s3 and s4 in sm the pearson s r values for the correlation between t and wetland area ranged from 0 57 to 0 12 indicating an inverse negative correlation in all cases this was consistent with the common expectation that increasing t will drive some degree of wetland decline wang et al 2018 also as expected p was positively correlated with wetland area i e decreased p gave some degree of decline in wetland area except in the case of lake urmia basin which exhibited a negative correlation r 0 03 table 2 which might mean weak climate role precipitation change in urmia lake decline overall however the correlations of p and t with wetland area decline were rather weak low r2 table 2 even though t exhibited a significant confidence level γ 0 95 increasing trend in five basins gavkhoni gorgan namak urmia maharloo bakhtegan the only exception the hur al azim basin showed no significant trend γ 0 95 in either t or p table 2 as expected from the overall insignificant γ 0 95 p trends wetland area correlations with t emerge as mostly somewhat stronger than those with p except for the maharloo bakhtegan basin the very weak correlations of both t and p with lake urmia area likely reflected particularly dominant non climate and mainly human drivers of wetland decline which was consistent with previous findings for this basin khazaei et al 2019 naboureh et al 2021 as changes in lulc could also affect landscape hydrology destouni et al 2013 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a 2018b trang et al 2017 we investigated correlations of lulc with wetland decline using esa cci data for each wetland site reclassified to seven main lulc classes based on chen et al 2019 see table s2 in sm the seventh class no data was omitted from the analysis with cumulative relative change in the six remaining lulc classes calculated for each wetland site correlations between these relative lulc changes and wetland area decline were further investigated using monthly gswd data on wetland area pekel et al 2016 rather than data on the water class in the esa cci dataset because gswd has finer resolution at monthly time scale and longer periods of wetland area estimation cumulative change relative to the initial area values for the main lulc classes see table s2 in sm were shown in fig 4 for direct comparability the first year with lulc data 1992 was used as the starting year for calculation of cumulative change in wetland area fig s5 in sm a common feature of all wetland basins was a high increase in urban land area which in all cases exceeded 140 fig 4 the highest growth in urban land occurred in lake urmia basin 185 and lake namak basin 184 and the lowest in maharloo bakhtegan lake basin 147 and hur al azim basin 140 this urban growth consistent with reported increases in urban population and residential area in iran along with expansion of infrastructure and industrial areas mao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 mansour et al 2020 grassland area change varied from 6 to 6 in five of the basins fig 4 the gavkhoni basin was an exception exhibiting sharp growth and then stabilization at around 75 fig 4a for shrub land the range of variation was 1 3 5 in all cases except maharloo bakhtegan lake basin where there was a sharp increase around 2008 and then stabilization at almost 73 fig 4f cropland mainly related to agricultural activities showed increases 5 12 in all cases except lake namak basin which had a decrease of 24 fig 4d in all six basins sparsely vegetated land mostly bare soil exhibited a decrease ranging from 1 to 26 with the greatest decrease in lake urmia basin and the least in gorgan bay basin fig 4 forest area change ranged from 9 4 in all cases except gorgan bay basin where it was 16 fig 4b due to massive deforestation in gorgan province fazel rastgar 2020 maleki et al 2020 with mostly conversion to cropland wetland area showed a declining trend in all cases as previously shown in fig 3 to 47 in the least affected case gorgan bay and close to 100 almost complete wetland disappearance in the worst affected basins gavkhoni wetland and lake namak the r and r2 values for the correlations of wetland area decline with lulc changes are presented in table 3 changes decrease increase in one lulc class leads to changes in other lulc classes but the relationship is not necessarily linear verburg and veldkamp 2001 noszczyk 2019 table3 showed the correlation between changes in wetland area and the six lulc classes correlations between lulc classes were presented in table s4 in sm there were consistently high negative correlations between wetland area and cropland and urban land for all wetland sites with average pearson s r values of 0 77 and 0 76 and r2 values of 0 62 and 0 60 respectively change in sparsely vegetated land also showed a relatively high correlation with wetland area decline in all cases r 0 59 r2 0 45 on average grassland was negatively correlated with wetland area at all sites except urmia while gavkhoni was the only site with a negative correlation between wetland area and forest land r 0 42 overall increasing cropland area emerged as a likely primary driver of wetland decline table 3 confirming reports by wine and laronne 2020 of a global pattern of decreasing lake area associated with increasing agricultural area in endorheic basins overall the correlations of lulc variables with wetland decline were moderate to strong with the strongest values found for cropland and urban area in agreement with previous findings mao et al 2018 wine and laronne 2020 the correlations of the climate variables p t with wetland decline were considerably weaker than those of most lulc variables and particularly the rather strong correlations found for cropland and urban land table 2 3 the changes in cropland and urban land are directly human driven for food production by expanding agricultural area and for urban residential purposes housing and infrastructure mansour et al 2020 mao et al 2019 wang et al 2015 urban development can lead to hydrological changes in an area by creating and expanding the water supply and distribution system wastewater disposal system and transmission structures rodrigues et al 2019 oudin et al 2018 the effects are intensified when urban development is beyond the ecological capacity of an area regardless of the ecological capacity of the region as cities grow increasing water demand and withdrawal can be expected and this process will intensify and become more complex over time li et al 2018 a clear example of this can be seen in the expansion of cities around the six iranian wetlands studied here fig 1 the high coefficient of determination for wetland declines versus cropland and urban area expansion r2 0 62 for cropland r2 0 6 for urban land compared with that for the main climate variables r2 0 08 for p r2 0 17 for t indicated a more dominant role of these two lulc variables than that of the climate variables in the rb reduction with associated eb increase component that drove the wetland decline at the six study sites fig 3 cropland and urban land expansion the two lulc types with the highest average correlation with decline in wetland area occurs by reducing replacing other lulc classes a review of the correlation coefficients between cropland urban land and other lulc classes table s4 showed that expansion of cropland and also expansion of urban land in all basins except gorgan were mainly associated with a change in the sparse lulc class however some changes were seen in other lulc classes the gorgan bay basin initially had a high density of forest coverage and cropland and urban land expansion in that basin occurred by massive deforestation with the cropland lulc having the highest possible inverse correlation coefficient 1 with forest cover high intensity of deforestation in this area has been reported by raiesi and beheshti 2022 an important point not addressed in previous investigations of lulc changes was the effect on these of climate change perhaps because the relationship between climate and lulc and changes in these is complex noszczyk 2019 dale 2011 in the natural environment lulc is primarily a function of climate conditions and area specification however the rapid rate of expansion of the cropland and urban land lulc classes both created by direct human intervention at the expense of other lulc classes will result in future climate change having weaker effects on lulc changes in the wetland basins than changes due to human interventions this is in line with the independent confirmation of the assumption of climatic and non climatic changes in section 3 4 3 extended budyko based analysis the complementary extended budyko based distinguishes climate and non climate drivers of the changes in the main outflows from each basin etb rb wetland surface evaporation ew and total regional evapotranspiration ettot including the change contribution to the latter from the wetland decline itself δettot decl fig 5 showed the climate and non climate driven contributions to change in average etb between the two sub periods fig 5a and corresponding contributions to total regional change in ettot from total etb change over the original basin area ew change over the remaining post change wetland area and δettot decl due to the dried area part of the original wetland in addition to the mean change value the range of fluctuation in change values was shown in fig 5 it was used to calculate the maximum and minimum values of the variables used with standard deviation in each of the sub periods studied in this way the range of change values and its components were calculated the changes in basin evapotranspiration δetb were in the form of increases in the lake urmia 42 0 8 5 mm yr lake namak 19 4 7 9 mm yr gavkhoni wetland 5 6 11 7 mm yr and gorgan bay 1 0 26 4 mm yr basins with decreases only in the hur al azim 11 3 60 9 mm yr and maharloo bakhtegan lake 18 1 12 1 mm yr basins fig 5a these values were also shown in table 1 based on the mean difference between the two sub periods intervals the climate driven contributions δetb clim were mostly decreases ranging from 8 to 52 1 mm yr except in gavkhoni 2 2 mm yr the predominant climate driven δetb clim decreases thus reflected the decreases in p meaning that less p input water was available for feeding etb rather than effects of increased t i e warming which would instead drive increased etb the only exception was the gavkhoni basin with a small climate driven increase contribution δetb clim reflecting the finding that this basin had by far the smallest decrease in p of only 6 5 mm yr table 1 in contrast all non climate driven contributions δetb non clim were positive i e increases in all basins fig 5a this indicated mainly increased contributions to total etb from the human driven changes in lulc particularly the cropland and urban area increases which replaced other lulc classes within the basins and were most strongly correlated with wetland decline at the different study sites table 3 as expected the contribution δettot decl to change in total regional evapotranspiration ettot due to the drying of wetland area itself was negative i e a decrease across all study sites fig 5b this is because the previously relatively high rate of evaporation from the open wetland water surface ew had shifted to a considerably lower rate of evapotranspiration from dry land etb for the remaining smaller water covered area aw post the climate driven change in evaporation rate δew was positive overall i e increase due to warming but very small less than 2 03 mm yr at any site overall total regional evapotranspiration change δettot was dominated by the change δetb over the hydrological basin draining into each wetland rather than by the mostly much smaller changes in water surface evaporation rate and area decline of the wetland itself fig 5b among the various components of the et change the other etb components had a lower range than the δetb interval this was especially evident on comparing the δetw and δettot decl values the basin change dominance over areal changes in the wetlands themselves was also reflected in the relative climate and non climate contributions δrb clim δrb non clim to total change in runoff δrb from each basin to the associated water receiving wetland fig 6 the contributions of the total runoff change δrb and the dominant non climate driven δrb non clim change were overall negative i e runoff decreases in all basins with δrb non clim in turn being driven by the predominant non climate evapotranspiration increases δetb non clim in all basins in addition the climate driven contributions δrb clim to total runoff change were mostly negative mainly due to associated p decrease with the namak and maharloo bakhtegan basins as exceptions runoff changes due to climate change in the maharloo bakhtegan and namak wetland basin were positive unlike in the other four basins based on the concepts described in section 3 2 fig 2 in the absence of human interventions and due to the reduction in etb clim and the similarity of these basins in the second interval point c in fig 2 to the initial state of the basin point a changes such as compatibility of basin land cover conditions with the new situation would eventually lead to increases in runoff however non climatic changes agricultural and urban growth neutralized these positive changes leading to a runoff reduction in most basins in all cases except the gorgan basin non climate driven contributions δrb non clim were more dominant than climate driven contributions δrb clim in determining total runoff change the complementary budyko based analysis thus supported the indications in the comparative correlation analysis that the observed wetland declines in iran are largely driven by human lulc changes with smaller contributions from climate change 5 conclusions distinguishing and quantifying the causes of wetland decline is essential for fundamental understanding of wetland change dynamics and effective wetland maintenance and restoration the methodology developed in this study comprising a data driven combination of comparative change correlation analysis and extended budyko based analysis was tested on six wetlands iran to assess whether it could explain large recent declines in wetland area and associated hydrological changes at these sites results from the comparative change correlation analysis and extended budyko based analysis both indicated that non climate variables particularly human lulc changes in cropland and urban area were the most important drivers of the observed wetland decline in iran followed by climate changes temperature and precipitation overall this study revealed the important role of human driven landscape development changes in addition to overarching climate change for wetland change dynamics in iran these combined change drivers have led to severe reductions in water inflow runoff from basins to the wetlands the role of climate change should not be ignored or underestimated but in the case of iran it has been a weaker influencing factor to date than non climatic lulc changes climate change can be expected to have a stronger influence in a future drier climate in iran especially since human driven lulc changes have left iranian wetlands vulnerable to additional climate induced change the combined change correlation and extended budyko based methodology developed in this study should be tested for its applicability in distinguishing wetland decline drivers in other regions around the world by consedring the developed method assumed that the interaction between non climatic changes and changes in climatic conditions are locally independent of each other supplementary

7893,study region tonle sap lake tsl basin in cambodia study focus the development and application of hydrological models for data sparse basins are hindered by the limited hydro meteorological data although gridded meteorological products are alternatively considered in many studies the validation of the products with limited point observations overlooks the original spatiotemporal characteristics thus leading to a selection of datasets with high uncertainty here we evaluated seven gridded meteorological datasets of rainfall and air temperature covering the data sparse tonle sap lake basin by employing the statistical approach based on the bilinear interpolation method and hydrological approach using the swat model which ensures the reliable estimates of streamflow and evapotranspiration new hydrological insights for the region the results of the statistical approach indicate that aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg based precipitation and cpc and sa obs based air temperature performed comparably well r 0 75 with the gauged data however era5 based streamflow performed relatively poor while swat driven by aphrodite underestimated satellite based evapotranspiration indicating the underestimation of basin wide precipitation by aphrodite although trmm and imerg provide more reliable estimation of streamflow and evapotranspiration slightly better performance and a higher spatial resolution of imerg dataset suggest that imerg precipitation is superior for basin wide hydrological modeling and impact assessment these findings showed that statistical comparisons with gauge data and hydrological evaluation of streamflow are not enough to justify the reliability of each gridded dataset graphical abstract ga1 keywords the tonle sap lake

ecosystems in the world uk et al 2018 playing a crucial role in livelihood and sustainable development in cambodia and the lower mekong region shivakoti and bao 2020 at the same time the high productivity and rich biodiversity in the tsl have been maintained through flood pulses which are seasonal inundation during the monsoon floods of the mekong river kummu et al 2014 uk et al 2018 recent studies have revealed that the lake has been confronting various environmental changes for example kallio and kummu 2021 reported that the maximum inundation area of the tsl during the rainy season showed a decreasing trend of 128 km2 per year wang et al 2020 reported an increasing trend of sediment concentration in the lake based on the analysis of satellite images fish catches have also revealed a decline in various fish species over time ngor et al 2018 although these changes could be attributed to multiple driving factors such as the influence from the mekong mainstream and anthropogenic activities inside the lake limited information is available regarding hydro environmental impacts from the tributary basins of the tsl ang and oeurng 2018 kummu et al 2014 this necessitates a comprehensive hydrological assessment of the tsl tributary basins owing to land use change population growth and climate change for environmental conservation of the tsl reliable climate datasets play vital roles in conducting hydro environmental impact assessment through the application of regional hydrological models however due to financial constraints of the kingdom of cambodia the sparse and uneven distribution of rain gauge stations in the tsl basin hinders the development of reliable hydrological models and accurate simulations of the hydrological impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change for example some studies attempted to simulate the daily streamflow exclusively for the tsl basin oeurng et al 2019 and its tributary basins ang and oeurng 2018 heng et al 2020 sao et al 2020 touch et al 2020 using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the limited agreement of simulated and observed streamflow values was shown in these studies and it was mainly attributed to data sparsity and limited available information on the spatio temporal variations of meteorological variables considering the current sparse monitoring network of the meteorological conditions in cambodia particularly over the tsl basin alternative reliable climate datasets are highly necessary furthermore getting ground based data at a good spatial temporal resolution is very challenging in developing countries and the data sometimes cannot be freely accessed by public users due to data sharing policy gauge observations are subject to limitations such as reporting time delays and sparse gauge networks bai and liu 2018 the open accessed or satellite based datasets on the other hand can support the near real time monitoring or forecasting and be merged with the in situ observations to improve the data quality we can find various studies globally that utilize regional and global gridded meteorological datasets to serve as alternative inputs for hydrological model simulations for hydro environmental assessments and water resource management fuka et al 2014 ur rahman et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 in recent years many different gridded rainfall and temperature datasets based on observation satellite measurement or reanalysis have been evaluated for their performance in climate and hydrological studies targeting different river basins tan et al 2021 for instance xu et al 2016a compared water and global change watch forcing data wfd and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite data with ground based precipitation data for flood simulation in the xiangjiang river basin china they found that aphrodite data had a better correlation with gauged precipitation and a relatively high flow prediction accuracy than wfd precipitation data the satellite based precipitation data tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is among the best performing datasets with lower bias from the interpolated rain gauge observations duan et al 2016 similarly satgé et al 2020 evaluated different 23 gridded precipitation datasets and revealed that trmm precipitation data showed relatively better performance for both daily and monthly time step having compared with the gauged dataset amjad et al 2020 found that european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis v5 era5 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg had minor estimation errors and high correlation for daily and monthly timescales analysis another study similarly found that among five satellite precipitation products trmm and imerg showed the best performance when compared with ground based monitored data islam et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that the combination of air temperature and precipitation from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps respectively provided satisfactory performance in streamflow simulation moreover fuka et al 2014 found that for five watersheds representing different hydro climate regimes the hydrological model simulation of river flow driven by the cfsr precipitation and temperature data provided results as good as those obtained using observation based weather data aslam et al 2020 compared the maximum and minimum temperatures over a data scarce transboundary river basin of india and pakistan obtained from the climate prediction center cpc and princeton university global meteorological forcing pgf datasets with the ground based observation they found that cpc had a better performance regarding station based time series analysis ge et al 2019 analyzed the performance of the newly developed meteorological dataset southeast asia observation sa obs in climatological means and surface air temperature trends of the indochina peninsula on a yearly and seasonal basis and sa obs product was found to have good overall agreement with observation and reanalysis datasets despite these studies it is challenging to select one superior product conclusively owing to the peculiar characteristics and uncertainties in each dataset depending on the data generation algorithm used the factors inherent to study regions such as climate and topography and the quality and quantity of the observed data used in developing the datasets fu et al 2016 lauri et al 2014 sun et al 2014 vu et al 2012 worqlul et al 2014 furthermore a limited number of studies have evaluated climate data sources covering the southeast asia region especially for the mekong river basin gunathilake et al 2020 evaluated six different gridded precipitation products and showed that imerg had a good performance in simulating the streamflow in the upper nan river basin northern thailand four different high resolution gridded precipitation datasets were evaluated in the philippines and it was shown that trmm has the least bias errors and most closely resembles the rainfall distribution observed at gauged stations peralta et al 2020 similarly the trmm was found to be the best performing dataset among five different precipitation products in malaysia ayoub et al 2020 over the mekong river basin most of these studies have validated gridded datasets by only focusing on the mainstream of the mekong river basin e g lauri et al 2014 try et al 2022 2020 try et al 2020 validated the river discharges using five different gridded precipitation datasets aphrodite trmm global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap global precipitation climatology center gpcc and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr at four gauging stations along the mainstream of the mekong river in lao pdr and cambodia similarly lauri et al 2014 utilized two temperature datasets cfsr and era interim and five precipitation products trmm 3b42 v6 trmm 3b42 v7 aphrodite cfsr and era interim to evaluate river flow simulation at five gauging stations along the mainstream of the lower mekong river furthermore try et al 2022 employed gpcc precipitation to study on identification of the spatio temporal and fluvial pluvial sources of flood inundation in the lower mekong basin and the river discharges was validated at the kratie gauging station located on the mainstream of mekong river no previous studies have assessed the spatio temporal characteristics and quantitative accuracy of gridded hydro meteorological datasets over the tsl basin hence the performance of individual datasets in hydrological modeling including other water balance components has not been clarified yet the majority of studies reviewed above rarely reported the evaluation of alternative air temperature datasets for hydrological simulations accordingly the assessment of air temperature data or the optimal data combinations e g aphrodite precipitation with cfsr temperature from different alternative climate products should also be considered in the validation schemes tan et al 2021 conventional statistical approaches using simple correlation or error analyses are often not enough to justify the variability and distribution of gridded precipitation data ahmed et al 2019 for further studies bai and liu 2018 suggested that hydrological evaluation of gridded products based only on streamflow simulations could not validate the reliability of gridded climate datasets but other hydrological variables such as evaporation and soil moisture should be considered for more comprehensive evaluation previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 oeurng et al 2019 uk et al 2018 have highlighted the demand for more reliable hydrological assessment over the tsl basin and the importance of identifying the factors that affect environmental and ecological changes in the tsl basin this study aimed to extensively evaluate alternative climate datasets for their reliability in representing spatio temporal characteristics and estimating streamflow in the tsl basin during the past decades using robust statistical and hydrological modeling approaches seven potentially promising gridded precipitation and air temperature datasets for analysis were selected these included aphrodite cfsr trmm imerg era5 sa obs and cpc we presented a comprehensive framework to evaluate their spatio temporal representations and hydrological quantification performances for all the tsl tributary basins where meteorological stations are sparsely located more specifically we firstly compared these gridded products with the observed datasets based on the bilinear interpolation method and examined the suitability of each dataset in estimating the daily streamflow in the eleven tsl tributary basins furthermore we evaluated each climate dataset by comparing satellite based and model derived actual evapotranspiration et in the whole tsl basin which further quantitatively validated the annual and seasonal rainfall amounts this approach enabled us to avoid the selection of hydro meteorological datasets with significant bias and uncertainty e g deficient basin wide rainfall that could affect the accuracy of simulations of sediment erosion and nutrient transport despite parameter optimization which could yield acceptable ranges for streamflow estimation irrespective of the dataset used finally we identified the gridded datasets most reliable for hydrological and environmental impact assessments as well as the projections of future climate change impacts over the tsl basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tsl the largest lake in southeast asia is one of the most important natural resources in cambodia kummu et al 2008 and symbolically called the heart of cambodia covering over 45 approximately 85 850 km2 of the national land surface area and approximately 5 of the total basin area being shared with thailand fig 1 the tonle sap lake basin consists of 11 major tributary basins and is connected to the tonle sap river which flows to the mainstream of the mekong river delta the seasonal flow direction reversal in the tonle sap river and the resultant inundation of the tsl floodplain during the flood season between june and october causes the lake s total surface area and water level to swell from approximately 2600 km2 and 2 m to 12 000 km2 and 10 m arias et al 2014 kummu et al 2014 oeurng et al 2019 respectively this creates a unique aquatic environment and a diverse and productive ecosystem arias et al 2014 kummu et al 2014 sabo et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 estimated that 34 29 1 km3 year of the water volume in the lake originates from the 11 tributary basins approximately 53 5 41 8 km3 year comes from the mekong river and 12 5 10 4 km3 year is from precipitation over the lake surface the tsl basin is covered by alluvial deposits composed of unconsolidated silt sand and gravel overlaying on the older bedrock tsukawaki and lao 1994 the climate in this region is characterized by two monsoon periods high humidity conditions prevail and frequent heavy rains are typically observed during the south west monsoon season from mid may to early october rainy season while the north east monsoon lasts from early november to march dry season bringing drier and cooler air world bank 2011 the tributary basins predominantly consist of gently sloping lowlands with an elevation of less than 100 m above the mean sea level the elevation increases to over 1700 m in the cardamom mountains to the southwest see fig 1 the basin area delineated area a basin boundary representing the contributing area for a gauging station of streamflow see fig s1 and land use area of each tributary basin are summarized in table 1 the total delineated area is 49 52 approximately 41 158 km2 of the total basin area most of the tributary basins seven out of eleven are predominantly forested land 50 while agricultural land is dominant in the mongkol borey baribo dauntri and siem reap tributary basins oeurng et al 2019 a limited number of rainfall and water level gauging stations are located in each tributary basin most monitoring stations are situated in the downstream areas fig 1 while gauges are sparsely located in the upstream areas particularly in the northeastern part of the tsl basin oeurng et al 2019 since a limited number of temperature monitoring stations are available in the tsl basin we used observed temperature data at five stations including three located outside the basin to the east fig 1 the daily observed rainfall and temperature data between 1985 and 2011 in which there is no missing value in these two datasets were used as a benchmark to validate gridded meteorological data 2 2 gridded precipitation and temperature datasets among the available gridded precipitation and temperature datasets we selected six datasets for precipitation and four datasets for air temperature table 2 namely aphrodite cfsr trmm imerg era5 sa obs and cpc considering their fine temporal daily and spatial resolutions 0 1 0 5 and potential applicability in asian basins evaluated in previous studies amjad et al 2020 aslam et al 2020 fuka et al 2014 ge et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 lauri et al 2014 odusanya et al 2018 saha et al 2014 singh and xiaosheng 2019 try et al 2020 vu et al 2012 xu et al 2016b zhang et al 2020a a brief description of each dataset is given in the following sections and summarized in table 2 2 2 1 aphrodite the aphrodite rainfall dataset is primarily created with rainfall data observed via a rain gauge observation network over asia yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite version v1101 covers the period from 1951 to 2007 and its updated version v1901 is available for the period between 1998 and 2015 we used both versions to cover the whole study period between 1985 and 2011 with daily temporal and spatial resolutions of 0 25 0 25 there are a total of 13 rainfall stations in the tsl basin used to create the aphrodite dataset some of which were not used in our study due to inconsistent measurement periods fig s2 the performance of the aphrodite dataset was compared to that of other products in the discharge modeling study for the mekong river basin lauri et al 2014 which indicated that the computed discharge based on aphrodite is similar to the observation data another study for the lower mekong river basin showed that the aphrodite dataset was suitable for rainfall runoff and flood inundation modeling try et al 2018 guan et al 2020 evaluated six different precipitation datasets using four hydrological models to simulate streamflow over the upper yellow river basin china and found that the aphrodite dataset was one of the superior products 2 2 2 cfsr cfsr was developed by the environmental modelling center at the national center for environmental prediction ncep it is a fully coupled atmospheric model representing the interactions among earth s atmosphere oceans land and sea ice systems to provide the best prediction of the state of these coupled domains from 1979 to 2014 saha et al 2014 the cfsr global atmospheric data have a spatial resolution of approximately 0 30 0 30 with daily resolution cfsr version 2 was used in this study in addition the cfsr dataset is commonly used in the swat modeling users group as this dataset provides complete data for several climate variables precipitation air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity with a convenient data format that is compatible with swat model requirements zhang et al 2020a cfsr precipitation was found to reproduce an adequate flow in the yangtze river basin china lu et al 2019 the monthly coefficient of rainfall and air temperature determination was higher than 0 6 and 0 9 respectively compared with the ground based station data additionally the air temperature of cfsr products could be a promising alternative data source to serve as input into the hydrological model for streamflow simulation in the data scarce river basins zhang et al 2020b 2 2 3 trmm trmm is a joint project between the north american space agency nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa to study rainfall over the tropical region the trmm precipitation is estimated from a combination of multiple satellites and rain gauge analyses at a fine spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 the 3b42v7 product was adjusted by monthly rain gauge precipitation data from the gpcc and is superior to the trmm 3b42rt v7 the number of rain gauges used in gpcc data is documented in earlier publications by vu et al 2018 however there is only one station in tsl basin that was used in interpolating the gpcc dataset during the study period the trmm 3b42v7 dataset from 1998 to 2011 with the daily resolution was used in this study trmm 3b42v7 precipitation data were compared with observed rainfall at 342 rain gauges over malaysia tan et al 2015 there was a tendency for trmm 3b42v7 to yield accurate and unbiased rainfall estimations trmm the climate prediction center morphing algorithm cmorph and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap reanalysis were evaluated via a comparison with the rain gauge based data over central vietnam trinh tuan et al 2019 and trmm was found to outperform the other datasets moreover the trmm precipitation was determined to be among the best performing products that gave better streamflow simulation results than the other four gridded datasets over the upper yellow river basin china guan et al 2020 nhi et al 2019 evaluated five gridded rainfall datasets in simulating streamflow and found that trmm was one of the best datasets showing a better match to rain gauge data in simulating the streamflow in the upper dong nai river basin vietnam 2 2 4 imerg following the success of trmm nasa and jaxa jointly launched the gpm observatory satellite on 28 february 2014 to provide more accurate precipitation data with fine spatiotemporal resolution using an algorithm combining information from the gpm satellite constellation from partner nations huffman et al 2020 liu 2016 recently imerg version 6 v06 extended its temporal coverage to the trmm era and provides datasets from june 2000 to the present gpm not only extended trmm s spatial coverage but also carries advanced sensors such as the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and gpm microwave imager gmi which quantify precipitation more accurately particularly for light and solid precipitation huffman et al 2020 like trmm monthly rain gauge precipitation data from the gpcc were used to adjust imerg precipitation furthermore there are three types of imerg products the early run imerg e and late run imerg l are available with a latency of 4 h and 14 h respectively huffman et al 2020 which could serve as a potential data source for flood forecasting and real time disaster management the final run imerg f is available approximately 4 months after observation and it is mainly aimed for research purposes the imerg f v06 dataset from 2001 to 2011 with the daily temporal resolution and spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 was used in this study lu et al 2021 found that imerg f precipitation has a great potential for application to hydroclimatic research and water resources assessment in the complex climatic and topographic conditions western china generally the imerg f shows high accuracy and good performance in hydrological simulations with a high correlation coefficient 0 63 and low relative bias 0 92 when compared with the ground observations wang et al 2017 gunathilake et al 2020 statistically and hydrologically evaluated the capacity of different six satellite based precipitation products in the upper nan river basin northern thailand showing that imerg precipitation demonstrates good performance for future hydrometeorological applications in this region huang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of imerg f during six extremely heavy precipitation events caused by powerful typhoons from 2016 to 2017 and they stated that the imerg f shows good capability in extreme rainfall events i e typhoons rainfall storm applications 2 2 5 era5 era5 is the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and it provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric land and oceanic climate variables from 1979 to the present with a spatial resolution of 31 km 0 25 hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 found that the performance of hydrological modeling based on era5 precipitation is equivalent to that based on the observed rainfall jiao et al 2021 showed that era5 data is in good agreement with the annual and seasonal patterns of observed precipitation in china and have correlation coefficient values ranging from 0 79 to 0 94 era5 temperature data was found to be consistent with the monthly observations and the trend of era5 based temperature and observation data showed a strong linear relationship with the monthly observations zhu et al 2021 2 2 6 sa obs sa obs is an observational gridded dataset for precipitation and temperature in the southeast asia region based on the southeast asian climate assessment dataset saca d project van den besselaar et al 2017 the full dataset is estimated at a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 1981 to 2017 since sa obs is a newly developed daily gridded dataset for southeast asia there are limited studies to evaluate the performance of this dataset the daily precipitation and temperature data were collected from the meteorological institutes of australia indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam there are 1393 precipitation stations including 365 stations with minimum and maximum temperatures and 274 stations with a daily mean temperature van den besselaar et al 2017 however during the creation of sa obs no gauged rainfall data were introduced from the tsl basin or cambodia therefore no data accuracy for this area has been clarified the detailed information on gauged stations used in sa obs data generation can be found in the study by van den besselaar et al 2017 a high correlation was found between station observations and the corresponding grid squares of sa obs van den besselaar et al 2017 while sa obs slightly underestimated high rainfall events singh and xiaosheng 2019 2 2 7 cpc the cpc dataset has been developed by the american national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa using optimal interpolation of quality controlled gauge records of the global telecommunication system gts network fan and van den dool 2008 to provide global gridded daily temperature datasets covering the period from 1979 to the present with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 like sa obs the gauged data was not introduced from the tsl basin for cpc data creation and more information on gauged stations used in interpolating cpc data is provided in the study by vu et al 2018 the daily hydrological evaluation results suggested that the cpc temperature combined with precipitation data is a more accurate option for estimating hydrological performance in the upper mekong river basin dinh et al 2020 a similar or lower performance compared to that of other gridded datasets was observed in the downstream areas owing to their reliability cpc temperature data were used as the reference data to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrology of a transboundary river between bhutan and india zam et al 2021 2 3 performance evaluation of gridded datasets of rainfall and temperature the performance of individual gridded precipitation and temperature products was evaluated by comparing them to gauge based datasets on the annual monthly and daily timescales from 1985 to 2011 for aphrodite era5 cfsr cpc and sa obs and from 1998 or 2001 2011 for trmm and imerg respectively the bilinear interpolation method was used to interpolate the gridded datasets to the 31 rainfall and five temperature ground based station locations based on the distance weighted average of the four nearest grid values several previous studies have applied this grid to point interpolation method to compare gridded products with observation data bao and zhang 2013 bromwich and fogt 2004 ebrahimi et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 meher and das 2019 this simplified method with two dimensional interpolation enables a more accurate comparison than the direct comparison between point observations and gridded data caroletti et al 2019 ud din et al 2008 the accuracy of gridded datasets was quantified using four statistical indicators listed in table s1 i e mean bias error mbe root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and modified index of agreement md mbe is a statistical index to assess the mean difference between two data products interpolated and observed rainfall or temperature and rmse represents the standard deviation of the two datasets the lower absolute values of mbe and rmse indicate the better performance of the gridded dataset r measures the degree of linear correlation between the interpolated and observed datasets md is used as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error which is the modified version of the index of agreement proposed by willmott 1981 to detect additive and proportional differences in the data ahmed et al 2019 pereira et al 2018 willmott 1984 the higher values of r and md closed to one indicate the higher accuracy of gridded products in estimating precipitation and air temperature the equation range and optimal value of each statistical index are presented in table s1 2 4 performance evaluation based on the hydrological model application the comparison of hydro meteorological data at individual locations has a particular limitation in assessing the basin wide applicability of gridded datasets for hydrological simulations mainly if the gauging stations are sparsely distributed within an area like the tsl basin therefore we evaluated the performance of selected gridded datasets in reproducing the streamflow of each tributary basin based on swat model application and the simulated daily streamflow was compared with the observed data furthermore considering the equifinality issue in the hydrological model application under different combinations of gridded datasets and model parameters we compared the simulated and satellite based actual et to confirm the accuracy of each dataset from the perspective of water balance as described in section 2 4 3 2 4 1 hydrological swat model quantitative representation of rainfall and temperature by each gridded dataset was evaluated using the swat model a widely used hydrological model to simulate streamflow sediments and other hydrological variables under diverse environments and scales arnold et al 1998 swat has gained international acceptance as a comprehensive watershed modeling tool gassman et al 2007 and has been applied throughout the world including the united states yuan and forshay 2021 europe bärlund et al 2007 cambodia ang and oeurng 2018 thailand shrestha et al 2018 lao pdr vilaysane et al 2015 vietnam vu et al 2012 china hao et al 2004 india kaur et al 2004 australia sun and cornish 2006 and africa schuol and abbaspour 2006 among many others swat requires topography soil and land use information to account for heterogeneities and divide the greater basin into a group of sub basins which are further subdivided into several hydrological response units hrus each hru is created from a unique combination of land cover slope soil properties and management practices the surface runoff from each hru is simulated based on the scs curve number method usda 1972 with daily rainfall defined at the centroid of the sub basin which is obtained by applying the bilinear interpolation method to the specific daily gridded precipitation dataset instead of the default swat model setting which only uses rainfall data from the gauging station located closest to the centroid of each sub basin arnold et al 1998 the approach using interpolated areal precipitation improved the performance of model calibration compared to the default method of the swat model abbas and xuan 2020 masih et al 2011 more details about swat can be found in the official theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 and the review paper by gassman et al 2007 each dataset used for the swat model setup is summarized in table 3 the topography data required to define flow accumulation stream networks and basin boundaries are based on a 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm land use distribution was obtained from the mekong river commission mrc which developed a land use map based on satellite imagery collected from 1993 to 1999 information on soil types was obtained from a 1 250 000 scale map created by the mrc that contains the required physical properties of each soil type based on the food and agriculture organization united nations educational scientific and cultural organization fao unesco 1988 classification scheme oeurng et al 2019 the daily rainfall and maximum minimum air temperature data were obtained from individual gridded datasets the streamflow in each tributary basin was calculated using rating curves developed by kummu et al 2014 from the observed water levels collected by the department of hydrology and river works ministry of water resources and meteorology of cambodia oeurng et al 2019 2 4 2 model calibration validation and evaluation model calibration was performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 and the performance of each gridded dataset in the hydrological model application was evaluated for the calibration and validation periods swat cup provides several methods for calibration to deal with parameter uncertainty including the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method nkonge et al 2014 wu and chen 2015 which was selected to provide more reasonable daily streamflow simulations at the outlet of each delineated drainage area table 1 and fig s1 considering the availability of continuous discharge data in each tributary basin the model parameters were calibrated with available streamflow data between 1995 and 2002 and simulation results were validated for the period between 2003 and 2011 based on previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 oeurng et al 2019 sao et al 2020 sok et al 2020 vilaysane et al 2015 vu et al 2012 23 parameters were selected and calibrated using the swat cup model table s2 for each gridded precipitation dataset for evaluating model performance in watershed simulations we employed three quantitative metrics i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as shown in table s1 moriasi et al 2007 nse indicates how well the result of a simulation fits the observed time series nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 r2 examines to what extent differences in one variable can be explained by the difference in a second variable in other words r2 assesses how strong the linear relationship is between two variables furthermore the performance ratings suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were applied to evaluate the swat model simulation s integrated performance table s3 2 4 3 evapotranspiration comparison swat determines the actual evapotranspiration et from potential evapotranspiration pet using one of the three built in empirical equations neitsch et al 2011 penman monteith allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 these three methods require different input variables the penmen monteith method requires solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and the priestley taylor method needs solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity considering limited data availability we used the hargreaves method which requires precipitation and air temperature only neitsch et al 2011 once the pet is determined et must be calculated swat estimates total et from four components canopy evaporation transpiration soil evaporation and revap et abiodun et al 2018 swat models the movement of water into overlying unsaturated layers as a function of water demand for et this process has been termed revap to avoid confusion with soil evaporation and transpiration neitsch et al 2011 as swat calculates the revap separately the revap should be added for et calculations abiodun et al 2018 fenta mekonnen et al 2018 more detailed information and a comprehensive outline of et calculations in the swat model can be found in the theoretical manual of neitsch et al 2011 and the studies by abiodun et al 2018 and fenta mekonnen et al 2018 the spatio temporal variation of et was obtained through swat model estimations driven by different precipitation products then we compared this information to satellite based et data for a more comprehensive evaluation of the gridded precipitation datasets for this purpose the swat model was applied to simulate daily et together with streamflow for the whole drainage area of each tributary basin with the parameters previously calibrated for the delineated area of each tributary basin from 2001 to 2011 the simulated et based on different gridded rainfall products was temporally and spatially aggregated to compare with satellite based et i e et from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model at monthly and annual timescales for the whole basin excluding the flooded areas satellite based et has been used to validate the application of hydrological models and assess water balance closure in several studies dash et al 2021 jin and jin 2020 lópez et al 2017 odusanya et al 2018 sirisena et al 2020 wong et al 2021 but the satellite et is rarely used for validating the gridded rainfall products modis et provides the evaporation from global terrestrial surfaces and transpiration from the vegetation canopy mu et al 2011 the algorithm to estimate et from modis data was initially developed by cleugh et al 2007 the modis et algorithms are based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 we used mod16a2 which is available at an 8 day interval and a spatial resolution of 1 km over a period extending from 2000 to 2014 mu et al 2013 compared the modis et with observed et across 46 sites from 2000 to 2006 and found that the average et biases and mean absolute errors between et observations and modis et are 0 11 mm and 0 33 mm respectively similarly kim and hogue 2008 validated modis et at a point scale by comparing modis et with measured et at four monitoring stations from 2001 to 2004 and results showed that at the daily time step modis et show a good correlation r 0 89 and low bias 0 34 mm with measured et the actual gleam et data are estimated as the sum of evaporation and et from three different land surface types i e bare soil short vegetation and vegetation with a tall canopy miralles et al 2011 the priestley and taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 was adopted to estimate evaporation in the gleam et algorithms we used the daily et of the gleam v3 2a dataset spanning 41 years from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the gleam et was validated at 91 in situ sites in the united states and australia between 2011 and 2015 and it was found that the mean correlation coefficient and root mean square difference between gleam and gauge et are 0 78 and 0 71 mm respectively martens et al 2017 the gleam et was also validated in china using in situ measurements at three different timescales the results showed a high average correlation coefficient with in situ observations at all sites on daily r 0 71 monthly r 0 86 and annual r 0 79 time scales yang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of precipitation datasets the results of all statistical indices mbe rmse r and md applied for each station are presented in fig 2 a x the positive mean values of mbe in cfsr era5 sa obs trmm and imerg indicate overestimation while aphrodite underestimated the observed data with a negative mean value of mbe table s4 the lower values of rmse derived from aphrodite fig 2 g era5 fig 2 i trmm fig 2 k and imerg l indicate that these datasets have a better performance than the other two products except for the locations in the southwestern and western regions in the trmm and imerg which are attributed to the overestimated rainfall over these areas fig 2 m x shows a better performance regarding the correlation coefficient r and modified index of agreement md in aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg based rainfall at each station fig 3 shows the mean monthly rainfall between 2001 and 2011 in each tributary basin which was calculated by averaging the monthly rainfall observed or interpolated bilinear interpolation at all rain gauge locations in the tributary basin era5 and aphrodite and the observed results showed a similar seasonal pattern to each other cfsr tended to overestimate the mean monthly rainfall for most tributary basins throughout the year and sa obs overestimated the mean monthly rainfall during the wet season fig 3 and s3 the trmm and imerg precipitation values overestimated the rain gauged values in four tributary basins dauntri mongkol borey pursat and sangker which is consistent with the higher spatial gradient of rainfall over the southwestern terrain fig 5 fig 4 shows the scatter plots between the interpolated monthly precipitation of each gridded product and the gauged observations for each tributary basin the higher values of coefficient of determination i e r2 in aphrodite trmm imerg and era5 indicate that these four datasets have a strong linear relationship with the observed monthly data while cfsr and sa obs show lower correlations with the observed data trmm and imerg show a good relationship with the observation data in eight tributary basins the monthly r2 values are higher than 0 65 while the other three basins located over the southwestern terrain of the tsl i e the dauntri pursat and sangker tributary basins exhibit r2 values between 0 5 and 0 58 for trmm and between 0 47 and 0 65 for imerg as seen in the scatter plots imerg outperformed trmm in some tributaries while the other tributaries showed equal or smaller correlation coefficients fig 4 3 2 spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation from 2001 to 2011 over the tsl basin is shown using the respective gridded dataset fig 5 a f and data from all 31 rain gauging stations fig 5 g the areal average of mean annual precipitation was 1246 2145 1762 2250 1851 and 1766 mm for aphrodite cfsr era5 sa obs trmm and imerg respectively there were substantial differences in the areal average and spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation between the six gridded products aphrodite revealed the smallest mean annual rainfall over the tsl basin while era5 trmm and imerg showed a comparably similar annual rainfall and spatial distribution with larger rainfall over the hilly regions in the south and northeast which are not visible in the observations fig 5 g and smaller rainfall over the lower elevation zone extending from the northwest to the southeast including the tsl although the overall spatial distribution of mean annual rainfall is similar between trmm and imerg the rainfall at the edge of the basin in the south and northeast areas was noticeably smaller in imerg than that of trmm fig 5 which could be a source of improvement in correlation coefficient between gauged and imerg precipitation in some tributaries fig 4 despite both aphrodite and sa obs datasets being based on the observation data their spatial distributions are very different and reflect the different number of gauged datasets used to create them 3 3 performance of temperature datasets fig 6 illustrates the comparison values of mean monthly averaged daily maximum and minimum temperatures derived from the results of bilinear interpolation of gridded data and those derived from the data of gauging stations from 1985 to 2011 overall the sa obs dataset displayed better estimates of seasonal patterns and magnitudes for both minimum and maximum temperatures fig 6 and s4 cfsr products exhibited huge differences in magnitude for both maximum and minimum temperatures especially between april and december era5 cpc sa obs and the observed results showed overall similarity in their seasonal patterns for minimum temperature fig 6 and s4 the statistical indices evaluating the performance of maximum and minimum temperatures at the monthly timescale are given in table 4 the results of four different indices for individual stations and their mean values are presented separately for maximum and minimum temperatures cfsr maximum and minimum temperatures had the poorest performance compared to other gridded products as typically indicated by a large rmse the cpc and sa obs minimum temperatures showed the highest mean correlation coefficients which were equal to 0 84 table 4 sa obs maximum temperature values outperformed the cpc products as indicated by the mean values of all indices table 4 therefore the sa obs product is the most favorable alternative temperature data source over the tsl basin from the statistical analysis the cpc and sa obs based air temperature performed comparably well with the gauged data this result was consistent with the previous work van den besselaar et al 2017 that found a high correlation between sa obs and aphrodite gauge based dataset for mean temperature over southeast asia similarly khadka et al 2021 indicated that cpc shows a high correlation with gauged data and well captures the variation of maximum and minimum temperature in northeast thailand 3 4 evaluation of performance based on the streamflow simulation through the analyses described in sections 3 1 3 3 aphrodite era5 trmm and imeerg were found to be the preferred alternative precipitation data sources and sa obs was found to be the favored alternative source for air temperature data therefore the four selected gridded precipitation products and the sa obs air temperature data were used in the swat model application to simulate streamflow in 11 tributary basins model performance was evaluated based on three statistical indicators nse pbias and r2 although the model parameters were optimized independently for each precipitation dataset there were some differences in the model performance results due to inherent biases and uncertainties included in each precipitation dataset table s5 fig 7 compares the time series of observed and simulated daily streamflow in the sen river basin which has the largest drainage area during the calibration from 1995 or 1998 or 2001 2002 and validation periods from 2003 to 2011 the hydrograph of aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg displayed a similar seasonal pattern to the observed data showing very good agreement and performance during both calibration and validation periods nse and r2 0 75 and pbias 10 tables s3 and s5 the monthly observed and simulated flows of all other tributary basins during the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs s5 and s6 respectively most of the results based on the four precipitation products reproduced the seasonal patterns well for both calibration and validation periods figs s5 and s6 mainly due to the good representation of monthly rainfall and temporal patterns in these datasets figs 3 and 4 statistical indices summarized for the calibration and validation periods table s5 demonstrate that aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg products performed well on daily streamflow simulations as nse and r2 in the calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 5 and pbias values were within 15 in most tributary basins on average the era5 streamflow showed weaker performance in the 11 tributary basins than the trmm imerg and aphrodite streamflow especially during the calibration period the average performance of imerg based models showed a slightly better performance than that of the trmm product for both calibration and validation phases table s5 the comparison of observed and simulated mean annual runoff from the delineated area of each tributary basin and their total values indicated that aphrodite trmm and imerg precipitation datasets showed better overall performances in hydrological simulations during both calibration and validation periods whereas the total runoff based on era5 rainfall overestimated the runoff by more than 50 mm in both calibration and validation periods fig 8 although era5 precipitation showed good spatial fig 2 and temporal fig 3 performance when compared with gauged data the bias and uncertainty in rainfall variability and distribution in the upstream areas where gauged data are not available could influence the performance of streamflow simulation at the gauged station the rainfall from aphrodite trmm and imerg combined with sa obs air temperature provided more reliable estimates of mean runoff in each tributary basin and the total delineated basin areas during calibration and validation periods although aphrodite trmm and imerg performed well in reproducing the streamflow a large difference in the annual precipitation recorded in these datasets fig 5 warrants further investigation with an additional water balance component i e et which is discussed in section 3 5 the average daily precipitation of sa obs overestimates the gauged data and is higher than that from aphrodite and trmm over southeast asia van den besselaar et al 2017 which agrees with the findings from our study errors in precipitation input can cause significant uncertainties in hydrological simulation consistent with the result of this study the cfsr data overestimated the gauged rainfall which resulted in the considerable overestimation of simulated streamflow in the upper dong nai river vietnam nhi et al 2019 dinh et al 2020 vu et al 2012 indicated that the trmm and aphrodite precipitation data have potential applications in driving hydrological model and water resources management in the mekong river basin while our study showed that aphrodite gives much underestimation of basin wide precipitation similarly kawai et al 2021 have pointed out in their study that the aphrodite precipitation is about 33 38 less than the gauged values over lao pdr like our study gunathilake et al 2020 showed that imerg had a high correlation and the lowest estimation error with gauged rainfall leading to good performance in simulating the streamflow in the upper nan river basin northern thailand therefore mohammed et al 2018 revealed that the models utilizing trmm and imerg forcing data simulated streamflow well in the lower mekong river which is also found in our study 3 5 evaluation of performance based on et throughout the tsl basin the spatial distribution of mean annual et calculated in the swat model application was compared with modis based and gleam based et for the whole basin excluding the flooded areas fig 9 a f the mean annual et of each dataset was 759 935 1093 1084 1138 and 1036 mm for aphrodite era5 trmm imerg modis and gleam respectively suggesting a better agreement between trmm and imerg based and satellite based et i e modis and gleam the et maps based on trmm imerg and modis fig 9 c d and e showed high spatial similarities except for the upstream areas in the pursat tributary basin different algorithms used in et calculations discussed in 2 4 3 might be the source of dissimilarity between simulated et and satellite based ets in some parts of the tributary basins the monthly et s time series and scatter plots averaged over each tributary basin excluding the flooded areas as shown in figs s4 and 10 respectively the et from the four precipitation products showed some similar seasonal patterns with modis and gleam et but significant differences were found for aphrodite et aphrodite et was much lower than other models and satellite based et while rmse values were found to be relatively smaller between those of trmm and imerg et and the satellite based ets table s6 additionally the average rmse between imerg and modis et is slightly smaller than that of trmm et and modis et table s6 the limited gauge information e g rainfall monitoring stations exclusively located at the downstream areas fig 1 used for gauge adjustment algorithms and resultant precipitation underestimations figs 2 and 3 could be the leading causes for the relatively poor performance of aphrodite based swat in et estimations indicating that this product could not be suitable for basin wide hydrological applications on average the et values simulated by the swat model using each precipitation product attributed to approximately 62 of the total precipitation fig s8 fig s9 compares mean simulated annual runoff depth values from each tributary basin and the total drainage area between 2001 and 2004 which were obtained by applying swat modeling and excluding the flooded regions in each tributary basin the simulated total runoff depth from 11 tributary basins was 330 414 395 and 393 mm year for aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg respectively in the study by kummu et al 2014 the total runoff depth from the same 11 tributaries of the tsl basin during the same period 2001 2004 was estimated to be 394 mm year which is much closer to our results obtained using trmm and imerg precipitation the smaller rmse table s6 and better temporal fig s7 and spatial figs 9 and 10 patterns of the imerg and trmm et with gleam and modis et indicate that trmm and imerg provide more reliable rainfall values over the tsl basin resulting in a more accurate estimation of streamflow and et and a better prediction of other water balance components in the study area therefore trmm and imerg precipitation combined with sa obs air temperature is a superior meteorological input for swat model simulations for comprehensive hydrological impact assessments over the tsl basin 4 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive assessment of seven gridded precipitation and air temperature products including aphrodite trmm imerg cfsr era5 sa obs and cpc by statistically comparing these datasets with gauge based datasets and applying the swat model for daily streamflow and et simulations over the tsl basin the precipitation data from aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg were found to have high correlations with rain gauged data and the lowest estimation errors whereas cfsr and sa obs products showed marked overestimation during most of the study period the sa obs and cpc were found to match the observed air temperature data well while the cfsr and era5 data showed larger estimation errors the results of the hydrological simulation showed that the rainfall data from aphrodite trmm and imerg combined with sa obs based air temperature data provided improved estimations of daily streamflow and mean runoff depth for most of the delineated tributary basins during the calibration and validation periods the et estimated using the trmm and imerg datasets showed a better temporal and spatial pattern agreement with gleam and modis et this suggests that trmm and imerg in conjunction with sa obs air temperature are reliable for providing the streamflow through the swat model application and other water balance components although trmm and imerg datasets provided comparable performance in streamflow and et simulation in the study area a slight improvement found for imerg in statistical analysis and streamflow and et simulations in addition to the spatial resolution and latency time of imerg suggest that imerg and sa obs provide the most favorable meteorological input datasets for comprehensive basin wide hydrological impact assessments the comprehensive evaluation framework used in this study was found to be effective in selecting reliable gridded meteorological datasets for hydrological simulation in data sparse river basins especially when large uncertainty existed in the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall the findings also showed that applying gridded data that had only been verified through statistical comparisons with gauged data and hydrological simulation of streamflow could result in large uncertainties when quantifying other water balance components and assessing the hydrological responses including rainfall driven phenomena such as soil erosion and nutrient transport due to climate change and land use change our comprehensive evaluation approach results are a valuable guide for selecting alternative meteorological data for hydrological applications when the existing gauging networks are limited not only in the tsl basin but also in the mekong river basin and other river basins located within a similar climate region credit

7893,study region tonle sap lake tsl basin in cambodia study focus the development and application of hydrological models for data sparse basins are hindered by the limited hydro meteorological data although gridded meteorological products are alternatively considered in many studies the validation of the products with limited point observations overlooks the original spatiotemporal characteristics thus leading to a selection of datasets with high uncertainty here we evaluated seven gridded meteorological datasets of rainfall and air temperature covering the data sparse tonle sap lake basin by employing the statistical approach based on the bilinear interpolation method and hydrological approach using the swat model which ensures the reliable estimates of streamflow and evapotranspiration new hydrological insights for the region the results of the statistical approach indicate that aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg based precipitation and cpc and sa obs based air temperature performed comparably well r 0 75 with the gauged data however era5 based streamflow performed relatively poor while swat driven by aphrodite underestimated satellite based evapotranspiration indicating the underestimation of basin wide precipitation by aphrodite although trmm and imerg provide more reliable estimation of streamflow and evapotranspiration slightly better performance and a higher spatial resolution of imerg dataset suggest that imerg precipitation is superior for basin wide hydrological modeling and impact assessment these findings showed that statistical comparisons with gauge data and hydrological evaluation of streamflow are not enough to justify the reliability of each gridded dataset graphical abstract ga1 keywords the tonle sap lake basin gridded datasets streamflow evapotranspiration swat model 1 introduction the tonle sap lake tsl in cambodia is the largest freshwater body in southeast asia and one of the most productive ecosystems in the world uk et al 2018 playing a crucial role in livelihood and sustainable development in cambodia and the lower mekong region shivakoti and bao 2020 at the same time the high productivity and rich biodiversity in the tsl have been maintained through flood pulses which are seasonal inundation during the monsoon floods of the mekong river kummu et al 2014 uk et al 2018 recent studies have revealed that the lake has been confronting various environmental changes for example kallio and kummu 2021 reported that the maximum inundation area of the tsl during the rainy season showed a decreasing trend of 128 km2 per year wang et al 2020 reported an increasing trend of sediment concentration in the lake based on the analysis of satellite images fish catches have also revealed a decline in various fish species over time ngor et al 2018 although these changes could be attributed to multiple driving factors such as the influence from the mekong mainstream and anthropogenic activities inside the lake limited information is available regarding hydro environmental impacts from the tributary basins of the tsl ang and oeurng 2018 kummu et al 2014 this necessitates a comprehensive hydrological assessment of the tsl tributary basins owing to land use change population growth and climate change for environmental conservation of the tsl reliable climate datasets play vital roles in conducting hydro environmental impact assessment through the application of regional hydrological models however due to financial constraints of the kingdom of cambodia the sparse and uneven distribution of rain gauge stations in the tsl basin hinders the development of reliable hydrological models and accurate simulations of the hydrological impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change for example some studies attempted to simulate the daily streamflow exclusively for the tsl basin oeurng et al 2019 and its tributary basins ang and oeurng 2018 heng et al 2020 sao et al 2020 touch et al 2020 using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the limited agreement of simulated and observed streamflow values was shown in these studies and it was mainly attributed to data sparsity and limited available information on the spatio temporal variations of meteorological variables considering the current sparse monitoring network of the meteorological conditions in cambodia particularly over the tsl basin alternative reliable climate datasets are highly necessary furthermore getting ground based data at a good spatial temporal resolution is very challenging in developing countries and the data sometimes cannot be freely accessed by public users due to data sharing policy gauge observations are subject to limitations such as reporting time delays and sparse gauge networks bai and liu 2018 the open accessed or satellite based datasets on the other hand can support the near real time monitoring or forecasting and be merged with the in situ observations to improve the data quality we can find various studies globally that utilize regional and global gridded meteorological datasets to serve as alternative inputs for hydrological model simulations for hydro environmental assessments and water resource management fuka et al 2014 ur rahman et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 in recent years many different gridded rainfall and temperature datasets based on observation satellite measurement or reanalysis have been evaluated for their performance in climate and hydrological studies targeting different river basins tan et al 2021 for instance xu et al 2016a compared water and global change watch forcing data wfd and asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite data with ground based precipitation data for flood simulation in the xiangjiang river basin china they found that aphrodite data had a better correlation with gauged precipitation and a relatively high flow prediction accuracy than wfd precipitation data the satellite based precipitation data tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is among the best performing datasets with lower bias from the interpolated rain gauge observations duan et al 2016 similarly satgé et al 2020 evaluated different 23 gridded precipitation datasets and revealed that trmm precipitation data showed relatively better performance for both daily and monthly time step having compared with the gauged dataset amjad et al 2020 found that european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis v5 era5 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg had minor estimation errors and high correlation for daily and monthly timescales analysis another study similarly found that among five satellite precipitation products trmm and imerg showed the best performance when compared with ground based monitored data islam et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a 2020b demonstrated that the combination of air temperature and precipitation from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps respectively provided satisfactory performance in streamflow simulation moreover fuka et al 2014 found that for five watersheds representing different hydro climate regimes the hydrological model simulation of river flow driven by the cfsr precipitation and temperature data provided results as good as those obtained using observation based weather data aslam et al 2020 compared the maximum and minimum temperatures over a data scarce transboundary river basin of india and pakistan obtained from the climate prediction center cpc and princeton university global meteorological forcing pgf datasets with the ground based observation they found that cpc had a better performance regarding station based time series analysis ge et al 2019 analyzed the performance of the newly developed meteorological dataset southeast asia observation sa obs in climatological means and surface air temperature trends of the indochina peninsula on a yearly and seasonal basis and sa obs product was found to have good overall agreement with observation and reanalysis datasets despite these studies it is challenging to select one superior product conclusively owing to the peculiar characteristics and uncertainties in each dataset depending on the data generation algorithm used the factors inherent to study regions such as climate and topography and the quality and quantity of the observed data used in developing the datasets fu et al 2016 lauri et al 2014 sun et al 2014 vu et al 2012 worqlul et al 2014 furthermore a limited number of studies have evaluated climate data sources covering the southeast asia region especially for the mekong river basin gunathilake et al 2020 evaluated six different gridded precipitation products and showed that imerg had a good performance in simulating the streamflow in the upper nan river basin northern thailand four different high resolution gridded precipitation datasets were evaluated in the philippines and it was shown that trmm has the least bias errors and most closely resembles the rainfall distribution observed at gauged stations peralta et al 2020 similarly the trmm was found to be the best performing dataset among five different precipitation products in malaysia ayoub et al 2020 over the mekong river basin most of these studies have validated gridded datasets by only focusing on the mainstream of the mekong river basin e g lauri et al 2014 try et al 2022 2020 try et al 2020 validated the river discharges using five different gridded precipitation datasets aphrodite trmm global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap global precipitation climatology center gpcc and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr at four gauging stations along the mainstream of the mekong river in lao pdr and cambodia similarly lauri et al 2014 utilized two temperature datasets cfsr and era interim and five precipitation products trmm 3b42 v6 trmm 3b42 v7 aphrodite cfsr and era interim to evaluate river flow simulation at five gauging stations along the mainstream of the lower mekong river furthermore try et al 2022 employed gpcc precipitation to study on identification of the spatio temporal and fluvial pluvial sources of flood inundation in the lower mekong basin and the river discharges was validated at the kratie gauging station located on the mainstream of mekong river no previous studies have assessed the spatio temporal characteristics and quantitative accuracy of gridded hydro meteorological datasets over the tsl basin hence the performance of individual datasets in hydrological modeling including other water balance components has not been clarified yet the majority of studies reviewed above rarely reported the evaluation of alternative air temperature datasets for hydrological simulations accordingly the assessment of air temperature data or the optimal data combinations e g aphrodite precipitation with cfsr temperature from different alternative climate products should also be considered in the validation schemes tan et al 2021 conventional statistical approaches using simple correlation or error analyses are often not enough to justify the variability and distribution of gridded precipitation data ahmed et al 2019 for further studies bai and liu 2018 suggested that hydrological evaluation of gridded products based only on streamflow simulations could not validate the reliability of gridded climate datasets but other hydrological variables such as evaporation and soil moisture should be considered for more comprehensive evaluation previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 oeurng et al 2019 uk et al 2018 have highlighted the demand for more reliable hydrological assessment over the tsl basin and the importance of identifying the factors that affect environmental and ecological changes in the tsl basin this study aimed to extensively evaluate alternative climate datasets for their reliability in representing spatio temporal characteristics and estimating streamflow in the tsl basin during the past decades using robust statistical and hydrological modeling approaches seven potentially promising gridded precipitation and air temperature datasets for analysis were selected these included aphrodite cfsr trmm imerg era5 sa obs and cpc we presented a comprehensive framework to evaluate their spatio temporal representations and hydrological quantification performances for all the tsl tributary basins where meteorological stations are sparsely located more specifically we firstly compared these gridded products with the observed datasets based on the bilinear interpolation method and examined the suitability of each dataset in estimating the daily streamflow in the eleven tsl tributary basins furthermore we evaluated each climate dataset by comparing satellite based and model derived actual evapotranspiration et in the whole tsl basin which further quantitatively validated the annual and seasonal rainfall amounts this approach enabled us to avoid the selection of hydro meteorological datasets with significant bias and uncertainty e g deficient basin wide rainfall that could affect the accuracy of simulations of sediment erosion and nutrient transport despite parameter optimization which could yield acceptable ranges for streamflow estimation irrespective of the dataset used finally we identified the gridded datasets most reliable for hydrological and environmental impact assessments as well as the projections of future climate change impacts over the tsl basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tsl the largest lake in southeast asia is one of the most important natural resources in cambodia kummu et al 2008 and symbolically called the heart of cambodia covering over 45 approximately 85 850 km2 of the national land surface area and approximately 5 of the total basin area being shared with thailand fig 1 the tonle sap lake basin consists of 11 major tributary basins and is connected to the tonle sap river which flows to the mainstream of the mekong river delta the seasonal flow direction reversal in the tonle sap river and the resultant inundation of the tsl floodplain during the flood season between june and october causes the lake s total surface area and water level to swell from approximately 2600 km2 and 2 m to 12 000 km2 and 10 m arias et al 2014 kummu et al 2014 oeurng et al 2019 respectively this creates a unique aquatic environment and a diverse and productive ecosystem arias et al 2014 kummu et al 2014 sabo et al 2017 kummu et al 2014 estimated that 34 29 1 km3 year of the water volume in the lake originates from the 11 tributary basins approximately 53 5 41 8 km3 year comes from the mekong river and 12 5 10 4 km3 year is from precipitation over the lake surface the tsl basin is covered by alluvial deposits composed of unconsolidated silt sand and gravel overlaying on the older bedrock tsukawaki and lao 1994 the climate in this region is characterized by two monsoon periods high humidity conditions prevail and frequent heavy rains are typically observed during the south west monsoon season from mid may to early october rainy season while the north east monsoon lasts from early november to march dry season bringing drier and cooler air world bank 2011 the tributary basins predominantly consist of gently sloping lowlands with an elevation of less than 100 m above the mean sea level the elevation increases to over 1700 m in the cardamom mountains to the southwest see fig 1 the basin area delineated area a basin boundary representing the contributing area for a gauging station of streamflow see fig s1 and land use area of each tributary basin are summarized in table 1 the total delineated area is 49 52 approximately 41 158 km2 of the total basin area most of the tributary basins seven out of eleven are predominantly forested land 50 while agricultural land is dominant in the mongkol borey baribo dauntri and siem reap tributary basins oeurng et al 2019 a limited number of rainfall and water level gauging stations are located in each tributary basin most monitoring stations are situated in the downstream areas fig 1 while gauges are sparsely located in the upstream areas particularly in the northeastern part of the tsl basin oeurng et al 2019 since a limited number of temperature monitoring stations are available in the tsl basin we used observed temperature data at five stations including three located outside the basin to the east fig 1 the daily observed rainfall and temperature data between 1985 and 2011 in which there is no missing value in these two datasets were used as a benchmark to validate gridded meteorological data 2 2 gridded precipitation and temperature datasets among the available gridded precipitation and temperature datasets we selected six datasets for precipitation and four datasets for air temperature table 2 namely aphrodite cfsr

brief description of each dataset is given in the following sections and summarized in table 2 2 2 1 aphrodite the aphrodite rainfall dataset is primarily created with rainfall data observed via a rain gauge observation network over asia yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite version v1101 covers the period from 1951 to 2007 and its updated version v1901 is available for the period between 1998 and 2015 we used both versions to cover the whole study period between 1985 and 2011 with daily temporal and spatial resolutions of 0 25 0 25 there are a total of 13 rainfall stations in the tsl basin used to create the aphrodite dataset some of which were not used in our study due to inconsistent measurement periods fig s2 the performance of the aphrodite dataset was compared to that of other products in the discharge modeling study for the mekong river basin lauri et al 2014 which indicated that the computed discharge based on aphrodite is similar to the observation data another study for the lower mekong river basin showed that the aphrodite dataset was suitable for rainfall runoff and flood inundation modeling try et al 2018 guan et al 2020 evaluated six different precipitation datasets using four hydrological models to simulate streamflow over the upper yellow river basin china and found that the aphrodite dataset was one of the superior products 2 2 2 cfsr cfsr was developed by the environmental modelling center at the national center for environmental prediction ncep it is a fully coupled atmospheric model representing the interactions among earth s atmosphere oceans land and sea ice systems to provide the best prediction of the state of these coupled domains from 1979 to 2014 saha et al 2014 the cfsr global atmospheric data have a spatial resolution of approximately 0 30 0 30 with daily resolution cfsr version 2 was used in this study in addition the cfsr dataset is commonly used in the swat modeling users group as this dataset provides complete data for several climate variables precipitation air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity with a convenient data format that is compatible with swat model requirements zhang et al 2020a cfsr precipitation was found to reproduce an adequate flow in the yangtze river basin china lu et al 2019 the monthly coefficient of rainfall and air temperature determination was higher than 0 6 and 0 9 respectively compared with the ground based station data additionally the air temperature of cfsr products could be a promising alternative data source to serve as input into the hydrological model for streamflow simulation in the data scarce river basins zhang et al 2020b 2 2 3 trmm trmm is a joint project between the north american space agency nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa to study rainfall over the tropical region the trmm precipitation is estimated from a combination of multiple satellites and rain gauge analyses at a fine spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 the 3b42v7 product was adjusted by monthly rain gauge precipitation data from the gpcc and is superior to the trmm 3b42rt v7 the number of rain gauges used in gpcc data is documented in earlier publications by vu et al 2018 however there is only one station in tsl basin that was used in interpolating the gpcc dataset during the study period the trmm 3b42v7 dataset from 1998 to 2011 with the daily resolution was used in this study trmm 3b42v7 precipitation data were compared with observed rainfall at 342 rain gauges over malaysia tan et al 2015 there was a tendency for trmm 3b42v7 to yield accurate and unbiased rainfall estimations trmm the climate prediction center morphing algorithm cmorph and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap reanalysis were evaluated via a comparison with the rain gauge based data over central vietnam trinh tuan et al 2019 and trmm was found to outperform the other datasets moreover the trmm precipitation was determined to be among the best performing products that gave better streamflow simulation results than the other four gridded datasets over the upper yellow river basin china guan et al 2020 nhi et al 2019 evaluated five gridded rainfall datasets in simulating streamflow and found that trmm was one of the best datasets showing a better match to rain gauge data in simulating the streamflow in the upper dong nai river basin vietnam 2 2 4 imerg following the success of trmm nasa and jaxa jointly launched the gpm observatory satellite on 28 february 2014 to provide more accurate precipitation data with fine spatiotemporal resolution using an algorithm combining information from the gpm satellite constellation from partner nations huffman et al 2020 liu 2016 recently imerg version 6 v06 extended its temporal coverage to the trmm era and provides datasets from june 2000 to the present gpm not only extended trmm s spatial coverage but also carries advanced sensors such as the dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and gpm microwave imager gmi which quantify precipitation more accurately particularly for light and solid precipitation huffman et al 2020 like trmm monthly rain gauge precipitation data from the gpcc were used to adjust imerg precipitation furthermore there are three types of imerg products the early run imerg e and late run imerg l are available with a latency of 4 h and 14 h respectively huffman et al 2020 which could serve as a potential data source for flood forecasting and real time disaster management the final run imerg f is available approximately 4 months after observation and it is mainly aimed for research purposes the imerg f v06 dataset from 2001 to 2011 with the daily temporal resolution and spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 was used in this study lu et al 2021 found that imerg f precipitation has a great potential for application to hydroclimatic research and water resources assessment in the complex climatic and topographic conditions western china generally the imerg f shows high accuracy and good performance in hydrological simulations with a high correlation coefficient 0 63 and low relative bias 0 92 when compared with the ground observations wang et al 2017 gunathilake et al 2020 statistically and hydrologically evaluated the capacity of different six satellite based precipitation products in the upper nan river basin northern thailand showing that imerg precipitation demonstrates good performance for future hydrometeorological applications in this region huang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of imerg f during six extremely heavy precipitation events caused by powerful typhoons from 2016 to 2017 and they stated that the imerg f shows good capability in extreme rainfall events i e typhoons rainfall storm applications 2 2 5 era5 era5 is the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and it provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric land and oceanic climate variables from 1979 to the present with a spatial resolution of 31 km 0 25 hersbach et al 2020 tarek et al 2020 found that the performance of hydrological modeling based on era5 precipitation is equivalent to that based on the observed rainfall jiao et al 2021 showed that era5 data is in good agreement with the annual and seasonal patterns of observed precipitation in china and have correlation coefficient values ranging from 0 79 to 0 94 era5 temperature data was found to be consistent with the monthly observations and the trend of era5 based temperature and observation data showed a strong linear relationship with the monthly observations zhu et al 2021 2 2 6 sa obs sa obs is an observational gridded dataset for precipitation and temperature in the southeast asia region based on the southeast asian climate assessment dataset saca d project van den besselaar et al 2017 the full dataset is estimated at a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 1981 to 2017 since sa obs is a newly developed daily gridded dataset for southeast asia there are limited studies to evaluate the performance of this dataset the daily precipitation and temperature data were collected from the meteorological institutes of australia indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam there are 1393 precipitation stations including 365 stations with minimum and maximum temperatures and 274 stations with a daily mean temperature van den besselaar et al 2017 however during the creation of sa obs no gauged rainfall data were introduced from the tsl basin or cambodia therefore no data accuracy for this area has been clarified the detailed information on gauged stations used in sa obs data generation can be found in the study by van den besselaar et al 2017 a high correlation was found between station observations and the corresponding grid squares of sa obs van den besselaar et al 2017 while sa obs slightly underestimated high rainfall events singh and xiaosheng 2019 2 2 7 cpc the cpc dataset has been developed by the american national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa using optimal interpolation of quality controlled gauge records of the global telecommunication system gts network fan and van den dool 2008 to provide global gridded daily temperature datasets covering the period from 1979 to the present with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 like sa obs the gauged data was not introduced from the tsl basin for cpc data creation and more information on gauged stations used in interpolating cpc data is provided in the study by vu et al 2018 the daily hydrological evaluation results suggested that the cpc temperature combined with precipitation data is a more accurate option for estimating hydrological performance in the upper mekong river basin dinh et al 2020 a similar or lower performance compared to that of other gridded datasets was observed in the downstream areas owing to their reliability cpc temperature data were used as the reference data to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrology of a transboundary river between bhutan and india zam et al 2021 2 3 performance evaluation of gridded datasets of rainfall and temperature the performance of individual gridded precipitation and temperature products was evaluated by comparing them to gauge based datasets on the annual monthly and daily timescales from 1985 to 2011 for aphrodite era5 cfsr cpc and sa obs and from 1998 or 2001 2011 for trmm and imerg respectively the bilinear interpolation method was used to interpolate the gridded datasets to the 31 rainfall and five temperature ground based station locations based on the distance weighted average of the four nearest grid values several previous studies have applied this grid to point interpolation method to compare gridded products with observation data bao and zhang 2013 bromwich and fogt 2004 ebrahimi et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 meher and das 2019 this simplified method with two dimensional interpolation enables a more accurate comparison than the direct comparison between point observations and gridded data caroletti et al 2019 ud din et al 2008 the accuracy of gridded datasets was quantified using four statistical indicators listed in table s1 i e mean bias error mbe root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r and modified index of agreement md mbe is a statistical index to assess the mean difference between two data products interpolated and observed rainfall or temperature and rmse represents the standard deviation of the two datasets the lower absolute values of mbe and rmse indicate the better performance of the gridded dataset r measures the degree of linear correlation between the interpolated and observed datasets md is used as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error which is the modified version of the index of agreement proposed by willmott 1981 to detect additive and proportional differences in the data ahmed et al 2019 pereira et al 2018 willmott 1984 the higher values of r and md closed to one indicate the higher accuracy of gridded products in estimating precipitation and air temperature the equation range and optimal value of each statistical index are presented in table s1 2 4 performance evaluation based on the hydrological model application the comparison of hydro meteorological data at individual locations has a particular limitation in assessing the basin wide applicability of gridded datasets for hydrological simulations mainly if the gauging stations are sparsely distributed within an area like the tsl basin therefore we evaluated the performance of selected gridded datasets in reproducing the streamflow of each tributary basin based on swat model application and the simulated daily streamflow was compared with the observed data furthermore considering the equifinality issue in the hydrological model application under different combinations of gridded datasets and model parameters we compared the simulated and satellite based actual et to confirm the accuracy of each dataset from the perspective of water balance as described in section 2 4 3 2 4 1 hydrological swat model quantitative representation of rainfall and temperature by each gridded dataset was evaluated using the swat model a widely used hydrological model to simulate streamflow sediments and other hydrological variables under diverse environments and scales arnold et al 1998 swat has gained international acceptance as a comprehensive watershed modeling tool gassman et al 2007 and has been applied throughout the world including the united states yuan and forshay 2021 europe bärlund et al 2007 cambodia ang and oeurng 2018 thailand shrestha et al 2018 lao pdr vilaysane et al 2015 vietnam vu et al 2012 china hao et al 2004 india kaur et al 2004 australia sun and cornish 2006 and africa schuol and abbaspour 2006 among many others swat requires topography soil and land use information to account for heterogeneities and divide the greater basin into a group of sub basins which are further subdivided into several hydrological response units hrus each hru is created from a unique combination of land cover slope soil properties and management practices the surface runoff from each hru is simulated based on the scs curve number method usda 1972 with daily rainfall defined at the centroid of the sub basin which is obtained by applying the bilinear interpolation method to the specific daily gridded precipitation dataset instead of the default swat model setting which only uses rainfall data from the gauging station located closest to the centroid of each sub basin arnold et al 1998 the approach using interpolated areal precipitation improved the performance of model calibration compared to the default method of the swat model abbas and xuan 2020 masih et al 2011 more details about swat can be found in the official theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 and the review paper by gassman et al 2007 each dataset used for the swat model setup is summarized in table 3 the topography data required to define flow accumulation stream networks and basin boundaries are based on a 90 m 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm land use distribution was obtained from the mekong river commission mrc which developed a land use map based on satellite imagery collected from 1993 to 1999 information on soil types was obtained from a 1 250 000 scale map created by the mrc that contains the required physical properties of each soil type based on the food and agriculture organization united nations educational scientific and cultural organization fao unesco 1988 classification scheme oeurng et al 2019 the daily rainfall and maximum minimum air temperature data were obtained from individual gridded datasets the streamflow in each tributary basin was calculated using rating curves developed by kummu et al 2014 from the observed water levels collected by the department of hydrology and river works ministry of water resources and meteorology of cambodia oeurng et al 2019 2 4 2 model calibration validation and evaluation model calibration was performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2015 and the performance of each gridded dataset in the hydrological model application was evaluated for the calibration and validation periods swat cup provides several methods for calibration to deal with parameter uncertainty including the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method nkonge et al 2014 wu and chen 2015 which was selected to provide more reasonable daily streamflow simulations at the outlet of each delineated drainage area table 1 and fig s1 considering the availability of continuous discharge data in each tributary basin the model parameters were calibrated with available streamflow data between 1995 and 2002 and simulation results were validated for the period between 2003 and 2011 based on previous studies ang and oeurng 2018 oeurng et al 2019 sao et al 2020 sok et al 2020 vilaysane et al 2015 vu et al 2012 23 parameters were selected and calibrated using the swat cup model table s2 for each gridded precipitation dataset for evaluating model performance in watershed simulations we employed three quantitative metrics i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as shown in table s1 moriasi et al 2007 nse indicates how well the result of a simulation fits the observed time series nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated values to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 r2 examines to what extent differences in one variable can be explained by the difference in a second variable in other words r2 assesses how strong the linear relationship is between two variables furthermore the performance ratings suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were applied to evaluate the swat model simulation s integrated performance table s3 2 4 3 evapotranspiration comparison swat determines the actual evapotranspiration et from potential evapotranspiration pet using one of the three built in empirical equations neitsch et al 2011 penman monteith allen et al 1989 monteith 1965 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves hargreaves and samani 1985 these three methods require different input variables the penmen monteith method requires solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed and the priestley taylor method needs solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity considering limited data availability we used the hargreaves method which requires precipitation and air temperature only neitsch et al 2011 once the pet is determined et must be calculated swat estimates total et from four components canopy evaporation transpiration soil evaporation and revap et abiodun et al 2018 swat models the movement of water into overlying unsaturated layers as a function of water demand for et this process has been termed revap to avoid confusion with soil evaporation and transpiration neitsch et al 2011 as swat calculates the revap separately the revap should be added for et calculations abiodun et al 2018 fenta mekonnen et al 2018 more detailed information and a comprehensive outline of et calculations in the swat model can be found in the theoretical manual of neitsch et al 2011 and the studies by abiodun et al 2018 and fenta mekonnen et al 2018 the spatio temporal variation of et was obtained through swat model estimations driven by different precipitation products then we compared this information to satellite based et data for a more comprehensive evaluation of the gridded precipitation datasets for this purpose the swat model was applied to simulate daily et together with streamflow for the whole drainage area of each tributary basin with the parameters previously calibrated for the delineated area of each tributary basin from 2001 to 2011 the simulated et based on different gridded rainfall products was temporally and spatially aggregated to compare with satellite based et i e et from modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model at monthly and annual timescales for the whole basin excluding the flooded areas satellite based et has been used to validate the application of hydrological models and assess water balance closure in several studies dash et al 2021 jin and jin 2020 lópez et al 2017 odusanya et al 2018 sirisena et al 2020 wong et al 2021 but the satellite et is rarely used for validating the gridded rainfall products modis et provides the evaporation from global terrestrial surfaces and transpiration from the vegetation canopy mu et al 2011 the algorithm to estimate et from modis data was initially developed by cleugh et al 2007 the modis et algorithms are based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 we used mod16a2 which is available at an 8 day interval and a spatial resolution of 1 km over a period extending from 2000 to 2014 mu et al 2013 compared the modis et with observed et across 46 sites from 2000 to 2006 and found that the average et biases and mean absolute errors between et observations and modis et are 0 11 mm and 0 33 mm respectively similarly kim and hogue 2008 validated modis et at a point scale by comparing modis et with measured et at four monitoring stations from 2001 to 2004 and results showed that at the daily time step modis et show a good correlation r 0 89 and low bias 0 34 mm with measured et the actual gleam et data are estimated as the sum of evaporation and et from three different land surface types i e bare soil short vegetation and vegetation with a tall canopy miralles et al 2011 the priestley and taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 was adopted to estimate evaporation in the gleam et algorithms we used the daily et of the gleam v3 2a dataset spanning 41 years from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the gleam et was validated at 91 in situ sites in the united states and australia between 2011 and 2015 and it was found that the mean correlation coefficient and root mean square difference between gleam and gauge et are 0 78 and 0 71 mm respectively martens et al 2017 the gleam et was also validated in china using in situ measurements at three different timescales the results showed a high average correlation coefficient with in situ observations at all sites on daily r 0 71 monthly r 0 86 and annual r 0 79 time scales yang et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of precipitation datasets the results of all statistical indices mbe rmse r and md applied for each station are presented in fig 2 a x the positive mean values of mbe in cfsr era5 sa obs trmm and imerg indicate overestimation while aphrodite underestimated the observed data with a negative mean value of mbe table s4 the lower values of rmse derived from aphrodite fig 2 g era5 fig 2 i trmm fig 2 k and imerg l indicate that these datasets have a better performance than the other two products except for the locations in the southwestern and western regions in the trmm and imerg which are attributed to the overestimated rainfall over these areas fig 2 m x shows a better performance regarding the correlation coefficient r and modified index of agreement md in aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg based rainfall at each station fig 3 shows the mean monthly rainfall between 2001 and 2011 in each tributary basin which was calculated by averaging the monthly rainfall observed or interpolated bilinear interpolation at all rain gauge locations in the tributary basin era5 and aphrodite and the observed results showed a similar seasonal pattern to each other cfsr tended to overestimate the mean monthly rainfall for most tributary basins throughout the year and sa obs overestimated the mean monthly rainfall during the wet season fig 3 and s3 the trmm and imerg precipitation values overestimated the rain gauged values in four tributary basins dauntri mongkol borey pursat and sangker which is consistent with the higher spatial gradient of rainfall over the southwestern terrain fig 5 fig 4 shows the scatter plots between the interpolated monthly precipitation of each gridded product and the gauged observations for each tributary basin the higher values of coefficient of determination i e r2 in aphrodite trmm imerg and era5 indicate that these four datasets have a strong linear relationship with the observed monthly data while cfsr and sa obs show lower correlations with the observed data trmm and imerg show a good relationship with the observation data in eight tributary basins the monthly r2 values are higher than 0 65 while the other three basins located over the southwestern terrain of the tsl i e the dauntri pursat and sangker tributary basins exhibit r2 values between 0 5 and 0 58 for trmm and between 0 47 and 0 65 for imerg as seen in the scatter plots imerg outperformed trmm in some tributaries while the other tributaries showed equal or smaller correlation coefficients fig 4 3 2 spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation the spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation from 2001 to 2011 over the tsl basin is shown using the respective gridded dataset fig 5 a f and data from all 31 rain gauging stations fig 5 g the areal average of mean annual precipitation was 1246 2145 1762 2250 1851 and 1766 mm for aphrodite cfsr era5 sa obs trmm and imerg respectively there were substantial differences in the areal average and spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation between the six gridded products aphrodite revealed the smallest mean annual rainfall over the tsl basin while era5 trmm and imerg showed a comparably similar annual rainfall and spatial distribution with larger rainfall over the hilly regions in the south and northeast which are not visible in the observations fig 5 g and smaller rainfall over the lower elevation zone extending from the northwest to the southeast including the tsl although the overall spatial distribution of mean annual rainfall is similar between trmm and imerg the rainfall at the edge of the basin in the south and northeast areas was noticeably smaller in imerg than that of trmm fig 5 which could be a source of improvement in correlation coefficient between gauged and imerg precipitation in some tributaries fig 4 despite both aphrodite and sa obs datasets being based on the observation data their spatial distributions are very different and reflect the different number of gauged datasets used to create them 3 3 performance of temperature datasets fig 6 illustrates the comparison values of mean monthly averaged daily maximum and minimum temperatures derived from the results of bilinear interpolation of gridded data and those derived from the data of gauging stations from 1985 to 2011 overall the sa obs dataset displayed better estimates of seasonal patterns and magnitudes for both minimum and maximum temperatures fig 6 and s4 cfsr products exhibited huge differences in magnitude for both maximum and minimum temperatures especially between april and december era5 cpc sa obs and the observed results showed overall similarity in their seasonal patterns for minimum temperature fig 6 and s4 the statistical indices evaluating the performance of maximum and minimum temperatures at the monthly timescale are given in table 4 the results of four different indices for individual stations and their mean values are presented separately for maximum and minimum temperatures cfsr maximum and minimum temperatures had the poorest performance compared to other gridded products as typically indicated by a large rmse the cpc and sa obs minimum temperatures showed the highest mean correlation coefficients which were equal to 0 84 table 4 sa obs maximum temperature values outperformed the cpc products as indicated by the mean values of all indices table 4 therefore the sa obs product is the most favorable alternative temperature data source over the tsl basin from the statistical analysis the cpc and sa obs based air temperature performed comparably well with the gauged data this result was consistent with the previous work van den besselaar et al 2017 that found a high correlation between sa obs and aphrodite gauge based dataset for mean temperature over southeast asia similarly khadka et al 2021 indicated that cpc shows a high correlation with gauged data and well captures the variation of maximum and minimum temperature in northeast thailand 3 4 evaluation of performance based on the streamflow simulation through the analyses described in sections 3 1 3 3 aphrodite era5 trmm and imeerg were found to be the preferred alternative precipitation data sources and sa obs was found to be the favored alternative source for air temperature data therefore the four selected gridded precipitation products and the sa obs air temperature data were used in the swat model application to simulate streamflow in 11 tributary basins model performance was evaluated based on three statistical indicators nse pbias and r2 although the model parameters were optimized independently for each precipitation dataset there were some differences in the model performance results due to inherent biases and uncertainties included in each precipitation dataset table s5 fig 7 compares the time series of observed and simulated daily streamflow in the sen river basin which has the largest drainage area during the calibration from 1995 or 1998 or 2001 2002 and validation periods from 2003 to 2011 the hydrograph of aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg displayed a similar seasonal pattern to the observed data showing very good agreement and performance during both calibration and validation periods nse and r2 0 75 and pbias 10 tables s3 and s5 the monthly observed and simulated flows of all other tributary basins during the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs s5 and s6 respectively most of the results based on the four precipitation products reproduced the seasonal patterns well for both calibration and validation periods figs s5 and s6 mainly due to the good representation of monthly rainfall and temporal patterns in these datasets figs 3 and 4 statistical indices summarized for the calibration and validation periods table s5 demonstrate that aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg products performed well on daily streamflow simulations as nse and r2 in the calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 5 and pbias values were within 15 in most tributary basins on average the era5 streamflow showed weaker performance in the 11 tributary basins than the trmm imerg and aphrodite streamflow especially during the calibration period the average performance of imerg based models showed a slightly better performance than that of the trmm product for both calibration and validation phases table s5 the comparison of observed and simulated mean annual runoff from the delineated area of each tributary basin and their total values indicated that aphrodite trmm and imerg precipitation datasets showed better overall performances in hydrological simulations during both calibration and validation periods whereas the total runoff based on era5 rainfall overestimated the runoff by more than 50 mm in both calibration and validation periods fig 8 although era5 precipitation showed good spatial fig 2 and temporal fig 3 performance when compared with gauged data the bias and uncertainty in rainfall variability and distribution in the upstream areas where gauged data are not available could influence the performance of streamflow simulation at the gauged station the rainfall from aphrodite trmm and imerg combined with sa obs air temperature provided more reliable estimates of mean runoff in each tributary basin and the total delineated basin areas during calibration and validation periods although aphrodite trmm and imerg performed well in reproducing the streamflow a large difference in the annual precipitation recorded in these datasets fig 5 warrants further investigation with an additional water balance component i e et which is discussed in section 3 5 the average daily precipitation of sa obs overestimates the gauged data and is higher than that from aphrodite and trmm over southeast asia van den besselaar et al 2017 which agrees with the findings from our study errors in precipitation input can cause significant uncertainties in hydrological simulation consistent with the result of this study the cfsr data overestimated the gauged rainfall which resulted in the considerable overestimation of simulated streamflow in the upper dong nai river vietnam nhi et al 2019 dinh et al 2020 vu et al 2012 indicated that the trmm and aphrodite precipitation data have potential applications in driving hydrological model and water resources management in the mekong river basin while our study showed that aphrodite gives much underestimation of basin wide precipitation similarly kawai et al 2021 have pointed out in their study that the aphrodite precipitation is about 33 38 less than the gauged values over lao pdr like our study gunathilake et al 2020 showed that imerg had a high correlation and the lowest estimation error with gauged rainfall leading to good performance in simulating the streamflow in the upper nan river basin northern thailand therefore mohammed et al 2018 revealed that the models utilizing trmm and imerg forcing data simulated streamflow well in the lower mekong river which is also found in our study 3 5 evaluation of performance based on et throughout the tsl basin the spatial distribution of mean annual et calculated in the swat model application was compared with modis based and gleam based et for the whole basin excluding the flooded areas fig 9 a f the mean annual et of each dataset was 759 935 1093 1084 1138 and 1036 mm for aphrodite era5 trmm imerg modis and gleam respectively suggesting a better agreement between trmm and imerg based and satellite based et i e modis and gleam the et maps based on trmm imerg and modis fig 9 c d and e showed high spatial similarities except for the upstream areas in the pursat tributary basin different algorithms used in et calculations discussed in 2 4 3 might be the source of dissimilarity between simulated et and satellite based ets in some parts of the tributary basins the monthly et s time series and scatter plots averaged over each tributary basin excluding the flooded areas as shown in figs s4 and 10 respectively the et from the four precipitation products showed some similar seasonal patterns with modis and gleam et but significant differences were found for aphrodite et aphrodite et was much lower than other models and satellite based et while rmse values were found to be relatively smaller between those of trmm and imerg et and the satellite based ets table s6 additionally the average rmse between imerg and modis et is slightly smaller than that of trmm et and modis et table s6 the limited gauge information e g rainfall monitoring stations exclusively located at the downstream areas fig 1 used for gauge adjustment algorithms and resultant precipitation underestimations figs 2 and 3 could be the leading causes for the relatively poor performance of aphrodite based swat in et estimations indicating that this product could not be suitable for basin wide hydrological applications on average the et values simulated by the swat model using each precipitation product attributed to approximately 62 of the total precipitation fig s8 fig s9 compares mean simulated annual runoff depth values from each tributary basin and the total drainage area between 2001 and 2004 which were obtained by applying swat modeling and excluding the flooded regions in each tributary basin the simulated total runoff depth from 11 tributary basins was 330 414 395 and 393 mm year for aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg respectively in the study by kummu et al 2014 the total runoff depth from the same 11 tributaries of the tsl basin during the same period 2001 2004 was estimated to be 394 mm year which is much closer to our results obtained using trmm and imerg precipitation the smaller rmse table s6 and better temporal fig s7 and spatial figs 9 and 10 patterns of the imerg and trmm et with gleam and modis et indicate that trmm and imerg provide more reliable rainfall values over the tsl basin resulting in a more accurate estimation of streamflow and et and a better prediction of other water balance components in the study area therefore trmm and imerg precipitation combined with sa obs air temperature is a superior meteorological input for swat model simulations for comprehensive hydrological impact assessments over the tsl basin 4 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive assessment of seven gridded precipitation and air temperature products including aphrodite trmm imerg cfsr era5 sa obs and cpc by statistically comparing these datasets with gauge based datasets and applying the swat model for daily streamflow and et simulations over the tsl basin the precipitation data from aphrodite era5 trmm and imerg were found to have high correlations with rain gauged data and the lowest estimation errors whereas cfsr and sa obs products showed marked overestimation during most of the study period the sa obs and cpc were found to match the observed air temperature data well while the cfsr and era5 data showed larger estimation errors the results of the hydrological simulation showed that the rainfall data from aphrodite trmm and imerg combined with sa obs based air temperature data provided improved estimations of daily streamflow and mean runoff depth for most of the delineated tributary basins during the calibration and validation periods the et estimated using the trmm and imerg datasets showed a better temporal and spatial pattern agreement with gleam and modis et this suggests that trmm and imerg in conjunction with sa obs air temperature are reliable for providing the streamflow through the swat model application and other water balance components although trmm and imerg datasets provided comparable performance in streamflow and et simulation in the study area a slight improvement found for imerg in statistical analysis and streamflow and et simulations in addition to the spatial resolution and latency time of imerg suggest that imerg and sa obs provide the most favorable meteorological input datasets for comprehensive basin wide hydrological impact assessments the comprehensive evaluation framework used in this study was found to be effective in selecting reliable gridded meteorological datasets for hydrological simulation in data sparse river basins especially when large uncertainty existed in the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall the findings also showed that applying gridded data that had only been verified through statistical comparisons with gauged data and hydrological simulation of streamflow could result in large uncertainties when quantifying other water balance components and assessing the hydrological responses including rainfall driven phenomena such as soil erosion and nutrient transport due to climate change and land use change our comprehensive evaluation approach results are a valuable guide for selecting alternative meteorological data for hydrological applications when the existing gauging networks are limited not only in the tsl basin but also in the mekong river basin and other river basins located within a similar climate region credit

7894,study region hekou karst basin southwestern china study focus the duality and complexity of hydrological behavior of karst systems pose challenges in precipitation streamflow modelling reliable hydrological models with high temporal resolution are warranted for predicting floods in humid flood prone karst dominated basins this study proposes a grid based distributed karst xin anjiang hydrological model dk xaj the model structure of each grid was developed using the conceptual xin anjiang model water exchange among each grid and the spatial heterogeneities of land use types and the karstification in each grid were considered information on two new linear reservoirs was added to represent the rapid conduit and slow matrix underground flow to improve the karst dual porosities the range of the underground runoff partitioning parameter was estimated from the observed flood recessions new hydrological insights the dk xaj model demonstrated good successive hourly streamflow modelling performance with mean values of 0 84 0 83 0 28 and 0 88 for nse kge rre and r 2 and results during validation of one nested interior grid without recalibration was also good the results indicate that the dk xaj model can help obtain detailed results for successive streamflow processes the peaks of floods under different magnitudes and the marked increase and recession of the flash floods can be accurately reproduced and depicted the dk xaj model can therefore be considered a new tool for the prediction of sub daily precipitation streamflow and flood events in karst dominated basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords karst hydrology xinanjiang hydrological model distributed hydrological model hourly successive streamflow simulation 1 introduction approximately 25 of the groundwater resources in the world are supplied by karst aquifer systems ford and williams 2007 and these systems are characterised by complicated heterogeneity and hydrological processes bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 the increasing risk of occurrence of extreme climate change scenarios continues to exert additional pressure on hydrological systems and the probability of flash floods in karst watersheds is likely to increase gázquez et al 2016 construction of a robust flood prediction scheme using hydrological models is one of the most important flood prevention countermeasures for karst dominated basins however precise modelling and prediction of the water dynamics in karst terrains are challenging the most significant feature of karst aquifers is their dual porosity i e matrix and conduits and a duality of hydrological behaviours is shown in the process and storage dynamics of karst systems hartmann et al 2014 water percolates rapidly through the conduits causing rapid recharge of underground flow and high flow velocity in contrast the main component of the water that promotes recharge of the matrix is diffusive and infiltrates slowly exhibiting less flow velocity bakalowicz 2005 schiperski et al 2016 the highly dynamic streamflow is dominated by groundwater which poses challenges in the obtainment of data via direct measurements lauber and goldscheider 2014 zirlewagen et al 2016 karst systems exhibit high heterogeneity and anisotropism bakalowicz 2005 and the spatial and temporal variation in the recharge area can lead to the establishment of a complicated hydrodynamic interaction between the water present on the surface and that existing underground ford and williams 2007 white 2018 these aspects limit the applicability of many hydrological models indicating that the use of hydrological models to provide adequate representations of karst systems remains a challenge hartmann et al 2014 jeannin et al 2021 various approaches have been applied to characterise the hydrological processes of karst systems including the use of lumped and distributed models the lumped modelling approach is used to conceptualise the general physical processes including those of the entire aquifer while the detailed physical relationships and spatial variability are not explicitly considered most lumped karst hydrological models are implemented by using a series of linear or non linear reservoirs to represent the different storage and spring components within a karst aquifer dubois et al 2020 duran et al 2020 eris and wittenberg 2015 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2012 jukić and denić jukić 2009 long 2015 tritz et al 2011 few existing lumped hydrological models have been modified by adding information on a structure that can account for the karst hydrological processes when using the lumped approach as lumped hydrological models are structurally simple with a less number of parameters and low input data requirements satisfactory simulation performances can be obtained and such models are widely applied however the simple structures of lumped models imply that these models are generally not sufficient to describe karst hydrological processes as the simulation performance is limited hartmann et al 2014 because lumped models cannot account for such spatially variable hydrological processes knöll et al 2020 the distributed modelling approach can better account for the spatial variability of karst systems and therefore demonstrates considerable potential to be utilised for boosting the simulation capability necessary for investigating karst hydrological systems bailly comte et al 2012 bittner et al 2018 doummar et al 2012 malard et al 2016 ollivier et al 2020 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 but the scale and characteristics of a karst catchment should be still considered in distributed modelling too jeannin et al 2021 distributed modelling can aid the provision of detailed information about temporal and spatial hydrological processes but present with the drawback of high computational data consumption distributed karst hydrological models are based on the hydrological processes of aquifers or systems at markedly smaller scales and cannot be directly used for precipitation streamflow and flood forecasting in karst dominated basins few distributed hydrological models have been modified to be utilised for hydrological modelling of surface streamflow an improved dhsvm distributed hydrological model was therefore developed and applied to a small karst catchment 1 5 km2 in china by modifying the flow routing estimation methods for porous darcy flow fissure flow and underground channel flow zhang et al 2011 and the findings provided new insights into the dynamic interaction between stored groundwater and surface water in karst terrains li et al 2021 modified the runoff generation algorithm and the underground river confluence module in the liuxihe model and reported the development of an improved karst liuxihe ikl model that could help simulate the annual runoff and flood events for a small karstic watershed 13 1 km2 the methods used to discretise the karst system have been established and included in the modflow cfp model according to the experience gathered in the karst modelling challenge jeannin et al 2021 the size and characteristics of the basin in the karst modelling should be considered and karst hydrological models taking in account the spatial heterogeneity for a small catchment 12 km2 does not provide better than models without considering spatial heterogeneity while for large basins with significant relief spatial variability the spatial aspect must be considered in general these physically based distributed models are usually operated using high resolution input data e g hydraulic properties aquifer geometry conduit geometry and details of the conduit network hartmann et al 2014 such data cannot be easily obtained on a large scale and there is a danger of over parametrisation which may lead to the observation of poor performance in terms of model calibration morrissey et al 2021 thus the applicability of physically based distributed models to large scale karst dominated basins remains limited hartmann et al 2014 jukić and denić jukić 2009 robineau et al 2018 as an important transition from traditional lumped models to more powerful physically based distributed models a conceptually based distributed modelling approach that is based on the combination of lumped conceptual and distributed model features was developed koren et al 2004 the conceptually based distributed hydrological model demonstrates advantages of applicability in the assessment of the spatial variability of hydrological factors even when less information is available on the spatial distribution of the underlying surface li et al 2019 proposed an improved liuxihe distributed hydrological model which used the muskingum routing method to conceptualised the underground runoff this model considered spatial heterogeneities i e land use karst geology within the model domain and obtained a satisfied simulation result in flood forecasting of large karst dominated basin 58 270 km2 hartmann et al 2013 developed a semi distributed karst hydrological model varkarst which considered the spatial heterogeneity using a function to describe the distributions of soil and epikarst storages vertical hydraulic conductivities the separation into diffuse and concentrated recharge and the groundwater hydraulic conductivities and this model had been tested in several large karst basins and shown to be enough to obtain stable integrated discharge and its variability hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the importance of assessing changes in the patterns of land use impacting the execution of studies for sustainable water resource management in karstic regions continues to increase bittner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 sarrazin et al 2018 as it is necessary for a karst hydrological model to be utilised to account for the spatial distribution in land use properties several studies have revealed that karst terrains with high spatial heterogeneity can exert an evident impact on flood processes delrieu et al 2005 zanon et al 2010 le mesnil et al 2021 during flood seasons the hydraulic connections between the different karst water storage media are promoted higher water infiltration from rivers during storm events leading to higher water infiltration and lateral outflow into the stream carrière et al 2016 resulting in the generation of a rapid hydrological response and flash floods that are concentrated over a short period concurrently an increase in the groundwater level results in reduced infiltration lópez chicano et al 2002 and the back flooding and surging which occur in sinkholes may further increase events of surface runoff maréchal et al 2008 le mesnil et al 2021 under these conditions the streamflow hydrographs for the karst dominated basin are likely to present a steep rise limb and recession chen et al 2008 with successive multi peaks thus high temporal resolution is indispensable for understanding and illustrating the complicated hydrological dynamics of karst flash floods and a fine time step is also essential for forecasting flood events jodar abellan et al 2019 yu et al 2018 jeannin et al 2021 however data on the temporal resolutions of most karst flood simulations that are based on the use of distributed models including modified swat based models malagò et al 2016 martínez salvador and conesa garcía 2020 reza eini et al 2020 are achieved daily thereby homogenising the flood peak processes that occur over a period of one day the complexity of the rapid response of the karst flood process is therefore not effectively reproduced implying that the method is insufficient for the construction of effective flood forecasting schemes calculation of hydrological processes in hourly time steps is important to understand instantaneous changes in flash floods and to provide timely warnings on flood events for flood prone karst dominated basins to the best of our knowledge few studies have been conducted in which sub daily streamflow modelling has been performed in a large karst dominated basin to explicitly account for karst hydrology the aim of this work was therefore to develop a new conceptually based distributed karst hydrological model referred to as the distributed karst xinanjiang dk xaj model which could be used for flood simulation and forecasting with hourly time steps and that could account for karst hydrological processes and the spatial variabilities of the underlying surface in the present study information on the explicit representation of land use properties was added to the dk xaj model by improving the runoff generation estimation methods for different land use types and some parameters were spatially distributed using available spatial information i e land use and soil texture the objectives of this research were 1 to propose a new grid based distributed karst hydrological model that could help simulate successive hourly precipitation streamflow in a karst dominated basin 2 to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the basin properties by identifying land use types and karstification geology in the model structure 3 to evaluate the model performance via hydrographs and fdcs and analyse the uncertainty of precipitation streamflow modelling 4 to evaluate the applicability of the lumped xin anjiang hydrological model and dk xaj model in the prediction of streamflow processes for high karst coverage sub basins without recalibration and 5 to quantitatively estimate the influence exerted by rapid karst underground flow on the flood response 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data availability the hekou karst basin hkb is located in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region in southwestern china with an elevation ranging from 82 to 1503 m a s l and a drainage area of 1044 km2 fig 1 a the existence of a humid subtropical monsoon climate implies that the hkb receives abundant rainfall and sunshine with average annual precipitation of 1494 mm and annual evapotranspiration of 854 mm however precipitation is distributed in an uneven manner for over a year the flood season in the hkb is from may to august and accounts for 66 of the average annual precipitation the predominant soil texture is clay 50 followed by loam 26 and silt 7 the main stream within the hkb is the diao river on which two hydrological stations are located namely jiuxu and hekou see fig 1 b the hekou hydrological station is located at the outlet of the hkb and the jiuxu hydrological station is located at the outlet of a tributary present downstream of the diao river the hydrogeology data used in this work are ngrc database http en ngac org cn which describes the properties of hydrogeological entities and aquifers in diao river basin drb edited by the regional geological survey research institute of guangxi zhuang autonomous region china the original data is the hydrogeological map of the drb with a scale of 1 100 000 where rock formations are detailed marked and the hkb is a sub basin of the whole drb karst typically develops from carbonate rocks such as limestone consisting of the mineral calcite dolomite rock and dolostone consisting of the mineral dolomite we grouped the hkb into three different karst terrain types based on different geological formations in the original hydrogeological map the area of carbonate formation whose lithologies mainly are dolomite and limestone is classified as strongly developed karst terrain the area of carbonate intercalated clastic rock formation whose lithology mainly is marlstone is classified as moderately developed karst terrain and the area of clastic rock formation whose lithologies mainly are sandstone and mudstone is classified as poorly developed karst terrain i e non karst terrain the local geology in the hkb is dominated by a substantial area 802 km2 of carbonate based e g limestone dolomites strongly and moderately developed karst terrains cover approximately 77 of the entire basin with only small parts see fig 1 c of the basin consisting of non carbonate rocks e g sandstone mudstone i e poorly developed karst terrains the jiuxu karst basin jkb is a high karst coverage sub basin with an area of 262 km2 and a drainage area that is almost completely covered by strongly developed karst terrains see fig 1 b and c owing to the high karstification e g the presence of well developed fissures conduits and swallow holes in the strongly developed karst terrains the infiltration of recharge into the karst aquifer can be very quick and flash floods are common events occurring in the basin during flood seasons when the degree of saturation in the karst aquifer system is high in the present study six precipitation gauges showing homogenous distribution over the hkb were used for data collection see fig 1 b data concerning the streamflow discharge precipitation and pan evaporation were collected from the hydrological stations data on both streamflow discharge and precipitation were recorded with a time interval of 1 h and information on pan evaporation was recorded daily since the main purpose of this study was to formulate a flood forecasting scheme based on the application of the dk xaj model it was suggested that precipitation streamflow modelling during the flood seasons 1st may to 31st aug should be investigated hydrological data were provided by the guangxi centre for hydrology gxch further information describing the data used is provided in table 1 the spatial geology data used in this study include the dem soil texture land use type and information about the karst geology which were downloaded from the open access databases as shown in table 1 2 2 the dk xaj model 2 2 1 overview of xaj model and its application in karst dominated basins the xin anjiang xaj model is a lumped conceptual hydrological model based on a saturation excess mechanism proposed by zhao 1992 this conceptual hydrological model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model e g black box model and a physically based distributed karst hydrological model which has relatively fewer parameters than the physical based distributed karst hydrological model and can generally reflect physical relationships through conceptualization of the basins in humid regions the xaj model has been widely applied in chinese humid and semi humid regions for streamflow simulation and forecasting jayawardena and zhou 2000 jiang et al 2007 su et al 2003 zhang and chiew 2009 the xaj model has the potential of obtaining relatively accurate flood simulation results in karst dominated basins with a parsimonious model structure and a small number of parameters compared to other physical based distributed karst hydrological models however the lack of specific development for karst landforms limits the application of the xaj model for karst dominated basins attempts have also been conducted using the improved xaj model to perform a hydrological simulation of karstic basins zhou et al 2019 coupled the xaj model with a two reservoir based karst model to simulate an event of runoff in a chinese karstic basin and found that the improved k xaj model generated better runoff forecasts compared with the traditional xaj model however this improved lumped xaj model has not accounted for the spatial variability in the underlying factors of karst basins i e land use type karst geology yang et al 2020 reported the development of a parallel linear reservoir modelling approach integrated with a grid based distributed xaj model to simulate the hourly flood events over karstic catchment however this improved conceptually distributed xaj model neglects the spatial variability of karst landforms and land use types thus the aim of this work was therefore to develop a new parsimonious conceptually based distributed karst hydrological model which was improved from xaj model and could be used for flood simulation and forecasting in humid flood prone karst dominated basins with hourly time steps and that could account for karst hydrological processes and the spatial variabilities of the underlying surface e g karst geology and land use types 2 2 2 improvement for dual porosity in karst terrains the vadose zones soil epikarst infiltration zone of karst systems are complex environments where soil is mixed with rock elements i e porosities fracture and there are notable spatial variations ollivier et al 2020 it is difficult to obtain field measurements data that could help separate and identify epikarst form vadose zone in large scale karst dominated basin on the other hand to characterise epikarst structure and heterogeneity in distributed karst hydrological models of a large basin is also difficult thus there is only one reservoir used to represent the behavior of the storage and recharge dynamics by the combined action of soil and epikarst in most studies fleury et al 2007 pointed out that the linear reservoir used for representing the slow matrix flow may include all levels of the aquifer from the epikarst to the saturated zone as well as storage in the infiltration zone in order to overcome the shortcomings of not being modified in the runoff generation module specifically for the epikarst the duality of slow and diffuse underground flow in matrix and rapid and concentrated flow in the karst conduits has been considered in the dk xaj model in this study owing to the difficulty in obtaining knowledge on the heterogeneous underground recharge and karst conduit network on a large scale i e a basin the commonly used lumped conceptually based modelling approach schmidt et al 2014 fleury et al 2007 mazzilli et al 2019 ollivier et al 2020 was introduced to represent the key feature of dual porosity in karst systems in the dk xaj model the transfer function that is used to describe flow routing mechanism in karst systems consists of two parallel linear reservoirs the first represents the underground rapid conduit flow and the second represents the underground slow matrix flow the two newly added reservoirs are coupled to the free water storage reservoir in the runoff separation module of the original conceptual xaj model in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity of karst geology in the model the hill slope cells are further divided into strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells according to the karst geology in hkb see fig 1 and different reservoir parameters are used for strongly and moderately developed karst terrains two new parameters the groundwater portioning coefficients of strongly developed karst terrain gwpc s and moderately developed karst terrain gwpc m were introduced to describe the partitioning of the underground runoff and the parameters helped represent the partitioning of the rapid conduit runoff rg 1 in the total underground runoff rg wherein gwpc s rg 1 rg and gwpc m rg 1 rg the yield of the total underground runoff was further divided into two parts according to gwpc s and 1 gwpc s or gwpc m and 1 gwpc m for moderately developed karst cells using the following equations 1 rg 1 rg g w p c m 2 rg 2 rg 1 g w p c m for strongly developed karst cells using the following equations 3 rg 1 rg g w p c s 4 rg 2 rg 1 g w p c s for poorly developed karst cells i e non karst terrain cells the rg was not further divided for the strongly and moderately developed karst terrain cells the total runoff was subdivided into four components by using an improved free water reservoir that has been developed from the free water reservoir in the original xaj model yang et al 2020 the structures variables and related parameters of the improved free water reservoir for strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells are shown in fig 2 challenges exist in the quantification of the contribution percentages from which the matrix is recharged and the conduit flows in the transfer functions and the variation in the recharge sources under different magnitudes of precipitation may differ to study the influence exerted by different precipitation scenarios on the gwpc mean value of gwpc s and gwpc m nine karst flood recessions recorded at the hekou hydrological station during 2014 and 2016 were selected to analyse and deduce the range of the two parameters this method was used to analyse the features of the different components of karst systems chang et al 2015 geyer et al 2008 in this study precipitation events with cumulative precipitation greater than 50 mm were considered as heavy precipitation events and precipitation events with cumulative precipitation less than 50 mm were considered as moderate precipitation events all nine karst flood recession hydrographs were separated into two stages namely the rapid flow drainage stage and the slow flow drainage stage to represent the recessions of a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer as a single exponential decrease chang et al 2015 a simple mathematical model proposed by maillet 1905 was selected to simulate karst flood recessions in the rapid flow drainage stage and the slow flow drainage stage and the model has been expressed as follows 5 q t q 0 e α t where q t represents the flow discharge at time t q 0 represents the slow matrix rapid conduit flow discharge when the matrix conduit dominated flow period starts and α represents the recession coefficient the recession coefficients of conduit and matrix reservoirs are represented by α1 and α2 respectively for each karst flood recession the partitioning of the underground runoff which reaches the conduit reservoir is defined based on the fitting observed on the recession hydrograph the results from all nine selected recessions provide data on the ranges of the gwpc s and gwpc m for further parameter optimisation analysis 2 3 model structure and foundation development of the dk xaj model was based on the first version of the model proposed by yang et al 2020 compared with other distributed karst models the main advantage of the dk xaj model is that it can express a certain physical meaning with a parsimonious model structure and less computing resources which is suitable for flood forecasting in karst dominated basins the spatial variabilities of underlying surface factors i e karst geology and land use types and water exchange among each grid cell have been considered in the model structure the dk xaj model consists of four modules namely an evapotranspiration module a runoff generation module a runoff separation module and a flow routing module which were developed from modules with the same function as those used in the original conceptual xaj hydrological model zhao 1992 yang et al 2020 the derived information was extracted using the raster format of the topographic map of the basin the entire basin has been categorised into several horizontal square grid cells whose information was derived from the raster format of the dem data each grid cell is considered a basic computational element the structure of the dk xaj model is illustrated in fig 3 the grid cells are divided into hill slope cells and river channel cells according to the flow accumulation values of each cell and the actual drainage network see fig 3 a the simulated runoff in each component e g surface and interflow runoff is routed from the upstream to downstream hill slope cells and most downstream hill slope cells are connected to the river channel cells indicating that the runoff in the river channel cells is routed in a cellwise manner to the basin outlet in reality the entire terrain within the basin is not covered by karst landforms thus the structure of the model should be improved to simultaneously comply with the needs of hydrological modelling in both karst terrain and in non karst terrain as mentioned above the dk xaj model is used to classify the hill slope cells as strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells see fig 2 to identify the types of karst terrain covered in a cell simultaneously information on the explicit representation of land use properties is added to the dk xaj model via modification of its runoff generation estimation methods 2 3 1 evapotranspiration module in the dk xaj model when the land use type of one hill slope cell is farmland forestland or grassland a three layer evapotranspiration estimation scheme developed on the basis of the original xaj model is used the evapotranspiration module calculated using each hill slope cell is related to the potential evapotranspiration through a three layer soil moisture model and this aids the categorisation of the soil into upper lower and deeper layers the detailed flowchart of calculation processes is shown in fig 4 the actual evapotranspiration in each computational element is the sum of the evapotranspiration yield in these three layers zhao 1992 when the land use type of one hill slope cell is a water body or settlement the evapotranspiration calculation scheme is different for a water body cell the evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 6 e w t e p t where e w t represents the evapotranspiration of one hill slope cell in which the land use type is water body at time t and e p t represents the observed pan evaporation at time t for a settlement cell the evapotranspiration is calculated using 7 e s t k e p t if p s t 0 0 if p s t 0 where e s t and e p t represent the evapotranspiration in one settlement cell and the observed pan evaporation at time t respectively k represents the reduction coefficient of evaporation and p s t represents the precipitation of this settlement cell at time t it is suggested that evapotranspiration will occur only when precipitation is greater than zero in the settlement cell at time t 2 3 2 runoff generation module in the dk xaj model the runoff generation calculation was performed only for the hill slope cells the runoff generation calculation performed in each hill slope cell was related to its land use type for different land use types such as forestland grassland or farmland the runoff generation calculation conforms to the mechanism of saturation excess zhao 1992 yang et al 2020 and is based on the assumption that the runoff generation occurs only upon repletion of the tension water capacity it has been confirmed by several applications that the mechanism of saturation excess is capable of precipitation runoff modelling in humid karst dominated basins in china zhou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2021 in the dk xaj model it is assumed that only surface runoff is produced in the hill slope cells for which the land use type includes water bodies or settlements and the runoff yield is governed by the following equations 8 r w t p t e w t 9 r s t p t e s t where e w t and e s t represent the evapotranspiration of the water body cell and the settlement cell at time t respectively p t represents the precipitation at the grid cell through the thiessen interpolation method at time t and r w t and r s t represent the runoff yields of the water body and the settlement cells at time t respectively it is noticed that the water exchange among each cell has been considered in the dk xaj model for water bodies and settlements cells that only produce surface runoff while the interflow and underground flow which are the lateral inflow from adjacent cells are still exist to better account for the spatial variation in the runoff generation parameters parameter estimation methods based on geographical information were used yao et al 2012 proposed methods to estimate the runoff generation parameters tension water capacity wm and free water capacity sm using geographically based information the wm and sm are defined as 10 wm θ fc θ wp l a 11 sm θ s θ fc l h where θ s represents the saturated moisture content θ fc represents the field capacity θ wp represents the wilting point l a represents the thickness of the aeration zone and l h represents the thickness of the humus soil layer the values of θ s θ wp and θ fc in each grid were estimated based on the soil texture distribution map see appendix b fig b 1 a in accordance with the methods described by anderson et al 2006 l a and l h are determined based on the values that are directly measured at sampling points which are established according to the different types of soil texture and land use types in the hkb the spatial patterns of the estimated wm and sm for the dk xaj model have been illustrated in appendix b fig b 1 b and c 2 3 3 runoff separation module the free water storage reservoir developed based on the principles of the original conceptual xaj model zhao 1992 is used to categorise the total runoff into surface runoff rs interflow runoff ri and underground runoff rg for cells that demonstrate the land use types farmland forestland and grassland when the land use type of one cell is a water body or settlement only rs is considered as the runoff component for strongly and moderately developed karst cells an improved free water reservoir is introduced which has been descripted in section 2 2 2 for poorly developed karst cells the free water reservoir is identical to that in the original xaj model zhao 1992 with surface interflow and underground runoff components 2 3 4 flow routing module different equations are adopted for assessing flow routing by hill slope cells and river channel cells in the dk xaj model based on the computation order matrix various runoff components rs ri rg 1 rg 2 and rg are subjected to routing over the hill slope cells to the river channel cells as lateral inflow and the flow routing distribution methods of hill slope cell to hill slope cell hill slope cell to river channel cell and river channel cell to river channel cell are all determined by the computation order matrix yao et al 2009 yao et al 2012 li and zhang 2008 the processing procedures of the computation order matrix has been elaborated in the appendix a linear reservoirs linsley 1967 are used to calculate the flow routing processes of each runoff component in the hill slope cells two components in underground runoff exist if the cell is a moderately or strongly developed karst cell in the runoff separation module while only one component exists if the cell is a poorly developed karst cell for a moderately or strongly developed karst cell two linear reservoirs are used to describe the flow routing of the rapid and slow underground runoff and the flow routing equations of the other runoff components rs and ri in the poorly developed cells are the same as those of the karst cell the cell to cell flow routing of interflow and underground flow for hill slope cells are illustrated in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a for each moderately and strongly developed karst terrain cell two karst reservoirs are utilized for simulating the flow routing of both the rapid and the slow underground runoff at time t the surface interflow rapid underground slow underground runoff are routed through linear reservoirs the total outflows of all runoff components for the hill slope cell j are composed of two parts which are the runoff yield generated in the cell j itself and the outflows routed from all upstream hill slop cells as illustrated in fig 5 a tqg 1 j is added to tqg 2 j to become the total underground flow tqg j at time t using the following equations 12 tqs j t

underground runoff that are generated in the upstream hill slope cell n and flows to the current cell j for all hill slope cells tqs j tqi j and tqg j are then added to serve as the total lateral inflow tq j to its adjacent river channel cell according to the computation order matrix and tq j is given by the following equations 20 tq j t tqs j t tqi j t tqg j t in the dk xaj model a river channel cell presents with the total lateral inflows from the hill slope cells whose outflows are based on the flow directions of each grid cell based on the computation order matrix the flow in a

were included in the dk xaj model shown in table 2 and most were selected based on previous experience using the original xaj model to describe the humid regions of china additionally the ranges of the newly proposed parameters i e gwpc m gwpc s have been determined by the results of karst flood recession analysis based on the previous experience of applying the xaj model in humid regions of china cg usually takes a value between 0 99 and 0 998 which roughly indicating the recession duration of the base flow is about 20 500 days in the basin zhao 1992 cg 1 and cg 2 the recession constants of rapid and slow groundwater used for strongly and moderately developed karst hill slope cell thus refer to the initial range of parameter cg 2 4 model calibration and validation 2 4 1 evaluation of model performances several indicators were used to demonstrate the quality of the simulation results to evaluate the performance of the dk xaj and xaj models the objective of this study was the formulation of a reliable flood prediction scheme for the hkb therefore important criteria such as the relative runoff error rre relative flood peak error rpe flood peak time error pte h and the deterministic coefficient dc i e nash sutcliffe efficiency of the accuracy standard for hydrological forecasting in china ashf the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 were considered as a measure of performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse has been expressed as follows 21 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q o 2 where q s i and q 0 i represent the simulated and observed streamflow discharge at each time step i respectively q 0 represents the average of the observed streamflow discharge series and n represents the total number of observation periods rre is defined as follows 22 rre r s r o r o 100 where r s and r 0 represent the simulated and observed runoff volumes respectively the model performance was also evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency kge and the coefficient of determination r 2 the kge is a multi objective function that was originally proposed by gupta et al 2009 and compared with the traditional nse the kge demonstrates a limited bias in evaluating high flow discharge values kge can be expressed as follows 23 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r represents the correlation coefficient α represents the ratio between the standard deviation of the simulated and the observed streamflow discharge and β represents the ratio between the average simulated and observed streamflow discharge nse kge rre and r 2 were considered as performance indicators to evaluate the successive hourly streamflow spanning the entire year to effectively evaluate the simulation results of the complex karst flash flood processes the rpe and pt e should be included and are defined as follows 24 rpe q sp q op q op 100 25 pte t sp t op where q op represents the observed flood peak discharge q sp represents the simulated flood peak discharge t op represents the observed flood peak time and t sp represents the simulated flood peak time 2 4 2 estimation of parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty it is necessary for hydrological modelling with high accuracy to make an uncertainty analysis in this study a parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analysis were conducted using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 in this study dk xaj was calibrated using 16 parameters related to evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff separation hill slope flow routing and river channel flow routing module the remaining parameters b c ex wdm were assigned based on the experience and were excluded from all uncertainty and modelling result analyses the sensitivity of model parameters was analyzed using the calibration period of observed as single time series data the nse was chosen as the likelihood measure and the threshold value which was used to identify behavioral from non behavioral parameter sets of nse was set as 0 60 the glue simulation run was performed with sample sizes of 6000 within the physically meaningful ranges of the parameters see table 2 then the results of glue runs whose likelihood measure value larger than 0 60 were used to summarized the 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu at the same time two indices p and r factor abbaspour et al 2015 were employed for quantitative evaluation of the prediction uncertainty of validation period the range for p and r factor is 0 1 and 0 respectively when the p factor and r factor are closer to 1 and 0 respectively there will be a good match between the simulations and the observations abbaspour 2013 2 4 3 calibration of streamflow in the hkb both the calibration and validation periods considered covered the entire years from jan 1st to dec 31st in each year with a 720 time step one month warm up stage which was excluded from all uncertainty and modelling result analyses the sce ua approach duan et al 1993 which has previously been applied for optimisation of various of hydrological model parameters trošelj and lee 2021 zeng et al 2018 was used for the model calibration the nse was used as the objective function the results of parameter sensitive analysis were used for optimisation the experience gained while performing calibration of the xaj model to describe the humid regions of china was considered while performing calibration of the final model parameters and methods were based on a combination of algorithmic and trial and error approaches yang et al 2020 however certain runoff generation parameters are directly determined by adopting prior estimation methods based on the topography and soil texture data and the range of the newly proposed parameter and adoption of such an approach account for the duality of karst systems the applicability of such an approach is determined by the characteristics of karst flood recessions in the hkb the model describing the whole year of 2014 was used for conducting calibration and the same final optimal parameter set derived from the calibration was used for investigating all six years in the validation periods 3 results 3 1 characteristics of karst flood recessions in the hkb the results of detailed analysis of the recession curves are shown in appendix c the estimated values of α1 α2 and mean gwpc under different antecedent cumulative amounts of precipitation are of the same order of magnitude the mean values of α1 and α2 under heavy precipitation conditions are 0 027 and 0 010 respectively which are markedly similar to those 0 024 and 0 006 respectively obtained under moderate precipitation conditions the estimated values of mean gwpc for heavy and moderate precipitation are 0 28 and 0 32 respectively and the values seem to exhibit less remarkable differences the distributions of α1 α2 and mean gwpc are depicted in fig 6 using boxplots as demonstrated in fig 6 c the mean gwpc values range from 0 16 to 0 48 with a mean of 0 28 under moderate precipitation conditions and range from 0 21 to 0 46 with a mean of 0 32 under heavy precipitation conditions this implies that slow flow contributes more than 50 of the total underground runoff yield indicating that the matrix flow dominates the recharge process and this observation is identical to the finding reported by mudarra and andreo 2011 and wang et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 c most values of mean gwpc are higher under heavy precipitation conditions than those under moderate precipitation conditions wang et al 2020 have suggested that contribution of conduits is dominated by the degree to which the aquifer is saturated the heavier the rainfall in the basin the higher the saturation of the karst aquifer thus conduit flow will contribute toward an increase in water levels in the total underground runoff finally optimisation of the parameter gwpc s was conducted over the range 0 29 0 4 and gwpc m was conducted over the range 0 15 0 28 3 2 establishment of the dk xaj model spatial resolution is a crucial factor in distributed hydrological modelling the higher the spatial resolution the more accurate the modelling of the terrain properties and processes however more computation resources should be used considering the availability of spatial data and the limited computing power in the present study the spatial resolution of the dk xaj model was defined and established as 1 km 1 km based on this resolution the entire hkb has been divided into 1391 grid cells including 1309 hill slope cells and 82 river channel cells see fig 7 b karst terrain cells and non karst terrain cells were identified based on karst topography using the gis technology with 562 strongly developed karst cells 465 moderately developed karst cells and 282 poorly developed karst cells included as hill slope cells see fig 7 e data on the fundamental features of the basin such as flow direction flow accumulation and drainage stream networks are obtained by using the dem and data will be used as input for the dk xaj model it is noted that the spatial distribution of hydrogeology information about rock formations can be obtained by field survey but the knowledge relative to the karst conduit network and fracture characteristics is rarely available at basin scale therefore the flow direction in hkb is obtained only used the dem the direction and accumulation of flow in each dem cell were calculated by implementing the eight neighbor method after which data on the drainage network were extracted o callaghan 1984 thereafter information on the matrix of grid cells in the dem can be acquired fairfield 1991 there exist 65 levels in the flow routing computation order for the hkb as shown in fig 7 e additionally information on land use soil texture karst geology and precipitation interpolation are also considered spatially distributed input variables for utilisation in the dk xaj model the input precipitation for each cell is based on adoption of the thiessen interpolation method and the thiessen polygon partitions over the hkb are illustrated in fig 7 f 3 3 uncertainty analysis results 3 3 1 sensitivity of parameters the dotty plots of objective function versus parameters for all behavioral and non behavioral simulations are showed in fig 8 which depict the goodness of fit response surface projected onto individual parameter dimensions and help to identify the corresponding sensitive range the reason for the distribution of dots multiplied by vertical lines in fig 8 i m n is that the uniform sampling interval in monte carlo sampling framework is set to 0 01 the parameters corresponding to fig 8 i m n are cg cg 1 and cg 2 respectively whose values range from 0 99 to 0 998 when the uniform distribution sampling interval is 0 01 the sampling points will appear as the shape of the vertical distributions as seen from the fig 8 the relatively concentrated distribution of behavioral simulations towards lower values when projected onto the parameter ranges of sm ki x mc as well as towards higher values of cs indicating higher sensitivity of hourly streamflow simulation to these calibration parameters on the other hand the scatters of non behavioral simulations are distributed nearly across the whole range of the other parameters shown in fig 8 reflecting lower sensitivity on the whole free water capacity sm of runoff generation module outflow coefficient of free water capacity to interflow ki of runoff separation module recession constant of surface flow cs of hill slope flow routing module and weight coefficient of muskingum cunge method x mc of river channel flow routing module were the most sensitive parameters affecting streamflow simulation whose sensitivity ranges were used as the basis for parameter optimization 3 3 2 uncertainty of modelling results the continuous hourly streamflow prediction versus observed values of each year in validation is shown in fig 9 the upper and lower prediction bounds were generated with behavioral model runs identified in year 2014 using the nse likelihood measure as seen from the fig 9 a and b most of the observations are bracketed by the 95ppu p factor 0 74 of the hydrograph and fdc however it is noticed that the relatively high uncertainty occurred during low flow than high flow period which is verified by both hydrograph fig 9 a and fdc fig 9 b the relatively large r factor value 1 33 indicated larger uncertainties may still remain in streamflow simulation and the overpredicted 95ppu may be caused by the glue method itself setegn et al 2010 3 4 simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models 3 4 1 results at the basin outlet the proposed dk xaj and xaj models were used for conducting successive hourly streamflow simulations in the hkb with the obtainment of performance indicators via comparison of the observed and simulated streamflow at the outlet of the entire hkb the performances of the two models obtained during calibration and validation are summarised in table 3 the results in table 3 demonstrate that the mean values of nse kge rre and r 2 based on the dk xaj model are 0 84 0 83 0 28 and 0 88 while those based on the xaj model are 0 64 0 49 43 64 and 0 74 respectively these results indicate a good match between the observed discharge and simulations using both dk xaj and xaj models meanwhile all indicators were improved by using the new proposed model implying that the dk xaj model outperformed the traditional lumped xaj model for successive hourly streamflow modelling over a karst dominated basin the simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for the calibration and validation periods are depicted in fig 10 3 4 2 results for the nested interior grid the dk xaj is a distributed karst hydrological model based on dem grid and as observed in several grid based xaj models huang et al 2016 yao et al 2009 yao et al 2012 and not only the streamflow processes at the outlet but the processes of any grid within the basin can be simulated by using the dk xaj model to further validate the performance of the dk xaj and xaj models for flood simulation and to test the utility of the two models in the direct simulation of the precipitation streamflow for a nested interior grid with an upstream drainage area i e high karst coverage sub basin that was almost covered by the strongly developed karst terrains without parameter recalibration the dk xaj and xaj models were used to simultaneously output the successive hourly streamflow processes of the hkb and jkb the model evaluation results of the jkb for the validation are also listed in table 3 the values of nse kge rre and r 2 that were obtained using the dk xaj model for the validation period over the jkb were 0 81 0 74 9 63 and 0 85 while those based on the xaj model were 0 71 0 78 1 78 and 0 75 respectively similar to the validation results of the hkb the simulation results of the jkb via application of the two models show an acceptable match between the observed and the simulated streamflow time series see fig 10 and table 3 however only nse and r 2 showed improvements when the dk xaj model was used indicating that the dk xaj model did not possess a more robust ability to reproduce streamflow over high karst coverage sub basins the simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for the validation period are shown in fig 10 b 3 4 3 assessment of the results using fdc according to the selected performance indicators application of both dk xaj and xaj model yielded acceptable results for the hkb with the obtainment of mean nse values of 0 84 and 0 64 respectively for the two models during validation the mean values of nse and r 2 in table 3 indicated that there were no significant differences between the dk xaj and xaj models for the outlet and interior streamflow simulations in both calibration and validation periods and that the dk xaj performances over validation were significantly better than those of the xaj model for the kge and rre furthermore the scatter diagrams illustrating the observed and simulated streamflow discharge during the validation period 2015 2020 see appendix d fig d 1 showed obvious underestimation in the simulated results when the xaj model was used for both the hkb and jkb the model performance indicators listed in section 2 4 1 were used to assess the overall streamflow simulation processes during the flood seasons to further evaluate the abilities of the dk xaj and xaj models to be used for simulation of different magnitudes of streamflow fdcs were used the fdc is defined as the flow exceedance probability curve smakhtin 2001 vogel and fennessey 1995 which summarises the ability of a basin to produce different magnitudes of flow yilmaz et al 2008 in karst hydrology fdcs are used to assess the range and variability of spring discharge and to identify the key features of karst systems hartmann et al 2013 sapač et al 2020 torresan et al 2020 because they can be used to reflect the regimes of flow under conditions of different porosities e g conduits and matrix the fdc has also been used as a performance indicator in karst hydrological modelling sezen et al 2019 the fdcs at the outlet of the hkb and jkb during the calibration and validation periods are depicted in fig 11 a and b respectively to quantitatively evaluate the simulated flow at different magnitudes yilmaz et al 2008 suggested that the fdc could be partitioned into the following three segments which could be used to characterise the different responses to precipitation in each basin 1 the high flow segment 2 the intermediate flow segment and 3 the low flow segment correspondingly the three diagnostic measures biasfhv biasfms and biasflv are proposed for evaluation of the model performances of the high intermediate and low flow segments respectively detailed information is provided in yilmaz et al 2008 considering the hydrodynamics of karst aquifers hartmann et al 2013 proposed the exceedance probabilities corresponding to the high medium and low flow paths of the fdcs the fdcs were separated into the high flows exceedance probabilities 0 0 0 1 median flows 0 1 0 9 and low flows 0 9 1 0 therefore in this study we modified the original exceedance probabilities yilmaz et al 2008 corresponding to the high flow intermediate flow and low flow segments of the diagnostic measures biasfhv biasfms and biasflv diagnostic measures for both the outlet and inside locations of the hkb during the calibration and validation periods are listed in table 4 3 4 4 flood peak simulation results with different magnitudes to further comprehensively describe and compare the flood simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for a flood season the flood peaks during each flood season were selected from the successive hourly precipitation streamflow process simulations according to the necessity of issuing flood warnings at the hekou hydrological station flood events have been divided into the following three types large medium and small the term large flood refers to a peak discharge greater than 560 m3 s with a return period greater than 2 years medium flood refers to a peak discharge that is greater than 322 5 m3 s and less than 560 0 m3 s and small flood refers to a peak discharge greater than 107 5 m3 s and less than 322 5 m3 s the results of the simulated flood peaks are presented in fig 12 the simulation results of the different flood magnitudes depicted in fig 12 reveal that compared with the performance of the xaj model the dk xaj model presents a more accurate fit and better evaluation indicators in the flow simulations the mean rpes of large medium and small floods in the dk xaj model are 5 0 2 4 and 10 0 and the mean ptes of large medium and small floods are 0 0 2 and 1 3 as depicted in fig 12 compared to the xaj model the mean pte and rpe in the dk xaj model are both close to zero with evident improvements realized in terms of the simulation errors the simulation results of the flood peaks at all magnitudes indicate that the peak flow values are evidently underestimated based on the application of the xaj model with a significant lag in the simulated flood peak time the dk xaj model can also be used to obtain better results when performing simulations of medium and large floods 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the overall precipitation streamflow process simulation via consideration of the fdc the results of the study indicate that the improved dk xaj model can yield better overall precipitation streamflow modelling performance compared to the original lumped xaj models which can be proven by not only the hydrographs but also the fdcs of the basin outlet and inside location according to the results presented in fig 11 a the fdcs over hkb of the dk xaj model in the calibration and validation periods significantly fit that of the observed streamflow in all three flow segments however an evident systematic underestimation was noted in the fdc over hkb of the xaj model that was used for validation as the main purpose of this study was the establishment of a flood forecasting scheme for the hkb and as the high flow segment reflected the characteristics of the flood peaks the simulation accuracy for high flow events with flow exceedance probabilities of 0 0 1 was crucial with respect to the high flow segment simulation evaluation for the validation periods over hkb the calculated biasfhv of dk xaj was 7 80 while that of xaj was 44 03 see table 4 and the high flow segment in the fdcs of the xaj model for the basin outlet was markedly lower than those obtained via observation fig 11 a this indicates that the application of the dk xaj model can help reproduce more accurate high flow processes for the hkb than that observed with application of the xaj model information on the contributions of different components to the groundwater can be obtained by identifying the shape of the fdc a flat slope usually indicates a system with more groundwater storage capacity and a lower degree of karstification matrix slow flow in contrast a steep slope indicates a system with well developed conduits even those with subterrain rivers conduit rapid flow smakhtin 2001 as shown in fig 11 and table 4 the fdcs of the simulated low flow segments in the xaj model for both basin outlet hkb and inside location jkb are significantly lower than those obtained via observation which demonstrates that the xaj model underestimates low flow events the biasflvs of 85 51 and 1025 21 were obtained via utilisation of the xaj model during the validation period for the basin outlet and inside location respectively which were 3 13 and 64 24 times higher than those obtained using the dk xaj model moreover the low flow segments of the fdcs contained information that was related to the recession of floods that were subjected to the combined action of conduit rapid flow and matrix slow flow resulting in the presence of significantly different slopes different slopes for the low flow segments of the observed discharge values are shown in fig 11 for the basin outlet the shape of the low flow segment in the fdcs of the xaj model are extremely flat and this behaviour is associated with single component flow indicating a state of non conformation to the dual flow conditions that are observed in karst aquifer systems in the original conceptual xaj model only one reservoir has been used to represent the underground flow indicating that the results simulated using the xaj model when applied in a karst dominated basin only reflect the average dynamics and characteristics of the karst underground flow in the dk xaj model a rapid flow reservoir and a slow flow reservoir were established to represent the main pathways related to the conduit dominated and matrix dominated flows and the dk xaj model could better simulate the low flow segments of the fdcs as evidenced from the information presented in table 4 and fig 11 therefore the dk xaj model can be used to assess the hydrological behaviours of the conduit and matrix flow in the low flow segments of karst dominated basins which indicates that the improvement of the dual porosity in the model structure is effective based on the fdc characteristics it can be concluded that the dk xaj model can be used to simulate the different water storage characteristics of the hkb with more accuracy than that observed with application of the xaj model the main reason for achieving a better low flow simulation is the improvement in the dual porosity realised using the dk xaj model on the other hand the area and position of the karst terrain exert a major control on the flood response in regions that are impacted by storm events zanon et al 2010 and the spatial heterogeneity of the karst terrains in the dk xaj model can play an important role in the achievement of an accurate high flow response simulation however it should be noted that there is still the overestimation error for dk xaj model in low flow simulation which is also confirmed and depicted in the modelling uncertainty analysis in fig 9 a the dk xaj model based on the saturation excess mechanism can be used to obtain good high flow simulation results in the flood season but only the saturation excess mechanism with poor representation of epikarst may not be adequately captured the low flow segment in karst dominated basin when the soil layer in the poorly developed karst terrains and the epikarst zone in the moderately and strongly developed karst terrains are relatively dry recharge from precipitation will help prioritise storage in the epikarst soil zone and the epikarst also demonstrates functions by delaying the recharge of the karst bakalowicz 2005 fleury et al 2007 perrin et al 2003 in this case the epikarst zone will exert more marked regulation and hysteresis tritz et al 2011 on the runoff which is reflected in the small flood events and slow recession processes at the outlet of the basin in the dk xaj model a linear reservoir is used for the routing simulation in the hillslope of the matrix slow flow and epikarst is not considered in runoff generation calculations this modelling method cannot be used to fully characterise the process of storing and delaying runoff in the epikarst zone during dry and low flow conditions more than 77 of the area of the hkb is covered by moderately and strongly developed karst terrains and the impact exerted by epikarst on runoff is significant therefore when a small flood event or recession which belong to slow flow segment is simulated by using dk xaj during the low flow period the simulated flood peak is relatively large and the recession limb is steep in future studies the detailed hydrological process within the epikarst will be better conceptualized and represented in dk xaj model 4 2 evaluation of the flood process simulation for the basin outlet and inside location for a spatially distributed hydrological model not only should researchers evaluate the simulation of the outlet but should also assess the results for the inside locations additionally the ability of a distributed model to be used for direct simulation of precipitation streamflow processes without subjection to recalibration is also important for the hydrological modelling of ungagged basins the flood event simulation results of the basin outlet and interior locations subjected to different scenarios of recharge and spatial distribution patterns were therefore evaluated as shown in fig 13 the evaluated indicators of the flood simulation results at the hekou and jiuxu hydrological stations are also presented in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a c both dk xaj and the xaj models can be used to conduct promising simulations of flood 20170625 with a relatively homogeneous spatial distribution of precipitation at the hekou hydrological station however the xaj model generated poor flood simulation results for the jiuxu hydrological station and there was a significant lag in the simulated peak time compared to the observed value the dk xaj model can be used to better simulate the flood processes at both hydrological stations for flood 20170709 with a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the precipitation as depicted in fig 13 d f while the xaj model cannot be used effectively to reproduce the first peak with a steep rise and the second peak with high discharge at the hekou hydrological station concurrently the peak at the jiuxu hydrological station also presented with a significant lag when simulated by the xaj model the scenario depicted in fig 13 d led to an increase in the spatial heterogeneity of recharge over the hkb the spatial distribution patterns of the recharge exerted a direct impact on the streamflow processes and the streamflow at the basin outlet exhibited responses more rapidly and intensely to recharge when the karst terrain was observed to be in the centre of the rainstorm an increase in the flow promotes the establishment of hydraulic connections between different water stocks that supply water to the flows more abundantly during the flood seasons carrière et al 2016 under wet conditions the water level can nearly reach the storage capacity of the karst system over the hkb however under heavy precipitation conditions the saturation excess water directly leads to the generation of surface runoff which feeds the stream and leads to the rapid development of flood peaks the improved dk xaj model can better simulate the flood peak discharge and peak time of the high coverage karst sub basin i e jkb in general dk xaj model could better account for the effect that the spatial heterogeneity in karst terrains exert on flood simulation and could help accurately assess the steep rise and recession and multi peak pattern of the observed flood processes that were recorded at the outlet and interior hydrological stations 4 3 influence of karst rapid underground flow on the flash flood response to understand the importance of the groundwater surface water interactions when simulating the streamflow processes and flood events in karst dominated basins the interactions between surface water and karst groundwater established during floods and the behaviour of karst water in addition to surface flooding in the event of multi peak precipitation has been studied by several authors bailly comte et al 2012 coustau et al 2012 darras et al 2015 le mesnil et al 2021 depending on the different groundwater surface interactions and topography of a karst aquifer karst can alternately amplify and attenuate streamflow le mesnil et al 2021 bailly comte et al 2012 highlighted the influence exerted by karst terrains on the amplification or generation of floods and flash floods le mesnil et al 2021 pointed that karst terrains increased characteristic flood times and peak flow attenuation to better understand the influence of karst rapid underground flow on the flash flood response via application of the dk xaj model the spatial variabilities of rapid underground flow and its responses to precipitation with different intensities during peak events were quantitatively assessed and one indicator was introduced to evaluate the contribution rate of accumulative rapid underground flow to the total underground flow crarugf owing to the nature of the dk xaj model the crarugf of each grid describing the hkb can be considered and calculated as follows 26 crarugf j t t 1 m tqg 1 j t t 1 m tqg j t at grid cell j tqg 1 j t tqg j t represent the simulated rapid underground total underground flow at time t respectively and m represents the data length of each flood peak event the spatial distribution of karst terrains in hkb is heterogeneous with upstream widespread moderately developed karst terrains and downstream binary karst systems where are covered by strongly developed karst terrains and poorly karst terrains simultaneously a successive multi peak flood event see fig 14 over hkb was selected to study the influence of karst rapid underground flow on flash flood which is trigged by intense and short precipitation under humid conditions during this flood event the soil matrix and underground conduit system in the hkb are almost saturated and the hydraulic connection type of the stream was gaining connected bailly comte et al 2009 under this condition karst terrains can promote streamflow amplification and the reaction to precipitation is accelerated knöll et al 2020 resulting in the observation of a steep rise limb in the hydrographs of the streamflow in karst dominated basins see fig 14 a similar behaviour in the karst region of southwest china was reported by chen et al 2008 and zhang et al 2011 regarding the distributions of crarugf for each peak shown in fig 14 f h the crarugf of most moderately and strongly developed karst terrain cells over hkb during this flood exceed 50 indicating that karst terrains exhibit a rapid and intense response to precipitation when the precipitation intensity is high the rapid underground flow exerts a significant impact on the flood rise process which can evidently increase both the speed at which the flood is concentrated and the flood peak magnitude the precipitation intensities of the last two floods are relatively strong among the successive multi peak flood events shown in fig 14 b with the increase of precipitation intensity the proportion of grids with a high crarugf value increases rapidly it can be seen from fig 14 f h that the number of grids with crarugf reaching 40 50 in the two floods i e 20160612 and 20160615 increased significantly compared with 20160610 as shown in fig 14 a the xaj model cannot represent such a relationship and the application of xaj result in a systematic underestimation of the measured peaks during the flood event when the xaj model was used to simulate the last two flood peaks with strong precipitation intensity the simulated peak flow was significantly smaller and the peak time was significantly delayed this indicates that the xaj model cannot be used to effectively simulate the flood response behaviour of steep slopes and short concentration times that are dominated by rapid underground flow at the same time the dk xaj model can more accurately reproduce the observed processes within the successive multi peak flood event and the spatial distribution of the rapid underground flow at the hkb while also highlighting the peak discharge and better representing the relationship between strong precipitation intensity and a rapid precipitation streamflow response 5 conclusions in this study a distributed karst hydrological model the dk xaj model was proposed for modelling hourly precipitation streamflow processes in karst dominated basins both the dk xaj and the xaj models were used to simulate hourly precipitation streamflow processes for flood seasons in the hkb the performances of the dk xaj and xaj models were compared and analysed based on the results the dk xaj model which combines the advantages of the conceptual and the fully distributed models can be deemed a valuable tool for precipitation streamflow modelling in karst dominated basins the following conclusions were deduced the main features of the proposed dk xaj model are as follows 1 the model structure is developed based on the principles of the lumped xaj model in each grid computational element which is relatively parsimonious 2 the explicit representations of the heterogeneous spatial distribution of land use and karst geology properties are added into dk xaj model by improving its runoff generation and the separation modules for each grid 3 the improved runoff separation module can be used to further separate the underground flow into rapid conduit flow and slow matrix flow matching the dual porosity observed in karst systems and the partitioning between the two underground components can be estimated from the observed data two karst reservoirs are used to represent different underground flow velocities which also conforms to the duality of the flow field in karst systems 4 the water exchange among each grid and the flow confluence in the river channel are considered in this model unlike the factors considered in other semi distributed karst hydrological models the simulation results show that the dk xaj model can be used to simulate successive hourly precipitation streamflow processes with high accuracy mean nse 0 84 kge 0 83 rre 0 28 and r 2 0 88 the fdc results indicate that the dk xaj model can be used to reproduce both high flow and low flow processes concurrently the dk xaj model shows a strong ability to be utilised to accurately simulate the streamflow and flood processes of a nested interior location within the hkb without the necessity of recalibration mean nse 0 81 kge 0 74 rre 9 63 and r 2 0 85 dk xaj can be used to achieve good performance in simulating detailed flood processes with mean rpes of large medium and small floods of 5 0 2 4 and 10 0 respectively and mean ptes of large medium and small floods of 0 h 0 2 h and 1 3 h both the hydrographs and the fdcs results demonstrate that the dk xaj model shows better performance and the xaj model demonstrates defects in simulating flood peaks when subjected to precipitation events with heterogeneous spatial distribution and cannot be used to accurately describe the behaviours of floods with steep rise and recession or successive multi peaks additionally the results of the low flow segment in the fdc show that the xaj model cannot be used to effectively account for the dual porosity of karst systems in contrast the dk xaj model can be used to assess and depict the hydrological behaviours of the conduit and matrix flows and the flood peak in a karst dominated basin and the nested interior high coverage karst sub basin which indicates that the improvement to dual porosity and spatial heterogeneity in the model structure is effective in general the proposed distributed karst hydrological model that is used via integration of the grid based xaj and which improves the karst dual flow characteristics is a potential tool for obtaining promising precipitation streamflow simulation results and for providing technical support for flood forecasting in karst dominated basins although this version of the dk xaj model can be used to reproduce the hourly precipitation streamflow processes for the karst dominated basin and to yield better results overall precipitation streamflow processes and flood peak compared to the original conceptual xaj model further improvements and investigations may be necessary to more accurately describe the hydrological processes in karst systems according to the results of uncertainty analysis the newly added parameters gwpc s gwpc m cg 1 cg 2 which were used to describe the duality of karst system were insensitive and the uncertainty of the modelling results with a r factor of 1 33 was relatively large in the future studies we will also explore ways to better characterise the physical processes of epikarst in runoff generation and flow routing as well as address the limitations of the assumption not considering karst fractures characteristics to determine flow direction and the uncertainty in the distributed karst hydrological modelling the improved dk xaj model applied in karst dominated basins is expected to provide more accurate

7894,study region hekou karst basin southwestern china study focus the duality and complexity of hydrological behavior of karst systems pose challenges in precipitation streamflow modelling reliable hydrological models with high temporal resolution are warranted for predicting floods in humid flood prone karst dominated basins this study proposes a grid based distributed karst xin anjiang hydrological model dk xaj the model structure of each grid was developed using the conceptual xin anjiang model water exchange among each grid and the spatial heterogeneities of land use types and the karstification in each grid were considered information on two new linear reservoirs was added to represent the rapid conduit and slow matrix underground flow to improve the karst dual porosities the range of the underground runoff partitioning parameter was estimated from the observed flood recessions new hydrological insights the dk xaj model demonstrated good successive hourly streamflow modelling performance with mean values of 0 84 0 83 0 28 and 0 88 for nse kge rre and r 2 and results during validation of one nested interior grid without recalibration was also good the results indicate that the dk xaj model can help obtain detailed results for successive streamflow processes the peaks of floods under different magnitudes and the marked increase and recession of the flash floods can be accurately reproduced and depicted the dk xaj model can therefore be considered a new tool for the prediction of sub daily precipitation streamflow and flood events in karst dominated basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords karst hydrology xinanjiang hydrological model distributed hydrological model hourly successive streamflow simulation 1 introduction approximately 25 of the groundwater resources in the world are supplied by karst aquifer systems ford and williams 2007 and these systems are characterised by complicated heterogeneity and hydrological processes bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 the increasing risk of occurrence of extreme climate change scenarios continues to exert additional pressure on hydrological systems and the probability of flash floods in karst watersheds is likely to increase gázquez et al 2016 construction of a robust flood prediction scheme using hydrological models is one of the most important flood prevention countermeasures for karst dominated basins however precise modelling and prediction of the water dynamics in karst terrains are challenging the most significant feature of karst aquifers is their dual porosity i e matrix and conduits and a duality of hydrological behaviours is shown in the process and storage dynamics of karst systems hartmann et al 2014 water percolates rapidly through the conduits causing rapid recharge of underground flow and high flow velocity in contrast the main component of the water that promotes recharge of the matrix is diffusive and infiltrates slowly exhibiting less flow velocity bakalowicz 2005 schiperski et al 2016 the highly dynamic streamflow is dominated by groundwater which poses challenges in the obtainment of data via direct measurements lauber and goldscheider 2014 zirlewagen et al 2016 karst systems exhibit high heterogeneity and anisotropism bakalowicz 2005 and the spatial and temporal variation in the recharge area can lead to the establishment of a complicated hydrodynamic interaction between the water present on the surface and that existing underground ford and williams 2007 white 2018 these aspects limit the applicability of many hydrological models indicating that the use of hydrological models to provide adequate representations of karst systems remains a challenge hartmann et al 2014 jeannin et al 2021 various approaches have been applied to characterise the hydrological processes of karst systems including the use of lumped and distributed models the lumped modelling approach is used to conceptualise the general physical processes including those of the entire aquifer while the detailed physical relationships and spatial variability are not explicitly considered most lumped karst hydrological models are implemented by using a series of linear or non linear reservoirs to represent the different storage and spring components within a karst aquifer dubois et al 2020 duran et al 2020 eris and wittenberg 2015 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2012 jukić and denić jukić 2009 long 2015 tritz et al 2011 few existing lumped hydrological models have been modified by adding information on a structure that can account for the karst hydrological processes when using the lumped approach as lumped hydrological models are structurally simple with a less number of parameters and low input data requirements satisfactory simulation performances can be obtained and such models are widely applied however the simple structures of lumped models imply that these models are generally not sufficient to describe karst hydrological processes as the simulation performance is limited hartmann et al 2014 because lumped models cannot account for such spatially variable hydrological processes knöll et al 2020 the distributed modelling approach can better account for the spatial variability of karst systems and therefore demonstrates considerable potential to be utilised for boosting the simulation capability necessary for investigating karst hydrological systems bailly comte et al 2012 bittner et al 2018 doummar et al 2012 malard et al 2016 ollivier et al 2020 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 but the scale and characteristics of a karst catchment should be still considered in distributed modelling too jeannin et al 2021 distributed modelling can aid the provision of detailed information about temporal and spatial hydrological processes but present with the drawback of high computational data consumption distributed karst hydrological models are based on the hydrological processes of aquifers or systems at markedly smaller scales and cannot be directly used for precipitation streamflow and flood forecasting in karst dominated basins few distributed hydrological models have been modified to be utilised for hydrological modelling of surface streamflow an improved dhsvm distributed hydrological model was therefore developed and applied to a small karst catchment 1 5 km2 in china by modifying the flow routing estimation methods for porous darcy flow fissure flow and underground channel flow zhang et al 2011 and the findings provided new insights into the dynamic interaction between stored groundwater and surface water in karst terrains li et al 2021 modified the runoff generation algorithm and the underground river confluence module in the liuxihe model and reported the development of an improved karst liuxihe ikl model that could help simulate the annual runoff and flood events for a small karstic watershed 13 1 km2 the methods used to discretise the karst system have been established and included in the modflow cfp model according to the experience gathered in the karst modelling challenge jeannin et al 2021 the size and characteristics of the basin in the karst modelling should be considered and karst hydrological models taking in account the spatial heterogeneity for a small catchment 12 km2 does not provide better than models without considering spatial heterogeneity while for large basins with significant relief spatial variability the spatial aspect must be considered in general these physically based distributed models are usually operated using high resolution input data e g hydraulic properties aquifer geometry conduit geometry and details of the conduit network hartmann et al 2014 such data cannot be easily obtained on a large scale and there is a danger of over parametrisation which may lead to the observation of poor performance in terms of model calibration morrissey et al 2021 thus the applicability of physically based distributed models to large scale karst dominated basins remains limited hartmann et al 2014 jukić and denić jukić 2009 robineau et al 2018 as an important transition from traditional lumped models to more powerful physically based distributed models a conceptually based distributed modelling approach that is based on the combination of lumped conceptual and distributed model features was developed koren et al 2004 the conceptually based distributed hydrological model demonstrates advantages of applicability in the assessment of the spatial variability of hydrological factors even when less information is available on the spatial distribution of the underlying surface li et al 2019 proposed an improved liuxihe distributed hydrological model which used the muskingum routing method to conceptualised the underground runoff this model considered spatial heterogeneities i e land use karst geology within the model domain and obtained a satisfied simulation result in flood forecasting of large karst dominated basin 58 270 km2 hartmann et al 2013 developed a semi distributed karst hydrological model varkarst which considered the spatial heterogeneity using a function to describe the distributions of soil and epikarst storages vertical hydraulic conductivities the separation into diffuse and concentrated recharge and the groundwater hydraulic conductivities and this model had been tested in several large karst basins and shown to be enough to obtain stable integrated discharge and its variability hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the importance of assessing changes in the patterns of land use impacting the execution of studies for sustainable water resource management in karstic regions continues to increase bittner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 sarrazin et al 2018 as it is necessary for a karst hydrological model to be utilised to account for the spatial distribution in land use properties several studies have revealed that karst terrains with high spatial heterogeneity can exert an evident impact on flood processes delrieu et al 2005 zanon et al 2010 le mesnil et al 2021 during flood seasons the hydraulic connections between the different karst water storage media are promoted higher water infiltration from rivers during storm events leading to higher water infiltration and lateral outflow into the stream carrière et al 2016 resulting in the generation of a rapid hydrological response and flash floods that are concentrated over a short period concurrently an increase in the groundwater level results in reduced infiltration lópez chicano et al 2002 and the back flooding and surging which occur in sinkholes may further increase events of surface runoff maréchal et al 2008 le mesnil et al 2021 under these conditions the streamflow hydrographs for the karst dominated basin are likely to present a steep rise limb and recession chen et al 2008 with successive multi peaks thus high temporal resolution is indispensable for understanding and illustrating the complicated hydrological dynamics of karst flash floods and a fine time step is also essential for forecasting flood events jodar abellan et al 2019 yu et al 2018 jeannin et al 2021 however data on the temporal resolutions of most karst flood simulations that are based on the use of distributed models including modified swat based models malagò et al 2016 martínez salvador and conesa garcía 2020 reza eini et al 2020 are achieved daily thereby homogenising the flood peak processes that occur over a period of one day the complexity of the rapid response of the karst flood process is therefore not effectively reproduced implying that the method is insufficient for the construction of effective flood forecasting schemes calculation of hydrological processes in hourly time steps is important to understand instantaneous changes in flash floods and to provide timely warnings on flood events for flood prone karst dominated basins to the best of our knowledge few studies have been conducted in which sub daily streamflow modelling has been performed in a large karst dominated basin to explicitly account for karst hydrology the aim of this work was therefore to develop a new conceptually based distributed karst hydrological model referred to as the distributed karst xinanjiang dk xaj model which could be used for flood simulation and forecasting with hourly time steps and that could account for karst hydrological processes and the spatial variabilities of the underlying surface in the present study information on the explicit representation of land use properties was added to the dk xaj model by improving the runoff generation estimation methods for different land use types and some parameters were spatially distributed using available spatial information i e land use and soil texture the objectives of this research were 1 to propose a new grid based distributed karst hydrological model that could help simulate successive hourly precipitation streamflow in a karst dominated basin 2 to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the basin properties by identifying land use types and karstification geology in the model structure 3 to evaluate the model performance via hydrographs and fdcs and analyse the uncertainty of precipitation streamflow modelling 4 to evaluate the applicability of the lumped xin anjiang hydrological model and dk xaj model in the prediction of streamflow processes for high karst coverage sub basins without recalibration and 5 to quantitatively estimate the influence exerted by rapid karst underground flow on the flood response 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data availability the hekou karst basin hkb is located in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region in southwestern china with an elevation ranging from 82 to 1503 m a s l and a drainage area of 1044 km2 fig 1 a the existence of a humid subtropical monsoon climate implies that the hkb receives abundant rainfall and sunshine with average annual precipitation of 1494 mm and annual evapotranspiration of 854 mm however precipitation is distributed in an uneven manner for over a year the flood season in the hkb is from may to august and accounts for 66 of the average annual precipitation the predominant soil texture is clay 50 followed by loam 26 and silt 7 the main stream within the hkb is the diao river on which two hydrological stations are located namely jiuxu and hekou see fig 1 b the hekou hydrological station is located at the outlet of the hkb and the jiuxu hydrological station is located at the outlet of a tributary present downstream of the diao river the hydrogeology data used in this work are ngrc database http en ngac org cn which describes the properties of hydrogeological entities and aquifers in diao river basin drb edited by the regional geological survey research institute of guangxi zhuang autonomous region china the original data is the hydrogeological map of the drb with a scale of 1 100 000 where rock formations are detailed marked and the hkb is a sub basin of the whole drb karst typically develops from carbonate rocks such as limestone consisting of the mineral calcite dolomite rock and dolostone consisting of the mineral dolomite we grouped the hkb into three different karst terrain types based on different geological formations in the original hydrogeological map the area of carbonate formation whose lithologies mainly are dolomite and limestone is classified as strongly developed karst terrain the area of carbonate intercalated clastic rock formation whose lithology mainly is marlstone is classified as moderately developed karst terrain and the area of clastic rock formation whose lithologies mainly are sandstone and mudstone is classified as poorly developed karst terrain i e non karst terrain the local geology in the hkb is dominated by a substantial area 802 km2 of carbonate based e g limestone dolomites strongly and moderately developed karst terrains cover approximately 77 of the entire basin with only small parts see fig 1 c of the basin consisting of non carbonate rocks e g sandstone mudstone i e poorly developed karst terrains the jiuxu karst basin jkb is a high karst coverage sub basin with an area of 262 km2 and a drainage area that is almost completely covered by strongly developed karst terrains see fig 1 b and c owing to the high karstification e g the presence of well developed fissures conduits and swallow holes in the strongly developed karst terrains the infiltration of recharge into the karst aquifer can be very quick and flash floods are common events occurring in the basin during flood seasons when the degree of saturation in the karst aquifer system is high in the present study six precipitation gauges showing homogenous distribution over the hkb were used for data collection see fig 1 b data concerning the streamflow discharge precipitation and pan evaporation were collected from the hydrological stations data on both streamflow discharge and precipitation were recorded with a time interval of 1 h and information on pan evaporation was recorded daily since the main purpose of this study was to formulate a flood forecasting scheme based on the application of the dk xaj model it was suggested that precipitation streamflow modelling during the flood seasons 1st may to 31st aug should be investigated hydrological data were provided by the guangxi centre for hydrology gxch further information describing the data used is provided in table 1 the spatial geology data used in this study include the dem soil texture land use type and information about the karst geology which were downloaded from the open access databases as shown in table 1 2 2 the dk xaj model 2 2 1 overview of xaj model and its application in karst dominated basins the xin anjiang xaj model is a lumped conceptual hydrological model based on a saturation excess mechanism proposed by zhao 1992 this conceptual hydrological model appears to be a good compromise between an empirical model e g black box model and a physically based distributed karst hydrological model which has relatively fewer parameters than the physical based distributed karst hydrological model and can generally reflect physical relationships through conceptualization of the basins in humid regions the xaj model has been widely applied in chinese humid and semi humid regions for streamflow simulation and forecasting jayawardena and zhou 2000 jiang et al 2007 su et al 2003 zhang and chiew 2009 the xaj model has the potential of obtaining relatively accurate flood simulation results in karst dominated basins with a parsimonious model structure and a small number of parameters compared to other physical based distributed karst hydrological models however the lack of specific development for karst landforms limits the application of the xaj model for karst dominated basins attempts have also been conducted using the improved xaj model to perform a hydrological simulation of karstic basins zhou et al 2019 coupled the xaj model with a two reservoir based karst model to simulate an event of runoff in a chinese karstic basin and found that the improved k xaj model generated better runoff forecasts compared with the traditional xaj model however this improved lumped xaj model has not accounted for the spatial variability in the underlying factors of karst basins i e land use type karst geology yang et al 2020 reported the development of a parallel linear reservoir modelling approach integrated with a grid based distributed xaj model to simulate the hourly flood events over karstic catchment however this improved conceptually distributed xaj model neglects the spatial variability of karst landforms and land use types thus the aim of this work was therefore to develop a new parsimonious conceptually based distributed karst hydrological model which was improved from xaj model and could be used for flood simulation and forecasting in humid flood prone karst dominated basins with hourly time steps and that could account for karst hydrological processes and the spatial variabilities of the underlying surface e g karst geology and land use types 2 2 2 improvement for dual porosity in karst terrains the vadose zones soil epikarst infiltration zone of karst systems are complex environments where soil is mixed with rock elements i e porosities fracture and there are notable spatial variations ollivier et al 2020 it is difficult to obtain field measurements data that could help separate and identify epikarst form vadose zone in large scale karst dominated basin on the other hand to characterise epikarst structure and heterogeneity in distributed karst hydrological models of a large basin is also difficult thus there is only one reservoir used to represent the behavior of the storage and recharge dynamics by the combined action of soil and epikarst in most studies fleury et al 2007 pointed out that the linear reservoir used for representing the slow matrix flow may include all levels of the aquifer from the epikarst to the saturated zone as well as storage in the infiltration zone in order to overcome the shortcomings of not being modified in the runoff generation module specifically for the epikarst the duality of slow and diffuse underground flow in matrix and rapid and concentrated flow in the karst conduits has been considered in the dk xaj model in this study owing to the difficulty in obtaining knowledge on the heterogeneous underground recharge and karst conduit network on a large scale i e a basin the commonly used lumped conceptually based modelling approach schmidt et al 2014 fleury et al 2007 mazzilli et al 2019 ollivier et al 2020 was introduced to represent the key feature of dual porosity in karst systems in the dk xaj model the transfer function that is used to describe flow routing mechanism in karst systems consists of two parallel linear reservoirs the first represents the underground rapid conduit flow and the second represents the underground slow matrix flow the two newly added reservoirs are coupled to the free water storage reservoir in the runoff separation module of the original conceptual xaj model in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity of karst geology in the model the hill slope cells are further divided into strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells according to the karst geology in hkb see fig 1 and different reservoir parameters are used for strongly and moderately developed karst terrains two new parameters the groundwater portioning coefficients of strongly developed karst terrain gwpc s and moderately developed karst terrain gwpc m were introduced to describe the partitioning of the underground runoff and the parameters helped represent the partitioning of the rapid conduit runoff rg 1 in the total underground runoff rg wherein gwpc s rg 1 rg and gwpc m rg 1 rg the yield of the total underground runoff was further divided into two parts according to gwpc s and 1 gwpc s or gwpc m and 1 gwpc m for moderately developed karst cells using the following equations 1 rg 1 rg g w p c m 2 rg 2 rg 1 g w p c m for strongly developed karst cells using the following equations 3 rg 1 rg g w p c s 4 rg 2 rg 1 g w p c s for poorly developed karst cells i e non karst terrain cells the rg was not further divided for the strongly and moderately developed karst terrain cells the total runoff was subdivided into four components by using an improved free water reservoir that has been developed from the free water reservoir in the original xaj model yang et al 2020 the structures variables and related parameters of the improved free water reservoir for strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells are shown in fig 2 challenges exist in the quantification of the contribution percentages from which the matrix is recharged and the conduit flows in the transfer functions and the variation in the recharge sources under different magnitudes of precipitation may differ to study the influence exerted by different precipitation scenarios on the gwpc mean value of gwpc s and gwpc m nine karst flood recessions recorded at the hekou hydrological station during 2014 and 2016 were selected to analyse and deduce the range of the two parameters this method was used to analyse the features of the different components of karst systems chang et al 2015 geyer et al 2008 in this study precipitation events with cumulative precipitation greater than 50 mm were considered as heavy precipitation events and precipitation events with cumulative precipitation less than 50 mm were considered as moderate precipitation events all nine karst flood recession hydrographs were separated into two stages namely the rapid flow drainage stage and the slow flow drainage stage to represent the recessions of a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer as a single exponential decrease chang et al 2015 a simple mathematical model proposed by maillet 1905 was selected to simulate karst flood recessions in the rapid flow drainage stage and the slow flow drainage stage and the model has been expressed as follows 5 q t q 0 e α t where q t represents the flow discharge at time t q 0 represents the slow matrix rapid conduit flow discharge when the matrix conduit dominated flow period starts and α represents the recession coefficient the recession coefficients of conduit and matrix reservoirs are represented by α1 and α2 respectively for each karst flood recession the partitioning of the underground runoff which reaches the conduit reservoir is defined based on the fitting observed on the recession hydrograph the results from all nine selected recessions provide data on the ranges of the gwpc s and gwpc m for further parameter optimisation analysis 2 3 model structure and foundation development of the dk xaj model was based on the first version of the model proposed by yang et al 2020 compared with other distributed karst models the main advantage of the dk xaj model is that it can express a certain physical meaning with a parsimonious model structure and less computing resources which is suitable for flood forecasting in karst dominated basins the spatial variabilities of underlying surface factors i e karst geology and land use types and water exchange among each grid cell have been considered in the model structure the dk xaj model consists of four modules namely an evapotranspiration module a runoff generation module a runoff separation module and a flow routing module which were developed from modules with the same function as those used in the original conceptual xaj hydrological model zhao 1992 yang et al 2020 the derived information was extracted using the raster format of the topographic map of the basin the entire basin has been categorised into several horizontal square grid cells whose information was derived from the raster format of the dem data each grid cell is considered a basic computational element the structure of the dk xaj model is illustrated in fig 3 the grid cells are divided into hill slope cells and river channel cells according to the flow accumulation values of each cell and the actual drainage network see fig 3 a the simulated runoff in each component e g surface and interflow runoff is routed from the upstream to downstream hill slope cells and most downstream hill slope cells are connected to the river channel cells indicating that the runoff in the river channel cells is routed in a cellwise manner to the basin outlet in reality the entire terrain within the basin is not covered by karst landforms thus the structure of the model should be improved to simultaneously comply with the needs of hydrological modelling in both karst terrain and in non karst terrain as mentioned above the dk xaj model is used to classify the hill slope cells as strongly moderately and poorly developed karst terrain cells see fig 2 to identify the types of karst terrain covered in a cell simultaneously information on the explicit representation of land use properties is added to the dk xaj model via modification of its runoff generation estimation methods 2 3 1 evapotranspiration module in the dk xaj model when the land use type of one hill slope cell is farmland forestland or grassland a three layer evapotranspiration estimation scheme developed on the basis of the original xaj model is used the evapotranspiration module calculated using each hill slope cell is related to the potential evapotranspiration through a three layer soil moisture model and this aids the categorisation of the soil into upper lower and deeper layers the detailed flowchart of calculation processes is shown in fig 4 the actual evapotranspiration in each computational element is the sum of the evapotranspiration yield in these three layers zhao 1992 when the land use type of one hill slope cell is a water body or settlement the evapotranspiration calculation scheme is different for a water body cell the evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 6 e w t e p t where e w t represents the evapotranspiration of one hill slope cell in which the land use type is water body at time t and e p t represents the observed pan evaporation at time t for a settlement cell the evapotranspiration is calculated using 7 e s t k e p t if p s t 0 0 if p s t 0 where e s t and e p t represent the evapotranspiration in one settlement cell and the observed pan evaporation at time t respectively k represents the reduction coefficient of evaporation and p s t represents the precipitation of this settlement cell at time t it is suggested that evapotranspiration will occur only when precipitation is greater than zero in the settlement cell at time t 2 3 2 runoff generation module in the dk xaj model the runoff generation calculation was performed only for the hill slope cells the runoff generation calculation performed in each hill slope cell was related to its land use type for different land use types such as forestland grassland or farmland the runoff generation calculation conforms to the mechanism of saturation excess zhao 1992 yang et al 2020 and is based on the assumption that the runoff generation occurs only upon repletion of the tension water capacity it has been confirmed by several applications that the mechanism of saturation excess is capable of precipitation runoff modelling in humid karst dominated basins in china zhou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 li et al 2019 li et al 2021 in the dk xaj model it is assumed that only surface runoff is produced in the hill slope cells for which the land use type includes water bodies or settlements and the runoff yield is governed by the following equations 8 r w t p t e w t 9 r s t p t e s t where e w t and e s t represent the evapotranspiration of the water body cell and the settlement cell at time t respectively p t represents the precipitation at the grid cell through the thiessen interpolation method at time t and r w t and r s t represent the runoff yields of the water body and the settlement cells at time t respectively it is noticed that the water exchange among each cell has been considered in the dk xaj model for water bodies and settlements cells that only produce surface runoff while the interflow and underground flow which are the lateral inflow from adjacent cells are still exist to better account for the spatial variation in the runoff generation parameters parameter estimation methods based on geographical information were used yao et al 2012 proposed methods to estimate the runoff generation parameters tension water capacity wm and free water capacity sm using geographically based information the wm and sm are defined as 10 wm θ fc θ wp l a 11 sm θ s θ fc l h where θ s represents the saturated moisture content θ fc represents the field capacity θ wp represents the wilting point l a represents the thickness of the aeration zone and l h represents the thickness of the humus soil layer the values of θ s θ wp and θ fc in each grid were estimated based on the soil texture distribution map see appendix b fig b 1 a in accordance with the methods described by anderson et al 2006 l a and l h are determined based on the values that are directly measured at sampling points which are established according to the different types of soil texture and land use types in the hkb the spatial patterns of the estimated wm and sm for the dk xaj model have been illustrated in appendix b fig b 1 b and c 2 3 3 runoff separation module the free water storage reservoir developed based on the principles of the original conceptual xaj model zhao 1992 is used to categorise the total runoff into surface runoff rs interflow runoff ri and underground runoff rg for cells that demonstrate the land use types farmland forestland and grassland when the land use type of one cell is a water body or settlement only rs is considered as the runoff component for strongly and moderately developed karst cells an improved free water reservoir is introduced which has been descripted in section 2 2 2 for poorly developed karst cells the free water reservoir is identical to that in the original xaj model zhao 1992 with surface interflow and underground runoff components 2 3 4 flow routing module different equations are adopted for assessing flow routing by hill slope cells and river channel cells in the dk xaj model based on the computation order matrix various runoff components rs ri rg 1 rg 2 and rg are subjected to routing over the hill slope cells to the river channel cells as lateral inflow and the flow routing distribution methods of hill slope cell to hill slope cell hill slope cell to river channel cell and river channel cell to river channel cell are all determined by the computation order matrix yao et al 2009 yao et al 2012 li and zhang 2008 the processing procedures of the computation order matrix has been elaborated in the appendix a linear reservoirs linsley 1967 are used to calculate the flow routing processes of each runoff component in the hill slope cells two components in underground runoff exist if the cell is a moderately or strongly developed karst cell in the runoff separation module while only one component exists if the cell is a poorly developed karst cell for a moderately or strongly developed karst cell two linear reservoirs are used to describe the flow routing of the rapid and slow underground runoff and the flow routing equations of the other runoff components rs and ri in the poorly developed cells are the same as those of the karst cell the cell to cell flow routing of interflow and underground flow for hill slope cells are illustrated in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a for each moderately and strongly developed karst terrain cell two karst reservoirs are utilized for simulating the flow routing of both the rapid and the slow underground runoff at time t the surface interflow rapid underground slow underground runoff are

were included in the dk xaj model shown in table 2 and most were selected based on previous experience using the original xaj model to describe the humid regions of china additionally the ranges of the newly proposed parameters i e gwpc m gwpc s have been determined by the results of karst flood recession analysis based on the previous experience of applying the xaj model in humid regions of china cg usually takes a value between 0 99 and 0 998 which roughly indicating the recession duration of the base flow is about 20 500 days in the basin zhao 1992 cg 1 and cg 2 the recession constants of rapid and slow groundwater used for strongly and moderately developed karst hill slope cell thus refer to the initial range of parameter cg 2 4 model calibration and validation 2 4 1 evaluation of model performances several indicators were used to demonstrate the quality of the simulation results to evaluate the performance of the dk xaj and xaj models the objective of this study was the formulation of a reliable flood prediction scheme for the hkb therefore important criteria such as the relative runoff error rre relative flood peak error rpe flood peak time error pte h and the deterministic coefficient dc i e nash sutcliffe efficiency of the accuracy standard for hydrological forecasting in china ashf the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2008 were considered as a measure of performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse has been expressed as follows 21 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q 0 i q o 2 where q s i and q 0 i represent the simulated and observed streamflow discharge at each time step i respectively q 0 represents the average of the observed streamflow discharge series and n represents the total number of observation periods rre is defined as follows 22 rre r s r o r o 100 where r s and r 0 represent the simulated and observed runoff volumes respectively the model performance was also evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency kge and the coefficient of determination r 2 the kge is a multi objective function that was originally proposed by gupta et al 2009 and compared with the traditional nse the kge demonstrates a limited bias in evaluating high flow discharge values kge can be expressed as follows 23 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r represents the correlation coefficient α represents the ratio between the standard deviation of the simulated and the observed streamflow discharge and β represents the ratio between the average simulated and observed streamflow discharge nse kge rre and r 2 were considered as performance indicators to evaluate the successive hourly streamflow spanning the entire year to effectively evaluate the simulation results of the complex karst flash flood processes the rpe and pt e should be included and are defined as follows 24 rpe q sp q op q op 100 25 pte t sp t op where q op represents the observed flood peak discharge q sp represents the simulated flood peak discharge t op represents the observed flood peak time and t sp represents the simulated flood peak time 2 4 2 estimation of parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty it is necessary for hydrological modelling with high accuracy to make an uncertainty analysis in this study a parameter sensitivity and prediction uncertainty analysis were conducted using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 in this study dk xaj was calibrated using 16 parameters related to evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff separation hill slope flow routing and river channel flow routing module the remaining parameters b c ex wdm were assigned based on the experience and were excluded from all uncertainty and modelling result analyses the sensitivity of model parameters was analyzed using the calibration period of observed as single time series data the nse was chosen as the likelihood measure and the threshold value which was used to identify behavioral from non behavioral parameter sets of nse was set as 0 60 the glue simulation run was performed with sample sizes of 6000 within the physically meaningful ranges of the parameters see table 2 then the results of glue runs whose likelihood measure value larger than 0 60 were used to summarized the 95 prediction uncertainty band 95ppu at the same time two indices p and r factor abbaspour et al 2015 were employed for quantitative evaluation of the prediction uncertainty of validation period the range for p and r factor is 0 1 and 0 respectively when the p factor and r factor are closer to 1 and 0 respectively there will be a good match between the simulations and the observations abbaspour 2013 2 4 3 calibration of streamflow in the hkb both the calibration and validation periods considered covered the entire years from jan 1st to dec 31st in each year with a 720 time step one month warm up stage which was excluded from all uncertainty and modelling result analyses the sce ua approach duan et al 1993 which has previously been applied for optimisation of various of hydrological model parameters trošelj and lee 2021 zeng et al 2018 was used for the model calibration the nse was used as the objective function the results of parameter sensitive analysis were used for optimisation the experience gained while performing calibration of the xaj model to describe the humid regions of china was considered while performing calibration of the final model parameters and methods were based on a combination of algorithmic and trial and error approaches yang et al 2020 however certain runoff generation parameters are directly determined by adopting prior estimation methods based on the topography and soil texture data and the range of the newly proposed parameter and adoption of such an approach account for the duality of karst systems the applicability of such an approach is determined by the characteristics of karst flood recessions in the hkb the model describing the whole year of 2014 was used for conducting calibration and the same final optimal parameter set derived from the calibration was used for investigating all six years in the validation periods 3 results 3 1 characteristics of karst flood recessions in the hkb the results of detailed analysis of the recession curves are shown in appendix c the estimated values of α1 α2 and mean gwpc under different antecedent cumulative amounts of precipitation are of the same order of magnitude the mean values of α1 and α2 under heavy precipitation conditions are 0 027 and 0 010 respectively which are markedly similar to those 0 024 and 0 006 respectively obtained under moderate precipitation conditions the estimated values of mean gwpc for heavy and moderate precipitation are 0 28 and 0 32 respectively and the values seem to exhibit less remarkable differences the distributions of α1 α2 and mean gwpc are depicted in fig 6 using boxplots as demonstrated in fig 6 c the mean gwpc values range from 0 16 to 0 48 with a mean of 0 28 under moderate precipitation conditions and range from 0 21 to 0 46 with a mean of 0 32 under heavy precipitation conditions this implies that slow flow contributes more than 50 of the total underground runoff yield indicating that the matrix flow dominates the recharge process and this observation is identical to the finding reported by mudarra and andreo 2011 and wang et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 c most values of mean gwpc are higher under heavy precipitation conditions than those under moderate precipitation conditions wang et al 2020 have suggested that contribution of conduits is dominated by the degree to which the aquifer is saturated the heavier the rainfall in the basin the higher the saturation of the karst aquifer thus conduit flow will contribute toward an increase in water levels in the total underground runoff finally optimisation of the parameter gwpc s was conducted over the range 0 29 0 4 and gwpc m was conducted over the range 0 15 0 28 3 2 establishment of the dk xaj model spatial resolution is a crucial factor in distributed hydrological modelling the higher the spatial resolution the more accurate the modelling of the terrain properties and processes however more computation resources should be used considering the availability of spatial data and the limited computing power in the present study the spatial resolution of the dk xaj model was defined and established as 1 km 1 km based on this resolution the entire hkb has been divided into 1391 grid cells including 1309 hill slope cells and 82 river channel cells see fig 7 b karst terrain cells and non karst terrain cells were identified based on karst topography using the gis technology with 562 strongly developed karst cells 465 moderately developed karst cells and 282 poorly developed karst cells included as hill slope cells see fig 7 e data on the fundamental features of the basin such as flow direction flow accumulation and drainage stream networks are obtained by using the dem and data will be used as input for the dk xaj model it is noted that the spatial distribution of hydrogeology information about rock formations can be obtained by field survey but the knowledge relative to the karst conduit network and fracture characteristics is rarely available at basin scale therefore the flow direction in hkb is obtained only used the dem the direction and accumulation of flow in each dem cell were calculated by implementing the eight neighbor method after which data on the drainage network were extracted o callaghan 1984 thereafter information on the matrix of grid cells in the dem can be acquired fairfield 1991 there exist 65 levels in the flow routing computation order for the hkb as shown in fig 7 e additionally information on land use soil texture karst geology and precipitation interpolation are also considered spatially distributed input variables for utilisation in the dk xaj model the input precipitation for each cell is based on adoption of the thiessen interpolation method and the thiessen polygon partitions over the hkb are illustrated in fig 7 f 3 3 uncertainty analysis results 3 3 1 sensitivity of parameters the dotty plots of objective function versus parameters for all behavioral and non behavioral simulations are showed in fig 8 which depict the goodness of fit response surface projected onto individual parameter dimensions and help to identify the corresponding sensitive range the reason for the distribution of dots multiplied by vertical lines in fig 8 i m n is that the uniform sampling interval in monte carlo sampling framework is set to 0 01 the parameters corresponding to fig 8 i m n are cg cg 1 and cg 2 respectively whose values range from 0 99 to 0 998 when the uniform distribution sampling interval is 0 01 the sampling points will appear as the shape of the vertical distributions as seen from the fig 8 the relatively concentrated distribution of behavioral simulations towards lower values when projected onto the parameter ranges of sm ki x mc as well as towards higher values of cs indicating higher sensitivity of hourly streamflow simulation to these calibration parameters on the other hand the scatters of non behavioral simulations are distributed nearly across the whole range of the other parameters shown in fig 8 reflecting lower sensitivity on the whole free water capacity sm of runoff generation module outflow coefficient of free water capacity to interflow ki of runoff separation module recession constant of surface flow cs of hill slope flow routing module and weight coefficient of muskingum cunge method x mc of river channel flow routing module were the most sensitive parameters affecting streamflow simulation whose sensitivity ranges were used as the basis for parameter optimization 3 3 2 uncertainty of modelling results the continuous hourly streamflow prediction versus observed values of each year in validation is shown in fig 9 the upper and lower prediction bounds were generated with behavioral model runs identified in year 2014 using the nse likelihood measure as seen from the fig 9 a and b most of the observations are bracketed by the 95ppu p factor 0 74 of the hydrograph and fdc however it is noticed that the relatively high uncertainty occurred during low flow than high flow period which is verified by both hydrograph fig 9 a and fdc fig 9 b the relatively large r factor value 1 33 indicated larger uncertainties may still remain in streamflow simulation and the overpredicted 95ppu may be caused by the glue method itself setegn et al 2010 3 4 simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models 3 4 1 results at the basin outlet the proposed dk xaj and xaj models were used for conducting successive hourly streamflow simulations in the hkb with the obtainment of performance indicators via comparison of the observed and simulated streamflow at the outlet of the entire hkb the performances of the two models obtained during calibration and validation are summarised in table 3 the results in table 3 demonstrate that the mean values of nse kge rre and r 2 based on the dk xaj model are 0 84 0 83 0 28 and 0 88 while those based on the xaj model are 0 64 0 49 43 64 and 0 74 respectively these results indicate a good match between the observed discharge and simulations using both dk xaj and xaj models meanwhile all indicators were improved by using the new proposed model implying that the dk xaj model outperformed the traditional lumped xaj model for successive hourly streamflow modelling over a karst dominated basin the simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for the calibration and validation periods are depicted in fig 10 3 4 2 results for the nested interior grid the dk xaj is a distributed karst hydrological model based on dem grid and as observed in several grid based xaj models huang et al 2016 yao et al 2009 yao et al 2012 and not only the streamflow processes at the outlet but the processes of any grid within the basin can be simulated by using the dk xaj model to further validate the performance of the dk xaj and xaj models for flood simulation and to test the utility of the two models in the direct simulation of the precipitation streamflow for a nested interior grid with an upstream drainage area i e high karst coverage sub basin that was almost covered by the strongly developed karst terrains without parameter recalibration the dk xaj and xaj models were used to simultaneously output the successive hourly streamflow processes of the hkb and jkb the model evaluation results of the jkb for the validation are also listed in table 3 the values of nse kge rre and r 2 that were obtained using the dk xaj model for the validation period over the jkb were 0 81 0 74 9 63 and 0 85 while those based on the xaj model were 0 71 0 78 1 78 and 0 75 respectively similar to the validation results of the hkb the simulation results of the jkb via application of the two models show an acceptable match between the observed and the simulated streamflow time series see fig 10 and table 3 however only nse and r 2 showed improvements when the dk xaj model was used indicating that the dk xaj model did not possess a more robust ability to reproduce streamflow over high karst coverage sub basins the simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for the validation period are shown in fig 10 b 3 4 3 assessment of the results using fdc according to the selected performance indicators application of both dk xaj and xaj model yielded acceptable results for the hkb with the obtainment of mean nse values of 0 84 and 0 64 respectively for the two models during validation the mean values of nse and r 2 in table 3 indicated that there were no significant differences between the dk xaj and xaj models for the outlet and interior streamflow simulations in both calibration and validation periods and that the dk xaj performances over validation were significantly better than those of the xaj model for the kge and rre furthermore the scatter diagrams illustrating the observed and simulated streamflow discharge during the validation period 2015 2020 see appendix d fig d 1 showed obvious underestimation in the simulated results when the xaj model was used for both the hkb and jkb the model performance indicators listed in section 2 4 1 were used to assess the overall streamflow simulation processes during the flood seasons to further evaluate the abilities of the dk xaj and xaj models to be used for simulation of different magnitudes of streamflow fdcs were used the fdc is defined as the flow exceedance probability curve smakhtin 2001 vogel and fennessey 1995 which summarises the ability of a basin to produce different magnitudes of flow yilmaz et al 2008 in karst hydrology fdcs are used to assess the range and variability of spring discharge and to identify the key features of karst systems hartmann et al 2013 sapač et al 2020 torresan et al 2020 because they can be used to reflect the regimes of flow under conditions of different porosities e g conduits and matrix the fdc has also been used as a performance indicator in karst hydrological modelling sezen et al 2019 the fdcs at the outlet of the hkb and jkb during the calibration and validation periods are depicted in fig 11 a and b respectively to quantitatively evaluate the simulated flow at different magnitudes yilmaz et al 2008 suggested that the fdc could be partitioned into the following three segments which could be used to characterise the different responses to precipitation in each basin 1 the high flow segment 2 the intermediate flow segment and 3 the low flow segment correspondingly the three diagnostic measures biasfhv biasfms and biasflv are proposed for evaluation of the model performances of the high intermediate and low flow segments respectively detailed information is provided in yilmaz et al 2008 considering the hydrodynamics of karst aquifers hartmann et al 2013 proposed the exceedance probabilities corresponding to the high medium and low flow paths of the fdcs the fdcs were separated into the high flows exceedance probabilities 0 0 0 1 median flows 0 1 0 9 and low flows 0 9 1 0 therefore in this study we modified the original exceedance probabilities yilmaz et al 2008 corresponding to the high flow intermediate flow and low flow segments of the diagnostic measures biasfhv biasfms and biasflv diagnostic measures for both the outlet and inside locations of the hkb during the calibration and validation periods are listed in table 4 3 4 4 flood peak simulation results with different magnitudes to further comprehensively describe and compare the flood simulation results of the dk xaj and xaj models for a flood season the flood peaks during each flood season were selected from the successive hourly precipitation streamflow process simulations according to the necessity of issuing flood warnings at the hekou hydrological station flood events have been divided into the following three types large medium and small the term large flood refers to a peak discharge greater than 560 m3 s with a return period greater than 2 years medium flood refers to a peak discharge that is greater than 322 5 m3 s and less than 560 0 m3 s and small flood refers to a peak discharge greater than 107 5 m3 s and less than 322 5 m3 s the results of the simulated flood peaks are presented in fig 12 the simulation results of the different flood magnitudes depicted in fig 12 reveal that compared with the performance of the xaj model the dk xaj model presents a more accurate fit and better evaluation indicators in the flow simulations the mean rpes of large medium and small floods in the dk xaj model are 5 0 2 4 and 10 0 and the mean ptes of large medium and small floods are 0 0 2 and 1 3 as depicted in fig 12 compared to the xaj model the mean pte and rpe in the dk xaj model are both close to zero with evident improvements realized in terms of the simulation errors the simulation results of the flood peaks at all magnitudes indicate that the peak flow values are evidently underestimated based on the application of the xaj model with a significant lag in the simulated flood peak time the dk xaj model can also be used to obtain better results when performing simulations of medium and large floods 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the overall precipitation streamflow process simulation via consideration of the fdc the results of the study indicate that the improved dk xaj model can yield better overall precipitation streamflow modelling performance compared to the original lumped xaj models which can be proven by not only the hydrographs but also the fdcs of the basin outlet and inside location according to the results presented in fig 11 a the fdcs over hkb of the dk xaj model in the calibration and validation periods significantly fit that of the observed streamflow in all three flow segments however an evident systematic underestimation was noted in the fdc over hkb of the xaj model that was used for validation as the main purpose of this study was the establishment of a flood forecasting scheme for the hkb and as the high flow segment reflected the characteristics of the flood peaks the simulation accuracy for high flow events with flow exceedance probabilities of 0 0 1 was crucial with respect to the high flow segment simulation evaluation for the validation periods over hkb the calculated biasfhv of dk xaj was 7 80 while that of xaj was 44 03 see table 4 and the high flow segment in the fdcs of the xaj model for the basin outlet was markedly lower than those obtained via observation fig 11 a this indicates that the application of the dk xaj model can help reproduce more accurate high flow processes for the hkb than that observed with application of the xaj model information on the contributions of different components to the groundwater can be obtained by identifying the shape of the fdc a flat slope usually indicates a system with more groundwater storage capacity and a lower degree of karstification matrix slow flow in contrast a steep slope indicates a system with well developed conduits even those with subterrain rivers conduit rapid flow smakhtin 2001 as shown in fig 11 and table 4 the fdcs of the simulated low flow segments in the xaj model for both basin outlet hkb and inside location jkb are significantly lower than those obtained via observation which demonstrates that the xaj model underestimates low flow events the biasflvs of 85 51 and 1025 21 were obtained via utilisation of the xaj model during the validation period for the basin outlet and inside location respectively which were 3 13 and 64 24 times higher than those obtained using the dk xaj model moreover the low flow segments of the fdcs contained information that was related to the recession of floods that were subjected to the combined action of conduit rapid flow and matrix slow flow resulting in the presence of significantly different slopes different slopes for the low flow segments of the observed discharge values are shown in fig 11 for the basin outlet the shape of the low flow segment in the fdcs of the xaj model are extremely flat and this behaviour is associated with single component flow indicating a state of non conformation to the dual flow conditions that are observed in karst aquifer systems in the original conceptual xaj model only one reservoir has been used to represent the underground flow indicating that the results simulated using the xaj model when applied in a karst dominated basin only reflect the average dynamics and characteristics of the karst underground flow in the dk xaj model a rapid flow reservoir and a slow flow reservoir were established to represent the main pathways related to the conduit dominated and matrix dominated flows and the dk xaj model could better simulate the low flow segments of the fdcs as evidenced from the information presented in table 4 and fig 11 therefore the dk xaj model can be used to assess the hydrological behaviours of the conduit and matrix flow in the low flow segments of karst dominated basins which indicates that the improvement of the dual porosity in the model structure is effective based on the fdc characteristics it can be concluded that the dk xaj model can be used to simulate the different water storage characteristics of the hkb with more accuracy than that observed with application of the xaj model the main reason for achieving a better low flow simulation is the improvement in the dual porosity realised using the dk xaj model on the other hand the area and position of the karst terrain exert a major control on the flood response in regions that are impacted by storm events zanon et al 2010 and the spatial heterogeneity of the karst terrains in the dk xaj model can play an important role in the achievement of an accurate high flow response simulation however it should be noted that there is still the overestimation error for dk xaj model in low flow simulation which is also confirmed and depicted in the modelling uncertainty analysis in fig 9 a the dk xaj model based on the saturation excess mechanism can be used to obtain good high flow simulation results in the flood season but only the saturation excess mechanism with poor representation of epikarst may not be adequately captured the low flow segment in karst dominated basin when the soil layer in the poorly developed karst terrains and the epikarst zone in the moderately and strongly developed karst terrains are relatively dry recharge from precipitation will help prioritise storage in the epikarst soil zone and the epikarst also demonstrates functions by delaying the recharge of the karst bakalowicz 2005 fleury et al 2007 perrin et al 2003 in this case the epikarst zone will exert more marked regulation and hysteresis tritz et al 2011 on the runoff which is reflected in the small flood events and slow recession processes at the outlet of the basin in the dk xaj model a linear reservoir is used for the routing simulation in the hillslope of the matrix slow flow and epikarst is not considered in runoff generation calculations this modelling method cannot be used to fully characterise the process of storing and delaying runoff in the epikarst zone during dry and low flow conditions more than 77 of the area of the hkb is covered by moderately and strongly developed karst terrains and the impact exerted by epikarst on runoff is significant therefore when a small flood event or recession which belong to slow flow segment is simulated by using dk xaj during the low flow period the simulated flood peak is relatively large and the recession limb is steep in future studies the detailed hydrological process within the epikarst will be better conceptualized and represented in dk xaj model 4 2 evaluation of the flood process simulation for the basin outlet and inside location for a spatially distributed hydrological model not only should researchers evaluate the simulation of the outlet but should also assess the results for the inside locations additionally the ability of a distributed model to be used for direct simulation of precipitation streamflow processes without subjection to recalibration is also important for the hydrological modelling of ungagged basins the flood event simulation results of the basin outlet and interior locations subjected to different scenarios of recharge and spatial distribution patterns were therefore evaluated as shown in fig 13 the evaluated indicators of the flood simulation results at the hekou and jiuxu hydrological stations are also presented in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a c both dk xaj and the xaj models can be used to conduct promising simulations of flood 20170625 with a relatively homogeneous spatial distribution of precipitation at the hekou hydrological station however the xaj model generated poor flood simulation results for the jiuxu hydrological station and there was a significant lag in the simulated peak time compared to the observed value the dk xaj model can be used to better simulate the flood processes at both hydrological stations for flood 20170709 with a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the precipitation as depicted in fig 13 d f while the xaj model cannot be used effectively to reproduce the first peak with a steep rise and the second peak with high discharge at the hekou hydrological station concurrently the peak at the jiuxu hydrological station also presented with a significant lag when simulated by the xaj model the scenario depicted in fig 13 d led to an increase in the spatial heterogeneity of recharge over the hkb the spatial distribution patterns of the recharge exerted a direct impact on the streamflow processes and the streamflow at the basin outlet exhibited responses more rapidly and intensely to recharge when the karst terrain was observed to be in the centre of the rainstorm an increase in the flow promotes the establishment of hydraulic connections between different water stocks that supply water to the flows more abundantly during the flood seasons carrière et al 2016 under wet conditions the water level can nearly reach the storage capacity of the karst system over the hkb however under heavy precipitation conditions the saturation excess water directly leads to the generation of surface runoff which feeds the stream and leads to the rapid development of flood peaks the improved dk xaj model can better simulate the flood peak discharge and peak time of the high coverage karst sub basin i e jkb in general dk xaj model could better account for the effect that the spatial heterogeneity in karst terrains exert on flood simulation and could help accurately assess the steep rise and recession and multi peak pattern of the observed flood processes that were recorded at the outlet and interior hydrological stations 4 3 influence of karst rapid underground flow on the flash flood response to understand the importance of the groundwater surface water interactions when simulating the streamflow processes and flood events in karst dominated basins the interactions between surface water and karst groundwater established during floods and the behaviour of karst water in addition to surface flooding in the event of multi peak precipitation has been studied by several authors bailly comte et al 2012 coustau et al 2012 darras et al 2015 le mesnil et al 2021 depending on the different groundwater surface interactions and topography of a karst aquifer karst can alternately amplify and attenuate streamflow le mesnil et al 2021 bailly comte et al 2012 highlighted the influence exerted by karst terrains on the amplification or generation of floods and flash floods le mesnil et al 2021 pointed that karst terrains increased characteristic flood times and peak flow attenuation to better understand the influence of karst rapid underground flow on the flash flood response via application of the dk xaj model the spatial variabilities of rapid underground flow and its responses to precipitation with different intensities during peak events were quantitatively assessed and one indicator was introduced to evaluate the contribution rate of accumulative rapid underground flow to the total underground flow crarugf owing to the nature of the dk xaj model the crarugf of each grid describing the hkb can be considered and calculated as follows 26 crarugf j t t 1 m tqg 1 j t t 1 m tqg j t at grid cell j tqg 1 j t tqg j t represent the simulated rapid underground total underground flow at time t respectively and m represents the data length of each flood peak event the spatial distribution of karst terrains in hkb is heterogeneous with upstream widespread moderately developed karst terrains and downstream binary karst systems where are covered by strongly developed karst terrains and poorly karst terrains simultaneously a successive multi peak flood event see fig 14 over hkb was selected to study the influence of karst rapid underground flow on flash flood which is trigged by intense and short precipitation under humid conditions during this flood event the soil matrix and underground conduit system in the hkb are almost saturated and the hydraulic connection type of the stream was gaining connected bailly comte et al 2009 under this condition karst terrains can promote streamflow amplification and the reaction to precipitation is accelerated knöll et al 2020 resulting in the observation of a steep rise limb in the hydrographs of the streamflow in karst dominated basins see fig 14 a similar behaviour in the karst region of southwest china was reported by chen et al 2008 and zhang et al 2011 regarding the distributions of crarugf for each peak shown in fig 14 f h the crarugf of most moderately and strongly developed karst terrain cells over hkb during this flood exceed 50 indicating that karst terrains exhibit a rapid and intense response to precipitation when the precipitation intensity is high the rapid underground flow exerts a significant impact on the flood rise process which can evidently increase both the speed at which the flood is concentrated and the flood peak magnitude the precipitation intensities of the last two floods are relatively strong among the successive multi peak flood events shown in fig 14 b with the increase of precipitation intensity the proportion of grids with a high crarugf value increases rapidly it can be seen from fig 14 f h that the number of grids with crarugf reaching 40 50 in the two floods i e 20160612 and 20160615 increased significantly compared with 20160610 as shown in fig 14 a the xaj model cannot represent such a relationship and the application of xaj result in a systematic underestimation of the measured peaks during the flood event when the xaj model was used to simulate the last two flood peaks with strong precipitation intensity the simulated peak flow was significantly smaller and the peak time was significantly delayed this indicates that the xaj model cannot be used to effectively simulate the flood response behaviour of steep slopes and short concentration times that are dominated by rapid underground flow at the same time the dk xaj model can more accurately reproduce the observed processes within the successive multi peak flood event and the spatial distribution of the rapid underground flow at the hkb while also highlighting the peak discharge and better representing the relationship between strong precipitation intensity and a rapid precipitation streamflow response 5 conclusions in this study a distributed karst hydrological model the dk xaj model was proposed for modelling hourly precipitation streamflow processes in karst dominated basins both the dk xaj and the xaj models were used to simulate hourly precipitation streamflow processes for flood seasons in the hkb the performances of the dk xaj and xaj models were compared and analysed based on the results the dk xaj model which combines the advantages of the conceptual and the fully distributed models can be deemed a valuable tool for precipitation streamflow modelling in karst dominated basins the following conclusions were deduced the main features of the proposed dk xaj model are as follows 1 the model structure is developed based on the principles of the lumped xaj model in each grid computational element which is relatively parsimonious 2 the explicit representations of the heterogeneous spatial distribution of land use and karst geology properties are added into dk xaj model by improving its runoff generation and the separation modules for each grid 3 the improved runoff separation module can be used to further separate the underground flow into rapid conduit flow and slow matrix flow matching the dual porosity observed in karst systems and the partitioning between the two underground components can be estimated from the observed data two karst reservoirs are used to represent different underground flow velocities which also conforms to the duality of the flow field in karst systems 4 the water exchange among each grid and the flow confluence in the river channel are considered in this model unlike the factors considered in other semi distributed karst hydrological models the simulation results show that the dk xaj model can be used to simulate successive hourly precipitation streamflow processes with high accuracy mean nse 0 84 kge 0 83 rre 0 28 and r 2 0 88 the fdc results indicate that the dk xaj model can be used to reproduce both high flow and low flow processes concurrently the dk xaj model shows a strong ability to be utilised to accurately simulate the streamflow and flood processes of a nested interior location within the hkb without the necessity of recalibration mean nse 0 81 kge 0 74 rre 9 63 and r 2 0 85 dk xaj can be used to achieve good performance in simulating detailed flood processes with mean rpes of large medium and small floods of 5 0 2 4 and 10 0 respectively and mean ptes of large medium and small floods of 0 h 0 2 h and 1 3 h both the hydrographs and the fdcs results demonstrate that the dk xaj model shows better performance and the xaj model demonstrates defects in simulating flood peaks when subjected to precipitation events with heterogeneous spatial distribution and cannot be used to accurately describe the behaviours of floods with steep rise and recession or successive multi peaks additionally the results of the low flow segment in the fdc show that the xaj model cannot be used to effectively account for the dual porosity of karst systems in contrast the dk xaj model can be used to assess and depict the hydrological behaviours of the conduit and matrix flows and the flood peak in a karst dominated basin and the nested interior high coverage karst sub basin which indicates that the improvement to dual porosity and spatial heterogeneity in the model structure is effective in general the proposed distributed karst hydrological model that is used via integration of the grid based xaj and which improves the karst dual flow characteristics is a potential tool for obtaining promising precipitation streamflow simulation results and for providing technical support for flood forecasting in karst dominated basins although this version of the dk xaj model can be used to reproduce the hourly precipitation streamflow processes for the karst dominated basin and to yield better results overall precipitation streamflow processes and flood peak compared to the original conceptual xaj model further improvements and investigations may be necessary to more accurately describe the hydrological processes in karst systems according to the results of uncertainty analysis the newly added parameters gwpc s gwpc m cg 1 cg 2 which were used to describe the duality of karst system were insensitive and the uncertainty of the modelling results with a r factor of 1 33 was relatively large in the future studies we will also explore ways to better characterise the physical processes of epikarst in runoff generation and flow routing as well as address the limitations of the assumption not considering karst fractures characteristics to determine flow direction and the uncertainty in the distributed karst hydrological modelling the improved dk xaj model applied in karst dominated basins is expected to provide more accurate
