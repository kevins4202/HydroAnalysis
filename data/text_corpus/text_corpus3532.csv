17660,for more than a decade the artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace and sucralose suc have been applied as tracers of the input of wastewater to environmental waters recently concerns have been raised that degradation of ace during treatment may hinder or restrict its use as a wastewater tracer in this study the value of ace and suc as tracers was reassessed based on samples of wastewater at 12 municipal wastewater treatment mwwt plants and from 7 septic systems and associated septic plumes in groundwater the results indicated stability of suc during mwwt at most plants and variable removal of both sweeteners during some mwwt and in the septic wastewater systems however the residual concentrations of ace and suc in municipal effluent and in septic plumes indicate that both sweeteners remain valuable wastewater tracers the mass ratio suc ace was found to be a useful parameter for examining the relative persistence of these sweeteners graphical abstract image 1 keywords acesulfame sucralose wastewater tracer municipal wastewater septic systems 1 introduction there are many reasons why researchers have sought to track the fate and impact of treated wastewater on environmental waters for example the large volumes of treated wastewater released each year estimated 330 km3 globally mateo sagasta et al 2015 can deliver trace contaminants pathogens and elevated nutrients to environmental waters some of these may have harmful effects on aquatic ecosystems or impair drinking water quality jmaiff blackstock et al 2019 warner et al 2019 in particular there may be toxic impacts on aquatic organisms and disruption of aquatic ecosystem functions e g triebskorn et al 2004 costanzo et al 2005 martín et al 2012 and increased risk of algal blooms in surface waters herath 1997 there are also threats to human health if drinking water sources gasser et al 2010 lapworth et al 2012 marshall et al 2019 or recreational waters are impacted glassmeyer et al 2005 a wide range of chemicals have been proposed as potential tracers to track the presence of wastewater in the environment e g glassmeyer et al 2005 kahle et al 2009 gasser et al 2010 dickenson et al 2011 james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 mccance et al 2018 warner et al 2019 in particular synthetic chemicals present in wastewater are potential tracers if they are released to the environment at concentrations well above their detection limits and if their attenuation processes in these environments are relatively slow just over a decade ago the artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace and sucralose suc were identified as useful tracers of wastewater input to environmental waters in part because of their observed persistence during municipal wastewater treatment buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 soh et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 gan et al 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 jekel et al 2015 and as septic wastewater plumes migrate in groundwater robertson et al 2013 recent studies have challenged the status of ace as a wastewater tracer following reports cardenas et al 2016 falås et al 2016 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 that ace was largely removed during wastewater treatment other studies have documented degradation of this sweetener see 1 1 this evidence prompted a recent claim that the use of ace as conservative tracer is obsolete kleinsteuber et al 2019 there is evidence that suc can also be degraded during wastewater treatment see 1 1 some studies have looked at degradation mechanisms and transformation products of these sweeteners e g sang et al 2014 li et al 2016 2017 this is significant in that the combined analysis of the sweeteners and their transformation products if the latter are persistent and diagnostic could potentially ameliorate the issue of tracer sweetener degradation the objective of this study is to reassess the value of ace and suc as tracers focusing on 1 their persistence during various types of municipal wastewater treatment mwwt 2 their concentrations when released to the environment either as municipal effluent or as septic wastewater plumes in groundwater and 3 their stability when septic plumes migrate through the subsurface with respect to our third objective we report persistence of the two sweeteners ace and suc in five septic plumes located in ontario canada prior to this study the only previous detailed information about persistence of ace and suc in a septic plume was an ongoing investigation of a plume in ontario canada robertson et al 2013 2016 in our assessment of the potential future use of these sweeteners as tracers we take into consideration the context of previous studies we also identify remaining gaps in our understanding about the fate of these chemicals in the environment 1 1 sweeteners and municipal wastewater treatment municipalities use various wastewater treatment mwwt systems table 1 to treat wastewater before it is released to the environment either directly to surface water bodies or via infiltration ponds into the subsurface where it mixes with groundwater consistent with reports castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 of biological degradation of ace during mwwt in germany other studies documented removal degradation of this sweetener during mwwt in australia cardenas et al 2016 the united states shreve and brennan 2019 and china yang et al 2017 li et al 2018b ace degradation was also demonstrated in tests of sequential managed aquifer recharge hellauer et al 2018 and pilot scale treatment wetlands nivala et al 2019 similarly laboratory studies documented degradation of ace e g achermann et al 2018 burke et al 2018 li et al 2018a wolff et al 2018 by specific microbial strains kleinsteuber et al 2019 by enzymes gonzales gil et al 2019 and by abiotic processes such as uv irradiation sang et al 2014 perkola et al 2016 minella et al 2017 chlorination li et al 2017 and ozonation soh et al 2011 zoumpouli et al 2019 collectively these studies suggest that ace previously found to be persistent during mwwt has become biodegradable by microbial adaptation kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 despite conclusive evidence that ace can be degraded during mwwt the extent of degradation during treatment can vary widely for example under different conditions in pilot scale wetlands ace degradation ranged from negligible to 62 nivala et al 2019 and in batch reactors used to simulate mwwt the degradation of ace ranged from around 10 to 90 wolff et al 2018 furthermore studies that have found degradation of ace during mwwt generally showed high residual concentrations typically 1 μg l of this sweetener in effluent samples table s1 in supporting information studies that have probed the fate of suc during mwwt have generally indicated its persistence table s1 at first glance these results suggest that suc may be a better candidate as a tracer of wastewater in the environment than ace however there is evidence for attenuation of suc including degradation during treatment of municipal wastewater scheurer et al 2009 2011 reported evidence for slow removal of sucralose during soil aquifer treatment as a final mwwt step and the loss was greater than that for ace attenuation of suc was significant up to 70 at two municipal wastewater infiltration pond sites in sweden at one of these sites the attenuation of suc was similar to the attenuation of ace gao et al 2019 1 2 sweeteners in septic system treatment in many smaller communities and rural areas wastewater is treated onsite for each home or facility using septic systems table 1 there is strong interest in finding chemical tracers to track the impact of septic wastewater on groundwater used for drinking water supplies murphy et al 2020 and on the streams and other water bodies into which the groundwater discharges finding suitable tracers to track impacts of septic wastewater may be more challenging than for municipal wastewater this is because septic systems are used for individual facilities or homes sometimes only seasonally so the chemistry of the wastewater that they generate may be much more variable over time than the wastewater generated by municipalities also the likelihood of a specific chemical e g pharmaceutical compound being present in the wastewater from an individual household is much lower than the likelihood of its presence in municipal wastewater when septic wastewater seeps into the subsurface it mixes with groundwater in order to estimate to what extent the selected tracer sweetener concentrations in the plumes have been affected by this mixing dilution process one generally needs to use another tracer a co tracer as discussed by mccane et al 2018 the use of relatively novel tracers such as sweeteners as co tracers in conjunction with the more conventional tracers i e stable and radiogenic isotopes or major ions can provide a more robust method of separating potential sources of contamination for our application the co tracer must be a solute present in the septic wastewater and behave conservatively i e no gains or losses as it mixes and flows with groundwater which can be compared to the sweetener concentrations and thus used to assess the role of dilution versus attenuation finding such a co tracer is challenging even if a suitable co tracer is found its use introduces extra noise and uncertainty given that the concentrations of both the sweetener and the co tracer are subject to temporal source variability and analytical uncertainty despite these challenges as part of an ongoing detailed investigation of a septic plume at a seasonal campground in ontario canada robertson et al 2013 found that ace and suc were persistent tracers in a plume of septic wastewater in groundwater and when this plume was resampled there was evidence of significant degradation of sucralose under suboxic conditions in the deeper and distal zones of the plume robertson et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of municipal wastewater as described by van stempvoort et al 2020a raw influent and final effluent wastewater samples were obtained from twelve mwwt plants at various locations across canada which varied widely in the treatment processes used table 2 locations anonymous on request at all plants raw influent and final effluent wastewater were sampled concurrently i e not hydraulically matched at most plants the samples were collected using autosamplers grab samples were obtained using pre cleaned stainless steel pails at treatment plants that had intermittent flows or lacked available electricity table 3 provides details regarding the sampling method for each plant on the day of collection all mwwt samples raw influent and final effluent were preserved for a range of analyses cf van stempvoort et al 2020a by filtering a 20 ml subsample through a sterile sfca 0 2 μm syringe filter corning corning ny usa with a 25 ml agilent disposable polypropylene syringe into a 40 ml pre cleaned glass epa volatile vial systems plus ltd baden on can that was preloaded with 5 5 g of isopropanol fisher scientific optima lc ms grade and then refrigerating until analysis the storage of isopropanol preserved and refrigerated ip rf samples before analysis ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months to test the ip rf technique samples of both influent and effluent for one site were split half were stored using the ip rf technique and half were frozen which is standard procedure for the analysis of these sweeteners van stempvoort et al 2020b after 11 weeks the ace and suc concentrations in the ipa rf stored samples were between 98 5 and 100 2 of the concentrations in frozen samples except for suc in the influent which was 130 4 the maximum holding time for ipa rf preserved samples was not tested 2 2 sampling of septic wastewater all of the seven septic systems in ontario canada selected for this study have seasonal use two are large conventional systems two are large mound systems and three are small mound systems for seasonal cottages table 4 at each site wastewater was sampled directly from the septic tank or dosing chamber if present by peristaltic pump with a dedicated polyethylene sampling tube at five of the sites groundwater was sampled from multilevel bundle piezometers two to six sampling tubes each installed directly beneath each septic drainfield and sometimes downgradient using peristaltic pumps all samples were filtered immediately 0 45 μm collected in separate polyethylene containers for sweeteners and anions and kept cold with ice or freezer packs in a cooler while transported to the laboratory at the laboratory the sweetener samples were frozen until analysis 2 3 sampling of a stream impacted by septic wastewater a small stream in a rural area in ontario canada was sampled every 2 4 weeks from june 2017 to july 2019 using a pole sampler as described by van stempvoort et al 2020b their station cc sw c this stream is impacted by multiple septic systems from a small community the estimated catchment area for this stream is 10 7 km2 and the estimated mean annual flow is 0 13 m³ s ontario ministry of natural resources and forestry 2018 the stream samples were immediately filtered in the field 0 45 μm placed in coolers then frozen until analysis 2 4 laboratory analyses artificial sweeteners were analyzed by environment and climate change canada at the canada centre for inland waters cciw burlington on canada by ion chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source in negative mode van stempvoort et al 2020b the detection limits for ace and suc were 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively anions including chloride were analyzed by ion chromatography using a dionex ic system 3 results 3 1 concentrations and variations of ace and suc in municipal wastewater samples the concentrations of ace and suc in the influent and effluent mwwt samples are shown in fig 1 complete analyses are provided in tables s2 and s3 in the supporting information fig 2 provides the coefficient of variation cv for the concentration of each sweetener in the wastewater influent and effluent at each mwwt plant 1 cvt x σt x μt x where t is the tracer being measured x is the wastewater source being sampled influent or effluent for a plant septic tank σt x is the standard deviation for the same samples and μt x is the mean tracer concentration for samples from that source for probing the fate of these sweeteners during wastewater treatment lower cv values are desirable because they indicate less variation in the concentrations and thus more confidence in being able to determine whether a tracer is persistent or if removal sorption or degradation of the tracer occurs during wastewater treatment the cv values for ace and suc for the various types of wastewater overlap but there is a tendency for ace to have lower cv fig 2 complete list of cv results is provided in table s4 in supporting information one might hypothesize that the largest municipal wastewater systems would have the lowest cv values assuming that the variability of the sweetener concentrations would be less affected by variations in input from individual facilities or households e g cottages however there was no apparent relationship between the wastewater flows m3 d and cv values r2 between 0 05 and 0 1 see fig s1 in supporting information the two primary mwwt systems v h were affected by rain events on the third day of a 3 day sampling period this event diluted both influent and effluent wastewater thus increasing cv over the three days of sampling 3 2 variable persistence of ace and suc during municipal wastewater treatment for the mwwt samples the effluent ace concentrations tended to be lower than influent concentrations fig 1 see tables s2 and s3 in supporting information for complete analyses based on a comparison of average influent and effluent concentrations for each plant the removal of ace during treatment had a median of 59 based on daily data and the average removal ranged between 11 8 and 99 2 for the twelve mwwt plants table 2 fig 1 the declines in concentrations were statistically significant for eight of the twelve mwwt systems table 2 two of the exceptions were the two primary treatment systems affected by rain events which had the highest cv values of all systems fig 2 the relatively high removals inferred for the two small facultative lagoon systems nw j 1000 m3 d each table 2 were not statistically significant based on a comparison of influent and effluent concentrations paired t tests 0 05 level this was related to the high cv values for the influent wastewater for these systems 0 18 and 0 30 which after the rain event affected systems were the next highest the magnitudes of the removals during treatment were strongly dependent on the type of mwwt process only small fractions not statistically significant of the ace were removed in the two systems that used primary treatment only whereas in some of the secondary and advanced treatment systems 90 of the ace was removed table 2 overall suc was more persistent than ace during mwwt fig 1 table 2 consistent with recent observations elsewhere arbeláez et al 2015 shreve and brennan 2019 average suc removals during mwwt for the 12 plants ranged from negligible to 56 5 with a median of 4 5 based on daily data consistently suc removals were observed for all four lagoon treatment systems in which average losses ranged from 20 1 to 56 5 table 2 removals of suc were highest in the facultative lagoon treatments averaging between 42 1 and 56 5 fig 1 table 2 three of the four lagoon treatment systems had statistically significant losses of suc we do not have direct information on the specific processes that removed ace or suc in the mwwt systems however sorption of these sweeteners to solids during mwwt is a weak process given their low kow values estimated log kow 1 1 33 suc and ace respectively subedi and kannan 2014 it is likely that one of the main processes that has removed one or both of these sweeteners during mwwt was microbial degradation this interpretation is supported by earlier studies in europe that inferred that microbial adaptation has enhanced ace degradation during mwwt there in recent years castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 the experimental results of perkola et al 2016 suggest that it is unlikely that photodegradation by sunlight played an important role in reduction of suc this applies even to the facultative lagoon treatment systems in which the wastewater was exposed for up to six months to sunlight though under ice for part of this time some photodegradation of ace may occur in shallow surface waters perkola et al 2016 perhaps relevant to the lagoon treatments though evidence is mixed minella et al 2017 our data indicate greater removal of suc in lagoons with facultative treatment compared to aerated lagoons table 2 we suspect that the degradation of suc during facultative treatments may have been enhanced due to anoxic conditions that would have developed as an intermediate layer within the water column during treatment united states environmental protection agency 2002 further investigation would be required to confirm this 3 3 effluent concentrations of ace and suc following municipal wastewater treatment the ace concentrations in the mwwt effluent samples from all 12 sites ranged from 0 2 to 21 μg l and averaged 7 7 μg l with a median value of 5 5 μg l fig 1 the effluent concentrations of suc ranged from 4 5 to 40 1 μg l averaged 21 9 μg l with a median of 21 0 μg l fig 1 tables s2 and s3 provide complete results despite the fact that ace was subject to variable degradation during mwwt the effluent concentrations of ace remained 2 to 4 orders of magnitude above the detection limit for analyses of this sweetener 0 002 μg l in the case of suc which tended to have no statistically significant degradation 9 of 12 plants the effluent concentrations were 2 3 orders of magnitude above the detection limit for analyses of this sweetener 0 02 μg l these results indicate that both ace and suc remain strong candidates as tracers of municipal wastewater effluent even when effluent plumes are diluted by several orders of magnitude in environmental waters though it is now known that microorganisms have adapted to degrading ace at relatively high concentrations during mwwt see 1 1 there appears to be no information on whether ace or suc can be degraded by microorganisms under very different conditions at relatively low concentrations when mwwt effluent is discharged to environmental waters often 1 μg l e g table 1 in spoelstra et al 2013 studies of the fate of ace and suc during municipal aquifer recharge and in laboratory degradation experiments report residual sweetener concentrations ranging from 0 08 to 10 μg l with no evidence that there is ongoing microbial degradation of the sweeteners at the lowest concentrations see tables s5 and s6 in supporting information microbial degradation of sweeteners might be affected by both the conditions treatment plant versus natural waters and by the sweetener concentrations for example temperature has been shown to influence the capacity for microorganisms to biodegrade ace burke et al 2017 3 4 concentrations and variations of ace and suc in septic wastewater the average ace and suc concentrations in the septic wastewater tanks at the seven sites ranged between 13 2 and 108 μg l and 8 4 71 9 μg l respectively table 4 for complete analyses see tables s8 s15 in supporting information these ranges are similar to those reported by snider et al 2017 for 19 septic systems in ontario canada which included the cr and sms sites of this study the average concentrations of ace and suc in the plumes sampled at five sites were lower 5 14 2 μg l and 7 5 18 μg l respectively table 4 but still much higher than the detection limits for these sweeteners 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively the relatively high cv values for both sweeteners in the septic tanks compared to municipal wastewater fig 2 indicate a greater challenge in being able to determine whether persistence or removal degradation of the sweeteners is taking place in the septic plumes the ranges of the cv for the cottage systems overlapped with those of the larger septic systems with no statistical difference 2 sample t tests we suggest that one reason that cv values for ace and suc in septic tank samples were relatively high fig 2 might be related to the duration of sampling each septic system was sampled over a period of 10 months or more table 4 whereas at each municipal treatment plant 3 sequential samples were collected only 1 day apart cv values were not calculated for septic plume samples given that they are affected by mixing with groundwater that directly affects the σt x 3 5 evidence for persistence of ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes 3 5 1 use of chloride as a co tracer we selected chloride as a test co tracer for septic wastewater in this study chloride has been used as a co tracer in earlier studies e g robertson et al 2013 because it occurs at a relatively high concentration and is relatively mobile and non reactive conservative in groundwater negligible sorption mineral precipitation no degradation before examining the plume data we examined the variability of the concentrations of the sweeteners and chloride in the samples from the septic tanks the variations in the chloride concentrations in septic tank samples fig 2 reduce its effectiveness as a co tracer furthermore most regressions of chloride versus ace and suc in the tank samples indicated weak r2 0 5 or negative relationships table s7 in supporting information given these results we consider chloride to have only semi quantitative value as a co tracer in the septic wastewater plumes at one site fc the chloride concentrations in the plume groundwater were consistently higher than those in the septic tank wastewater fig 3 table 4 these data indicate that another chloride source or sources likely de icing salt from a nearby highway other than the septic wastewater plume has contributed much of the chloride measured in the groundwater samples given that this has compromised the use of chloride as a co tracer we exclude the fc site from detailed discussion in this section based on chloride levels observed in groundwater samples with low sweetener concentrations the septic plumes at the other sites were also affected by non septic sources of chloride in the ambient groundwater these samples were used to estimate the background concentrations of chloride in groundwater table 4 it is possible however that we may have overestimated the concentration of background chloride in groundwater at some sites if the samples we used to infer background chloride were impacted by plume water in which the sweeteners had been degraded it is also possible that the background levels of chloride fluctuated seasonally at some of the sites garda 2018 observed spring time spikes in chloride concentrations some higher than septic tank values in plume samples at the cr and sms sites and suggested that the elevated chloride might have been derived from air borne fallout from de icing salt applied to the highways that were located nearby 50 and 100 m from the tile beds respectively if the concentrations of de icing salt or another non septic source of chloride were higher in some samples than our assumed background levels table 4 then our use of chloride as a co tracer has resulted in overestimating the removal degradation of the sweeteners in the plumes at three of the sites sn sms dy the highest concentrations of chloride and the sweeteners in the plumes were similar to those measured in the septic tanks fig 3 this indicates that little if any removal or dilution of ace and suc occurs at these three sites for the relatively short time between flow or pumping from the septic tanks seepage through drainage tiles and the unsaturated zone and recharge at the water table as an undiluted septic plume at the other site cr the groundwater samples with chloride levels most similar to those in the septic tank have notably lower concentrations of both ace and suc this suggests that both sweeteners were partially degraded as the wastewater seeped from the tile drains through the relatively thick unsaturated zone 2 m at this site toward the water table for each site the plot for ace versus chloride is similar to the plot of suc versus chloride fig 3 which indicates comparable persistence and or attenuation of both sweeteners in each of the septic plumes in groundwater some of the plumes have outlier low concentrations of one or both of the sweeteners fig 3 for example the sn site has very low ace concentrations at the lowest chloride concentrations the dy site has non detections of suc at some of the lowest chloride concentrations and low ace concentrations in some of the other samples these observations suggest there may be discrete zones in some of the septic plumes where enhanced degradation of either ace or suc occurs using chloride as a co tracer the majority of the groundwater ace and suc samples plot below the trends for conservative mixing of septic wastewater tank values with ambient groundwater taking into account chloride levels in the ambient groundwater fig 3 this suggests there was some loss of both sweeteners as the wastewater plumes migrated and mixed with groundwater calculations based on chloride as a co tracer infer that there has been removal of ace in at least four of the septic plumes and removal of suc in at least two of the plumes table 4 as noted above given the noise in the sweetener and chloride concentrations and uncertainty regarding the contribution of chloride by other sources these results are tentative and qualitative these results clearly demonstrate the limitation of using chloride as a wastewater tracer even for septic plumes in the immediate vicinity of septic systems 3 5 2 use of suc ace ratio to infer relative stability of these sweeteners the above analysis demonstrates that it is challenging to find a suitable co tracer to assess the persistence of the sweeteners ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes given the above noted issues with chloride we used another approach to examine the persistence of the sweeteners ace and suc in the septic plumes we probed the relative persistence of these sweeteners by comparing their concentrations specifically using the mass ratio suc ace in support of this approach the r2 values for the regressions of suc versus ace in the septic tank samples tended to be higher than the values for regressions of each sweetener versus chloride table s7 in supporting information the suc ace for tank and plume groundwater samples from each site were compared table 5 for four of the five sites the average suc ace in the septic plume was higher than in the septic tank and the inferred removal of ace relative to suc ranged from 22 to 57 table 5 however based on t tests the apparent increase in the suc ace ratio from tank to plume was only significant for two sites table 5 one with a large septic system cr where the inferred removal of ace relative to suc was 29 and the cottage site where the average inferred removal of ace relative to suc was 57 given the noise in both sweetener concentrations fig 2 these results are semi quantitative next we compared samples in each plume along an inferred mixing trend as the plume mixed with ambient groundwater by plotting suc ace versus the total concentration of these sweeteners suc ace fig 4 for all of the five plumes there was overall a negligible change in the suc ace ratio as the septic wastewater mixed with groundwater for each site the slope for the linear regression of suc ace versus suc ace was very close to zero 0 0001 in spite of very large concentration gradients in which the maximums and minimum suc ace varied by factors between 10 and 1000 x within each plume this analysis suggests that both suc and ace are persistent during mixing of the septic wastewater plume with ambient groundwater or that their degradation rates are similar some scatter of suc ace fig 4 suggests zones where either ace or suc is subject to some degradation at two sites estimated transit times in the subsurface were available cr sms garda 2018 both of these sites are seasonal use campgrounds with wastewater loading occurring only during the may october period transit times and ages were estimated by monitoring seasonal breakthrough of the plumes at various locations along the plume after loading commenced in the spring and by continuing monitoring during the winter when no loading was occurring for samples from three piezometers from each site suc ace ratios for groundwater samples were plotted versus transit time to test whether there was a discernible change in the suc ace ratio over the inferred times that the plumes have migrated in groundwater fig 5 the small negative slopes exhibited by both linear regressions fig 5 are influenced by higher values for some of the youngest septic plume samples when these samples are excluded the slopes for each regression decrease to very low values 0 02 each not shown indicating very weak negligible trends these results indicate that both septic plumes cr sms exhibited an overall consistency of suc ace ratios versus estimated age fig 5 in these plumes the suc ace ratio is stable over inferred subsurface travel times of 9 and 6 6 months cr and sms plumes respectively the observed stability of the suc ace ratio over a number of months in these two plumes suggests that ace and suc have similar degradation rates in the groundwater which could be negligible this is in contrast to the results of robertson et al 2016 who found evidence for selective degradation of suc and stability of ace in the long point on canada septic plume during transport in groundwater but over a long time period of 1 7 years and possibly stimulated by a zone of active denitrification present in that plume similarly the samples from the dy plume that showed selective removal of suc lower suc ace values tended to have relatively reducing conditions as indicated by higher concentrations of dissolved fe mn and nh4 and lower concentrations of nitrate and sulfate fig s2 in supporting information 3 5 3 suc ace ratio in a stream impacted by septic systems for the samples collected over a two year period from a small rural stream that flows through a small community with septic systems all had detections of both ace average 0 16 μg l and most had detections of suc average 0 092 μg l assuming samples with non detections 0 001 μg l see table s16 in supporting information for complete analyses these sweeteners have a weak positive correlation r2 0 41 fig s3 in supporting information that is statistically significant pearson correlation coefficient 0 64 p value 0 001 in contrast there was no significant correlation between each sweetener and chloride r2 0 024 0 008 p values 0 67 0 46 apparently due to dominance of non septic sources of the chloride in this stream e g deicing salt the average and standard deviation of the suc ace ratio in these samples 0 74 0 52 are similar to overlap with the values observed in our septic tanks and plumes these data which essentially integrate the impact from multiple septic plumes suggest that overall both sweeteners are stable in most septic plumes as they migrate through groundwater and impact streams 3 6 concentrations of ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes table 4 indicates that the highest concentrations of ace and suc in septic plume samples at all five sites consistently were 5 μg l and some were 10 μg l which are well above the detection limits 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively for these two sweeteners while there is some evidence for partial degradation of these sweeteners in the septic plumes above overall they are relatively stable and thus remain strong candidates as tracers of septic plumes in groundwater 4 discussion this study demonstrates that neither ace nor suc is an ideal wastewater tracer this conclusion should not be surprising because every synthetic chemical present in wastewater that is probed for its value as a tracer is subject to non ideal properties and constraints such as uneven distribution in time and space noise in wastewater sources and tendencies to be attenuated by sorption and degradation even if these are relatively weak processes collectively our mwwt data indicate that if ace concentrations remain high after wastewater treatment and if ace is stable after effluent discharge to the environment then ace retains high value for applications as a municipal wastewater tracer the qualifier to this statement is that one has to take into consideration the wide variation in mwwt effluent ace concentrations resulting from variable extents of ace degradation during different mwwt processes consequently ace might prove to be particularly useful in future as a tracer of effluent from individual mwwt plants our data indicate that suc is usually persistent during mwwt and thus remains a powerful tracer of wastewater flux to the environment however these data also suggest that it is not an ideal tracer when lagoon treatment is used due to degradation likely microbial another potential drawback for use of suc as a tracer is that its detection limit tends to be an order of magnitude higher than that of ace buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 this study consequently ace is sometimes detected in surface waters when suc is either not detected or less frequently detected spoelstra et al 2020 baer et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020b figure 7 this study shows a tendency for less variation lower cv in the ace concentrations in each municipal wastewater source compared to suc in general the application of tracers to determine the fate of septic wastewater plumes is more challenging our analysis based on use of both chloride as a co tracer and suc ace ratios suggests that degradation has removed some of the ace and suc in the study septic plumes this included evidence for extensive removal of at least one of the sweeteners in discrete zones however both ace and suc were relatively persistent overall in all five plumes investigated these sweeteners remain useful as qualitative or semi quantitative tracers of septic plumes in environmental waters there is a distinct advantage in using ace and suc together as co tracers given the evidence that one or the other may tend to be degraded including either discrete zones this study or at a front in septic plumes robertson et al 2016 use of the suc ace ratio may be particularly useful for checking how degradation may be affecting one of these two sweeteners as they migrate in groundwater or in other environmental waters although not ideal tracers ace and suc remain very versatile tracers of wastewater in the environment and they have several advantages over some of the other non ideal tracers that have been recently identified as candidates to track wastewater in environmental waters for example ace and suc tend to have higher concentrations and more ubiquitous presence in wastewater compared to some of the pharmaceutical compounds their metabolites and other medical derived compounds that have been proposed as tracers e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole valsartan acid iodinated x ray contrast medium amidotrizoic acid dickenson et al 2011 wolf et al 2012 nödler et al 2013 also ace and suc are more persistent than compounds such as caffeine warner et al 2019 based on our results we conclude that relative to the other potential tracer compounds ace and suc remain two of the best choices as wastewater tracers given their concentrations when released to the environment relative to detection limits their ease of analysis e g method used in this study their persistence and their source specificity gaps in our current understanding of the fate of ace and suc in the environment include to what extent they undergo degradation biological and or photo catalyzed at dilute concentrations in environmental waters and how redox conditions in the environment affect the biological degradation of these sweeteners another information gap is what conditions can lead to the development of discrete zones of sweetener degradation in septic plumes an area of research that should be explored further is the possibility of combining the analysis of sweeteners with their transformation products metabolites to enhance the use of the sweeteners as tracers a number of studies have already investigated the

sweeteners acesulfame ace and sucralose suc remain valuable tracers of municipal wastewater in environmental waters ace and suc are relatively persistent in septic plumes and thus remain useful as

17660,for more than a decade the artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace and sucralose suc have been applied as tracers of the input of wastewater to environmental waters recently concerns have been raised that degradation of ace during treatment may hinder or restrict its use as a wastewater tracer in this study the value of ace and suc as tracers was reassessed based on samples of wastewater at 12 municipal wastewater treatment mwwt plants and from 7 septic systems and associated septic plumes in groundwater the results indicated stability of suc during mwwt at most plants and variable removal of both sweeteners during some mwwt and in the septic wastewater systems however the residual concentrations of ace and suc in municipal effluent and in septic plumes indicate that both sweeteners remain valuable wastewater tracers the mass ratio suc ace was found to be a useful parameter for examining the relative persistence of these sweeteners graphical abstract image 1 keywords acesulfame sucralose wastewater tracer municipal wastewater septic systems 1 introduction there are many reasons why researchers have sought to track the fate and impact of treated wastewater on environmental waters for example the large volumes of treated wastewater released each year estimated 330 km3 globally mateo sagasta et al 2015 can deliver trace contaminants pathogens and elevated nutrients to environmental waters some of these may have harmful effects on aquatic ecosystems or impair drinking water quality jmaiff blackstock et al 2019 warner et al 2019 in particular there may be toxic impacts on aquatic organisms and disruption of aquatic ecosystem functions e g triebskorn et al 2004 costanzo et al 2005 martín et al 2012 and increased risk of algal blooms in surface waters herath 1997 there are also threats to human health if drinking water sources gasser et al 2010 lapworth et al 2012 marshall et al 2019 or recreational waters are impacted glassmeyer et al 2005 a wide range of chemicals have been proposed as potential tracers to track the presence of wastewater in the environment e g glassmeyer et al 2005 kahle et al 2009 gasser et al 2010 dickenson et al 2011 james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 mccance et al 2018 warner et al 2019 in particular synthetic chemicals present in wastewater are potential tracers if they are released to the environment at concentrations well above their detection limits and if their attenuation processes in these environments are relatively slow just over a decade ago the artificial sweeteners acesulfame ace and sucralose suc were identified as useful tracers of wastewater input to environmental waters in part because of their observed persistence during municipal wastewater treatment buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 soh et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 gan et al 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 jekel et al 2015 and as septic wastewater plumes migrate in groundwater robertson et al 2013 recent studies have challenged the status of ace as a wastewater tracer following reports cardenas et al 2016 falås et al 2016 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 that ace was largely removed during wastewater treatment other studies have documented degradation of this sweetener see 1 1 this evidence prompted a recent claim that the use of ace as conservative tracer is obsolete kleinsteuber et al 2019 there is evidence that suc can also be degraded during wastewater treatment see 1 1 some studies have looked at degradation mechanisms and transformation products of these sweeteners e g sang et al 2014 li et al 2016 2017 this is significant in that the combined analysis of the sweeteners and their transformation products if the latter are persistent and diagnostic could potentially ameliorate the issue of tracer sweetener degradation the objective of this study is to reassess the value of ace and suc as tracers focusing on 1 their persistence during various types of municipal wastewater treatment mwwt 2 their concentrations when released to the environment either as municipal effluent or as septic wastewater plumes in groundwater and 3 their stability when septic plumes migrate through the subsurface with respect to our third objective we report persistence of the two sweeteners ace and suc in five septic plumes located in ontario canada prior to this study the only previous detailed information about persistence of ace and suc in a septic plume was an ongoing investigation of a plume in ontario canada robertson et al 2013 2016 in our assessment of the potential future use of these sweeteners as tracers we take into consideration the context of previous studies we also identify remaining gaps in our understanding about the fate of these chemicals in the environment 1 1 sweeteners and municipal wastewater treatment municipalities use various wastewater treatment mwwt systems table 1 to treat wastewater before it is released to the environment either directly to surface water bodies or via infiltration ponds into the subsurface where it mixes with groundwater consistent with reports castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 of biological degradation of ace during mwwt in germany other studies documented removal degradation of this sweetener during mwwt in australia cardenas et al 2016 the united states shreve and brennan 2019 and china yang et al 2017 li et al 2018b ace degradation was also demonstrated in tests of sequential managed aquifer recharge hellauer et al 2018 and pilot scale treatment wetlands nivala et al 2019 similarly laboratory studies documented degradation of ace e g achermann et al 2018 burke et al 2018 li et al 2018a wolff et al 2018 by specific microbial strains kleinsteuber et al 2019 by enzymes gonzales gil et al 2019 and by abiotic processes such as uv irradiation sang et al 2014 perkola et al 2016 minella et al 2017 chlorination li et al 2017 and ozonation soh et al 2011 zoumpouli et al 2019 collectively these studies suggest that ace previously found to be persistent during mwwt has become biodegradable by microbial adaptation kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 despite conclusive evidence that ace can be degraded during mwwt the extent of degradation during treatment can vary widely for example under different conditions in pilot scale wetlands ace degradation ranged from negligible to 62 nivala et al 2019 and in batch reactors used to simulate mwwt the degradation of ace ranged from around 10 to 90 wolff et al 2018 furthermore studies that have found degradation of ace during mwwt generally showed high residual concentrations typically 1 μg l of this sweetener in effluent samples table s1 in supporting information studies that have probed the fate of suc during mwwt have generally indicated its persistence table s1 at first glance these results suggest that suc may be a better candidate as a tracer of wastewater in the environment than ace however there is evidence for attenuation of suc including degradation during treatment of municipal wastewater scheurer et al 2009 2011 reported evidence for slow removal of sucralose during soil aquifer treatment as a final mwwt step and the loss was greater than that for ace attenuation of suc was significant up to 70 at two municipal wastewater infiltration pond sites in sweden at one of these sites the attenuation of suc was similar to the attenuation of ace gao et al 2019 1 2 sweeteners in septic system treatment in many smaller communities and rural areas wastewater is treated onsite for each home or facility using septic systems table 1 there is strong interest in finding chemical tracers to track the impact of septic wastewater on groundwater used for drinking water supplies murphy et al 2020 and on the streams and other water bodies into which the groundwater discharges finding suitable tracers to track impacts of septic wastewater may be more challenging than for municipal wastewater this is because septic systems are used for individual facilities or homes sometimes only seasonally so the chemistry of the wastewater that they generate may be much more variable over time than the wastewater generated by municipalities also the likelihood of a specific chemical e g pharmaceutical compound being present in the wastewater from an individual household is much lower than the likelihood of its presence in municipal wastewater when septic wastewater seeps into the subsurface it mixes with groundwater in order to estimate to what extent the selected tracer sweetener concentrations in the plumes have been affected by this mixing dilution process one generally needs to use another tracer a co tracer as discussed by mccane et al 2018 the use of relatively novel tracers such as sweeteners as co tracers in conjunction with the more conventional tracers i e stable and radiogenic isotopes or major ions can provide a more robust method of separating potential sources of contamination for our application the co tracer must be a solute present in the septic wastewater and behave conservatively i e no gains or losses as it mixes and flows with groundwater which can be compared to the sweetener concentrations and thus used to assess the role of dilution versus attenuation finding such a co tracer is challenging even if a suitable co tracer is found its use introduces extra noise and uncertainty given that the concentrations of both the sweetener and the co tracer are subject to temporal source variability and analytical uncertainty despite these challenges as part of an ongoing detailed investigation of a septic plume at a seasonal campground in ontario canada robertson et al 2013 found that ace and suc were persistent tracers in a plume of septic wastewater in groundwater and when this plume was resampled there was evidence of significant degradation of sucralose under suboxic conditions in the deeper and distal zones of the plume robertson et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of municipal wastewater as described by van stempvoort et al 2020a raw influent and final effluent wastewater samples were obtained from twelve mwwt plants at various locations across canada which varied widely in the treatment processes used table 2 locations anonymous on request at all plants raw influent and final effluent wastewater were sampled concurrently i e not hydraulically matched at most plants the samples were collected using autosamplers grab samples were obtained using pre cleaned stainless steel pails at treatment plants that had intermittent flows or lacked available electricity table 3 provides details regarding the sampling method for each plant on the day of collection all mwwt samples raw influent and final effluent were preserved for a range of analyses cf van stempvoort et al 2020a by filtering a 20 ml subsample through a sterile sfca 0 2 μm syringe filter corning corning ny usa with a 25 ml agilent disposable polypropylene syringe into a 40 ml pre cleaned glass epa volatile vial systems plus ltd baden on can that was preloaded with 5 5 g of isopropanol fisher scientific optima lc ms grade and then refrigerating until analysis the storage of isopropanol preserved and refrigerated ip rf samples before analysis ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months to test the ip rf technique samples of both influent and effluent for one site were split half were stored using the ip rf technique and half were frozen which is standard procedure for the analysis of these sweeteners van stempvoort et al 2020b after 11 weeks the ace and suc concentrations in the ipa rf stored samples were between 98 5 and 100 2 of the concentrations in frozen samples except for suc in the influent which was 130 4 the maximum holding time for ipa rf preserved samples was not tested 2 2 sampling of septic wastewater all of the seven septic systems in ontario canada selected for this study have seasonal use two are large conventional systems two are large mound systems and three are small mound systems for seasonal cottages table 4 at each site wastewater was sampled directly from the septic tank or dosing chamber if present by peristaltic pump with a dedicated polyethylene sampling tube at five of the sites groundwater was sampled from multilevel bundle piezometers two to six sampling tubes each installed directly beneath each septic drainfield and sometimes downgradient using peristaltic pumps all samples were filtered immediately 0 45 μm collected in separate polyethylene containers for sweeteners and anions and kept cold with ice or freezer packs in a cooler while transported to the laboratory at the laboratory the sweetener samples were frozen until analysis 2 3 sampling of a stream impacted by septic wastewater a small stream in a rural area in ontario canada was sampled every 2 4 weeks from june 2017 to july 2019 using a pole sampler as described by van stempvoort et al 2020b their station cc sw c this stream is impacted by multiple septic systems from a small community the estimated catchment area for this stream is 10 7 km2 and the estimated mean annual flow is 0 13 m³ s ontario ministry of natural resources and forestry 2018 the stream samples were immediately filtered in the field 0 45 μm placed in coolers then frozen until analysis 2 4 laboratory analyses artificial sweeteners were analyzed by environment and climate change canada at the canada centre for inland waters cciw burlington on canada by ion chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source in negative mode van stempvoort et al 2020b the detection limits for ace and suc were 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively anions including chloride were analyzed by ion chromatography using a dionex ic system 3 results 3 1 concentrations and variations of ace and suc in municipal wastewater samples the concentrations of ace and suc in the influent and effluent mwwt samples are shown in fig 1 complete analyses are provided in tables s2 and s3 in the supporting information fig 2 provides the coefficient of variation cv for the concentration of each sweetener in the wastewater influent and effluent at each mwwt plant 1 cvt x σt x μt x where t is the tracer being measured x is the wastewater source being sampled influent or effluent for a plant septic tank σt x is the standard deviation for the same samples and μt x is the mean tracer concentration for samples from that source for probing the fate of these sweeteners during wastewater treatment lower cv values are desirable because they indicate less variation in the concentrations and thus more confidence in being able to determine whether a tracer is persistent or if removal sorption or degradation of the tracer occurs during wastewater treatment the cv values for ace and suc for the various types of wastewater overlap but there is a tendency for ace to have lower cv fig 2 complete list of cv results is provided in table s4 in supporting information one might hypothesize that the largest municipal wastewater systems would have the lowest cv values assuming that the variability of the sweetener concentrations would be less affected by variations in input from individual facilities or households e g cottages however there was no apparent relationship between the wastewater flows m3 d and cv values r2 between 0 05 and 0 1 see fig s1 in supporting information the two primary mwwt systems v h were affected by rain events on the third day of a 3 day sampling period this event diluted both influent and effluent wastewater thus increasing cv over the three days of sampling 3 2 variable persistence of ace and suc during municipal wastewater treatment for the mwwt samples the effluent ace concentrations tended to be lower than influent concentrations fig 1 see tables s2 and s3 in supporting information for complete analyses based on a comparison of average influent and effluent concentrations for each plant the removal of ace during treatment had a median of 59 based on daily data and the average removal ranged between 11 8 and 99 2 for the twelve mwwt plants table 2 fig 1 the declines in concentrations were statistically significant for eight of the twelve mwwt systems table 2 two of the exceptions were the two primary treatment systems affected by rain events which had the highest cv values of all systems fig 2 the relatively high removals inferred for the two small facultative lagoon systems nw j 1000 m3 d each table 2 were not statistically significant based on a comparison of influent and effluent concentrations paired t tests 0 05 level this was related to the high cv values for the influent wastewater for these systems 0 18 and 0 30 which after the rain event affected systems were the next highest the magnitudes of the removals during treatment were strongly dependent on the type of mwwt process only small fractions not statistically significant of the ace were removed in the two systems that used primary treatment only whereas in some of the secondary and advanced treatment systems 90 of the ace was removed table 2 overall suc was more persistent than ace during mwwt fig 1 table 2 consistent with recent observations elsewhere arbeláez et al 2015 shreve and brennan 2019 average suc removals during mwwt for the 12 plants ranged from negligible to 56 5 with a median of 4 5 based on daily data consistently suc removals were observed for all four lagoon treatment systems in which average losses ranged from 20 1 to 56 5 table 2 removals of suc were highest in the facultative lagoon treatments averaging between 42 1 and 56 5 fig 1 table 2 three of the four lagoon treatment systems had statistically significant losses of suc we do not have direct information on the specific processes that removed ace or suc in the mwwt systems however sorption of these sweeteners to solids during mwwt is a weak process given their low kow values estimated log kow 1 1 33 suc and ace respectively subedi and kannan 2014 it is likely that one of the main processes that has removed one or both of these sweeteners during mwwt was microbial degradation this interpretation is supported by earlier studies in europe that inferred that microbial adaptation has enhanced ace degradation during mwwt there in recent years castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 the experimental results of perkola et al 2016 suggest that it is unlikely that photodegradation by sunlight played an important role in reduction of suc this applies even to the facultative lagoon treatment systems in which the wastewater was exposed for up to six months to sunlight though under ice for part of this time some photodegradation of ace may occur in shallow surface waters perkola et al 2016 perhaps relevant to the lagoon treatments though evidence is mixed minella et al 2017 our data indicate greater removal of suc in lagoons with facultative treatment compared to aerated lagoons table 2 we suspect that the degradation of suc during facultative treatments may have been enhanced due to anoxic conditions that would have developed as an intermediate layer within the water column during treatment united states environmental protection agency 2002 further investigation would be required to confirm this 3 3 effluent concentrations of ace and suc following municipal wastewater treatment the ace concentrations in the mwwt effluent samples from all 12 sites ranged from 0 2 to 21 μg l and averaged 7 7 μg l with a median value of 5 5 μg l fig 1 the effluent concentrations of suc ranged from 4 5 to 40 1 μg l averaged 21 9 μg l with a median of 21 0 μg l fig 1 tables s2 and s3 provide complete results despite the fact that ace was subject to variable degradation during mwwt the effluent concentrations of ace remained 2 to 4 orders of magnitude above the detection limit for analyses of this sweetener 0 002 μg l in the case of suc which tended to have no statistically significant degradation 9 of 12 plants the effluent concentrations were 2 3 orders of magnitude above the detection limit for analyses of this sweetener 0 02 μg l these results indicate that both ace and suc remain strong candidates as tracers of municipal wastewater effluent even when effluent plumes are diluted by several orders of magnitude in environmental waters though it is now known that microorganisms have adapted to degrading ace at relatively high concentrations during mwwt see 1 1 there appears to be no information on whether ace or suc can be degraded by microorganisms under very different conditions at relatively low concentrations when mwwt effluent is discharged to environmental waters often 1 μg l e g table 1 in spoelstra et al 2013 studies of the fate of ace and suc during municipal aquifer recharge and in laboratory degradation experiments report residual sweetener concentrations ranging from 0 08 to 10 μg l with no evidence that there is ongoing microbial degradation of the sweeteners at the lowest concentrations see tables s5 and s6 in supporting information microbial degradation of sweeteners might be affected by both the conditions treatment plant versus natural waters and by the sweetener concentrations for example temperature has been shown to influence the capacity for microorganisms to biodegrade ace burke et al 2017 3 4 concentrations and variations of ace and suc in septic wastewater the average ace and suc concentrations in the septic wastewater tanks at the seven sites ranged between 13 2 and 108 μg l and 8 4 71 9 μg l respectively table 4 for complete analyses see tables s8 s15 in supporting information these ranges are similar to those reported by snider et al 2017 for 19 septic systems in ontario canada which included the cr and sms sites of this study the average concentrations of ace and suc in the plumes sampled at five sites were lower 5 14 2 μg l and 7 5 18 μg l respectively table 4 but still much higher than the detection limits for these sweeteners 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively the relatively high cv values for both sweeteners in the septic tanks compared to municipal wastewater fig 2 indicate a greater challenge in being able to determine whether persistence or removal degradation of the sweeteners is taking place in the septic plumes the ranges of the cv for the cottage systems overlapped with those of the larger septic systems with no statistical difference 2 sample t tests we suggest that one reason that cv values for ace and suc in septic tank samples were relatively high fig 2 might be related to the duration of sampling each septic system was sampled over a period of 10 months or more table 4 whereas at each municipal treatment plant 3 sequential samples were collected only 1 day apart cv values were not calculated for septic plume samples given that they are affected by mixing with groundwater that directly affects the σt x 3 5 evidence for persistence of ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes 3 5 1 use of chloride as a co tracer we selected chloride as a test co tracer for septic wastewater in this study chloride has been used as a co tracer in earlier studies e g robertson et al 2013 because it occurs at a relatively high concentration and is relatively mobile and non reactive conservative in groundwater negligible sorption mineral precipitation no degradation before examining the plume data we examined the variability of the concentrations of the sweeteners and chloride in the samples from the septic tanks the variations in the chloride concentrations in septic tank samples fig 2 reduce its effectiveness as a co tracer furthermore most regressions of chloride versus ace and suc in the tank samples indicated weak r2 0 5 or negative relationships table s7 in supporting information given these results we consider chloride to have only semi quantitative value as a co tracer in the septic wastewater plumes at one site fc the chloride concentrations in the plume groundwater were consistently higher than those in the septic tank wastewater fig 3 table 4 these data indicate that another chloride source or sources likely de icing salt from a nearby highway other than the septic wastewater plume has contributed much of the chloride measured in the groundwater samples given that this has compromised the use of chloride as a co tracer we exclude the fc site from detailed discussion in this section based on chloride levels observed in groundwater samples with low sweetener concentrations the septic plumes at the other sites were also affected by non septic sources of chloride in the ambient groundwater these samples were used to estimate the background concentrations of chloride in groundwater table 4 it is possible however that we may have overestimated the concentration of background chloride in groundwater at some sites if the samples we used to infer background chloride were impacted by plume water in which the sweeteners had been degraded it is also possible that the background levels of chloride fluctuated seasonally at some of the sites garda 2018 observed spring time spikes in chloride concentrations some higher than septic tank values in plume samples at the cr and sms sites and suggested that the elevated chloride might have been derived from air borne fallout from de icing salt applied to the highways that were located nearby 50 and 100 m from the tile beds respectively if the concentrations of de icing salt or another non septic source of chloride were higher in some samples than our assumed background levels table 4 then our use of chloride as a co tracer has resulted in overestimating the removal degradation of the sweeteners in the plumes at three of the sites sn sms dy the highest concentrations of chloride and the sweeteners in the plumes were similar to those measured in the septic tanks fig 3 this indicates that little if any removal or dilution of ace and suc occurs at these three sites for the relatively short time between flow or pumping from the septic tanks seepage through drainage tiles and the unsaturated zone and recharge at the water table as an undiluted septic plume at the other site cr the groundwater samples with chloride levels most similar to those in the septic tank have notably lower concentrations of both ace and suc this suggests that both sweeteners were partially degraded as the wastewater seeped from the tile drains through the relatively thick unsaturated zone 2 m at this site toward the water table for each site the plot for ace versus chloride is similar to the plot of suc versus chloride fig 3 which indicates comparable persistence and or attenuation of both sweeteners in each of the septic plumes in groundwater some of the plumes have outlier low concentrations of one or both of the sweeteners fig 3 for example the sn site has very low ace concentrations at the lowest chloride concentrations the dy site has non detections of suc at some of the lowest chloride concentrations and low ace concentrations in some of the other samples these observations suggest there may be discrete zones in some of the septic plumes where enhanced degradation of either ace or suc occurs using chloride as a co tracer the majority of the groundwater ace and suc samples plot below the trends for conservative mixing of septic wastewater tank values with ambient groundwater taking into account chloride levels in the ambient groundwater fig 3 this suggests there was some loss of both sweeteners as the wastewater plumes migrated and mixed with groundwater calculations based on chloride as a co tracer infer that there has been removal of ace in at least four of the septic plumes and removal of suc in at least two of the plumes table 4 as noted above given the noise in the sweetener and chloride concentrations and uncertainty regarding the contribution of chloride by other sources these results are tentative and qualitative these results clearly demonstrate the limitation of using chloride as a wastewater tracer even for septic plumes in the immediate vicinity of septic systems 3 5 2 use of suc ace ratio to infer relative stability of these sweeteners the above analysis demonstrates that it is challenging to find a suitable co tracer to assess the persistence of the sweeteners ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes given the above noted issues with chloride we used another approach to examine the persistence of the sweeteners ace and suc in the septic plumes we probed the relative persistence of these sweeteners by comparing their concentrations specifically using the mass ratio suc ace in support of this approach the r2 values for the regressions of suc versus ace in the septic tank samples tended to be higher than the values for regressions of each sweetener versus chloride table s7 in supporting information the suc ace for tank and plume groundwater samples from each site were compared table 5 for four of the five sites the average suc ace in the septic plume was higher than in the septic tank and the inferred removal of ace relative to suc ranged from 22 to 57 table 5 however based on t tests the apparent increase in the suc ace ratio from tank to plume was only significant for two sites table 5 one with a large septic system cr where the inferred removal of ace relative to suc was 29 and the cottage site where the average inferred removal of ace relative to suc was 57 given the noise in both sweetener concentrations fig 2 these results are semi quantitative next we compared samples in each plume along an inferred mixing trend as the plume mixed with ambient groundwater by plotting suc ace versus the total concentration of these sweeteners suc ace fig 4 for all of the five plumes there was overall a negligible change in the suc ace ratio as the septic wastewater mixed with groundwater for each site the slope for the linear regression of suc ace versus suc ace was very close to zero 0 0001 in spite of very large concentration gradients in which the maximums and minimum suc ace varied by factors between 10 and 1000 x within each plume this analysis suggests that both suc and ace are persistent during mixing of the septic wastewater plume with ambient groundwater or that their degradation rates are similar some scatter of suc ace fig 4 suggests zones where either ace or suc is subject to some degradation at two sites estimated transit times in the subsurface were available cr sms garda 2018 both of these sites are seasonal use campgrounds with wastewater loading occurring only during the may october period transit times and ages were estimated by monitoring seasonal breakthrough of the plumes at various locations along the plume after loading commenced in the spring and by continuing monitoring during the winter when no loading was occurring for samples from three piezometers from each site suc ace ratios for groundwater samples were plotted versus transit time to test whether there was a discernible change in the suc ace ratio over the inferred times that the plumes have migrated in groundwater fig 5 the small negative slopes exhibited by both linear regressions fig 5 are influenced by higher values for some of the youngest septic plume samples when these samples are excluded the slopes for each regression decrease to very low values 0 02 each not shown indicating very weak negligible trends these results indicate that both septic plumes cr sms exhibited an overall consistency of suc ace ratios versus estimated age fig 5 in these plumes the suc ace ratio is stable over inferred subsurface travel times of 9 and 6 6 months cr and sms plumes respectively the observed stability of the suc ace ratio over a number of months in these two plumes suggests that ace and suc have similar degradation rates in the groundwater which could be negligible this is in contrast to the results of robertson et al 2016 who found evidence for selective degradation of suc and stability of ace in the long point on canada septic plume during transport in groundwater but over a long time period of 1 7 years and possibly stimulated by a zone of active denitrification present in that plume similarly the samples from the dy plume that showed selective removal of suc lower suc ace values tended to have relatively reducing conditions as indicated by higher concentrations of dissolved fe mn and nh4 and lower concentrations of nitrate and sulfate fig s2 in supporting information 3 5 3 suc ace ratio in a stream impacted by septic systems for the samples collected over a two year period from a small rural stream that flows through a small community with septic systems all had detections of both ace average 0 16 μg l and most had detections of suc average 0 092 μg l assuming samples with non detections 0 001 μg l see table s16 in supporting information for complete analyses these sweeteners have a weak positive correlation r2 0 41 fig s3 in supporting information that is statistically significant pearson correlation coefficient 0 64 p value 0 001 in contrast there was no significant correlation between each sweetener and chloride r2 0 024 0 008 p values 0 67 0 46 apparently due to dominance of non septic sources of the chloride in this stream e g deicing salt the average and standard deviation of the suc ace ratio in these samples 0 74 0 52 are similar to overlap with the values observed in our septic tanks and plumes these data which essentially integrate the impact from multiple septic plumes suggest that overall both sweeteners are stable in most septic plumes as they migrate through groundwater and impact streams 3 6 concentrations of ace and suc in septic wastewater plumes table 4 indicates that the highest concentrations of ace and suc in septic plume samples at all five sites consistently were 5 μg l and some were 10 μg l which are well above the detection limits 0 002 and 0 02 μg l respectively for these two sweeteners while there is some evidence for partial degradation of these sweeteners in the septic plumes above overall they are relatively stable and thus remain strong candidates as tracers of septic plumes in groundwater 4 discussion this study demonstrates that neither ace nor suc is an ideal wastewater tracer this conclusion should not be surprising because every synthetic chemical present in wastewater that is probed for its value as a tracer is subject to non ideal properties and constraints such as uneven distribution in time and space noise in wastewater sources and tendencies to be attenuated by sorption and degradation even if these are relatively weak processes collectively our mwwt data indicate that if ace concentrations remain high after wastewater treatment and if ace is stable after effluent discharge to the environment then ace retains high value for applications as a municipal wastewater tracer the qualifier to this statement is that one has to take into consideration the wide variation in mwwt effluent ace concentrations resulting from variable extents of ace degradation during different mwwt processes consequently ace might prove to be particularly useful in future as a tracer of effluent from individual mwwt plants our data indicate that suc is usually persistent during mwwt and thus remains a powerful tracer of wastewater flux to the environment however these data also suggest that it is not an ideal tracer when lagoon treatment is used due to degradation likely microbial another potential drawback for use of suc as a tracer is that its detection limit tends to be an order of magnitude higher than that of ace buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 this study consequently ace is sometimes detected in surface waters when suc is either not detected or less frequently detected spoelstra et al 2020 baer et al 2019 van stempvoort et al 2020b figure 7 this study shows a tendency for less variation lower cv in the ace concentrations in each municipal wastewater source compared to suc in general the application of tracers to determine the fate of septic wastewater plumes is more challenging our analysis based on use of both chloride as a co tracer and suc ace ratios suggests that degradation has removed some of the ace and suc in the study septic plumes this included evidence for extensive removal of at least one of the sweeteners in discrete zones however both ace and suc were relatively persistent overall in all five plumes investigated these sweeteners remain useful as qualitative or semi quantitative tracers of septic plumes in environmental waters there is a distinct advantage in using ace and suc together as co tracers given the evidence that one or the other may tend to be degraded including either discrete zones this study or at a front in septic plumes robertson et al 2016 use of the suc ace ratio may be particularly useful for checking how degradation may be affecting one of these two sweeteners as they migrate in groundwater or in other environmental waters although not ideal tracers ace and suc remain very versatile tracers of wastewater in the environment and they have several advantages over some of the other non ideal tracers that have been recently identified as candidates to track wastewater in environmental waters for example ace and suc tend to have higher concentrations and more ubiquitous presence in wastewater compared to some of the pharmaceutical compounds their metabolites and other medical derived compounds that have been proposed as tracers e g carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole valsartan acid iodinated x ray contrast medium amidotrizoic acid

17661,due to the inherent rheological complexity of wastewater sludges conventional sludge pipeline design based on simplified rheological models can result in inefficient sludge transportation systems these inefficiencies are further exacerbated by a global need for the processing of more concentrated wastewater sludges that have a more pronounced non newtonian character and hence require greater energy for transportation however the complex rheology of these materials typically visco elastic and thixotropic requires sophisticated methods for constitutive modelling that are impractical to implement for complex materials such as sewerage sludges we address this challenge by developing a novel viscoplastic thixotropic constitutive model that exploits the separation of timescales between the thixotropic and viscoelastic processes leading to simpler and more robust experimental methods parameter estimation and process simulation methods this constitutive model combines a kinetic model for thixotropic degradation and agglomeration via a classical structural parameter λ approach coupled nonlinearly with a herschel bulkley model to yield a thixotropic viscoplastic model of sludge rheology experimental data for thickened digested sludge between 3 and 4 9 solids were collected to validate the assumption for the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic responses the fitting procedure was found to be robust and efficient and several rheological parameters were found to be invariant with solids concentration simplified energy calculations for a typical sludge pipeline showed that the pumping energy could be significantly under or overestimated without considering thixotropy these simple and robust constitutive models and fitting methods can accurately predict and hence design and optimise sludge behaviour over a wide range of wastewater processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge rheology thixotropy viscoplasticity constitutive modelling pipeline transportation elasto visco plastic 1 introduction globally wastewater sludge transportation systems account for a significant proportion of total energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants despite the magnitude of this energy consumption these pipeline systems are often operated far from their optimal energy efficiency as system design is typically based upon over simplified calculations of friction loss that only consider a single valued viscosity and ignores the inherent complexity of sludge rheology anderson et al 2008 concentrated wastewater sludges exhibit a range of apparent viscosities that can vary strongly as a function of both the magnitude and duration of an applied force known as shear history markis et al 2014 these factors must be accounted for when designing transportation systems the rheological complexity of concentrated wastewater sludges can manifest in several ways above a specific solids concentration typically 1 sludge exhibits solid like behaviour under flow start up which arises from the presence of a gel like microstructure that must be broken down to some extent before flow can begin this solid like property manifests as visco elastic rheological behaviour over small timescales relaxation timescale baudez et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 but it is also often approximated as a visco plastic behaviour i e a yield stress fluid in many instances eshtiaghi et al 2013 mechanistically deformation of the microstructure by small externally imposed deformations is reversible in that it can store energy elastically however as the strain amplitude is increased microstructural rearrangements on progressively larger length scales lead to irreversible deformation that manifests as a dissipative viscous mechanical response while there is increasing evidence buscall et al 2015 that this irreversible breakdown may be described as a purely viscoelastic response in the most general case this breakdown may be described by an elasto visco plastic rheological model once a flow is initiated the microstructure of these materials can undergo further degradation with shear history which manifests as a thixotropic behaviour of the sludge baudez 2008 thixotropy is defined as the gradual decrease with flow of the viscosity of a material that was initially at rest and the subsequent gradual recovery of viscosity once the flow is ceased larson 2015 upon flow cessation the rheology of concentrated wastewater sludges has been observed markis et al 2014 to undergo either a complete or partial recovery with time due to restructuring of the sludge microstructure with brownian motion mewis and wagner 2011 both the elasto visco plastic and thixotropic nature of the sludge rheology plays a critical role in the design and optimization of processes such as pump start up and long distance transportation because of the long residence times short time dynamics and different shear histories during these processes however this combination of simultaneous thixotropic and elasto visco plastic tevp rheology presents a significant challenge for the development of accurate constitutive models for these materials as it is often challenging to deconvolve the various contributions from these different microstructural processes ewoldt and mckinley 2017 hence the development and application of robust and accurate tevp models remain an unresolved scientific challenge the tevp models developed to date involve a large number of model parameters that make it challenging to avoid spurious fitting and hinder the identification of fundamental material parameters from confounding factors as such these methods have only been applied successfully to a small number of materials with relatively well characterized rheological behaviours such as xanthan gum blackwell and ewoldt 2014 de souza mendes 2011 wei et al 2018 conversely concentrated wastewater sludges are notoriously complex materials that pose a number of fundamental and practical challenges eshtiaghi et al 2013 with respect to their rheological characterisation hence the tevp models and characterisation methods proposed by ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are too complex and impractical for concentrated wastewater sludges literature regarding the rheological characterisation of the thixotropic and elasto visco plastic tevp behaviour of wastewater sludge is scarce despite the very significant impact of sludge rheology upon the performance of wastewater treatment plant equipment such as pumps mixer and aerators typical constitutive models for wastewater sludges are over simplified in they do not resolve the important couplings between viscoelasticity and thixotropy which is necessary for industrial application for example eshtiaghi et al 2012a 2016 2012b baudez et al 2011 2013 and farno et al 2015 2016 considered wastewater sludges to behave as a purely shear thinning viscoplastic material in the liquid like regime i e at applied shear stresses beyond the shear yield stress while ignoring the fact that these materials are thixotropic due to the lack of a comprehensive constitutive model industrial practitioners typically increase the estimated pressure drop by 10 50 anderson et al 2008 to allow for the errors in design and prediction of the best efficiency point for pump operation gottliebson et al 2008 by reconstruction of the sludge velocity profile during a rheometric measurement with a wide gap vane geometry baudez 2008 demonstrated that due to the thixotropic nature of the sludge the width of the flowing yielded part of the sludge material across the gap between the rheometer vane and cup varies with shearing time under a constant shear force baudez 2008 proposed a thixotropic and elasto visco plastic model based on the analogy between the proportion of yielded to unyielded material and the proportion of broken to unbroken sludge microstructure using a dimensionless structural parameter λ which quantifies the evolution of the shear yield stress of the sludge with thixotropy this model describes the degradation of sludge microstructure during the flow initiation as a gradual transformation from a kelvin voigt linear viscoelastic behaviour to a newtonian viscous flow this model however is not able to describe rebuild of the microstructure under shear and shear rate dependent break down of microstructure as λ is only a function of shear time and it is not described with a kinetic model as is observed for colloidal suspensions buscall et al 2015 conversely hammadi et al 2013 used a combination of a herschel bulkley viscoplastic constitutive model with the thixotropic model of tiu and boger 1974 to characterise the rheology of wastewater sludge this model is formed simply by scaling the sludge flow curve fitted with the herschel bulkley equation with a dimensionless structural parameter λ which parameterises the thixotropic state of the sludge microstructure here the fully agglomerated sludge microstructure at rest i e under zero shear rate corresponds to a structural parameter equal to one λ 1 and the fully disintegrated microstructure under very large shear rates corresponds to a structural parameter equal to zero λ 0 under constant shear rate the structural parameter decays from an initial value λ 0 toward a finite equilibrium value λ e λ 0 via a second order kinetic equation the main drawbacks of this model are that rebuild of the microstructure is not included and the kinetics of the structural parameter evolution equation varies with shear rate and so need to be experimentally determined across a range of shear rates as such there exists a pressing need for the development of constitutive models and characterisation methods for wastewater sludges which considers both thixotropic and viscoplastic rheology of sludge while are also simple and robust enough for routine application to these complex biological materials in this study we directly address this need by developing and applying novel rheological characterisation methods for concentrated wastewater sludges by clearly identifying the timescale of elastic relaxation and the timescale of thixotropic breakdown and rebuild the elastic timescale is related to the relaxation of the sludge microstructure in response to small deformations whereas the thixotropic timescale characterises the rate of degradation of the sludge microstructure in response to sustained viscous flow as the elastic and thixotropic timescales arise from very different physical mechanisms they typically differ by at least several orders of magnitude this separation of timescales allows us to employ an assumption of quasi static rheological behaviour enabling natural decoupling of the yield and thixotropic processes in wastewater sludges in turn this timescale separation justifies the development and application of relatively simple constitutive models and characterisation techniques to exploit this behaviour indeed it is only for materials where these processes act on commensurate timescales that the complexities associated with fully coupled tevp characterization techniques ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are required tevp models are certainly more comprehensive than the simple thixotropic viscoplastic models as they can predict combined thixotropic viscoplastic and viscoelastic behaviour of a material however because the application of tevp models often requires detailed experiments such as large amplitude oscillatory shear characterisation as proposed by ewoldt and mckinley 2017 to differentiate between viscoelastic and thixotropic responses and analysis of this rheological data involves solving a system of partial differential equations and determination of several fitting parameters they are not suitable for complex industrial systems such as wastewater sludges in this study we focus on process timescales that are significantly longer than the relaxation timescale i e that do not resolve the detailed yielding dynamics associated with e g pump start up and so only require constitutive models that resolve the viscoplastic and thixotropic behaviour of these materials the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in the following section we detail the theory regarding constitutive modelling of tevp materials and the application to wastewater sludges under the assumption of the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic timescales this assumption facilitates the development of relatively simple rheological constitutive models that can be readily employed to design and optimise both pipeline transportation systems and wastewater treatment plant operations via computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation in section 3 we describe the experimental materials and rheometric methods and apply these rheometric techniques including creep tests step up and step down the shear rate to samples of concentrated wastewater sludge at four different solids concentrations over the range 3 0 4 9 w w solids these experiments justify the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic timescales and provide quantitative data for the fitting of the constitutive model section 4 is concerned with the fitting of the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model to this data a discussion of research findings undertaken in section 5 including the application of the constitutive model to several examples of pressure calculations for the thixotropic breakdown in sludge pipelines finally conclusions are made in section 6 the constitutive model developed in this study represents the first accurate quantification of the viscoplastic and thixotropic rheology of wastewater sludges including resolution of both breakdown and rebuild of the sludge microstructure respectively via shear degradation and brownian motion 2 constitutive modelling of tevp materials the classical approach to modelling thixotropic behaviour in any material is developed by quantifying the general constitutive equation for the material in terms of a dimensionless structural parameter λ barnes 1997 mewis and wagner 2011 while this structural parameter usually does not have a direct quantitative interpretation in terms of microstructural properties it is interpreted as a surrogate parameter that represents the state of the material microstructure that evolves as a function of shear history typically this structural parameter is limited between zero and unity where λ 1 is taken to represent the equilibrium material microstructure in the absence of shear and λ 0 is taken to represent the equilibrium material microstructure in the limit of high shear rate as such the material rheological parameters such as yield stress and fluid consistency index typically increases with λ this dependence is often encoded in terms of a kinetic model for the evolution of λ with shear rate and the constitutive model parameters are expressed as functions of the structural parameter in keeping with this approach we propose a new approach with a novel fitting procedure for thixotropic herschel bulkley constitutive model for the sludge flow behaviour as of the following 1 τ τ y τ λ γ τ y λ k λ γ n τ τ y γ 0 where τ pa and γ 1 s are the fluid shear stress and shear rate respectively n is the shear index and τ y λ and k λ are the structure dependent yield stress and consistency respectively consistent with previous experimental observations farno et al 2015 we assume the index n is insensitive to thixotropic breakdown and rebuild but herein we also test explicitly for such independence the structure dependent material functions are proposed to be nonlinear functions of the structural parameter λ as 2 τ y λ τ y τ y 0 τ y f λ k λ k k 0 k f λ where the parameters τ y k and τ y 0 k 0 respectively are the sludge shear yield stress and consistency for the fully degraded λ 0 γ and fully agglomerated λ 1 γ 0 sludge microstructures with τ y 0 τ y k 0 k and f λ is a monotonic increasing function that captures the nonlinear dependence of the sludge rheology upon the structural parameter λ i e f 0 0 and f 1 1 therefore the sludge rheology under the fully agglomerated f 1 λ 1 γ 0 and fully degraded f 0 λ 0 γ microstructural states is given by the herschel bulkley equations 3 τ 1 γ τ y 0 k 0 γ n 4 τ 0 γ τ y k γ n with the rheology at any intermediate microstructural state 0 λ 1 given by equations 1 and 2 equation 2 assumes that the change in yield stress and consistency with the thixotropic parameter λ follows the same functional form f λ in the results and discussion section this assumption is validated by the observation that a master equilibrium curve for the equilibrium thixotropic parameter as a function of shear rate which results directly from this assumption captures all of the systematic variation of all experimental data collected over a range of solids concentrations combining equations 1 4 the nonlinear function f λ that links the microstructural parameter λ to the sludge rheology is then given by the ratio of shear stresses as 5 f λ τ λ γ τ 0 γ τ 1 γ τ 0 γ under equilibrium conditions such as steady state shear stress the microstructural parameter λ can be replaced by its equilibrium value λ e q this expression is useful for testing different functions of f λ when the right hand side of equation 5 could be experimentally evaluated as shall be demonstrated in section 4 an appropriate nonlinear function f λ which is monotonic increasing and satisfies the boundary conditions f 0 0 f 1 1 is the sigmoid function 6 f λ 1 1 a e 1 λ 1 1 where a 0 is a fitting parameter to close this constitutive model an evolution equation is also required for the structural parameter λ we use a linear first order kinetic model to describe the breakdown and rebuild of this structural parameter as 7 d λ d t k 1 γ λ k 2 1 λ where k 1 and k 2 s 1 are kinetic parameters that respectively characterise the rate of structural breakdown due to shear degradation hence is proportional to γ λ and the rate of structural rebuild agglomeration due to brownian motion thus is proportional to the fraction of degraded microstructure 1 λ evolution equations similar to equation 7 have been widely used by several authors mewis and wagner 2011 to describe the thixotropic behaviour of materials with gel like structures in this context the structural parameter is assumed to represent the fraction of potential interparticle links some researchers yziquel et al 1999 have argued that shear stress is more appropriate to be used instead of the shear rate but this renders equation 7 implicit note that the rate of the rebuild of the microstructure has rarely been observed mewis and wagner 2011 to be dependent on the shear rate under equilibrium conditions for example after application of a fixed shear rate γ for a sufficiently long time the rate of microstructural build up and break down in equation 7 are equal yielding dλ dt 0 hence the microstructure of sludge does not change significantly with time and the structural parameter approaches its equilibrium value 8 λ e q γ 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 which only depends upon the ratio of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 by substitution of this expression into the constitutive model 1 2 an expression is obtained for the equilibrium stress value 9 τ e q γ τ y τ y 0 τ y f 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 k k 0 k f 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 γ n substitution of the sigmoid function 6 into this expression then yields 10 τ e q γ τ y τ y 0 τ y 1 a e k 1 k 2 γ 1 k k 0 k 1 a e k 1 k 2 γ 1 γ n this expression quantifies the equilibrium stress τ e q γ in terms of the five rheological parameters n τ y τ y 0 k k 0 two kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 and one functional parameter a and allows the constitutive model to be directly tested against experimental equilibrium data without the need for a priori fitting of the kinetic model 7 note that only the ratio of kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 appear in equation 10 and so this expression is independent of the actual rate of thixotropic breakdown or rebuild while we do not recommend to use equation 10 to directly fit data and determine model parameters due to the risk of spurious regression with such a large number of parameters it does serve as a useful functional form to check whether the proposed model is capable of resolving the rheological complexity of these materials instead equations 3 and 4 provide an excellent starting point for robust estimation of the model parameters as it includes only five fitting parameters here rheological characterisation of a fully degraded sample λ 0 provides estimates of the parameters τ y k and n and rheological characterisation of a fully agglomerated sample λ 1 provides estimates of τ y 0 and k 0 as well as an independent estimate of the index n once these parameters are robustly determined then rheological characterisation under equilibrium conditions λ λ e q can provide robust estimates of the parameter a and the kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 via equation 10 finally the individual kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 may then be determined by fitting the kinetic model 7 to rheological data involving thixotropic evolution from a known initial state to equilibrium conditions all of the required rheological data outlined above can be provided by a series of controlled shear rate tests involving a step up or step down in shear rate by appropriately preparing each sludge sample via application of pre shear a fully agglomerated or fully degraded initial microstructural state can be achieved under the assumption that a step to a new shear rate can be applied and the stress response accurately measured prior to any significant change in the thixotropic state the parameters in equations 3 and 4 can then be determined from the instantaneous stress response with time the sample then approaches its equilibrium state allowing the remaining parameter groups in equation 10 to be determined finally the kinetic parameters can be individually determined by fitting the rate of the transient response of the stress to the new equilibrium value the constitutive model proposed in this study does not resolve elastic deformations but instead approximates viscoelastic softening of the sludge as an instantaneous viscoplastic failure whilst many materials exhibit viscoelastic softening under shear buscall et al 2015 for many applications this phenomenon occurs on timescales which significantly shorter than the timescale of flow and deformation hence a viscoplastic constitutive model is appropriate for these applications these simpler rheological models also circumvent the complexities associated with experimental characterisation data analysis and flow prediction for viscoelastic materials for thixotropic materials a further requirement for a viscoplastic constitutive model is that the timescale of thixotropic breakdown is significantly longer than that of viscoelastic response whilst the timescale of the viscoelastic response is characterized by the relaxation timescale τ r of the material this can be difficult to accurately determine for thixotropic materials however an upper bound estimate for τ r is given by the timescale of the elastic response t e which is defined as the time beyond which elastic effects are no longer significant in a creep test as illustrated in fig 1 the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model is valid if the elastic timescale t e under a creep test is significantly smaller than the timescale τ t of thixotropic breakdown under this condition there exists a separation of timescales between the elastic and thixotropic processes in the material allowing the viscoelastic characteristics to be validly approximated as viscoplastic rheology on timescales significantly longer than the retardation time subject to thixotropic breakdown and recovery conversely if the elastic and thixotropic processes occur on similar timescales then more complicated tevp constitutive models ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are required to characterise the sludge hence controlled rate step up step down and creep tests play an essential role in both quantifying and validating the viscoplastic constitutive model these tests are described in greater detail in the following section along with sample collection and preparation 3 materials and methods this section provides details on the sample collection preparation and experimental procedures required to fit the constitutive model proposed in the previous section digested sludge ds samples were collected from the sampling point of a mesophilic anaerobic digester at the eastern treatment plant etp in victoria australia at a temperature of approximately 37 c these samples were then housed in insulated containers to minimise any temperature changes the solids concentration of the collected ds samples was measured as 2 wt based on the apha 1992 method and these samples were subsequently thickened using buchner vacuum filtration process to the following approximate total solids concentrations 3 0 3 7 4 0 4 9 these samples were then prepared for the series of rheological experiments outlined in the previous section that comprise of creep tests step up and step down controlled shear rate tests 3 1 creep experiments creep experiments involve the measurement of the shear deformation of a material sample initially at rest in response to applied fixed shear stress the creep response of sludge samples was used to provide an upper bound estimate of the relaxation timescale of the sample for comparison with the timescale of thixotropic breakdown the stress controlled creep test is well suited to this task as it enables better observation of the transition from solid like behaviour to liquid like behaviour these tests were performed at 20 c using a stress controlled rheometer hr3 ta instrument equipped with a vane and rough cup geometry with respective diameters 15 mm and 30 mm for the vane and the inner cup in a series of separate tests the sample was initially presheared for 10 min at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 to achieve an initial condition close to the large shear equilibrium i e λ 0 before the sample was exposed to constant stress for 10 min 3 2 step change shear experiments the step change shear experiments consist of imposing a fixed shear rate to a sludge sample for long enough for the equilibrium state to be reached followed by a rapid change to a new fixed shear rate until the new equilibrium state is reached the new shear rate may be higher step up or lower step down than the original rate these experiments are designed to probe the kinetics of the thixotropic response as the sludge sample evolves from one equilibrium state to the next by setting the pre shear conditions to be either very high or zero sample at rest for sufficiently long periods we ensure the microstructural parameter is either zero λ 0 or one λ 1 respectively at the start of each test this approach then facilitates the estimation of the fully agglomerated τ y 0 k 0 n and fully degraded τ y k n herschel bulkley rheological parameters directly from the fitting of equations 3 and 4 respectively to the initial stress strain data prior to application of the step change these step change shear experiments were performed at 20 c using a rate controlled rheometer ares ta instrument equipped with a parallel plate geometry with diameter 50 mm and gap size 1 mm and humidity control chamber for all tests the sludge sample was initially stirred for 10 min at 1000 rpm corresponding to a nominal shear rate of 300 s 1 to achieve a uniform initial condition close to the large shear equilibrium i e λ 0 for the step down experiments the shear rate under rate controlled conditions was held at an initial rate of 300 s 1 for 10 min to ensure equilibrium conditions prior to being suddenly dropped at time t 0 to a lower constant shear rate for 10 min again to ensure equilibrium was reached in a series of tests where the lower shear rate ranged from 30 to 250 s 1 see table 1 for detail whilst the pre shear renders the structural parameter λ initially close to zero the step down experiments involve a transition of the structural parameter λ from a finite equilibrium value λ e q γ given by equation 8 at 300 s 1 to a second equilibrium value λ e q γ given by equation 8 at the ultimate shear rate in response to this sudden reduction in shear rate the shear stress suddenly decreased to a minimum value as a predominantly viscous response and then gradually increased due to a reduction in the shear mediated thixotropic breakdown given by the first term on the right hand side of equation 7 towards the new equilibrium value corresponding to the new applied shear rate note that an initial shear rate of 300 s 1 was chosen because it was the maximum shear rate that could be attained whilst preventing material from being pushed out of the measurement gap for the step up tests each sludge sample was pre sheared for 10 min at 300 s 1 followed by 10 min resting at zero shear rate to ensure equilibrium and zero stress in the material at the end of the rest period this was validated by measurement of shear stress during the rest period we assume that the microstructure of sludge was entirely rebuilt λ 1 at the end of this rest period and so the sludge rheology is described by equation 3 in the step up experiments a constant shear rate in the range 30 250 s 1 see table 1 for detail was applied to the sludge sample which had previously been at rest in response the shear stress increased to a maximum as a viscous response and then gradually decreased as a thixotropic response due to increased rate of microstructural breakdown to a steady state value corresponding to the applied shear rate the combination of the step up and step down shear tests provide critical quantitative data for the fitting of the constitutive model which shall be detailed in the following section 4 results and discussion fig 2 a illustrates the shear rate of the 3 7 sludge samples in response to different applied shear stresses during the creep tests see figure b1 a c for 3 4 2 and 4 9 in appendix b these creep responses can be divided into two distinct stages at very short times t 0 01 s the shear rate increased sharply as the sample and instrument inertia were overcome beyond this time t 0 01 s the viscoelastic response becomes significant and manifests as an increasing shear rate with different slopes for different applied shear rates up until around t 10 s for smaller applied stresses below 15 pa the shear rate increases to reaches a peak value at around t 10 s beyond which the shear rate reduces due to elastic retardation hence this range of shear stress demonstrate traces of viscoelastic response and not a full viscous flow situation conversely for higher applied stresses more than 20 pa the shear rate increases and plateaus at around t 10 s corresponding to yield and constant viscous flow of the sludge sample these results suggest that for creep experiments above the critical applied stress the higher value of applied stress before viscous flow starts the sludge sample flows as a purely viscous material at times greater than t 10 s and so this time represents a reasonable approximation to the elastic timescale t e ideally a creep recovery test could show the extent of non linear viscoelastic response for the material being yielded however such tests can impart significant errors due to inertial effects this observation of t e 10 s is further supported by the peak shear rate observed in the unyielded cases where the peak shear rate corresponds to complete relaxation of the elastic stresses in the system as strain softening relaxation and thixotropy both act to lower the viscosity of the sample the viscoplastic thixotropic constitutive model proposed in section 2 does not aim to resolve the rheological response over timescales less than the elastic timescale t e rather the complex viscoelastic strain softening behaviour prior to yield is modelled as an instantaneous plastic yield with an associated shear yield stress hence this constitutive model may be validly applied to the prediction of flow phenomena on timescales longer than t e such as steady pipe flow but it cannot be validly applied to short time phenomena such as pump start up and sudden changes in flowrate in subsequent studies we aim to develop a viscoelastic thixotropic constitutive model for these materials that whilst slightly more complex is capable of resolving such short time phenomena fig 2b and 2c respectively illustrate the stress response of the 3 7 sludge samples in the step up and the step down shear rate tests see figure b2 and figure b3a c for 3 4 2 and 4 9 in appendix b in all instances of these tests the applied stress was higher than the upper yield stress of the material and thus the sludge material was always undergoing viscous flow for the step up tests the shear stress initially increased to a maximum value at around 0 07 s before gradually reducing toward a constant equilibrium value after 10 min this sharp initial rise in stress is interpreted as an inertial and viscoelastic response to the imposed shear rate increase while the subsequent decrease is a mixture of both retarded elasticity and thixotropy while it is typically difficult to differentiate between these two phenomena larson 2015 the creep test results indicate that elastic effects are negligible for times greater than t e hence we only consider data beyond this time to fit the constitutive model conversely for the step down tests the shear stress decreased to a minimum value at around 0 07 s before gradually increasing toward a constant equilibrium value after 10 min similarly this sharp decrease in stress is interpreted as an inertial and viscoelastic response to the imposed shear rate decrease whilst the subsequent increase is a mixture of both retarded elasticity and thixotropy mewis and wagner 2011 after determining the upper bound t e 10 s the data from the step change shear rate tests at t e was fitted with equations 3 and 4 using the least squared method in matlab under the assumption of a significantly slower thixotropic timescale such that thixotropic evolution was negligible at time t e the three rheological parameters τ y k n were estimated from 10 experimental data points from the 10 step down tests at time t e and the two rheological parameters of τ y 0 k 0 were estimated from 10 experimental points in the 10 step up tests at time t e once the above parameters were determined k 1 k 2 and a were estimated by fitting equation 10 to the 20 experimental points at t 10 min assumed to be at equilibrium in both the step up and step down tests this procedure provides a much more robust fitting compared to the scenario where equation 10 is fitted directly to the experimental data to estimate all eight rheological parameters simultaneously fig 3 illustrates the variation of the shear stress with the shear rate for the 3 7 ds samples at the following three different times during the step change shear tests i at time t e after the change in shear rate in the step down tests where it is assumed the sludge microstructure is still completely degraded i e λ 0 ii at time t e after the change in shear rate in the step up tests where it is assumed the sludge microstructure is still completely agglomerated i e λ 1 and iii equilibrium measurements after 10 min of constant shear in both the step down and step up shear rate tests 0 λ eq 1 as expected the equilibrium middle flow curve in fig 3 approaches the fully agglomerated upper flow curve at low shear rates and then undergoes a transition to approach the fully degraded lower flow curve at high shear rates this relationship between the equilibrium fully degraded and fully agglomerated rheology is encoded by the kinetic model and the nonlinear function f λ similar behaviour was observed albeit at stresses that increase with solids concentration across the other solids concentrations 3 4 2 and 4 9 ds at the above times see figure b4 in appendix b fig 4 shows the evolution of f λ eq calculated from the equilibrium data from the step change shear rate tests via equation 5 with the shear rate for the various solid concentrations interestingly this figure indicates that there is no systematic variation of f λ eq with changes in solid concentration and there exist only random variations due to experimental error this indicates that the kinetic model and the dependence of the herschel bulkley rheology upon the microstructural state is independent of solids concentration hence equation 6 with a single parameter a and a single kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 was used to fit the data shown in fig 4 across all concentrations this figure indicates that the bulk of the transition from the fully agglomerated state to the fully degraded state occurs over the shear rate range 20 s 1 to 200 s 1 hence industrial processes with characteristic shear rates in this transition region are sensitive to the thixotropic state of the material table 2 reports the fitted values for the rheological parameters used in equations 3 4 and 10 for the various solid concentrations studied herein as expected and in agreement with previous studies eshtiaghi et al 2013 the yield stress τ y τ y 0 and consistencies k k 0 all increased with solids concentration conversely the value of the flow index n was approximately constant for all concentrations and the parameter a and the kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 was invariant with solids concentration the individual values of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 were obtained independently by fitting the analytic solution of the kinetic model 7 with the herschel bulkley rheological model 2 to the transient data from the step up and step down tests the fittings were performed using the nonlinear least squared function lsqnonlin in matlab via minimisation of the root mean squared error rmse between the experimentally observed transient shear stress data and that predicted from the constitutive model fig 5 compares the predictions from the fitted rheological model lines with the experimental observations markers of shear stress versus time during the step down shear rate tests for the 3 7 ds sample in response to the step down in shear rate the shear stress swiftly decreased to a minimum value at about 1s as shown in fig 2c and then gradually increased due to reduced shear degradation of the microstructure to approach a new steady state where thixotropic rebuild and breakdown rates were in equilibrium as can be seen the model successfully captures the trend of evolution in shear stress due to thixotropic break down and build up the deviations of the model predictions from the equilibrium value at t 10 min in fig 5 are due to the scatter of the equilibrium data in fig 5 as such this is not a failing of the constitutive model per se but rather an artefact of experimental error fig 6 compares the experimental observation of shear stress versus time during the step up shear rate tests markers with the predictions of equations 2 and 7 lines for the 3 7 ds sample similar to the step up tests in response to the sudden increase in shear rate the shear stress increased quickly to reach a peak at about 1 s as shown in fig 2b and then slowly decreased due to break down of the microstructure to reach an equilibrium value at around 10 min as expected the equilibrium values were comparable within experimental error at the same shear rate for both the step up and step down tests table 3 compares the ratio k 1 k 2 obtained from fitting the equilibrium data fig 4 with the same ratio for the values of k 1 and k 2 directly obtained from independent fitting of the transient data figs 5 and 6 the errors between these two ratios are typically small order 10 and the transient fitting systematically underestimates the ratio estimated from equilibrium this overall excellent agreement confirms the robustness of the fitting procedure and validates the initial assumption of separation of thixotropic and viscoelastic timescales indeed if there were considerable effects of the viscoelastic response still persistent once thixotropic breakdown is significant then estimates of the ratio k 1 k 2 from the transient data would be significantly different from that of the equilibrium data table 3 also suggests that the values of k 1 and k 2 are constant at different concentration because the variation of k 1 and k 2 between different solid concentration are smaller than the fitting errors hence one may use the weighted mean value weighted by the inverse of rmse of k 1 0 0005 and k 2 0 036 in table 3 for a reasonable approximation of k 1 and k 2 for sludge within the studied concentrations this thixotropic visco plastic constitutive model facilitates the prediction of sludge flow in a wide range of industrial applications via e g cfd or analytic approximations in the following section we apply this model to pipeline flow as a motivating example of an industrial 5 implications for pipeline design sludge pipelining and transportation is a significant issue in many wastewater treatment plants where sludge rheology plays a critical role in pipeline design and operation in the previous section it was observed that the evolution of the sludge apparent viscosity due to thixotropy could persist for up to 10 min 600s for most industrial pipelines in which the operating velocity does not exceed 3 m s slatter 2004 this 600s corresponds to 1800 m of pipe length depending on the characteristic shear rate such variation of apparent viscosity results in the variation of both wall shear stress and friction loss over the length of the pipe this variation presents a challenge for engineers as it is unclear which viscosity should be taken for the calculation of friction loss and thus how much pumping power is required to derive the flow despite the significance of sludge thixotropy upon required pumping power and pressure common engineering practice assumes constant friction loss and ignores sludge thixotropy in this section we consider the magnitude of the errors associated with this assumption by comparing predictions of pressure loss and power demand in pipeline flow from the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model with those from a purely viscoplastic model we consider flow in a typical 100 mm diameter straight industrial pipeline operating under laminar conditions that is transporting 3 7 sludge from a storage tank to a processing unit at a fixed volumetric flowrate q in this case the sludge is initially at rest hence fully agglomerated and then the material undergoes shear degradation under pipe flow leading to a reduction of the sludge viscosity a scenario that is analogous to a step up shear rate test under the approximation that the microstructural parameter λ only varies in the axial direction the governing navier stokes equations and constitutive model simplify see appendix a for details to the following analytic solution bird et al 1983 for the total volumetric flowrate q in terms of the wall stress and herschel bulkley rheological parameters 11 q π r 3 n τ w z k λ 1 n 1 τ y λ τ w z n 1 n 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 3 n 1 2 τ y λ τ w z 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 n 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 n 1 as q is constant and the rheological functions τ y λ k λ are known equation 11 quantifies how the wall stress τ w z varies with axial distance with respect to the microstructural parameter λ z whilst the total flowrate q is constant due to evolution of the plug radius r p z the total volumetric flow rates in the plug q p z and annular q a n n z regions of the pipe evolve with axial distance as 12 q p z π r 3 n n 1 τ y λ z τ w z 2 τ w z k λ z 1 n 1 τ y λ z τ w z n 1 n q a n n z q q p z to further simplify analysis we make the approximation that the shear rate acting on the degradation of the rheological parameters across the pipe cross section is constant and equal to the nominal shear rate in the annulus area of the pipe γ r z γ n z the nominal shear rate in the annular yielded region of herschel bulkley fluid undergoing laminar pipe flow may be approximated as γ n z u z r 8 u a n n z d a n n z farno et al 2018 slatter 2011 where u a n n z q a n n z π r 2 r p z 2 is the average velocity in the annular area and d a n n z 2 r r p z is the mean diameter of the annular region from these expressions and equation 12 the nominal shear rate γ n z may be expressed as a known function of the microstructural parameter λ z as γ n z γ n λ z using this expression and the above assumptions and approximations the steady state microstructural evolution equation a 3 then simplifies to 13 u z d λ z d z k 1 γ n λ z λ z k 2 1 λ z λ 0 1 where u z q π r 2 is the average pipe velocity and the boundary condition corresponds to fully agglomerated sludge at the pipe entrance one factor complicating numerical solution of equation 13 is that there is no closed form expression for the nominal shear rate γ n λ from the equations above rather we use the numerical method described in farno et al 2018 that given a value of λ then uses equation 6 to determine τ y λ and k λ which are then input into equations 11 and 12 to yield a unique estimate of the nominal shear rate γ n we encode this numerical method as a standalone function for γ n λ in matlab and then use a runge kutta 4 5 method mathworks 2016 to solve equation 13 implemented via the ode command in matlab along the axial coordinate the total pressure drop δ p l over a length of pipe of length l was then calculated via integration of a 5 over the pipe length as δ p l 2 r 0 l τ w z d z and the pumping power is then 14 w p l 2 q r 0 l τ w z d z note that with increasing pipe length the microstructural parameter λ z approaches its equilibrium value λ n e q given from equation 13 as k 1 γ n λ n e q λ n e q k 2 1 λ n e q 0 and so the pipeline pressure gradient g z d p d z also approaches its equilibrium value g e q lim z g z 2 τ w e q r where τ w e q satisfies equation 11 with the substitution λ λ n e q thus solution of equation 13 provides a means to estimate pressure drop and pumping power requirements for pipeline transportation of wastewater sludges that accounts for thixotropic breakdown of the sludge in contrast conventional methods to design sludge pipeline systems typically ignore thixotropic breakdown of the sludge and assume fixed values of the herschel bulkley rheological parameters throughout the entire pipeline by ignoring thixotropy estimates of pressure drop and power consumption may either under or over estimate the true values depending upon whether the rheological parameters have been determined based upon fully agglomerated τ y λ 1 k λ 1 or fully degraded τ y λ 0 k λ 0 sludge samples or for a steady state τ y τ y λ τ y 0 k k λ k 0 sludge samples subject to a steady shear rate γ in any of these cases the pumping power is simply 15 w p l 2 q l r τ w λ e x p where the pumping pressure drop is δ p l w p l q λ e x p is the microstructural parameter used during rheological characterisation and τ w λ e x p satisfies equation 11 with the substitution λ λ e x p fig 7 compares estimates of the wall shear stress τ w and total pumping power normalized by the pipe length w p l l between conventional pipeline design methods that ignore thixotropy such that λ is constant and the rheological model in this study that incorporates thixotropic breakdown such that λ evolves as the sludge is advected along the pipe the estimated pumping power in these conventional non thixotropic models can vary based on whether the sludge rheology has been characterised when the sludge is in the fully agglomerated λ 1 or fully degraded λ 0 as shown in fig 7 both τ w and w p l l decrease over the length of the pipe due to thixotropic degradation of the herschel bulkley parameters continues lines in fig 7 whereas as shown by dashed lines in fig 7 the calculations ignoring thixotropy are constant over the pipe length and result in under or over estimation of the total pumping power given by the difference between the indicated curves note that if the sludge rheology has been characterised with a partially degraded equilibrium microstructure 0 λ eq 1 then the estimated pumping power ignoring thixotropy forms into another line that lies between the two dashed lines corresponding to λ 0 and λ 1 furthermore unless thixotropy is accounted for it is not possible to determine whether the estimated pumping power is under or over estimated in other words the pumping power cannot be accurately calculated without considering sludge thixotropy both during rheological characterisation and solution of pipe moreover as can be seen in fig 7 the differences between the thixotropic calculations and the non thixotropic calculations depends upon the flow rate and the pipe length the longer the pipe the higher is the error for non thixotropic λ 1 and in parallel the longer the pipe the lower is the error for non thixotropic λ 0 and the higher the flow rate the higher is the error for non thixotropic λ 1 calculation conversely if the sludge microstructure is fully degraded by mechanical operation of a pump a centrifugal pump imposed a shear rate much higher than 300 s 1 at the beginning of a pipeline the sludge microstructure then rebuilds throughout the pipeline increasing apparent viscosity this is a similar scenario to the step down shear rate test in this case the increase in the apparent viscosity results in an increase in the wall shear stress and therefore a friction loss which is increasing and not constant over the length of the pipe similarly this will lead to an over or under estimation of the total pumping power depending whether the rheological parameters have been respectively determined based upon fully agglomerated τ y λ 1 k λ 1 or fully degraded τ y λ 0 k λ 0 sludge samples for a simple evaluation of the pumping power in a short pipeline e g 10 m in the case that sludge microstructure is degraded throughout the pipe one may use the rheological data for the fully agglomerated sludge sample i e λ 1 while in the case that sludge microstructure rebuilds throughout the pipeline one may use the rheological data for the fully degraded sludge sample i e λ 0 this conclusion also suggests that a correct rheological characterisation of sludge depends upon the process that is to be modelled in other words the rheometry procedure used for a flow curve measurement should be adapted based on the application of the flow curve data in general accurate estimation of friction losses and pumping energy under either laminar or turbulent pipe flow requires the full solution of the flow and rheology equations which demands a numerical approach to solve the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model equations 2 and 7 coupled with the navier stokes equations under this full solution the shear rate pressure microstructural parameter and apparent viscosity fields all vary both axially and radially and the mean axial pressure gradient and the size of the plug region vary axially due to thixotropy as analytic expressions provide a useful tool for pipeline design and optimization in future studies we shall develop and test analytic approximations to the full numerical solutions of thixotropic viscoplastic pipe flow 6 conclusions a novel constitutive model of sludge viscoplasticity and thixotropy was developed and validated based on separation of the timescales of elastic and thixotropic responses this model is comprised of a herschel bulkley rheological model which depends nonlinearly on thixotropic structural parameter that quantifies the state of agglomeration of the sludge microstructure that is governed by a linear kinetic model involving shear degradation during breakdown and diffusion mediated agglomeration during rebuild under the assumption of fast viscoelastic relaxation compared to thixotropic breakdown this model greatly simplifies the class of tvep thixotropic visco elasto plastic models that have been used to characterise the rheology of materials that exhibit simultaneous thixotropy and viscoelasticity this simplification was justified by observing under creep experiments that the timescales of viscoelastic relaxation in the order of seconds is significantly faster than that of thixotropic degradation in the order of minutes in wastewater sludge this simplified thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model was fitted to a series of creep step up and step down rheological experiments for a series of digested wastewater sludge samples over a range of total solid concentrations from 3 0 to 4 9 wt a novel and robust fitting procedure was developed that reduced both the number of fitting parameters and the risk of spurious regression this constitutive model was validated by matching the ratio of kinetic parameters in the thixotropic model between those estimated from equilibrium data and those estimated from transient data we find that the kinetic parameters and the nonlinear function that relates the thixotropic structural parameter to the sludge rheology and the herschel bulkley index are all invariant with solids concentration indicating the universality of the proposed kinetic model application of this model to an example calculation of pumping energy under laminar pipeline flow suggests that thixotropy can significantly impact the energy requirements of pumping process and a calculation without considering thixotropy can lead to significant errors in pump sizing the constitutive model and presented fitting method represent a robust and practical method to characterise the rheology of these complex materials in industrial applications either through numerical methods or analytic approximations the application of these models and techniques provide the capacity to design and optimise a wide range of wastewater sludge processes form transportation and

mechanics of steady laminar flow of thixotropic viscoplastic wastewater sludge although these equations must be solved numerically via e g dedicated cfd methods we only require approximate solutions to these equations to demonstrate the impact of considering thixotropy upon pressure drop and energy consumption under steady pipe flow hence we simplify this set of equations via the following approximations first we assume that under laminar flow conditions the inertial terms on the right hand side of a 1 are negligible with respect to the viscous terms on the left hand side this is justified by the highly viscous nature of concentrated wastewater sludge and low reynolds number note the maximum re3 reynolds number developed for herschel bulkley fluids farno et al 2018 is 1400 for

17661,due to the inherent rheological complexity of wastewater sludges conventional sludge pipeline design based on simplified rheological models can result in inefficient sludge transportation systems these inefficiencies are further exacerbated by a global need for the processing of more concentrated wastewater sludges that have a more pronounced non newtonian character and hence require greater energy for transportation however the complex rheology of these materials typically visco elastic and thixotropic requires sophisticated methods for constitutive modelling that are impractical to implement for complex materials such as sewerage sludges we address this challenge by developing a novel viscoplastic thixotropic constitutive model that exploits the separation of timescales between the thixotropic and viscoelastic processes leading to simpler and more robust experimental methods parameter estimation and process simulation methods this constitutive model combines a kinetic model for thixotropic degradation and agglomeration via a classical structural parameter λ approach coupled nonlinearly with a herschel bulkley model to yield a thixotropic viscoplastic model of sludge rheology experimental data for thickened digested sludge between 3 and 4 9 solids were collected to validate the assumption for the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic responses the fitting procedure was found to be robust and efficient and several rheological parameters were found to be invariant with solids concentration simplified energy calculations for a typical sludge pipeline showed that the pumping energy could be significantly under or overestimated without considering thixotropy these simple and robust constitutive models and fitting methods can accurately predict and hence design and optimise sludge behaviour over a wide range of wastewater processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge rheology thixotropy viscoplasticity constitutive modelling pipeline transportation elasto visco plastic 1 introduction globally wastewater sludge transportation systems account for a significant proportion of total energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants despite the magnitude of this energy consumption these pipeline systems are often operated far from their optimal energy efficiency as system design is typically based upon over simplified calculations of friction loss that only consider a single valued viscosity and ignores the inherent complexity of sludge rheology anderson et al 2008 concentrated wastewater sludges exhibit a range of apparent viscosities that can vary strongly as a function of both the magnitude and duration of an applied force known as shear history markis et al 2014 these factors must be accounted for when designing transportation systems the rheological complexity of concentrated wastewater sludges can manifest in several ways above a specific solids concentration typically 1 sludge exhibits solid like behaviour under flow start up which arises from the presence of a gel like microstructure that must be broken down to some extent before flow can begin this solid like property manifests as visco elastic rheological behaviour over small timescales relaxation timescale baudez et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 but it is also often approximated as a visco plastic behaviour i e a yield stress fluid in many instances eshtiaghi et al 2013 mechanistically deformation of the microstructure by small externally imposed deformations is reversible in that it can store energy elastically however as the strain amplitude is increased microstructural rearrangements on progressively larger length scales lead to irreversible deformation that manifests as a dissipative viscous mechanical response while there is increasing evidence buscall et al 2015 that this irreversible breakdown may be described as a purely viscoelastic response in the most general case this breakdown may be described by an elasto visco plastic rheological model once a flow is initiated the microstructure of these materials can undergo further degradation with shear history which manifests as a thixotropic behaviour of the sludge baudez 2008 thixotropy is defined as the gradual decrease with flow of the viscosity of a material that was initially at rest and the subsequent gradual recovery of viscosity once the flow is ceased larson 2015 upon flow cessation the rheology of concentrated wastewater sludges has been observed markis et al 2014 to undergo either a complete or partial recovery with time due to restructuring of the sludge microstructure with brownian motion mewis and wagner 2011 both the elasto visco plastic and thixotropic nature of the sludge rheology plays a critical role in the design and optimization of processes such as pump start up and long distance transportation because of the long residence times short time dynamics and different shear histories during these processes however this combination of simultaneous thixotropic and elasto visco plastic tevp rheology presents a significant challenge for the development of accurate constitutive models for these materials as it is often challenging to deconvolve the various contributions from these different microstructural processes ewoldt and mckinley 2017 hence the development and application of robust and accurate tevp models remain an unresolved scientific challenge the tevp models developed to date involve a large number of model parameters that make it challenging to avoid spurious fitting and hinder the identification of fundamental material parameters from confounding factors as such these methods have only been applied successfully to a small number of materials with relatively well characterized rheological behaviours such as xanthan gum blackwell and ewoldt 2014 de souza mendes 2011 wei et al 2018 conversely concentrated wastewater sludges are notoriously complex materials that pose a number of fundamental and practical challenges eshtiaghi et al 2013 with respect to their rheological characterisation hence the tevp models and characterisation methods proposed by ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are too complex and impractical for concentrated wastewater sludges literature regarding the rheological characterisation of the thixotropic and elasto visco plastic tevp behaviour of wastewater sludge is scarce despite the very significant impact of sludge rheology upon the performance of wastewater treatment plant equipment such as pumps mixer and aerators typical constitutive models for wastewater sludges are over simplified in they do not resolve the important couplings between viscoelasticity and thixotropy which is necessary for industrial application for example eshtiaghi et al 2012a 2016 2012b baudez et al 2011 2013 and farno et al 2015 2016 considered wastewater sludges to behave as a purely shear thinning viscoplastic material in the liquid like regime i e at applied shear stresses beyond the shear yield stress while ignoring the fact that these materials are thixotropic due to the lack of a comprehensive constitutive model industrial practitioners typically increase the estimated pressure drop by 10 50 anderson et al 2008 to allow for the errors in design and prediction of the best efficiency point for pump operation gottliebson et al 2008 by reconstruction of the sludge velocity profile during a rheometric measurement with a wide gap vane geometry baudez 2008 demonstrated that due to the thixotropic nature of the sludge the width of the flowing yielded part of the sludge material across the gap between the rheometer vane and cup varies with shearing time under a constant shear force baudez 2008 proposed a thixotropic and elasto visco plastic model based on the analogy between the proportion of yielded to unyielded material and the proportion of broken to unbroken sludge microstructure using a dimensionless structural parameter λ which quantifies the evolution of the shear yield stress of the sludge with thixotropy this model describes the degradation of sludge microstructure during the flow initiation as a gradual transformation from a kelvin voigt linear viscoelastic behaviour to a newtonian viscous flow this model however is not able to describe rebuild of the microstructure under shear and shear rate dependent break down of microstructure as λ is only a function of shear time and it is not described with a kinetic model as is observed for colloidal suspensions buscall et al 2015 conversely hammadi et al 2013 used a combination of a herschel bulkley viscoplastic constitutive model with the thixotropic model of tiu and boger 1974 to characterise the rheology of wastewater sludge this model is formed simply by scaling the sludge flow curve fitted with the herschel bulkley equation with a dimensionless structural parameter λ which parameterises the thixotropic state of the sludge microstructure here the fully agglomerated sludge microstructure at rest i e under zero shear rate corresponds to a structural parameter equal to one λ 1 and the fully disintegrated microstructure under very large shear rates corresponds to a structural parameter equal to zero λ 0 under constant shear rate the structural parameter decays from an initial value λ 0 toward a finite equilibrium value λ e λ 0 via a second order kinetic equation the main drawbacks of this model are that rebuild of the microstructure is not included and the kinetics of the structural parameter evolution equation varies with shear rate and so need to be experimentally determined across a range of shear rates as such there exists a pressing need for the development of constitutive models and characterisation methods for wastewater sludges which considers both thixotropic and viscoplastic rheology of sludge while are also simple and robust enough for routine application to these complex biological materials in this study we directly address this need by developing and applying novel rheological characterisation methods for concentrated wastewater sludges by clearly identifying the timescale of elastic relaxation and the timescale of thixotropic breakdown and rebuild the elastic timescale is related to the relaxation of the sludge microstructure in response to small deformations whereas the thixotropic timescale characterises the rate of degradation of the sludge microstructure in response to sustained viscous flow as the elastic and thixotropic timescales arise from very different physical mechanisms they typically differ by at least several orders of magnitude this separation of timescales allows us to employ an assumption of quasi static rheological behaviour enabling natural decoupling of the yield and thixotropic processes in wastewater sludges in turn this timescale separation justifies the development and application of relatively simple constitutive models and characterisation techniques to exploit this behaviour indeed it is only for materials where these processes act on commensurate timescales that the complexities associated with fully coupled tevp characterization techniques ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are required tevp models are certainly more comprehensive than the simple thixotropic viscoplastic models as they can predict combined thixotropic viscoplastic and viscoelastic behaviour of a material however because the application of tevp models often requires detailed experiments such as large amplitude oscillatory shear characterisation as proposed by ewoldt and mckinley 2017 to differentiate between viscoelastic and thixotropic responses and analysis of this rheological data involves solving a system of partial differential equations and determination of several fitting parameters they are not suitable for complex industrial systems such as wastewater sludges in this study we focus on process timescales that are significantly longer than the relaxation timescale i e that do not resolve the detailed yielding dynamics associated with e g pump start up and so only require constitutive models that resolve the viscoplastic and thixotropic behaviour of these materials the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in the following section we detail the theory regarding constitutive modelling of tevp materials and the application to wastewater sludges under the assumption of the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic timescales this assumption facilitates the development of relatively simple rheological constitutive models that can be readily employed to design and optimise both pipeline transportation systems and wastewater treatment plant operations via computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation in section 3 we describe the experimental materials and rheometric methods and apply these rheometric techniques including creep tests step up and step down the shear rate to samples of concentrated wastewater sludge at four different solids concentrations over the range 3 0 4 9 w w solids these experiments justify the separation of viscoelastic and thixotropic timescales and provide quantitative data for the fitting of the constitutive model section 4 is concerned with the fitting of the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model to this data a discussion of research findings undertaken in section 5 including the application of the constitutive model to several examples of pressure calculations for the thixotropic breakdown in sludge pipelines finally conclusions are made in section 6 the constitutive model developed in this study represents the first accurate quantification of the viscoplastic and thixotropic rheology of wastewater sludges including resolution of both breakdown and rebuild of the sludge microstructure respectively via shear degradation and brownian motion 2 constitutive modelling of tevp materials the classical approach to modelling thixotropic behaviour in any material is developed by quantifying the general constitutive equation for the material in terms of a dimensionless structural parameter λ barnes 1997 mewis and wagner 2011 while this structural parameter usually does not have a direct quantitative interpretation in terms of microstructural properties it is interpreted as a surrogate parameter that represents the state of the material microstructure that evolves as a function of shear history typically this structural parameter is limited between zero and unity where λ 1 is taken to represent the equilibrium material microstructure in the absence of shear and λ 0 is taken to represent the equilibrium material microstructure in the limit of high shear rate as such the material rheological parameters such as yield stress and fluid consistency index typically increases with λ this dependence is often encoded in terms of a kinetic model for the evolution of λ with shear rate and the constitutive model parameters are expressed as functions of the structural parameter in keeping with this approach we propose a new approach with a novel fitting procedure for thixotropic herschel bulkley constitutive model for the sludge flow behaviour as of the following 1 τ τ y τ λ γ τ y λ k λ γ n τ τ y γ 0 where τ pa and γ 1 s are the fluid shear stress and shear rate respectively n is the shear index and τ y λ and k λ are the structure dependent yield stress and consistency respectively consistent with previous experimental observations farno et al 2015 we assume the index n is insensitive to thixotropic breakdown and rebuild but herein we also test explicitly for such independence the structure dependent material functions are proposed to be nonlinear functions of the structural parameter λ as 2 τ y λ τ y τ y 0 τ y f λ k λ k k 0 k f λ where the parameters τ y k and τ y 0 k 0 respectively are the sludge shear yield stress and consistency for the fully degraded λ 0 γ and fully agglomerated λ 1 γ 0 sludge microstructures with τ y 0 τ y k 0 k and f λ is a monotonic increasing function that captures the nonlinear dependence of the sludge rheology upon the structural parameter λ i e f 0 0 and f 1 1 therefore the sludge rheology under the fully agglomerated f 1 λ 1 γ 0 and fully degraded f 0 λ 0 γ microstructural states is given by the herschel bulkley equations 3 τ 1 γ τ y 0 k 0 γ n 4 τ 0 γ τ y k γ n with the rheology at any intermediate microstructural state 0 λ 1 given by equations 1 and 2 equation 2 assumes that the change in yield stress and consistency with the thixotropic parameter λ follows the same functional form f λ in the results and discussion section this assumption is validated by the observation that a master equilibrium curve for the equilibrium thixotropic parameter as a function of shear rate which results directly from this assumption captures all of the systematic variation of all experimental data collected over a range of solids concentrations combining equations 1 4 the nonlinear function f λ that links the microstructural parameter λ to the sludge rheology is then given by the ratio of shear stresses as 5 f λ τ λ γ τ 0 γ τ 1 γ τ 0 γ under equilibrium conditions such as steady state shear stress the microstructural parameter λ can be replaced by its equilibrium value λ e q this expression is useful for testing different functions of f λ when the right hand side of equation 5 could be experimentally evaluated as shall be demonstrated in section 4 an appropriate nonlinear function f λ which is monotonic increasing and satisfies the boundary conditions f 0 0 f 1 1 is the sigmoid function 6 f λ 1 1 a e 1 λ 1 1 where a 0 is a fitting parameter to close this constitutive model an evolution equation is also required for the structural parameter λ we use a linear first order kinetic model to describe the breakdown and rebuild of this structural parameter as 7 d λ d t k 1 γ λ k 2 1 λ where k 1 and k 2 s 1 are kinetic parameters that respectively characterise the rate of structural breakdown due to shear degradation hence is proportional to γ λ and the rate of structural rebuild agglomeration due to brownian motion thus is proportional to the fraction of degraded microstructure 1 λ evolution equations similar to equation 7 have been widely used by several authors mewis and wagner 2011 to describe the thixotropic behaviour of materials with gel like structures in this context the structural parameter is assumed to represent the fraction of potential interparticle links some researchers yziquel et al 1999 have argued that shear stress is more appropriate to be used instead of the shear rate but this renders equation 7 implicit note that the rate of the rebuild of the microstructure has rarely been observed mewis and wagner 2011 to be dependent on the shear rate under equilibrium conditions for example after application of a fixed shear rate γ for a sufficiently long time the rate of microstructural build up and break down in equation 7 are equal yielding dλ dt 0 hence the microstructure of sludge does not change significantly with time and the structural parameter approaches its equilibrium value 8 λ e q γ 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 which only depends upon the ratio of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 by substitution of this expression into the constitutive model 1 2 an expression is obtained for the equilibrium stress value 9 τ e q γ τ y τ y 0 τ y f 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 k k 0 k f 1 k 1 k 2 γ 1 γ n substitution of the sigmoid function 6 into this expression then yields 10 τ e q γ τ y τ y 0 τ y 1 a e k 1 k 2 γ 1 k k 0 k 1 a e k 1 k 2 γ 1 γ n this expression quantifies the equilibrium stress τ e q γ in terms of the five rheological parameters n τ y τ y 0 k k 0 two kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 and one functional parameter a and allows the constitutive model to be directly tested against experimental equilibrium data without the need for a priori fitting of the kinetic model 7 note that only the ratio of kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 appear in equation 10 and so this expression is independent of the actual rate of thixotropic breakdown or rebuild while we do not recommend to use equation 10 to directly fit data and determine model parameters due to the risk of spurious regression with such a large number of parameters it does serve as a useful functional form to check whether the proposed model is capable of resolving the rheological complexity of these materials instead equations 3 and 4 provide an excellent starting point for robust estimation of the model parameters as it includes only five fitting parameters here rheological characterisation of a fully degraded sample λ 0 provides estimates of the parameters τ y k and n and rheological characterisation of a fully agglomerated sample λ 1 provides estimates of τ y 0 and k 0 as well as an independent estimate of the index n once these parameters are robustly determined then rheological characterisation under equilibrium conditions λ λ e q can provide robust estimates of the parameter a and the kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 via equation 10 finally the individual kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 may then be determined by fitting the kinetic model 7 to rheological data involving thixotropic evolution from a known initial state to equilibrium conditions all of the required rheological data outlined above can be provided by a series of controlled shear rate tests involving a step up or step down in shear rate by appropriately preparing each sludge sample via application of pre shear a fully agglomerated or fully degraded initial microstructural state can be achieved under the assumption that a step to a new shear rate can be applied and the stress response accurately measured prior to any significant change in the thixotropic state the parameters in equations 3 and 4 can then be determined from the instantaneous stress response with time the sample then approaches its equilibrium state allowing the remaining parameter groups in equation 10 to be determined finally the kinetic parameters can be individually determined by fitting the rate of the transient response of the stress to the new equilibrium value the constitutive model proposed in this study does not resolve elastic deformations but instead approximates viscoelastic softening of the sludge as an instantaneous viscoplastic failure whilst many materials exhibit viscoelastic softening under shear buscall et al 2015 for many applications this phenomenon occurs on timescales which significantly shorter than the timescale of flow and deformation hence a viscoplastic constitutive model is appropriate for these applications these simpler rheological models also circumvent the complexities associated with experimental characterisation data analysis and flow prediction for viscoelastic materials for thixotropic materials a further requirement for a viscoplastic constitutive model is that the timescale of thixotropic breakdown is significantly longer than that of viscoelastic response whilst the timescale of the viscoelastic response is characterized by the relaxation timescale τ r of the material this can be difficult to accurately determine for thixotropic materials however an upper bound estimate for τ r is given by the timescale of the elastic response t e which is defined as the time beyond which elastic effects are no longer significant in a creep test as illustrated in fig 1 the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model is valid if the elastic timescale t e under a creep test is significantly smaller than the timescale τ t of thixotropic breakdown under this condition there exists a separation of timescales between the elastic and thixotropic processes in the material allowing the viscoelastic characteristics to be validly approximated as viscoplastic rheology on timescales significantly longer than the retardation time subject to thixotropic breakdown and recovery conversely if the elastic and thixotropic processes occur on similar timescales then more complicated tevp constitutive models ewoldt and mckinley 2017 are required to characterise the sludge hence controlled rate step up step down and creep tests play an essential role in both quantifying and validating the viscoplastic constitutive model these tests are described in greater detail in the following section along with sample collection and preparation 3 materials and methods this section provides details on the sample collection preparation and experimental procedures required to fit the constitutive model proposed in the previous section digested sludge ds samples were collected from the sampling point of a mesophilic anaerobic digester at the eastern treatment plant etp in victoria australia at a temperature of approximately 37 c these samples were then housed in insulated containers to minimise any temperature changes the solids concentration of the collected ds samples was measured as 2 wt based on the apha 1992 method and these samples were subsequently thickened using buchner vacuum filtration process to the following approximate total solids concentrations 3 0 3 7 4 0 4 9 these samples were then prepared for the series of rheological experiments outlined in the previous section that comprise of creep tests step up and step down controlled shear rate tests 3 1 creep experiments creep experiments involve the measurement of the shear deformation of a material sample initially at rest in response to applied fixed shear stress the creep response of sludge samples was used to provide an upper bound estimate of the relaxation timescale of the sample for comparison with the timescale of thixotropic breakdown the stress controlled creep test is well suited to this task as it enables better observation of the transition from solid like behaviour to liquid like behaviour these tests were performed at 20 c using a stress controlled rheometer hr3 ta instrument equipped with a vane and rough cup geometry with respective diameters 15 mm and 30 mm for the vane and the inner cup in a series of separate tests the sample was initially presheared for 10 min at a shear rate of 1000 s 1 to achieve an initial condition close to the large shear equilibrium i e λ 0 before the sample was exposed to constant stress for 10 min 3 2 step change shear experiments the step change shear experiments consist of imposing a fixed shear rate to a sludge sample for long enough for the equilibrium state to be reached followed by a rapid change to a new fixed shear rate until the new equilibrium state is reached the new shear rate may be higher step up or lower step down than the original rate these experiments are designed to probe the kinetics of the thixotropic response as the sludge sample evolves from one equilibrium state to the next by setting the pre shear conditions to be either very high or zero sample at rest for sufficiently long periods we ensure the microstructural parameter is either zero λ 0 or one λ 1 respectively at the start of each test this approach then facilitates the estimation of the fully agglomerated τ y 0 k 0 n and fully degraded τ y k n herschel bulkley rheological parameters directly from the fitting of equations 3 and 4 respectively to the initial stress strain data prior to application of the step change these step change shear experiments were performed at 20 c using a rate controlled rheometer ares ta instrument equipped with a parallel plate geometry with diameter 50 mm and gap size 1 mm and humidity control chamber for all tests the sludge sample was initially stirred for 10 min at 1000 rpm corresponding to a nominal shear rate of 300 s 1 to achieve a uniform initial condition close to the large shear equilibrium i e λ 0 for the step down experiments the shear rate under rate controlled conditions was held at an initial rate of 300 s 1 for 10 min to ensure equilibrium conditions prior to being suddenly dropped at time t 0 to a lower constant shear rate for 10 min again to ensure equilibrium was reached in a series of tests where the lower shear rate ranged from 30 to 250 s 1 see table 1 for detail whilst the pre shear renders the structural parameter λ initially close to zero the step down experiments involve a transition of the structural parameter λ from a finite equilibrium value λ e q γ given by equation 8 at 300 s 1 to a second equilibrium value λ e q γ given by equation 8 at the ultimate shear rate in response to this sudden reduction in shear rate the shear stress suddenly decreased to a minimum value as a predominantly viscous response and then gradually increased due to a reduction in the shear mediated thixotropic breakdown given by the first term on the right hand side of equation 7 towards the new equilibrium value corresponding to the new applied shear rate note that an initial shear rate of 300 s 1 was chosen because it was the maximum shear rate that could be attained whilst preventing material from being pushed out of the measurement gap for the step up tests each sludge sample was pre sheared for 10 min at 300 s 1 followed by 10 min resting at zero shear rate to ensure equilibrium and zero stress in the material at the end of the rest period this was validated by measurement of shear stress during the rest period we assume that the microstructure of sludge was entirely rebuilt λ 1 at the end of this rest period and so the sludge rheology is described by equation 3 in the step up experiments a constant shear rate in the range 30 250 s 1 see table 1 for detail was applied to the sludge sample which had previously been at rest in response the shear stress increased to a maximum as a viscous response and then gradually decreased as a thixotropic response due to increased rate of microstructural breakdown to a steady state value corresponding to the applied shear rate the combination of the step up and step down shear tests provide critical quantitative data for the fitting of the constitutive model which shall be detailed in the following section 4 results and discussion fig 2 a illustrates the shear rate of the 3 7 sludge samples in response to different applied shear stresses during the creep tests see figure b1 a c for 3 4 2 and 4 9 in appendix b these creep responses can be divided into two distinct stages at very short times t 0 01 s the shear rate increased sharply as the sample and instrument inertia were overcome beyond this time t 0 01 s the viscoelastic response becomes significant and manifests as an increasing shear rate with different slopes for different applied shear rates up until around t 10 s for smaller applied stresses below 15 pa the shear rate increases to reaches a peak value at around t 10 s beyond which the shear rate reduces due to elastic retardation hence this range of shear stress demonstrate traces of viscoelastic response and not a full viscous flow situation conversely for higher applied stresses more than 20 pa the shear rate increases and plateaus at around t 10 s corresponding to yield and constant viscous flow of the sludge sample these results suggest that for creep experiments above the critical applied stress the higher value of applied stress before viscous flow starts the sludge sample flows as a purely viscous material at times greater than t 10 s and so this time represents a reasonable approximation to the elastic timescale t e ideally a creep recovery test could show the extent of non linear viscoelastic response for the material being yielded however such tests can impart significant errors due to inertial effects this observation of t e 10 s is further supported by the peak shear rate observed in the unyielded cases where the peak shear rate corresponds to complete relaxation of the elastic stresses in the system as strain softening relaxation and thixotropy both act to lower the viscosity of the sample the viscoplastic thixotropic constitutive model proposed in section 2 does not aim to resolve the rheological response over timescales less than the elastic timescale t e rather the complex viscoelastic strain softening behaviour prior to yield is modelled as an instantaneous plastic yield with an associated shear yield stress hence this constitutive model may be validly applied to the prediction of flow phenomena on timescales longer than t e such as steady pipe flow but it cannot be validly applied to short time phenomena such as pump start up and sudden changes in flowrate in subsequent studies we aim to develop a viscoelastic thixotropic constitutive model for these materials that whilst slightly more complex is capable of resolving such short time phenomena fig 2b and 2c respectively illustrate the stress response of the 3 7 sludge samples in the step up and the step down shear rate tests see figure b2 and figure b3a c for 3 4 2 and 4 9 in appendix b in all instances of these tests the applied stress was higher than the upper yield stress of the material and thus the sludge material was always undergoing viscous flow for the step up tests the shear stress initially increased to a maximum value at around 0 07 s before gradually reducing toward a constant equilibrium value after 10 min this sharp initial rise in stress is interpreted as an inertial and viscoelastic response to the imposed shear rate increase while the subsequent decrease is a mixture of both retarded elasticity and thixotropy while it is typically difficult to differentiate between these two phenomena larson 2015 the creep test results indicate that elastic effects are negligible for times greater than t e hence we only consider data beyond this time to fit the constitutive model conversely for the step down tests the shear stress decreased to a minimum value at around 0 07 s before gradually increasing toward a constant equilibrium value after 10 min similarly this sharp decrease in stress is interpreted as an inertial and viscoelastic response to the imposed shear rate decrease whilst the subsequent increase is a mixture of both retarded elasticity and thixotropy mewis and wagner 2011 after determining the upper bound t e 10 s the data from the step change shear rate tests at t e was fitted with equations 3 and 4 using the least squared method in matlab under the assumption of a significantly slower thixotropic timescale such that thixotropic evolution was negligible at time t e the three rheological parameters τ y k n were estimated from 10 experimental data points from the 10 step down tests at time t e and the two rheological parameters of τ y 0 k 0 were estimated from 10 experimental points in the 10 step up tests at time t e once the above parameters were determined k 1 k 2 and a were estimated by fitting equation 10 to the 20 experimental points at t 10 min assumed to be at equilibrium in both the step up and step down tests this procedure provides a much more robust fitting compared to the scenario where equation 10 is fitted directly to the experimental data to estimate all eight rheological parameters simultaneously fig 3 illustrates the variation of the shear stress with the shear rate for the 3 7 ds samples at the following three different times during the step change shear tests i at time t e after the change in shear rate in the step down tests where it is assumed the sludge microstructure is still completely degraded i e λ 0 ii at time t e after the change in shear rate in the step up tests where it is assumed the sludge microstructure is still completely agglomerated i e λ 1 and iii equilibrium measurements after 10 min of constant shear in both the step down and step up shear rate tests 0 λ eq 1 as expected the equilibrium middle flow curve in fig 3 approaches the fully agglomerated upper flow curve at low shear rates and then undergoes a transition to approach the fully degraded lower flow curve at high shear rates this relationship between the equilibrium fully degraded and fully agglomerated rheology is encoded by the kinetic model and the nonlinear function f λ similar behaviour was observed albeit at stresses that increase with solids concentration across the other solids concentrations 3 4 2 and 4 9 ds at the above times see figure b4 in appendix b fig 4 shows the evolution of f λ eq calculated from the equilibrium data from the step change shear rate tests via equation 5 with the shear rate for the various solid concentrations interestingly this figure indicates that there is no systematic variation of f λ eq with changes in solid concentration and there exist only random variations due to experimental error this indicates that the kinetic model and the dependence of the herschel bulkley rheology upon the microstructural state is independent of solids concentration hence equation 6 with a single parameter a and a single kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 was used to fit the data shown in fig 4 across all concentrations this figure indicates that the bulk of the transition from the fully agglomerated state to the fully degraded state occurs over the shear rate range 20 s 1 to 200 s 1 hence industrial processes with characteristic shear rates in this transition region are sensitive to the thixotropic state of the material table 2 reports the fitted values for the rheological parameters used in equations 3 4 and 10 for the various solid concentrations studied herein as expected and in agreement with previous studies eshtiaghi et al 2013 the yield stress τ y τ y 0 and consistencies k k 0 all increased with solids concentration conversely the value of the flow index n was approximately constant for all concentrations and the parameter a and the kinetic parameter ratio k 1 k 2 was invariant with solids concentration the individual values of the kinetic parameters k 1 k 2 were obtained independently by fitting the analytic solution of the kinetic model 7 with the herschel bulkley rheological model 2 to the transient data from the step up and step down tests the fittings were performed using the nonlinear least squared function lsqnonlin in matlab via minimisation of the root mean squared error rmse between the experimentally observed transient shear stress data and that predicted from the constitutive model fig 5 compares the predictions from the fitted rheological model lines with the experimental observations markers of shear stress versus time during the step down shear rate tests for the 3 7 ds sample in response to the step down in shear rate the shear stress swiftly decreased to a minimum value at about 1s as shown in fig 2c and then gradually increased due to reduced shear degradation of the microstructure to approach a new steady state where thixotropic rebuild and breakdown rates were in equilibrium as can be seen the model successfully captures the trend of evolution in shear stress due to thixotropic break down and build up the deviations of the model predictions from the equilibrium value at t 10 min in fig 5 are due to the scatter of the equilibrium data in fig 5 as such this is not a failing of the constitutive model per se but rather an artefact of experimental error fig 6 compares the experimental observation of shear stress versus time during the step up shear rate tests markers with the predictions of equations 2 and 7 lines for the 3 7 ds sample similar to the step up tests in response to the sudden increase in shear rate the shear stress increased quickly to reach a peak at about 1 s as shown in fig 2b and then slowly decreased due to break down of the microstructure to reach an equilibrium value at around 10 min as expected the equilibrium values were comparable within experimental error at the same shear rate for both the step up and step down tests table 3 compares the ratio k 1 k 2 obtained from fitting the equilibrium data fig 4 with the same ratio for the values of k 1 and k 2 directly obtained from independent fitting of the transient data figs 5 and 6 the errors between these two ratios are typically small order 10 and the transient fitting systematically underestimates the ratio estimated from equilibrium this overall excellent agreement confirms the robustness of the fitting procedure and validates the initial assumption of separation of thixotropic and viscoelastic timescales indeed if there were considerable effects of the viscoelastic response still persistent once thixotropic breakdown is significant then estimates of the ratio k 1 k 2 from the transient data would be significantly different from that of the equilibrium data table 3 also suggests that the values of k 1 and k 2 are constant at different concentration because the variation of k 1 and k 2 between different solid concentration are smaller than the fitting errors hence one may use the weighted mean value weighted by the inverse of rmse of k 1 0 0005 and k 2 0 036 in table 3 for a reasonable approximation of k 1 and k 2 for sludge within the studied concentrations this thixotropic visco plastic constitutive model facilitates the prediction of sludge flow in a wide range of industrial applications via e g cfd or analytic approximations in the following section we apply this model to pipeline flow as a motivating example of an industrial 5 implications for pipeline design sludge pipelining and transportation is a significant issue in many wastewater treatment plants where sludge rheology plays a critical role in pipeline design and operation in the previous section it was observed that the evolution of the sludge apparent viscosity due to thixotropy could persist for up to 10 min 600s for most industrial pipelines in which the operating velocity does not exceed 3 m s slatter 2004 this 600s corresponds to 1800 m of pipe length depending on the characteristic shear rate such variation of apparent viscosity results in the variation of both wall shear stress and friction loss over the length of the pipe this variation presents a challenge for engineers as it is unclear which viscosity should be taken for the calculation of friction loss and thus how much pumping power is required to derive the flow despite the significance of sludge thixotropy upon required pumping power and pressure common engineering practice assumes constant friction loss and ignores sludge thixotropy in this section we consider the magnitude of the errors associated with this assumption by comparing predictions of pressure loss and power demand in pipeline flow from the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model with those from a purely viscoplastic model we consider flow in a typical 100 mm diameter straight industrial pipeline operating under laminar conditions that is transporting 3 7 sludge from a storage tank to a processing unit at a fixed volumetric flowrate q in this case the sludge is initially at rest hence fully agglomerated and then the material undergoes shear degradation under pipe flow leading to a reduction of the sludge viscosity a scenario that is analogous to a step up shear rate test under the approximation that the microstructural parameter λ only varies in the axial direction the governing navier stokes equations and constitutive model simplify see appendix a for details to the following analytic solution bird et al 1983 for the total volumetric flowrate q in terms of the wall stress and herschel bulkley rheological parameters 11 q π r 3 n τ w z k λ 1 n 1 τ y λ τ w z n 1 n 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 3 n 1 2 τ y λ τ w z 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 n 1 τ y λ τ w z 2 n 1 as q is constant and the rheological functions τ y λ k λ are known equation 11 quantifies how the wall stress τ w z varies with axial distance with respect to the microstructural parameter λ z whilst the total flowrate q is constant due to evolution of the plug radius r p z the total volumetric flow rates in the plug q p z and annular q a n n z regions of the pipe evolve with axial distance as 12 q p z π r 3 n n 1 τ y λ z τ w z 2 τ w z k λ z 1 n 1 τ y λ z τ w z n 1 n q a n n z q q p z to further simplify analysis we make the approximation that the shear rate acting on the degradation of the rheological parameters across the pipe cross section is constant and equal to the nominal shear rate in the annulus area of the pipe γ r z γ n z the nominal shear rate in the annular yielded region of herschel bulkley fluid undergoing laminar pipe flow may be approximated as γ n z u z r 8 u a n n z d a n n z farno et al 2018 slatter 2011 where u a n n z q a n n z π r 2 r p z 2 is the average velocity in the annular area and d a n n z 2 r r p z is the mean diameter of the annular region from these expressions and equation 12 the nominal shear rate γ n z may be expressed as a known function of the microstructural parameter λ z as γ n z γ n λ z using this expression and the above assumptions and approximations the steady state microstructural evolution equation a 3 then simplifies to 13 u z d λ z d z k 1 γ n λ z λ z k 2 1 λ z λ 0 1 where u z q π r 2 is the average pipe velocity and the boundary condition corresponds to fully agglomerated sludge at the pipe entrance one factor complicating numerical solution of equation 13 is that there is no closed form expression for the nominal shear rate γ n λ from the equations above rather we use the numerical method described in farno et al 2018 that given a value of λ then uses equation 6 to determine τ y λ and k λ which are then input into equations 11 and 12 to yield a unique estimate of the nominal shear rate γ n we encode this numerical method as a standalone function for γ n λ in matlab and then use a runge kutta 4 5 method mathworks 2016 to solve equation 13 implemented via the ode command in matlab along the axial coordinate the total pressure drop δ p l over a length of pipe of length l was then calculated via integration of a 5 over the pipe length as δ p l 2 r 0 l τ w z d z and the pumping power is then 14 w p l 2 q r 0 l τ w z d z note that with increasing pipe length the microstructural parameter λ z approaches its equilibrium value λ n e q given from equation 13 as k 1 γ n λ n e q λ n e q k 2 1 λ n e q 0 and so the pipeline pressure gradient g z d p d z also approaches its equilibrium value g e q lim z g z 2 τ w e q r where τ w e q satisfies equation 11 with the substitution λ λ n e q thus solution of equation 13 provides a means to estimate pressure drop and pumping power requirements for pipeline transportation of wastewater sludges that accounts for thixotropic breakdown of the sludge in contrast conventional methods to design sludge pipeline systems typically ignore thixotropic breakdown of the sludge and assume fixed values of the herschel bulkley rheological parameters throughout the entire pipeline by ignoring thixotropy estimates of pressure drop and power consumption may either under or over estimate the true values depending upon whether the rheological parameters have been determined based upon fully agglomerated τ y λ 1 k λ 1 or fully degraded τ y λ 0 k λ 0 sludge samples or for a steady state τ y τ y λ τ y 0 k k λ k 0 sludge samples subject to a steady shear rate γ in any of these cases the pumping power is simply 15 w p l 2 q l r τ w λ e x p where the pumping pressure drop is δ p l w p l q λ e x p is the microstructural parameter used during rheological characterisation and τ w λ e x p satisfies equation 11 with the substitution λ λ e x p fig 7 compares estimates of the wall shear stress τ w and total pumping power normalized by the pipe length w p l l between conventional pipeline design methods that ignore thixotropy such that λ is constant and the rheological model in this study that incorporates thixotropic breakdown such that λ evolves as the sludge is advected along the pipe the estimated pumping power in these conventional non thixotropic models can vary based on whether the sludge rheology has been characterised when the sludge is in the fully agglomerated λ 1 or fully degraded λ 0 as shown in fig 7 both τ w and w p l l decrease over the length of the pipe due to thixotropic degradation of the herschel bulkley parameters continues lines in fig 7 whereas as shown by dashed lines in fig 7 the calculations ignoring thixotropy are constant over the pipe length and result in under or over estimation of the total pumping power given by the difference between the indicated curves note that if the sludge rheology has been characterised with a partially degraded equilibrium microstructure 0 λ eq 1 then the estimated pumping power ignoring thixotropy forms into another line that lies between the two dashed lines corresponding to λ 0 and λ 1 furthermore unless thixotropy is accounted for it is not possible to determine whether the estimated pumping power is under or over estimated in other words the pumping power cannot be accurately calculated without considering sludge thixotropy both during rheological characterisation and solution of pipe moreover as can be seen in fig 7 the differences between the thixotropic calculations and the non thixotropic calculations depends upon the flow rate and the pipe length the longer the pipe the higher is the error for non thixotropic λ 1 and in parallel the longer the pipe the lower is the error for non thixotropic λ 0 and the higher the flow rate the higher is the error for non thixotropic λ 1 calculation conversely if the sludge microstructure is fully degraded by mechanical operation of a pump a centrifugal pump imposed a shear rate much higher than 300 s 1 at the beginning of a pipeline the sludge microstructure then rebuilds throughout the pipeline increasing apparent viscosity this is a similar scenario to the step down shear rate test in this case the increase in the apparent viscosity results in an increase in the wall shear stress and therefore a friction loss which is increasing and not constant over the length of the pipe similarly this will lead to an over or under estimation of the total pumping power depending whether the rheological parameters have been respectively determined based upon fully agglomerated τ y λ 1 k λ 1 or fully degraded τ y λ 0 k λ 0 sludge samples for a simple evaluation of the pumping power in a short pipeline e g 10 m in the case that sludge microstructure is degraded throughout the pipe one may use the rheological data for the fully agglomerated sludge sample i e λ 1 while in the case that sludge microstructure rebuilds throughout the pipeline one may use the rheological data for the fully degraded sludge sample i e λ 0 this conclusion also suggests that a correct rheological characterisation of sludge depends upon the process that is to be modelled in other words the rheometry procedure used for a flow curve measurement should be adapted based on the application of the flow curve data in general accurate estimation of friction losses and pumping energy under either laminar or turbulent pipe flow requires the full solution of the flow and rheology equations which demands a numerical approach to solve the thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model equations 2 and 7 coupled with the navier stokes equations under this full solution the shear rate pressure microstructural parameter and apparent viscosity fields all vary both axially and radially and the mean axial pressure gradient and the size of the plug region vary axially due to thixotropy as analytic expressions provide a useful tool for pipeline design and optimization in future studies we shall develop and test analytic approximations to the full numerical solutions of thixotropic viscoplastic pipe flow 6 conclusions a novel constitutive model of sludge viscoplasticity and thixotropy was developed and validated based on separation of the timescales of elastic and thixotropic responses this model is comprised of a herschel bulkley rheological model which depends nonlinearly on thixotropic structural parameter that quantifies the state of agglomeration of the sludge microstructure that is governed by a linear kinetic model involving shear degradation during breakdown and diffusion mediated agglomeration during rebuild under the assumption of fast viscoelastic relaxation compared to thixotropic breakdown this model greatly simplifies the class of tvep thixotropic visco elasto plastic models that have been used to characterise the rheology of materials that exhibit simultaneous thixotropy and viscoelasticity this simplification was justified by observing under creep experiments that the timescales of viscoelastic relaxation in the order of seconds is significantly faster than that of thixotropic degradation in the order of minutes in wastewater sludge this simplified thixotropic viscoplastic constitutive model was fitted to a series of creep step up and step down rheological experiments for a series of digested wastewater sludge samples over a range of total solid concentrations from 3 0 to 4 9 wt a novel and robust fitting procedure was developed that reduced both the number of fitting parameters and the risk of spurious regression this constitutive model was validated by matching the ratio of kinetic parameters in the thixotropic model between those estimated from equilibrium data and those estimated from transient data we find that the kinetic parameters and the nonlinear function that relates the thixotropic structural parameter to the sludge rheology and the herschel bulkley index are all invariant with solids concentration indicating the universality of the proposed kinetic model application of this model to an example calculation of pumping energy under laminar pipeline flow suggests that thixotropy can significantly impact the energy requirements of pumping process and a calculation without considering thixotropy can lead to significant errors in pump sizing the constitutive model and presented fitting method represent a robust and practical method to characterise the rheology of these complex materials in industrial applications either through numerical methods or analytic approximations the application of these models and techniques provide the capacity to design and optimise a wide range of wastewater sludge processes form transportation and

mechanics of steady laminar flow of thixotropic viscoplastic wastewater sludge although these equations must be solved numerically via e g dedicated cfd methods we only require approximate solutions to these equations to demonstrate the impact of considering thixotropy upon pressure drop and energy consumption under steady pipe flow hence we simplify this set of equations via the following approximations first we assume that under laminar flow conditions the inertial terms on the right hand side of a 1 are negligible with respect to the viscous terms on the left hand side this is justified by the highly viscous nature of concentrated wastewater sludge and low reynolds number note the maximum re3 reynolds number developed for herschel bulkley fluids farno et al 2018 is 1400 for all of studied cases the navier stokes equations may be further simplified by considering the buoyant pressure p p ρ g yielding the stokes equations a 4 σ λ γ p u 0 application of stokes divergence theorem to a 4 then yields a relationship between the mean cross sectional buoyant pressure p and the wall shear stress τ w σ r z r r as a 5 d p d z 2 τ w r where the cross sectional average is defined as x 2 r 2 0 r r x d r by further assuming that the radial velocity component is zero u x 0 u z r z and that the fluid buoyant pressure shear rate and microstructural parameter are all uniform in the radial direction p p z γ γ z λ λ z then the stokes equation a 4 further simplifies to a 6 σ r z r r τ y λ k λ γ n d p d z the axial velocity field u z comprises of both unsheared plug flow 0 r

that the fluid buoyant pressure p and microstructural parameter λ do not vary in the radial direction integration of equation a 6 across the pipe cross section including both plug flow and annular

17662,biodegradable organic matter bom which can be partially evaluated by assimilable organic carbon aoc can deteriorate the biological stability of drinking water causing microbial regrowth in premise plumbing however little information is available about the compounds consisting of bom or aoc in this study non target screening analysis using high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms was applied to resolve the bom candidates in drinking water the ozonated water was incubated with a microbial community in the effluent from biological activated carbon bac filtration changes in the molecular level composition of dissolved organic matter before and after incubation were assessed by orbitrap ms in the ozonated water 14 components were extracted as bom candidates on the other hand 22 bom candidates were screened in the finished drinking water incubated with an indigenous microbial community proliferating in drinking water comparison of these candidates showed that the ozonated water and finished drinking water had different bom compositions a chlorine disinfection experiment demonstrated that most of the 22 bom candidates in the finished drinking water were generated as chlorine disinfection byproducts although bac filtration effectively removed bom candidates generated by ozonation different types of bom were generated by the final chlorine disinfection chlorine disinfection is indispensable for microbial risk control but it also influences the residual bom composition in drinking water causing microbial regrowth graphical abstract image

system and premise plumbing is susceptible to microbial regrowth lautenschlager et al 2010 ling et al 2018 proctor et al 2018 the regrowth of opportunistic pathogens such as legionella pneumophila and mycobacterium avium after water treatment poses a significant health risk gebert et al 2018 loret and dumoutier 2019 van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 waak et al 2018 various factors affect the biological stability of drinking water prest et al 2016 although disinfectant residual can effectively maintain biological stability and suppress microbial regrowth it is easily diminished during stagnation upon contact with pipes and rusty materials ling et al 2018 biodegradable organic matter bom in drinking water supports microbial regrowth in the distribution system and is an important factor determining the growth potential of drinking water this is more obvious when a disinfectant residual is not applied van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 the amount of bom can fluctuate during drinking water treatment processes chien et al 2007 hammes et al 2010 bom has been commonly evaluated by assimilable organic carbon aoc using the standard isolates or natural microbial community hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij and hijnen 1984 in the drinking water treatment process the aoc concentration increases after ozonation but it is efficiently removed by subsequent biological treatments such as biological sand filtration and biological activated carbon bac filtration basu et al 2016 terry and summers 2018 furthermore oxidative chlorine disinfection can elevate the aoc concentration huang et al 2019 polanska et al 2005 although aoc is solely defined based on the growth of standard bacterial isolates or the microbial community and substrate spectra of the isolates are well described it does not provide exact information on the bom composition a previous study demonstrated that carboxylic acids aldoketoacids and aldehydes accounted for 26 7 and 4 of the ozonated water respectively while 63 of the aoc fraction remained unidentified weinberg 1999 in another study oxalate and formate accounted for 57 of the aoc composition generated by ozonation in full scale drinking water treatment but 43 was not fully identified hammes et al 2006 moreover aoc only covers part of the total bom the intensive review on bom and aoc reported that the median of the ratio of aoc to biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc in the ozonated water was only 30 n 17 terry and summers 2018 while total bdoc is not always consumed for microbial regrowth in actual drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing recent studies revealed that biopolymers such as polysaccharides and oligosaccharides were one of the important fractions of bom in drinking water which were missed by the conventional aoc assay hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 additional strain flavobacterium johnsoniae a3 was proposed to evaluate biodegradable biopolymers because p17 and nox do not assimilate them sack et al 2011 to deepen our understanding of bom causing undesirable microbial regrowth the molecular level composition of unknown bom or aoc should be resolved however conventional analytical methods are not suitable recently advanced high resolution mass spectrometry hrms such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms has been introduced for non target screening analysis of complex dom hawkes et al 2016 herzsprung et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 yuthawong et al 2017 hrms can fully resolve unknown substances consisting of dom and estimate the molecular formulas based on accurate mass determination on the other hand hrms has limited applications to reveal the relationship between dom and the bacterial community fticr ms was applied to characterize extracellular metabolites released from oligotrophic marine bacterium isolate pseudovibrio sp fo beg1 romano et al 2014 demonstrating that bacterially derived dom was composed of nearly 4000 unique molecular formulas fticr ms was also used to explore natural substrates supporting fo beg1 revealing that substrate candidates included nitrogen bearing molecules schwedt et al 2015 orbitrap ms was applied to reveal biotransformation of micropollutants in biological wastewater treatment process schollee et al 2015 however the composition of bom associated with microbial regrowth in drinking water has yet to be elucidated this study investigated a proof of concept application of orbitrap ms to reveal the composition and source of unknown bom in drinking water we collected water samples from a full scale drinking water treatment plant using ozonation and bac filtration to screen bom compounds in the ozonated water orbitrap ms analyzed the ozonated water incubated with a microbial community in a bac effluent to identify the residual bom causing microbial regrowth in drinking water the finished drinking water was incubated with an indigenous microbial community which actually proliferated in drinking water since the fates of the residual bom candidates during the full scale treatment process were influenced by chlorine disinfection the impact of chlorine disinfection on the generation of residual bom was further studied the experimental design of this study is shown in fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling sampling was conducted at a full scale drinking water treatment plant in tokyo with a production capacity of 1 500 000 m3 day in december 2017 fig s2 river surface water was used as the drinking water source the treatment process of the plant consisted of coagulation followed by sedimentation ozonation bac filtration and rapid sand filtration after bac filtration sodium hypochlorite was dosed at 0 6 mg l for chlorine disinfection the finished water maintained 0 5 mg l of free chlorine residual the ozone dosage was 0 42 mg l with a total contact time of approximately 20 min the filter depth of bac filtration was 2 5 m and the empty bed contact time was controlled at approximately 15 20 min water samples from raw water to the finished water after disinfection were collected in glass bottles which were soaked in 0 1 m hcl fujifilm wako pure chemical japan overnight and then baked at 550 c for 6 h to remove carbon contaminants all samples were stored in a cool box and transported to the laboratory within 1 h of collection the influent and effluent of the bac filtration as well as the finished water were immediately treated for non target screening of bom the other samples were also immediately subjected to analysis of water quality and dom composition 2 2 non target screening of bom in ozonated water the influent and effluent of the bac filtration where bac had been in service since november 2016 were collected for non target screening of bom candidates in the ozonated water the bac filtration influent ozonated water was filtered through gf 75 glass fiber filters with nominal particle retention size of 0 3 μm advantec japan the filtrated water was dispensed to six 1 l glass bottles main bottles and one 250 ml bottle monitoring

samples in three 1 l bottles were immediately subjected to solid phase extraction spe to determine the initial dom composition by orbitrap ms the other samples were incubated in the dark at 25 c tcc in the 250 ml bottle was monitored regularly until tcc reached the maximum the other three 1 l bottles were not opened during the incubation to avoid potential contamination of organic matter after the incubation tcc in the three 1 l bottles were checked the water samples were subjected to spe in addition doc aoc and carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate were measured before and after incubation water samples were also collected from different depths of the bac filtration for water quality analysis 2 3 non target screening of residual bom in drinking water to obtain an indigenous microbial community with regrowth potential in actual drinking water an annular reactor model1320ls biosurface technologies usa with an effective volume of 1 l was operated by continuously feeding tap water at a rate of 10 ml min for 1 week in the laboratory of the university of tokyo sodium thiosulphate was added to tap water to quench free chlorine 0 1 0 2 mg l an internal cylinder with polycarbonate coupons was rotated at 15 rpm in the dark at ambient temperature tcc in the effluent of the reactor was monitored the finished water collected from the plant was filtered and dispensed to glass bottles in the same manner as described in 2 2 the chlorine residual naturally diminished after pasteurization the effluent of the annular reactor was added as a bacterial seed to each bottle so that the initial tcc was 103 cells ml the bottles were incubated and processed for water quality analysis including orbitrap ms in the same manner as described in 2 2 2 4 impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition to evaluate the impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition in the laboratory unfiltered bac effluent 1 l was aliquoted to a 1 l baked glass bottle in triplicate sodium hypochlorite solution fujifilm wako pure chemical was injected at a dosage of 0 6 mg l which was the same condition as the full scale drinking water treatment the bottles were incubated at 20 c in the dark with magnetic stirring for 5 h the reaction time also reflected the overall contact time including travel time from the injection point of sodium hypochlorite to a distribution reservoir 2 h and the average retention time in the reservoir 3 h at the plant free chlorine residual was checked after the reaction water samples before and after treatment were filtrated through gf 75 filters and subjected to spe in the same manner 2 5 analysis of raw water and water samples taken after each treatment process raw water and water samples collected after each treatment process were filtered through gf 75 glass fiber filters doc and carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate were measured for all samples while aoc was determined for the ozonated water the bac filtration effluent and the finished water all samples were subjected to spe for analyzing dom compositions by orbitrap ms 2 6 dom analysis by orbitrap ms 2 6 1 spe dom was extracted by polystyrene divinylbenzene based bondelut ppl cartridges 1 g agilent technologies usa both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds could be extracted from the resin dittmar et al 2008 to eliminate possible residual organics associated with the resin the cartridges were first soaked overnight in lc ms grade methanol fujifilm wako pure chemical the cartridges were washed with 20 ml methanol and

componentization was performed by integrating isotopologues and different adduct ions the components were extracted based on the following conditions 1 signal to noise ratios were equal to or greater than 3 and 2 coefficient of variance cv of peak intensities in triplicate experimental cases were below 20 it should be noted that a component in this study can contain different isomers since they cannot be distinguished using only the molecular formula components whose intensities significantly decreased by more than 30 after incubation were screened as bom candidates t test p 0 05 this semi quantitative criterion was confirmed for flow injection analysis by orbitrap ms phungsai et al 2016 2018 2 6 3 molecular formula assignment the compound identification algorithm was used to assign

p17 and nox were cultivated on an r2a agar medium bd usa at 20 c the growth yields of p17 and nox were 4 1 106 cfu μg acetate c and 1 2 107 cfu μg acetate c respectively formate acetate and oxalate were determined by ion chromatography 881 compact ic pro metrohm switzerland with the metrosep a supp 5 250 4 0 column and metrohm co2 suppressor the sample loop volume was 250 μl the flow rate of the

1 performance of full scale drinking water treatment the doc concentration in raw water was 0 91 mg c l but was reduced to 0 72 mg c l after coagulation sedimentation and 0 42 mg c l after bac filtration the finished water contained 0 44 mg c l of doc detailed changes in the doc concentrations are shown in fig s3 oxalate concentration increased from below the loq to 7 5 μg c l after ozonation and decreased to below the loq after bac filtration formate concentration also increased after ozonation and decreased after bac filtration these trends were consistent with the previous study hammes et al 2006 oxalate and formate increased again after chlorine disinfection which was also reported in the previous studies jurado sanchez et al 2014 ramseier et al 2011 the residual concentrations of oxalate and formate in the finished drinking water were 3 8 and 6 7 μg c l respectively acetate was below the loq for all samples changes in the concentrations of carboxylic acids are shown in fig 1 a the depth profiles of the concentrations of doc and carboxylic acids at the bac filtration were investigated figs s4 and s5 doc reductions were apparent in the first 100 cm of the bed although formate removal was limited during the first 50 cm oxalate was reduced below the loq at a depth of 100 cm since bac is hard to adsorb these hydrophilic and low molecular weight carboxylic acids jurado sanchez et al 2014 the reduction of carboxylic acids could be due to microorganisms in the surface layer of the bac filtration basu et al 2016 chien et al 2008 hu et al 1999 the aoc concentrations in the influent and effluent of the bac filtration and finished water are shown in fig 1 b the aoc concentrations were reduced from 58 μg c acetate l to 21 μg c acetate l by bac filtration however the aoc concentrations jumped to 64 μg c acetate l in the finished water this increase was mainly caused by the increase of the aoc nox fraction this increased aoc is consistent with the trends of carboxylic acids fig 1 indicating that chlorine disinfection generates the additional labile fraction of dom polanska et al 2005 3 2 non target screening of the bom composition in ozonated water to explore the bom composition in the ozonated water which could be biologically removed by bac filtration the batch incubation of the ozonated water with microorganisms in the bac effluent was conducted tcc in the monitoring bottle increased from 5 0 103 cells ml to 7 6 105 cells ml after 4 days of incubation fig s6 indicating that microorganisms in the bac effluent utilized bom in the ozonated water for their growth tcc in the main bottles for dom analysis on day 4 was 7 5 0 2 105 cells ml mean standard error n 3 which was in accordance with the result of the monitoring bottle assuming the general growth yields of bacteria 2 9 106 2 5 107 cells μg c hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij 2003 it was estimated that 30 260 μg c l of bom was consumed during incubation the doc concentration decreased from 0 73 mg c l to 0 64 mg c l during the incubation p 0 05 the doc reduction 90 μg c l during the incubation was within the range of the estimated bom consumption during incubation formate was reduced from 10 3 μg c l to 7 9 μg c l p 0 05 and oxalate was reduced from 9 4 μg c l to below the loq p 0 05 fig 2 a although the aoc p17 concentrations did not change significantly during the incubation p 0 05 aoc nox concentrations decreased from 29 μg c l to 5 0 μg c l p 0 05 fig 2 b since carboxylic acids such as oxalate are major components of the aoc nox fraction van der kooij and hijnen 1984 simultaneous reductions of aoc nox and oxalate were reasonable however the total carbon base consumption of formate and oxalate accounted for only 10 of the doc reduction clearly indicating the presence of unknown bom other than formate and oxalate in the ozonated water dom samples before and after the incubation were extracted by spe and analyzed by orbitrap ms doc recovery ranged from 49 to 54 with an average of 51 which was consistent with the doc recovery extracted by the same method analyzing dom in drinking water treatment phungsai et al 2018 2019 in total 1028 components with different molecular formulas were detected the changes in peak intensities of 1028 components were semi quantitatively categorized fig s7 the peak intensities of 1005 components were stable within 30 during incubation however the intensities of 9 components increased by more than 30 after incubation probably due to the production or release of soluble microbial products from the bacterial community associated with bac hong et al 2018 the peak intensities of 14 components decreased by more than 30 after incubation suggesting that they were bom candidates supporting the simultaneous increase of tcc fig s6 these bom candidates in the ozonated water were designated as oz 1 oz 14 table 1 molecular formula assignment indicated that 11 of the 14 formulas of bom candidates were cho type suggesting that microorganisms utilizing cho type compounds became dominant in the water the hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon ratios of the cho type formulas were 1 69 2 00 and 0 50 0 75 respectively which were similar to the elemental ratios of carbohydrates kim et al 2006 several studies pointed out that carbohydrates such as oligo polysaccharides were additional components of bom promoting microbial regrowth in drinking water hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 fig 3 shows the peak intensities of the 14 bom candidates during the full scale treatment process all components were detected throughout the process among them the intensities of 11 components other than oz 3 oz 6 and oz 9 increased by 36 172 after ozonation suggesting that they could be byproducts of ozonation that were generated from other organic precursors in the full scale bac filtration the intensities of 13 candidates other than oz 14 also decreased by 35 96 table 1 which was consistent with the batch experiment observations the behaviors of the bom candidates during ozonation and bac filtration were in accordance with the trends of carboxylic acids fig 1 a previous studies analyzing the dom compositions during the drinking water treatment process by orbitrap ms demonstrated that ozonation generated organic components with more saturation features phungsai et al 2018 the average hydrogen to carbon ratio h c of molecular formula of oz 1 oz 14 1 63 was significantly higher than that of the other components unchanged 1 41 increased 1 01 steel dwass test p 0 01 these facts indicated that bom generated by ozonation had saturated features which was consistent with the previous finding phungsai et al 2018 it has been reported that the peak intensities of identical components corresponding to oz 2 c8h6o5 and oz 3 c8h8o6s also increased by more than 30 after ozonation in another drinking water treatment plant although overall dom composition was different from that in this study phungsai et al 2018 according to a chemspider search 85 and 35 isomers were proposed to have molecular formulas of oz 2 and oz 3 respectively although a further study is necessary to identify their exact structures it is possible that some common oxygen rich molecules are generated by ozonation regardless of the source water 3 3 non target screening of the residual bom composition in drinking water the aoc concentration in the finished water was higher than that in the effluent from the bac filtration fig 1 b in the next experiment the finished water was incubated with an indigenous microbial community which actually regrew in drinking water to explore the bom composition causing microbial regrowth in drinking water tcc in the monitoring bottle increased from 1 5 103 cells ml to the maximum of 4 6 105 cells ml on day 2 fig s8 tcc in the main bottles for dom analysis on day 4 was 3 3 0 1 105 cells ml which was equivalent to a consumption of 13 114 μg c l of doc based on the growth yields conversion the doc concentrations before and after the incubation were 0 41 mg c l and 0 39 mg c l respectively these values were not significantly different p 0 05 after the incubation formate oxalate and the aoc nox fraction were simultaneously reduced p 0 05 fig 4 indicating that the finished water still contained bom compounds promoting microbial regrowth orbitrap ms revealed that the finished water contained 869 different components doc recovery ranged from 46 to 50 with an average of 48 the changes in the peak intensities of these 869 components were assessed fig s9 although the intensities of 306 components increased by more than 30 541 components remained unchanged during the incubation but 22 components decreased by more than 30 suggesting that they could be bom candidates in drinking water these 22 bom candidates in the finished water were designated as fw 1 fw 22 table 2 molecular formula assignment indicated that chon type and chons type formulas were dominant in the bom candidates table 2 implying that nitrogen bearing compounds could be preferentially utilized for regrowth in the finished water these nitrogen bearing compounds could be protein like biopolymers supporting microbial regrowth in drinking water hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 the ratio of components with increased intensities was larger than that in the previous experiment using the ozonated water fig s7 they might be due to metabolites of microbial community growing in the finished drinking water the seed microbial communities in the bac effluent and that in the effluent from the annular reactor were different fig s10 after incubation comamonadaceae were dominant in the bac effluent while oxalobacteraceae were dominant in the finished water these groups affiliated within burkholderiales in betaproteobacteria were observed in drinking water systems niemi et al 2009 proctor et al 2016 vandermaesen et al 2017 recent studies revealed that bacteria could release diverse extracellular metabolites romano et al 2014 wienhausen et al 2017 oxalobacteraceae growing in the finished water can probably produce more microbial products during their growth fig 5 demonstrates the changes in peak intensities of 10 major bom candidates among the 22 in the full scale treatment process these major candidates were selected in descending order of peak intensity reduction during incubation they were detected throughout the process the peak intensities of these major candidates except fw 9 increased by 66 1849 between bac filtration and finished water this trend was also observed for the other bom candidates table 2 in the treatment plant sodium hypochlorite was injected for disinfection immediately after bac filtration therefore the increased peak intensities of the bom candidates could be attributed to disinfection which coincided with the fact that the aoc concentration in the finished water was three fold higher than that in the bac filtration effluent fig 1 b some identical components corresponding to fw 1 fw 2 fw 4 fw 5 fw 8 and fw 10 increased peak intensities by more than 30 after chlorine disinfection in another full scale drinking water treatment plant phungsai et al 2018 for example a chemspider search proposed 48 isomers for fw 5 c6h4o5 most of which 30 isomers had carboxylic functional groups interestingly the bom candidates in the ozonated water table 1 and those in the finished drinking water table 2 did not overlap at all this discrepancy suggested that the bom composition dramatically changed during the treatment process figs 3 and 5 show the impacts of ozonation and chlorine disinfection on the fates of bom candidates in the ozonated water oz 1 oz 14 and the bom candidates in the finished water fw 1 fw 22 ozonation increased the peak intensities of 11 of 14 bom candidates in the ozonated water by more than 30 on the other hand only 7 of 22 bom candidates in the finished water significantly increased peak intensities after ozonation chlorine disinfection increased peak intensities of only oz 1 oz 10 and oz 11 among 14 bom candidates in the ozonated water while it significantly increased the peak intensities of 20 of 22 bom candidates in the finished water these distinctive fates suggest that the bom compositions in the ozonated water and finished water qualitatively differ 3 4 impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition to confirm whether the bom candidates in the finished water were generated by chlorine disinfection sodium hypochlorite was added to the bac filtration effluent in triplicate in the laboratory the dosage of free chlorine 0 6 mg l and contact time 5 h were identical to the conditions in the full scale plant after the reaction 0 34 0 39 mg l of free chlorine residual remained the doc concentration slightly increased from 0 37 mg c l to 0 41 mg c l since an unfiltered bac filtration effluent was used in the chlorine disinfection experiment the slight increase of doc may originate from oxidized particulate organic matter disinfection increased the formate and oxalate concentrations fig s11 the levels of formate and oxalate were almost equivalent to those in the finished water fig 1 a indicating that sodium hypochlorite could generate these carboxylic acids the changes in the peak intensities of dom composition were assessed by orbitrap ms fig s12 although the peak intensities of 690 components decreased by more than 30 the changes of 170 components were less than 30 on the other hand the peak intensities of 45 components increased and one component was newly detected after the reaction with sodium hypochlorite suggesting that they were oxidation byproducts of chlorine disinfection these byproducts were designated as dis 1 dis 46 table s1 in fact 12 of the 22 bom candidates in the finished water matched the components of dis 1 dis 46 indicating that these bom components may be chlorine disinfection byproducts and could partially account for the increased aoc after disinfection fig 1 b the peak intensities of 43 byproducts significantly increased by 750 on average median 195 from the bac filtration to finished water fig s13 and table s1 which was consistent with the results in the laboratory experiment dead bacterial biomass could be a potential source of bom supporting microbial regrowth in drinking water which is referred as necrotrophic growth chatzigiannidou et al 2018 interestingly 28 of the 46 chlorine disinfection byproducts dis 1 dis 46 were chon type formulas suggesting that bacterial biomass and its derivatives treated by chlorine disinfection could be potential origins of residual bom in the finished water the peak intensities for the same components corresponding to 14 components dis 1 dis 3 dis 4 dis 6 dis 8 dis 10 dis 14 dis 16 17 dis 20 dis 25 increased by more than 30 after chlorine disinfection in other drinking water treatment plants phungsai et al 2018 suggesting that production of these byproducts is common in the full scale treatments previous studies that evaluated the impact of chlorine disinfection on the dom composition using fticr ms and orbitrap ms demonstrated that chlorination preferably reacted with reduced molecules with low oxygen to carbon ratios o c and generated more oxidized compounds enriched with carboxylic functional groups phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 the average o c of the components with decreased peak intensities in the chlorine disinfection experiment was 0 43 while that of the other components with increased peak intensities was 0 55 these results were consistent with the previous reports phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 3 5 technical limitations and further study hrms is a powerful tool to reveal unknown dom compositions at the molecular level our study demonstrates the removal and generation of bom components during full scale treatment and the sources of residual bom causing microbial regrowth in drinking water although the feasibility of hrms to explore unknown bom in drinking water could be demonstrated the results obtained should be further validated for different samples dom composition can be different depending on source water and treatment conditions microbial community is also dependent on water supply systems accumulation of more data is informative to reveal the impact of ozonation and chlorination on bom composition it is also necessary to assess the impacts of sample pretreatment filtration and pasteurization and abiotic factors during incubation on non target screening of bom composition moreover technical limitations should be improved to enhance applications of hrms to environmental samples first the target organic compounds in this study are limited to a specific fraction of low molecular weight compounds m z 100 1000 which can be extracted by spe and ionized by negative esi drinking water contains slowly biodegradable and high molecular weight organic matter which can be removed by ultrafiltration schurer et al 2019 such large bom compounds are beyond the current analytical window second flow injection analysis without column separation is semi quantitative nanita and kaldon 2016 applying column separation prior to orbitrap ms can improve the quantitative assessment finally the same molecular formulas assigned in this study do not always guarantee that they are the same compounds since isomers cannot be distinguished only by molecular formula structural characterization of each component by ms ms with clear separation by high pressure liquid chromatography is necessary merel et al 2017 this study focuses on bom which was removed or generated during the treatment process however another important source of bom in drinking water is plastic polymers used in pipes and other accessories in premise plumbing bucheli witschel et al 2012 rahmatika et al 2020 wen et al 2015 additional studies should investigate bom migrating from plastics during long stagnation in japan the national population is decreasing and aging reducing the demand for water this reduced use may cause water stagnation especially in premise plumbing to occur more frequently because it is not practically possible to maintain disinfectant residual everywhere at all times revealing the fates of bom substances in the water supply system should help determine effective mitigation measures to reduce the microbial regrowth potential in drinking water 4 conclusions the bom composition in drinking water was explored using orbitrap ms for non target screening among complex dom bom candidates were screened from the ozonated water and finished drinking water fourteen bom candidates mainly composed of cho type formulas were screened from the ozonated water their peak intensities during the treatment process increased after ozonation but decreased after bac filtration twenty two bom candidates mainly composed of nitrogen bearing formulas were screened from the finished water they were completely different from those found in the ozonated water their peak intensities increased after chlorine disinfection suggesting that chlorine disinfection was involved in their generation a chlorine disinfection experiment demonstrated that some components were generated as byproducts which contained the bom candidates detected in the finished water although bac filtration can remove bom produced by ozonation chlorine disinfection which is a key factor in controlling waterborne pathogens and suppressing microbial regrowth is the major generation mechanism of the residual bom in drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17662,biodegradable organic matter bom which can be partially evaluated by assimilable organic carbon aoc can deteriorate the biological stability of drinking water causing microbial regrowth in premise plumbing however little information is available about the compounds consisting of bom or aoc in this study non target screening analysis using high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms was applied to resolve the bom candidates in drinking water the ozonated water was incubated with a microbial community in the effluent from biological activated carbon bac filtration changes in the molecular level composition of dissolved organic matter before and after incubation were assessed by orbitrap ms in the ozonated water 14 components were extracted as bom candidates on the other hand 22 bom candidates were screened in the finished drinking water incubated with an indigenous microbial community proliferating in drinking water comparison of these candidates showed that the ozonated water and finished drinking water had different bom compositions a chlorine disinfection experiment demonstrated that most of the 22 bom candidates in the finished drinking water were generated as chlorine disinfection byproducts although bac filtration effectively removed bom candidates generated by ozonation different types of bom were generated by the final chlorine

mycobacterium avium after water treatment poses a significant health risk gebert et al 2018 loret and dumoutier 2019 van der wielen and van der kooij 2013 waak et al 2018 various factors affect the

stagnation upon contact with pipes and rusty materials ling et al 2018 biodegradable organic matter bom in drinking water supports microbial regrowth in the distribution system and is an important factor determining the growth potential of drinking water this is more obvious when a disinfectant residual is not applied van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 the amount of bom can fluctuate during drinking water treatment processes chien et al 2007 hammes et al 2010 bom has been commonly evaluated by assimilable organic carbon aoc using the standard isolates or natural microbial community hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij and hijnen 1984 in the drinking water treatment process the aoc concentration increases after ozonation but it is efficiently removed by subsequent biological treatments such as biological sand filtration and biological activated carbon bac filtration basu et al 2016 terry and summers 2018 furthermore oxidative chlorine disinfection can elevate the aoc concentration huang et al 2019 polanska et al 2005 although aoc is solely defined based on the growth of standard bacterial isolates or the microbial community and substrate spectra of the isolates are well described it does not provide exact information on the bom composition a previous study demonstrated that carboxylic acids aldoketoacids and aldehydes accounted for 26 7 and 4 of the ozonated water respectively while 63 of the aoc fraction remained unidentified weinberg 1999 in another study oxalate and formate accounted for 57 of the aoc composition generated by ozonation in full scale drinking water treatment but 43 was not fully identified hammes et al 2006 moreover aoc only covers part of the total bom the intensive review on bom and aoc reported that the median of the ratio of aoc to biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc in the ozonated water was only 30 n 17 terry and summers 2018 while total bdoc is not always consumed for microbial regrowth in actual drinking water distribution systems and premise plumbing recent studies revealed that biopolymers such as polysaccharides and oligosaccharides were one of the important fractions of bom in drinking water which were missed by the conventional aoc assay hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 additional strain flavobacterium johnsoniae a3 was proposed to evaluate biodegradable biopolymers because p17 and nox do not assimilate them sack et al 2011 to deepen our understanding of bom causing undesirable microbial regrowth the molecular level composition of unknown bom or aoc should be resolved however conventional analytical methods are not suitable recently advanced high resolution mass spectrometry hrms such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms has been introduced for non target screening analysis of complex dom hawkes et al 2016 herzsprung et al 2016 phungsai et al 2018 yuthawong et al 2017 hrms can fully resolve unknown substances consisting of dom and estimate the molecular formulas based on accurate mass determination on the other hand hrms has limited applications to reveal the relationship between dom and the bacterial community fticr ms was applied to characterize extracellular metabolites released from oligotrophic marine bacterium isolate pseudovibrio sp fo beg1 romano et al 2014 demonstrating that bacterially derived dom was composed of nearly 4000 unique molecular formulas fticr ms was also used to explore natural substrates supporting fo beg1 revealing that substrate candidates included nitrogen bearing molecules schwedt et al 2015 orbitrap ms was applied to reveal biotransformation of micropollutants in biological wastewater treatment process schollee et al 2015 however the composition of bom associated with microbial regrowth in drinking water has yet to be elucidated this study investigated a proof of concept application of orbitrap ms to reveal the composition and source of unknown bom in drinking water we collected water samples from a full scale drinking water treatment plant using ozonation and bac filtration to screen bom compounds in the ozonated water orbitrap ms analyzed the ozonated water incubated with a microbial community in a bac effluent to identify the residual bom causing microbial regrowth in drinking water the finished drinking water was incubated with an indigenous microbial community which actually proliferated in drinking water since the fates of the residual bom candidates during the full scale treatment process were influenced by chlorine disinfection the impact of chlorine disinfection on the generation of residual bom was further studied the experimental design of this study is shown in fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling sampling was conducted at a full scale drinking water treatment plant in tokyo with a production capacity of 1 500 000 m3 day in december 2017 fig s2 river surface water was used as the drinking water source the treatment process of the plant consisted of coagulation followed by sedimentation ozonation bac filtration and rapid sand filtration after bac filtration sodium hypochlorite was dosed at 0 6 mg l for chlorine disinfection the finished water maintained 0 5 mg l of free chlorine residual the ozone dosage was 0 42 mg l with a total contact time of approximately 20 min the filter depth of bac filtration was 2 5 m and the empty bed contact time was controlled at approximately 15 20 min water samples from raw water to the finished water after disinfection were collected in glass bottles which were soaked in 0 1 m hcl fujifilm wako pure chemical japan overnight and then baked at 550 c for 6 h to remove carbon contaminants all samples were stored in a cool box and transported to the laboratory within 1 h of collection the influent and effluent of the bac filtration as well as the finished water were immediately treated for non target screening of bom the other samples were also immediately subjected to analysis of water quality and dom composition 2 2 non target screening of bom in ozonated water the influent and effluent of the bac filtration where bac had been in service since november 2016 were collected for non target screening of bom candidates in the ozonated water the bac filtration influent ozonated water was filtered through gf 75 glass fiber filters with nominal particle retention size of 0 3 μm advantec japan the filtrated water was dispensed to six 1 l glass bottles main bottles and one 250 ml bottle monitoring

samples in three 1 l bottles were immediately subjected to solid phase extraction spe to determine the initial dom composition by orbitrap ms the other samples were incubated in the dark at 25 c tcc in the 250 ml bottle was monitored regularly until tcc reached the maximum the other three 1 l bottles were not opened during the incubation to avoid potential contamination of organic matter after the incubation tcc in the three 1 l bottles were checked the water samples were subjected to spe in addition doc aoc and carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate were measured before and after incubation water samples were also collected from different depths of the bac filtration for water quality analysis 2 3 non target screening of residual bom in drinking water to obtain an indigenous microbial community with regrowth potential in actual drinking water an annular reactor model1320ls biosurface technologies usa with an effective volume of 1 l was operated by continuously feeding tap water at a rate of 10 ml min for 1 week in the laboratory of the university of tokyo sodium thiosulphate was added to tap water to quench free chlorine 0 1 0 2 mg l an internal cylinder with polycarbonate coupons was rotated at 15 rpm in the dark at ambient temperature tcc in the effluent of the reactor was monitored the finished water collected from the plant was filtered and dispensed to glass bottles in the same manner as described in 2 2 the chlorine residual naturally diminished after pasteurization the effluent of the annular reactor was added as a bacterial seed to each bottle so that the initial tcc was 103 cells ml the bottles were incubated and processed for water quality analysis including orbitrap ms in the same manner as described in 2 2 2 4 impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition to evaluate the impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition in the laboratory unfiltered bac effluent 1 l was aliquoted to a 1 l baked glass bottle in triplicate sodium hypochlorite solution fujifilm wako pure chemical was injected at a dosage of 0 6 mg l which was the same condition as the full scale drinking water treatment the bottles were incubated at 20 c in the dark with magnetic stirring for 5 h the reaction time also reflected the overall contact time including travel time from the injection point of sodium hypochlorite to a distribution reservoir 2 h and the average retention time in the reservoir 3 h at the plant free chlorine residual was checked after the reaction water samples before and after treatment were filtrated through gf 75 filters and subjected to spe in the same manner 2 5 analysis of raw water and water samples taken after each treatment process raw water and water samples collected after each treatment process were filtered through gf 75 glass fiber filters doc and carboxylic acids formate acetate and oxalate were measured for all samples while aoc was determined for the ozonated water the bac filtration effluent and the finished water all samples were subjected to spe for analyzing dom compositions by orbitrap ms 2 6 dom analysis by orbitrap ms 2 6 1 spe dom was extracted by polystyrene divinylbenzene based bondelut ppl cartridges 1 g agilent technologies usa both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds could be extracted from the resin dittmar et al 2008 to eliminate possible residual organics associated with the resin the cartridges were first soaked overnight in lc ms grade methanol fujifilm wako pure chemical the cartridges were washed with 20 ml methanol and 20 ml of 0 01 m hcl fujifilm wako pure chemical one liter of the filtrated water sample was acidified at ph 2 0 by 1 m hcl fujifilm wako pure chemical and subjected to the resin followed by washing with 30 ml of 0 01 m hcl after drying for 5 min the retained organic matter was extracted by 10 ml methanol in parallel an operational blank was obtained by treating 1 l milli q water in the same manner a portion of the extract was evaporated at 40 c under a laminar flow of nitrogen gas it was re dissolved in 20 ml of milli q water with sonication doc concentration was determined to estimate

than 3 and 2 coefficient of variance cv of peak intensities in triplicate experimental cases were below 20 it should be noted that a component in this study can contain different isomers since they cannot be distinguished using only the molecular formula components whose intensities significantly decreased by more than 30 after incubation were screened as bom candidates t test p 0 05 this semi quantitative criterion was confirmed for flow injection analysis by orbitrap ms phungsai et al 2016 2018 2 6 3 molecular formula assignment the compound identification algorithm was used to assign

atcc 49642 and aquaspirillum sp nox atcc 49643 were inoculated to the samples so that the initial concentrations were 500 cfu ml they were incubated at 15 c until the p17 and nox counts were maximized p17 and nox were cultivated on an r2a agar medium bd usa at 20 c the growth yields of p17 and nox were 4 1 106 cfu μg acetate c and 1 2 107 cfu μg acetate c respectively formate acetate and oxalate were determined by ion chromatography 881 compact ic pro metrohm switzerland with the metrosep a supp 5 250 4 0 column and metrohm co2 suppressor the sample loop volume was 250 μl the flow rate of the

1 performance of full scale drinking water treatment the doc concentration in raw water was 0 91 mg c l but was reduced to 0 72 mg c l after coagulation sedimentation and 0 42 mg c l after bac filtration the finished water contained 0 44 mg c l of doc detailed changes in the doc concentrations are shown in fig s3 oxalate concentration increased from below the loq to 7 5 μg c l after ozonation and decreased to below the loq after bac filtration formate concentration also increased after ozonation and decreased after bac filtration these trends were consistent with the previous study hammes et al 2006 oxalate and formate increased again after chlorine disinfection which was also reported in the previous studies jurado sanchez et al 2014 ramseier et al 2011 the residual concentrations of oxalate and formate in the finished drinking water were 3 8 and 6 7 μg c l respectively acetate was below the loq for all samples changes in the concentrations of carboxylic acids are shown in fig 1 a the depth profiles of the concentrations of doc and carboxylic acids at the bac filtration were investigated figs s4 and s5 doc reductions were apparent in the first 100 cm of the bed although formate removal was limited during the first 50 cm oxalate was reduced below the loq at a depth of 100 cm since bac is hard to adsorb these hydrophilic and low molecular weight carboxylic acids jurado sanchez et al 2014 the reduction of carboxylic acids could be due to microorganisms in the surface layer of the bac filtration basu et al 2016 chien et al 2008 hu et al 1999 the aoc concentrations in the influent and effluent of the bac filtration and finished water are shown in fig 1 b the aoc concentrations were reduced from 58 μg c acetate l to 21 μg c acetate l by bac filtration however the aoc concentrations jumped to 64 μg c acetate l in the finished water this increase was mainly caused by the increase of the aoc nox fraction this increased aoc is consistent with the trends of carboxylic acids fig 1 indicating that chlorine disinfection generates the additional labile fraction of dom polanska et al 2005 3 2 non target screening of the bom composition in ozonated water to explore the bom composition in the ozonated water which could be biologically removed by bac filtration the batch incubation of the ozonated water with microorganisms in the bac effluent was conducted tcc in the monitoring bottle increased from 5 0 103 cells ml to 7 6 105 cells ml after 4 days of incubation fig s6 indicating that microorganisms in the bac effluent utilized bom in the ozonated water for their growth tcc in the main bottles for dom analysis on day 4 was 7 5 0 2 105 cells ml mean standard error n 3 which was in accordance with the result of the monitoring bottle assuming the general growth yields of bacteria 2 9 106 2 5 107 cells μg c hammes and egli 2005 van der kooij 2003 it was estimated that 30 260 μg c l of bom was consumed during incubation the doc concentration decreased from 0 73 mg c l to 0 64 mg c l during the incubation p 0 05 the doc reduction 90 μg c l during the incubation was within the range of the estimated bom consumption during incubation formate was reduced from 10 3 μg c l to 7 9 μg c l p 0 05 and oxalate was reduced from 9 4 μg c l to below the loq p 0 05 fig 2 a although the aoc p17 concentrations did not change significantly during the incubation p 0 05 aoc nox concentrations decreased from 29 μg c l to 5 0 μg c l p 0 05 fig 2 b since carboxylic acids such as oxalate are major components of the aoc nox fraction van der kooij and hijnen 1984 simultaneous reductions of aoc nox and oxalate were reasonable however the total carbon base consumption of formate and oxalate accounted for only 10 of the doc reduction clearly indicating the presence of unknown bom other than formate and oxalate in the ozonated water dom samples before and after the incubation were extracted by spe and analyzed by orbitrap ms doc recovery ranged from 49 to 54 with an average of 51 which was consistent with the doc recovery extracted by the same method analyzing dom in drinking water treatment phungsai et al 2018 2019 in total 1028 components with different molecular formulas were detected the changes in peak intensities of 1028 components were semi quantitatively categorized fig s7 the peak intensities of 1005 components were stable within 30 during incubation however the intensities of 9 components increased by more than 30 after incubation probably due to the production or release of soluble microbial products from the bacterial community associated with bac hong et al 2018 the peak intensities of 14 components decreased by more than 30 after incubation suggesting that they were bom candidates supporting the simultaneous increase of tcc fig s6 these bom candidates in the ozonated water were designated as oz 1 oz 14 table 1 molecular formula assignment indicated that 11 of the 14 formulas of bom candidates were cho type suggesting that microorganisms utilizing cho type compounds became dominant in the water the hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon ratios of the cho type formulas were 1 69 2 00 and 0 50 0 75 respectively which were similar to the elemental ratios of carbohydrates kim et al 2006 several studies pointed out that carbohydrates such as oligo polysaccharides were additional components of bom promoting microbial regrowth in drinking water hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 fig 3 shows the peak intensities of the 14 bom candidates during the full scale treatment process all components were detected throughout the process among them the intensities of 11 components other than oz 3 oz 6 and oz 9 increased by 36 172 after ozonation suggesting that they could be byproducts of ozonation that were generated from other organic precursors in the full scale bac filtration the intensities of 13 candidates other than oz 14 also decreased by 35 96 table 1 which was consistent with the batch experiment observations the behaviors of the bom candidates during ozonation and bac filtration were in accordance with the trends of carboxylic acids fig 1 a previous studies analyzing the dom compositions during the drinking water treatment process by orbitrap ms demonstrated that ozonation generated organic components with more saturation features phungsai et al 2018 the average hydrogen to carbon ratio h c of molecular formula of oz 1 oz 14 1 63 was significantly higher than that of the other components unchanged 1 41 increased 1 01 steel dwass test p 0 01 these facts indicated that bom generated by ozonation had saturated features which was consistent with the previous finding phungsai et al 2018 it has been reported that the peak intensities of identical components corresponding to oz 2 c8h6o5 and oz 3 c8h8o6s also increased by more than 30 after ozonation in another drinking water treatment plant although overall dom composition was different from that in this study phungsai et al 2018 according to a chemspider search 85 and 35 isomers were proposed to have molecular formulas of oz 2 and oz 3 respectively although a further study is necessary to identify their exact structures it is possible that some common oxygen rich molecules are generated by ozonation regardless of the source water 3 3 non target screening of the residual bom composition in drinking water the aoc concentration in the finished water was higher than that in the effluent from the bac filtration fig 1 b in the next experiment the finished water was incubated with an indigenous microbial community which actually regrew in drinking water to explore the bom composition causing microbial regrowth in drinking water tcc in the monitoring bottle increased from 1 5 103 cells ml to the maximum of 4 6 105 cells ml on day 2 fig s8 tcc in the main bottles for dom analysis on day 4 was 3 3 0 1 105 cells ml which was equivalent to a consumption of 13 114 μg c l of doc based on the growth yields conversion the doc concentrations before and after the incubation were 0 41 mg c l and 0 39 mg c l respectively these values were not significantly different p 0 05 after the incubation formate oxalate and the aoc nox fraction were simultaneously reduced p 0 05 fig 4 indicating that the finished water still contained bom compounds promoting microbial regrowth orbitrap ms revealed that the finished water contained 869 different components doc recovery ranged from 46 to 50 with an average of 48 the changes in the peak intensities of these 869 components were assessed fig s9 although the intensities of 306 components increased by more than 30 541 components remained unchanged during the incubation but 22 components decreased by more than 30 suggesting that they could be bom candidates in drinking water these 22 bom candidates in the finished water were designated as fw 1 fw 22 table 2 molecular formula assignment indicated that chon type and chons type formulas were dominant in the bom candidates table 2 implying that nitrogen bearing compounds could be preferentially utilized for regrowth in the finished water these nitrogen bearing compounds could be protein like biopolymers supporting microbial regrowth in drinking water hijnen et al 2018 sack et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2015 the ratio of components with increased intensities was larger than that in the previous experiment using the ozonated water fig s7 they might be due to metabolites of microbial community growing in the finished drinking water the seed microbial communities in the bac effluent and that in the effluent from the annular reactor were different fig s10 after incubation comamonadaceae were dominant in the bac effluent while oxalobacteraceae were dominant in the finished water these groups affiliated within burkholderiales in betaproteobacteria were observed in drinking water systems niemi et al 2009 proctor et al 2016 vandermaesen et al 2017 recent studies revealed that bacteria could release diverse extracellular metabolites romano et al 2014 wienhausen et al 2017 oxalobacteraceae growing in the finished water can probably produce more microbial products during their growth fig 5 demonstrates the changes in peak intensities of 10 major bom candidates among the 22 in the full scale treatment process these major candidates were selected in descending order of peak intensity reduction during incubation they were detected throughout the process the peak intensities of these major candidates except fw 9 increased by 66 1849 between bac filtration and finished water this trend was also observed for the other bom candidates table 2 in the treatment plant sodium hypochlorite was injected for disinfection immediately after bac filtration therefore the increased peak intensities of the bom candidates could be attributed to disinfection which coincided with the fact that the aoc concentration in the finished water was three fold higher than that in the bac filtration effluent fig 1 b some identical components corresponding to fw 1 fw 2 fw 4 fw 5 fw 8 and fw 10 increased peak intensities by more than 30 after chlorine disinfection in another full scale drinking water treatment plant phungsai et al 2018 for example a chemspider search proposed 48 isomers for fw 5 c6h4o5 most of which 30 isomers had carboxylic functional groups interestingly the bom candidates in the ozonated water table 1 and those in the finished drinking water table 2 did not overlap at all this discrepancy suggested that the bom composition dramatically changed during the treatment process figs 3 and 5 show the impacts of ozonation and chlorine disinfection on the fates of bom candidates in the ozonated water oz 1 oz 14 and the bom candidates in the finished water fw 1 fw 22 ozonation increased the peak intensities of 11 of 14 bom candidates in the ozonated water by more than 30 on the other hand only 7 of 22 bom candidates in the finished water significantly increased peak intensities after ozonation chlorine disinfection increased peak intensities of only oz 1 oz 10 and oz 11 among 14 bom candidates in the ozonated water while it significantly increased the peak intensities of 20 of 22 bom candidates in the finished water these distinctive fates suggest that the bom compositions in the ozonated water and finished water qualitatively differ 3 4 impact of chlorine disinfection on the bom composition to confirm whether the bom candidates in the finished water were generated by chlorine disinfection sodium hypochlorite was added to the bac filtration effluent in triplicate in the laboratory the dosage of free chlorine 0 6 mg l and contact time 5 h were identical to the conditions in the full scale plant after the reaction 0 34 0 39 mg l of free chlorine residual remained the doc concentration slightly increased from 0 37 mg c l to 0 41 mg c l since an unfiltered bac filtration effluent was used in the chlorine disinfection experiment the slight increase of doc may originate from oxidized particulate organic matter disinfection increased the formate and oxalate concentrations fig s11 the levels of formate and oxalate were almost equivalent to those in the finished water fig 1 a indicating that sodium hypochlorite could generate these carboxylic acids the changes in the peak intensities of dom composition were assessed by orbitrap ms fig s12 although the peak intensities of 690 components decreased by more than 30 the changes of 170 components were less than 30 on the other hand the peak intensities of 45 components increased and one component was newly detected after the reaction with sodium hypochlorite suggesting that they were oxidation byproducts of chlorine disinfection these byproducts were designated as dis 1 dis 46 table s1 in fact 12 of the 22 bom candidates in the finished water matched the components of dis 1 dis 46 indicating that these bom components may be chlorine disinfection byproducts and could partially account for the increased aoc after disinfection fig 1 b the peak intensities of 43 byproducts significantly increased by 750 on average median 195 from the bac filtration to finished water fig s13 and table s1 which was consistent with the results in the laboratory experiment dead bacterial biomass could be a potential source of bom supporting microbial regrowth in drinking water which is referred as necrotrophic growth chatzigiannidou et al 2018 interestingly 28 of the 46 chlorine disinfection byproducts dis 1 dis 46 were chon type formulas suggesting that bacterial biomass and its derivatives treated by chlorine disinfection could be potential origins of residual bom in the finished water the peak intensities for the same components corresponding to 14 components dis 1 dis 3 dis 4 dis 6 dis 8 dis 10 dis 14 dis 16 17 dis 20 dis 25 increased by more than 30 after chlorine disinfection in other drinking water treatment plants phungsai et al 2018 suggesting that production of these byproducts is common in the full scale treatments previous studies that evaluated the impact of chlorine disinfection on the dom composition using fticr ms and orbitrap ms demonstrated that chlorination preferably reacted with reduced molecules with low oxygen to carbon ratios o c and generated more oxidized compounds enriched with carboxylic functional groups phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 the average o c of the components with decreased peak intensities in the chlorine disinfection experiment was 0 43 while that of the other components with increased peak intensities was 0 55 these results were consistent with the previous reports phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 3 5 technical limitations and further study hrms is a powerful tool to reveal unknown dom compositions at the molecular level our study demonstrates the removal and generation of bom components during full scale treatment and the sources of residual bom causing microbial regrowth in drinking water although the feasibility of hrms to explore unknown bom in drinking water could be demonstrated the results obtained should be further validated for different samples dom composition can be different depending on source water and treatment conditions microbial community is also dependent on water supply systems accumulation of more data is informative to reveal the impact of ozonation and chlorination on bom composition it is also necessary to assess the impacts of sample pretreatment filtration and pasteurization and abiotic factors during incubation on non target screening of bom composition moreover technical limitations should be improved to enhance applications of hrms to environmental samples first the target organic compounds in this study are limited to a specific fraction of low molecular weight compounds m z 100 1000 which can be extracted by spe and ionized by negative esi drinking water contains slowly biodegradable and high molecular weight organic matter which can be removed by ultrafiltration schurer et al 2019 such large bom compounds are beyond the current analytical window second flow injection analysis without column separation is semi quantitative nanita and kaldon 2016 applying column separation prior to orbitrap ms can improve the quantitative assessment finally the same molecular formulas assigned in this study do not always guarantee that they are the same compounds since isomers cannot be distinguished only by molecular formula structural characterization of each component by ms ms with clear separation by high pressure liquid chromatography is necessary merel et al 2017 this study focuses on bom which was removed or generated during the treatment process however another important source of bom in drinking water is plastic polymers used in pipes and other accessories in premise plumbing bucheli witschel et al 2012 rahmatika et al 2020 wen et al 2015 additional studies should investigate bom migrating from plastics during long stagnation in japan the national population is decreasing and aging reducing the demand for water this reduced use may cause water stagnation especially in premise plumbing to occur more frequently because it is not practically possible to maintain disinfectant residual everywhere at all times revealing the fates of bom substances in the water supply system should help determine effective mitigation measures to reduce the microbial regrowth potential in drinking water 4 conclusions the bom composition in drinking water was explored using orbitrap ms for non target screening among complex dom bom candidates were screened from the ozonated water and finished drinking water fourteen bom candidates mainly composed of cho type formulas were screened from the ozonated water their peak intensities during the treatment process increased after ozonation but decreased after bac filtration twenty two bom candidates mainly composed of nitrogen bearing formulas were screened from the finished water they were completely different from those found in the ozonated water their peak intensities increased after chlorine disinfection suggesting that chlorine disinfection was involved in their generation a chlorine disinfection experiment demonstrated that some components were generated as byproducts which contained the bom candidates detected in the finished water although bac filtration can remove bom produced by ozonation chlorine disinfection which is a key factor in controlling waterborne pathogens and suppressing microbial regrowth is the major generation mechanism of the residual bom in drinking water declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17663,the formation of estrogenic intermediates i e nonylphenol diethoxylate np2eo nonylphenol monoethoxylate np1eo and nonylphenol np following nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos biodegradation in textile wastewater raises concerns about its endocrine disruptive activity but the estrogenicity changes of textile wastewater throughout biological treatment processes remain unknown in the present study the estrogenicity of textile wastewater sampled from 10 wastewater treatment plants wwtps were investigated using the reporter gene based t47d kbluc bioassay results showed that the estrogenicity of the textile wastewater significantly increased after either anaerobic or aerobic treatment in all wwtps with an average fold change of 3 21 although traditional pollutants were effectively removed the estradiol equivalents of the effluent ranging from 1 50 to 4 12 ng e2 l were generally higher than published effect based trigger values indicating an increased risk for the receiving waters removal efficiency was high 84 46 for npeos but was low for np2eo and np1eo in the biological treatment processes nevertheless np had increased concentrations after the treatment bioanalytical equivalent concentration of the textile wastewater and that of np2eo np1eo and np showed a good linear correlation of which np alone contributed more than 70 to the observed estrogenicity extending hydraulic retention time was found effective in reducing the estrogenicity as it allows relatively complete degradation of np which was further confirmed by running lab scale a o reactors fed with np10eo the results may extend our knowledge regarding the estrogenicity of textile wastewater and its reduction technologies used in wwtps keywords biological treatment processes effect based trigger value estrogenicity nonylphenol nonylphenol ethoxylates textile wastewater 1 introduction the textile industry especially the wet processing including de sizing scouring bleaching dyeing printing and finishing consumes a large amount of water yaseen and scholz 2019 in a conventional textile mill about 150 m3 of water is consumed for one ton of textile processing and more than 80 of the textile wastewater is discharged by the wet processing mills hussain and wahab 2018 in a global scale annual discharge of textile wastewater is estimated to amount to more than 3 billion tons li et al 2019 antczak et al 2019 whereas the dilution factors dfs for a high proportion of existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps are below 10 for low flow receiving streams link et al 2017 rice et al 2017 which has posed a serious challenge to the wastewater management for water ecology restoration qu et al 2019 nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos are an important industrial nonionic surfactant widely used in textile wet processing acir and guenther 2018 high concentrations of npeos ranging from 450 to 5680 μg l is present in textile wastewater gonzalez et al 2008 sheahan et al 2002 and the instability of npeos is associated with the polyethoxylate chains comprised of 1 20 ethoxy units currently biological processes are widely used to treat textile wastewater and npeos in bioreactors go through a series of transformations where the polyethoxylate chain breaks down generating more hydrophobic short chain npeo transformation products mainly including nonylphenol np nonylphenol monoethoxylate np1eo and nonylphenol diethoxylate np2eo planas et al 2002 with the similar structure of the endogenous estrogen 17 beta estradiol these transformation products pose higher estrogenic activities than their parent compounds acir and guenther 2018 this raises concerns about the risk of increasing rather than reducing the estrogenicity of the treated textile wastewater the majority of existing studies have principally focused on the chemical analysis of npeos and its degradation products in environmental compartments such as municipal wastewater sediments ground water and surface water li et al 2018 priac et al 2017 but little information is available regarding the behavior and estrogenicity of the chemicals in textile wastewater especially their changing patterns in textile wwtps textile wastewater is a complex mixture of chemicals mixture toxicity modeling has been used to determine the fraction of the observed effect that can be explained by detected chemicals using the bioanalytical equivalent beq concentration approach which calculates the beq concentration from chemical analysis beqchem using the detected chemical concentration and their relative potency and compares it to the beq from the bioassay beqbio neale et al 2017 2018 xiao et al 2016 yao et al 2018 in textile wastewater treatment bioreactors a complete degradation of npeos into non toxic substances e g co2 and h2o is often compromised by the complicated molecular structure of chemicals and the poor degradation capacities of microorganisms gao et al 2014 ho and watanabe 2017 thus characterizing the changing patterns of estrogenicity in wwtps is essential to ensure the ecological health of the receiving water of the treated wastewater to address the above knowledge gaps the present study used t47d kbluc reporter gene assays to measure the estrogenicity of textile wastewater sampled from 10 wwtps to characterize the estrogenicity changes along the biological wastewater treatment processes mixture toxicity modeling was conducted to compare the beqchem of npeos biodegradation intermediates np2eo np1eo and np and the beqbio of the textile wastewater to determine the main toxicants additionally lab scale a o reactors were run to treat synthetic textile wastewater spiked with npeos to further confirm the survey results of the wwtps our results are expected to shed light on the endocrine disruption toxicity of textile wastewater and provide new insights into the toxicity reduction of textile wastewater in biological treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of textile wastewater wastewater samples were collected from 10 typical textile wwtps as named from wwtp1 to wwtp10 in the following text located in changzhou which is one of the most developed cities in textile printing and dyeing industry in china each of the wwtps continuously apply biological treatment processes and has been stably running for at least one year among the 10 wwtps nine wwtp1 to wwtp9 separately serve an independent textile factory producing denim nylon corduroy etc wwtp10 is located in a textile industrial park and treats the mixed wastewater collected from different textile factories of the 10 wwtps four wwtp1 to wwtp4 adopt an anoxic oxic a o treatment process as the secondary treatment while the other six wwtp5 to wwtp10 adopt only an aerobic o treatment process as the secondary treatment additionally wwtp1 and wwtp10 discharge the treated wastewater into a nearby river and the other eight ones discharge the treated wastewater into either municipal wwtp or industrial park wwtp for further treatment table s1 presents the detailed information of the wwtps grab water samples including the raw wastewater rw effluent from primary settling

hydrochloric acid the water samples were loaded at 5 10 ml min by a vacuum pump totally 500 ml of rw eps or ea or 1000 ml of se were passed through one cartridge after loading the cartridge was dried for 2 h under gentle air pressure then 10 ml of methanol and 10 ml of acetone hexane mixture 50 50 v v were used to elute compounds trapped in the spe cartridge the eluate was evaporated to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream and then immediately dissolved in 1 ml of methanol resulting in enrichment factor ef of 500 500 500 and 1000 for rw eps ea and se respectively for spe quality control a laboratory blank consisted of milli q water running through the same spe process as the se the same aliquots were used for biological and chemical analysis recovery rates of np np1eo np2eo and npeos in milli q water and textile wastewater during the spe procedure were assessed according to omeroglu et al 2015 table s3 lists the detailed recovery rates of the chemicals 2 3 biological analysis of estrogenicity the biological analysis of estrogenicity was performed using the t47d kbluc bioassay as previously described conley et al 2017b briefly t47d kbluc cells were maintained in a gibco phenol

methanol concentration cytotoxicity checks were run to ensure that no cytotoxicity was present at the tested enrichment level supplementary information method s1 a standard curve of 17β estradiol e2 and vehicle control methanol were run concurrently with the sample on each plate each sample was tested in at least two separate plates with three replicate wells at each enrichment level after a 24 h incubation the luciferase activity in each well was measured by a chemiluminescence assay with the dual luciferase reporter assay system promega corp madison usa luminescence was measured by a tecan infinite 200 pro multifunctional microplate reader tecan group ltd männedorf switzerland 2 4 chemical analysis the chemical analysis of npeos was conducted following the method recommended by gang et al 2010 by using an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with an ultraviolet detector agilent technologies santa clara ca usa ten μl of internal standard 4 n np was added before analysis clara et al 2007 the hplc system was equipped with an agilent eclipse xdb c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 mm agilent technologies usa methanol and water 80 20 were used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min at the beginning a wavelength of 227 nm was used and the injection volume was set at 20 μl gradient elution was carried out with a linear program changing from 80 methanol and 20 water to 100 methanol within 10 min which persisted for 5 min np np1eo and np2eo were detected using the method reported by omeroglu et al 2015 briefly 500 μl of eluate in methanol spiked with 4 n np was dried completely under nitrogen gas and 200 μl of bstfa tmcs 99 1 was added into the vials which were mixed for 1 min using a vortex stirrer and then incubated at 70 c for 30 min cooled down to room temperature and vortexed for 1 min finally the mixture was transferred into silylated gas chromatography gc amber glass vials to be injected into a gc mass spectrometer gc ms all experiments were carried out using a trace dsq ⅱ gas chromatography mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa the column used was a db 5ms 5 phenyl methyl siloxane 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm with helium as the carrier gas with a constant flow of 1 0 ml min the sample 1 μl was then injected into a gc ms splitless mode at 280 c the final selected oven program used was as follows 100 c for 5 min 25 c min 1 to 160 c 10 c min 1 to 260 c 260 c for 5 min 35 c min 1 to 285 c and 285 c for 7 min the temperatures of the ms interphase source and quadrupole ei mode were 280 c 230 c and 150 c respectively the selective ion monitoring sim mode was used to test the selected compounds the m z values for the derivatized compounds were 4 n np 179 and 292 np 179 193 207 and 235 np1eo 251 265 279 and 307 np2eo 295 309 and 323 np np1eo and np2eo exist as a number of isomers due to the variability in the branched nonyl moiety so the analytical parameter of each chemical represents the sum of the integrated peak areas for each peak the target and quantification ions were determined together with their retention times 2 5 a o reactor operation to confirm the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt on estrogenicity reduction observed by the wwtps survey two laboratory a o reactors were run to treat synthetic textile wastewater spiked with np10eo a wetting agent frequently used in the textile process synthetic textile wastewater instead of real wastewater was used to better control the variables during the experiments both bioreactors consisted of the same combination of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb 2 l followed by a sequencing batch reactor sbr 2 l fig s1 shows the scheme of the uasb sbr system both a o reactors were seeded with the same activated sludge taken from a full scale textile wwtp and the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the uasb and sbr were 6 5 and 2 0 g l respectively the two reactors were fed with the same synthetic textile wastewater containing cod 1000 mg l and nutrients nh4 n 37 mg l similar to the real textile wastewater see table s4 which lists the details of synthetic wastewater components and was run with an hrt of 8 h at reactor 1 r1 and 24 h at reactor 2 r2 at room temperature the bioreactors were continuously operated for 8 months including four stages at the start up stage unspiked synthetic wastewater was fed to the two a o reactors for more than two months stage 0 then both reactors received synthetic wastewater spiked with increasing np10eo concentrations of 1 mg l stage 1 2 mg l stage 2 and 5 mg l stage 3 and each stage lasted for more than 50 d table s5 shows the detailed operation scheme of the reactors during the whole operation period the uasb and sbr tank were run with a ph of 6 5 and 7 8 and a do of 0 17 and 2 8 mg l respectively routine monitoring included cod nh4 n mlss and ph for all treatment units after stage 0 both bioreactors exhibited consistent performances with a cod removal of 93 and nh4 n removal of 90 details shown in table s6 feeding with np10eo at stages 1 2 and 3 had no perceptible impact on the performance of the reactors except for reactor 1 at stage 3 where the cod removal of the uasb unit decreased from 73 to 56 at the end of each stage a water sample from each treatment unit was collected and extracted for biological and chemical analyses as described above 2 6 data evaluation in vitro assay data analysis was performed as previously described conley et al 2017a briefly luminescence data were normalized to background vehicle control log10 transformed and converted to maximum response based on saturating levels of the agonist standard e2 dose response curves were fit with a four parameter logistic regression using the following constraints top 100 bottom 0 and hillslope hillslope of the reference agonist standard curve the reference agonist ref and sample ec50 values were determined from the logistic regression curves and used to calculate the beqbio of the samples using eq 1 where all concentrations are expressed as the e2 equivalent eeq in ng e2 l and the sample ef represents the degree of the water sample concentration via spe 1 b e q b i o r e f e c 50 s a m

calculating the relative effect potency repi of the detected chemicals using eq 2 for the chemicals with low effect levels the linear form of the concentration effect curves was used for derivation of the effect concentration causing 10 of the maximum effect ec10 to calculate the repi neale et al 2017 the beqchem was calculated using eq 3 where all concentrations are also expressed in ng e2 l and ci represents the concentration of the detected chemicals in the water sample 2 r e p i r e f e c 50 c h e m i c a l i e c 50 o r r e p i r e f e c 10 c h e m i c a l i e c 10 3 b e q c h e m r e p i

posthoc dunnett s test and a p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the linear regression analysis was evaluated using the spss 16 0 software 3 results 3 1 estrogenicity of textile wastewater during wastewater treatments table s2 indicates that the biological treatment processes applied in all 10 wwtps are effective in removing traditional pollutants including cod nitrogen and phosphorus the t47d kbluc reporter gene bioassay revealed that rw from all wwtps induced an activation of er indicating that rw was estrogenically active figs 1 and s2 along with the wastewater treatment processes of each wwtp the estrogenicity of the textile wastewater continuously increased and se incurred significantly higher estrogenicity than rw with an average fold change of 3 21 ranging from 1 61 to 5 49 all with a p 0 05 the eeq calculation further confirmed the increase of estrogenicity fig 1 and table s7 the eeq of rw from the 10 wwtps ranged from 0 41 to 1 62 ng e2 l mean 0 91 0 39 ng e2 l while the eeq of se ranged from 1 56 to 4 15 ng e2 l mean 2 73 0 87 ng e2 l notably from rw to se the elevation of the wastewater estrogenicity primarily occurred during the biological treatments including the anaerobic and or aerobic treatment process which contributes more than 74 98 to the increased estrogenicity on average 3 2 mixture toxicity modeling of npeo biodegradation intermediates as shown in figs 2 and 3 the npeos and their biodegradation intermediates i e np2eo np1eo and np were detected in all wastewater samples collected from the 10 wwtps the total concentration of all the npeos in rw from the 10 wwtps was 0 425 0 243 mg l 0 127 0 818 mg l which was decreased to 0 066 0 060 mg l in the se 0 022 0 228 mg l p 0 05 with an average removal efficiency of 84 46 fig 2 among the npeos np2eo and np1eo also showed a decreasing trend from rw to se but their removal rates were significantly lower fig 3 for example the average concentration of np1eo in rw and se was 7 61 μg l 1 11 15 22 μg l and 5 37 μg l 1 47 9 17 μg l respectively fig 3 in contrast the average concentration of np significantly increased from 4 83 μg l 1 03 10 89 μg l in rw to 14 29 μg l 7 83 25 94 μg l in se p 0 05 fig 3 in accordance with the estrogenicity changes from rw to se the degradation of npeos and the accumulation of np primarily occurred during the biological treatment processes the beqchem values of np2eo np1eo and np were calculated by converting chemical concentrations to in vitro bioanalytical eeq using the relative effect potency of each compound as shown in fig s3 the relative effect potency of np2eo np1eo and np were 5 66 10 6 1 18 10 5 and 1 58 10 4 respectively as a result the beqchem values of np2eo np1eo and np in the textile wastewater from the 10 wwtps ranged from 0 001 to 0 039 mean 0 014 ng e2 l 0 013 to 0 228 mean 0 081 ng e2 l and 0 16 to 4 10 mean 1 33 ng e2 l respectively fig 4 a pearson correlation analysis showed that the beqchem of np2eo np1eo and np were significantly and positively correlated with the measured beqbio of the textile wastewater r2 0 805 p 0 0054 fig 4b mixture toxicity modeling showed that np2eo np1eo and np could totally contribute 79 94 18 59 ranging from 43 18 to 123 48 to the measured in vitro estrogenic activity of the wastewater samples fig 4c with no significant difference between the rw spe ea and se fig s4 of the three intermediates np alone explained averagely 70 97 of the measured in vitro activity while np2eo and np1eo had average explanations of only 1 37 and 7 06 respectively fig 4c 3 3 effects of extending hrt on estrogenicity control of the 10 wwtps four plants i e wwtp1 wwtp2 wwtp3 and wwtp4 adopted the a o treatment process interestingly of the two plants wwtp3 and wwtp4 with a relatively short hrt 16 h the marked estrogenicity increase occurred in the aerobic treatment unit whereas in the two plants wwtp1 and wwtp2 with a longer hrt 24 h a marked estrogenicity increase was observed during the anaerobic treatment fig 1 to further confirm the changes of wastewater estrogenicity in response to different hrts synthetic textile wastewater spiked with different concentrations of np10eo were treated in laboratory a o reactors with both low hrt 8 h in r1 and high hrt 24 h in r2 in r1 the wastewater estrogenicity showed a continuous increase following the a o treatment at all stages especially during the aerobic treatment process and higher levels of spiked np10eo resulted in higher estrogenicity in the effluent fig 5 a a similar trend was observed in r2 except that the marked increase of the estrogenicity occurred during the anaerobic treatment fig 5a notably at all stages the estrogenicity of either ea or se in r2 were generally lower than their counterparts in r1 fig 5a all p 0 05 chemical analysis revealed that more than 94 48 of the spiked npeos were removed during the a o treatment at all stages fig 5b in both reactors concentrations of np markedly increased from ea to se but the fold changes of np from ea to se were higher in r1 when compared to r2 fig 5c which agrees with the survey results of the 10 wwtps in addition concentrations of np np1eo and np2eo in r2 were lower than their counterparts in r1 at all stages fig 5c although the total mass of the three intermediates detected in the effluent either ea or se only accounted for less than 3 of the spiked np10eo as revealed by the mass balance analysis regression analysis showed a good linear correlation between the beqchem of the three intermediates and the beqbio of the synthetic wastewater r2 0 919 p 0 0258 fig s5 4 discussion textile wastewater is known for its high toxicity with respect to risk assessment the majority of existing studies primarily focused on the acute toxicity of textile wastewater to aquatic organisms such as luminescent bacteria algae or daphnia liang et al 2018 pazdzior et al 2017 rodrigues de oliveira et al 2018 roshini et al 2017 in the present study we found that the textile wastewater sampled in all 10 well operated wwtps induced an er mediated estrogenicity with strong erα agonism in a t47d derived reporter gene cell line though the observed results of estrogenicity were based on human erα the conservation of er across vertebrates indicates a relevant estrogenic toxicity for other vertebrates as well following the discharge of textile wastewater nelson and habibi 2013 especially for the aquatic animals since textile wastewater are typically discharged into aquatic environments notably the biggest wwtp wwtp10 discharges 20 000 tons treated textile wastewater eeq of 2 95 ng e2 l per day to a nearby river with an estimated df of below 5 which would result in a receiving water eeq higher than the required e2 limitation of 0 4 ng l in surface water or artificial water bodies according to directive 2000 60 ec additionally from the perspective of protection goals including human health or environmental safety researchers have proposed erα specific effect based trigger values ranging from 0 5 to 0 1 ng e2 l as thresholds below which no environmental risk is expected escher et al 2018 jarosova et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017 the exceeded eeq value of the textile effluent indicates a potential risk of endocrine disruptive activity for the receiving environments which emphasizes the importance of endocrine disruption to be included in textile wastewater risk assessment it is worth noting that although the findings were obtained based on the survey of textile wwtps in china the relevant estrogenic toxicity is more than just a local issue but is rather more of a global problem as npeos have been widely used in the world especially in developing countries acir and guenther 2018 for example high concentrations of npeos have been detected in textile wastewater or clothing items from different geographical locations such as vietnam serbia and hungary antal et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2008 ho and watanabe 2017 indicating potential prevalence of endocrine disruption risk from discharge of npeos containing wastewater on a global scale to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the elevation of estrogenicity of textile wastewater by biological treatment processes biological treatment has been well known as a cost effective method to treat textile wastewater for not only being efficient in removing the chemical contaminants but also adequate in reducing the biological acute toxicity amaral et al 2014 ceretta et al 2018 sarayu and sandhya 2012 however the present study revealed significantly higher estrogenicity of the textile effluent after biological treatments when compared to the raw textile wastewater it is known that changes in wastewater toxicity are in sync with the degradation or transformation of the toxicants present in the wastewater previous studies have demonstrated potential links between the reduction of acute toxicity of textile wastewater and the degradation of azo dyes during biological treatments solis et al 2012 in the present study the relative accumulation of np2eo np1eo and np in contrast to the biodegradation of npeos is consistent with the increase of estrogenicity of textile wastewater as evidenced by the significant positive correlation between the beqchem of these estrogenic active compounds and the beqbio in both real and synthetic textile wastewater suggesting a potential relationship between the biodegradation of npeos and the estrogenicity change of textile wastewater during biological treatments mixture toxicity modeling and effect directed analysis using the beq approach has been extensively used to determine the fraction of the observed effects that can be explained by detected chemicals neale et al 2015 pochiraju et al 2020 specifically for the receptor mediated effects e g activation of the er studies have demonstrated that typically only a few highly bioactive molecules can explain a high proportion of the mixture effect observed by the cocktail of chemicals in a water sample escher et al 2018 hashmi et al 2018 neale et al 2017 using the beq approach we found that np2eo np1eo and np present in the textile wastewater explained nearly 80 of the estrogenicity of the wastewater due to a much higher estrogenic potency of np when compared to np1eo and np2eo np alone contributes more than 70 of the observed effect indicating that np serves as a dominant toxicant for inducing the estrogenicity of textile wastewater although studies have shown that short chain nonylphenol ethoxycarboxylates npecs which are also estrogenic active can be formed during npeos biodegradation they are much less estrogenically potent than np and present at lower concentration in comparison to the short chain npeos especially in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems zhou et al 2015 interestingly the beqchem of several wastewater samples were found to be higher than their corresponding beqbio the reason may be the presence of some antiestrogen compounds in the textile wastewater which leads to a less potent beqbio when compared to the beqchem similar results have also been reported in other samples of chemical mixtures including municipal wastewater and surface water conley et al 2017a it is known that npeos are subject to microbial biodegradation under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions gao et al 2014 lu et al 2008 and a lower rate of benzene ring cleavage than that found in ethoxy dropping would result in the relative accumulation of np lu et al 2008 this agrees with the results of the present study that the np concentrations and estrogenicity of both the real and synthetic textile wastewater increased after either anaerobic or aerobic biodegradation however if given enough time the accumulation of np would eventually come to an end when the estrogenicity reaches its summit then it would start to decline lu et al 2008 this is confirmed by the lab scale bioreactor simulation indicating that the effluent estrogenicity in r2 was lower than its counterpart in r1 these results indicate that the increase of wastewater estrogenicity in biological treatment systems follows an n shape curve in respond to increasing hrt therefore to reduce the effluent estrogenicity by extending hrt one should make sure that the extended hrt is longer than the time required for the estrogenicity to reach the summit the fact that the effluent estrogenicity in r2 was lower than that in r1 indicates that the summit time is shorter than 24 h the present study also shows that extending hrt of the a o treatment process may result in a narrowed estrogenicity difference between ea and se and even lower estrogenicity in se when compared to ea these findings are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating beneficial effects of extending hrt on the biodegradation of estrogenic micropollutants such as np estrogens and bisphenol a petrie et al 2014 boonnorat et al 2019 additionally it has been shown that ammonia oxidizing bacteria in wwtps contributes to the removal of estrogenic micropollutants via co metabolism biodegradation forrez et al 2009 sun et al 2012 which provides research outlooks on simultaneous nitrification and estrogenicity reduction for textile wastewater treatment notably the mass balance analysis revealed that more than 97 of the parent npeos were degraded into np and then transformed into non estrogenic products in conventional biological treatment systems and the estrogenicity inducing np were at trace concentrations to achieve effective estrogenicity reduction with no need to extend hrt some scientists have suggested acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation as an effective method for organic pollutant biodegradation especially for micropollutants with low concentrations boonnorat et al 2018 2019 alternatively tertiary treatments assembled with absorption or advanced oxidation with particular functions on removing micropollutants especially np are recommended for example mineral commercial activated carbons and photo fenton oxidation have proven effective in removing np in wastewater balabanic et al 2012 del bubba et al 2019 5 conclusions this study characterized the changes of estrogenicity of textile wastewater in biological treatment systems and their links with the biodegradation of npeos biological treatment is effective in removal of chemical pollutants however they can also increase the estrogenicity of textile wastewater increasing the risk of endocrine disruptive activity for the receiving waters the estrogenicity enhancement is primarily attributed to the formation of npeos biodegradation intermediates in which np accumulation plays a major role extending hrt of biological treatment processes to exceed the summit time is conducive to reducing estrogenicity as it allows for a relatively complete degradation of the estrogenic intermediates specifically np in textile wastewater

17663,the formation of estrogenic intermediates i e nonylphenol diethoxylate np2eo nonylphenol monoethoxylate np1eo and nonylphenol np following nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos biodegradation in textile wastewater raises concerns about its endocrine disruptive activity but the estrogenicity changes of textile wastewater throughout biological treatment processes remain unknown in the present study the estrogenicity of textile wastewater sampled from 10 wastewater treatment plants wwtps were investigated using the reporter gene based t47d kbluc bioassay results showed that the estrogenicity of the textile wastewater significantly increased after either anaerobic or aerobic treatment in all wwtps with an average fold change of 3 21 although traditional pollutants were effectively removed the estradiol equivalents of the effluent ranging from 1 50 to 4 12 ng e2 l were generally higher than published effect based trigger values indicating an increased risk for the receiving waters removal efficiency was high 84 46 for npeos but was low for np2eo and np1eo in the biological treatment processes nevertheless np had increased concentrations after the treatment bioanalytical equivalent concentration of the textile wastewater and that of np2eo np1eo and np showed a good linear correlation of which np alone contributed more than 70 to the observed estrogenicity extending hydraulic retention time was found effective in reducing the estrogenicity as it allows relatively complete degradation of np which was further confirmed by running lab scale a o reactors fed with np10eo the results may extend our knowledge regarding the estrogenicity of textile wastewater and its reduction technologies used in wwtps keywords biological treatment processes effect based trigger value estrogenicity nonylphenol nonylphenol ethoxylates textile wastewater 1 introduction the textile industry especially the wet processing including de sizing scouring bleaching dyeing printing and finishing consumes a large amount of water yaseen and scholz 2019 in a conventional textile mill about 150 m3 of water is consumed for one ton of textile processing and more than 80 of the textile wastewater is discharged by the wet processing mills hussain and wahab 2018 in a global scale annual discharge of textile wastewater is estimated to amount to more than 3 billion tons li et al 2019 antczak et al 2019 whereas the dilution factors dfs for a high proportion of existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps are below 10 for low flow receiving streams link et al 2017 rice et al 2017 which has posed a serious challenge to the wastewater management for water ecology restoration qu et al 2019 nonylphenol ethoxylates npeos are an important industrial nonionic surfactant widely used in textile wet processing acir and guenther 2018 high concentrations of npeos ranging from 450 to 5680 μg l is present in textile wastewater gonzalez et al 2008 sheahan et al 2002 and the instability of npeos is associated with the polyethoxylate chains comprised of 1 20 ethoxy units currently biological processes are widely used to treat textile wastewater and npeos in bioreactors go through a series of transformations where the polyethoxylate chain breaks down generating more hydrophobic short chain npeo transformation products mainly including nonylphenol np nonylphenol monoethoxylate np1eo and nonylphenol diethoxylate np2eo planas et al 2002 with the similar structure of the endogenous estrogen 17 beta estradiol these transformation products pose higher estrogenic activities than their parent compounds acir and guenther 2018 this raises concerns about the risk of increasing rather than reducing the estrogenicity of the treated textile wastewater the majority of existing studies have principally focused on the chemical analysis of npeos and its degradation products in environmental compartments such as municipal wastewater sediments ground water and surface water li et al 2018 priac et al 2017 but little information is available regarding the behavior and estrogenicity of the chemicals in textile wastewater especially their changing patterns in textile wwtps textile wastewater is a complex mixture of chemicals mixture toxicity modeling has been used to determine the fraction of the observed effect that can be explained by detected chemicals using the bioanalytical equivalent beq concentration approach which calculates the beq concentration from chemical analysis beqchem using the detected chemical concentration and their relative potency and compares it to the beq from the bioassay beqbio neale et al 2017 2018 xiao et al 2016 yao et al 2018 in textile wastewater treatment bioreactors a complete degradation of npeos into non toxic substances e g co2 and h2o is often compromised by the complicated molecular structure of chemicals and the poor degradation capacities of microorganisms gao et al 2014 ho and watanabe 2017 thus characterizing the changing patterns of estrogenicity in wwtps is essential to ensure the ecological health of the receiving water of the treated wastewater to address the above knowledge gaps the present study used t47d kbluc reporter gene assays to measure the estrogenicity of textile wastewater sampled from 10 wwtps to characterize the estrogenicity changes along the biological wastewater treatment processes mixture toxicity modeling was conducted to compare the beqchem of npeos biodegradation intermediates np2eo np1eo and np and the beqbio of the textile wastewater to determine the main toxicants additionally lab scale a o reactors were run to treat synthetic textile wastewater spiked with npeos to further confirm the survey results of the wwtps our results are expected to shed light on the endocrine disruption toxicity of textile wastewater and provide new insights into the toxicity reduction of textile wastewater in biological treatment processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of textile wastewater wastewater samples were collected from 10 typical textile wwtps as named from wwtp1 to wwtp10 in the following text located in changzhou which is one of the most developed cities in textile printing and dyeing industry in china each of the wwtps continuously apply biological treatment processes and has been stably running for at least one year among the 10 wwtps nine wwtp1 to wwtp9 separately serve an independent textile factory producing denim nylon corduroy etc wwtp10 is located in a textile industrial park and treats the mixed wastewater collected from different textile factories of the 10 wwtps four wwtp1 to wwtp4 adopt an anoxic oxic a o treatment process as the secondary treatment while the other six wwtp5 to wwtp10 adopt only an aerobic o treatment process as the secondary treatment additionally wwtp1 and wwtp10 discharge the treated wastewater into a nearby river and the other eight ones discharge the treated wastewater into either municipal wwtp or industrial park wwtp for further treatment table s1 presents the detailed information of the wwtps grab water samples including the raw wastewater rw effluent from primary settling

infinite 200 pro multifunctional microplate reader tecan group ltd männedorf switzerland 2 4 chemical analysis the chemical analysis of npeos was conducted following the method recommended by gang et al 2010 by using an agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with an ultraviolet detector agilent technologies santa clara ca usa ten μl of internal standard 4 n np was added before analysis clara et al 2007 the hplc system was equipped with an agilent eclipse xdb c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm id 5 mm agilent technologies usa methanol and water 80 20 were used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min at the beginning a wavelength of 227 nm was used and the injection volume was set at 20 μl gradient elution was carried out with a linear program changing from 80 methanol and 20 water to 100 methanol within 10 min which persisted for 5 min np np1eo and np2eo were detected using the method reported by omeroglu et al 2015 briefly 500 μl of eluate in methanol spiked with 4 n np was dried completely under nitrogen gas and 200 μl of bstfa tmcs 99 1 was added into the vials which were mixed for 1 min using a vortex stirrer and then incubated at 70 c for 30 min cooled down to room temperature and vortexed for 1 min finally the mixture was transferred into silylated gas chromatography gc amber glass vials to be injected into a gc mass spectrometer gc ms all experiments were carried out using a trace dsq ⅱ gas chromatography mass spectrometer thermo scientific usa the column used was a db 5ms 5 phenyl methyl siloxane 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm with helium as the carrier gas

monitoring sim mode was used to test the selected compounds the m z values for the derivatized compounds were 4 n np 179 and 292 np 179 193 207 and 235 np1eo 251 265 279 and 307 np2eo 295 309 and 323 np np1eo and np2eo exist as a number of isomers due to the variability in the branched nonyl moiety so the analytical parameter of each chemical represents the sum of the integrated peak areas for each peak the target and quantification ions were determined together with their retention times 2 5 a o reactor operation to confirm the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt on estrogenicity reduction observed by the wwtps survey two laboratory a o reactors were run to treat synthetic textile wastewater spiked with np10eo a wetting agent frequently used in the textile process synthetic textile wastewater instead of real wastewater was used to better control the variables during the experiments both bioreactors consisted of the same combination of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb 2 l followed by a sequencing batch reactor sbr 2 l fig s1 shows the scheme of the uasb sbr system both a o reactors were seeded with the same activated sludge taken from a full scale textile wwtp and the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the uasb and sbr were 6 5 and 2 0 g l respectively the two reactors were fed with the same synthetic textile wastewater containing cod 1000 mg l and nutrients nh4 n 37 mg l similar to the real textile wastewater see table s4 which lists the details of synthetic wastewater components and was run with an hrt of 8 h at reactor 1 r1 and 24 h at reactor 2 r2 at room temperature the bioreactors were continuously operated for 8 months including four stages at the start up stage unspiked synthetic wastewater was fed to the two a o reactors for more than two months stage 0 then both reactors received synthetic wastewater spiked with increasing np10eo concentrations of 1 mg l stage 1 2 mg l stage 2 and 5 mg l stage 3 and each stage lasted for more than 50 d table s5 shows the detailed operation scheme of the reactors during the whole operation period the uasb and sbr tank were run with a ph of 6 5 and 7 8 and a do of 0 17 and 2 8 mg l respectively routine monitoring included cod nh4 n mlss and ph for all treatment units after stage 0 both bioreactors exhibited consistent performances with a cod removal of 93 and nh4 n removal of 90 details shown in table s6 feeding with np10eo at stages 1 2 and 3 had no perceptible impact on the performance of the reactors except for reactor 1 at stage 3 where the cod removal of the uasb unit decreased from 73 to 56 at the end of each stage a water sample from each treatment unit was collected and extracted for biological and chemical analyses as described above 2 6 data evaluation in vitro assay data analysis was performed as previously described conley et al 2017a briefly luminescence data were normalized to background vehicle control log10 transformed and converted to maximum response based on saturating levels of the agonist standard e2 dose response curves were fit with a four parameter logistic regression using the following constraints top 100 bottom 0 and hillslope hillslope of the reference agonist standard curve the reference agonist ref and sample ec50 values were determined from the logistic regression curves and used to calculate the beqbio of the samples

calculating the relative effect potency repi of the detected chemicals using eq 2 for the chemicals with low effect levels the linear form of the concentration effect curves was used for derivation of the effect concentration causing 10 of the maximum effect ec10 to calculate the repi neale et al 2017 the beqchem was calculated using eq 3 where all concentrations are also expressed in ng e2 l and ci represents the concentration of the detected chemicals in the water sample 2 r e p i r e f e c 50 c h e m i c a l i e c 50 o r r e p i r e f e c 10 c h e m i c a l i e c 10 3 b e q c h e m r e p i

posthoc dunnett s test and a p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the linear regression analysis was evaluated using the spss 16 0 software 3 results 3 1 estrogenicity of textile wastewater during wastewater treatments table s2 indicates that the biological treatment processes applied in all 10 wwtps are effective in removing traditional pollutants including cod nitrogen and phosphorus the t47d kbluc reporter gene bioassay revealed that rw from all wwtps induced an activation of er indicating that rw was estrogenically active figs 1 and s2 along with the wastewater treatment processes of each wwtp the estrogenicity of the textile wastewater continuously increased and se incurred significantly higher estrogenicity than rw with an average fold change of 3 21 ranging from 1 61 to 5 49 all with a p 0 05 the eeq calculation further confirmed the increase of estrogenicity fig 1 and table s7 the eeq of rw from the 10 wwtps ranged from 0 41 to 1 62 ng e2 l mean 0 91 0 39 ng e2 l while the eeq of se ranged from 1 56 to 4 15 ng e2 l mean 2 73 0 87 ng e2 l notably from rw to se the elevation of the wastewater estrogenicity primarily occurred during the biological treatments including the anaerobic and or aerobic treatment process which contributes more than 74 98 to the increased estrogenicity on average 3 2 mixture toxicity modeling of npeo biodegradation intermediates as shown in figs 2 and 3 the npeos and their biodegradation intermediates i e np2eo np1eo and np were detected in all wastewater samples collected from the 10 wwtps the total concentration of all the npeos in rw from the 10 wwtps was 0 425 0 243 mg l 0 127 0 818 mg l which was decreased to 0 066 0 060 mg l in the se 0 022 0 228 mg l p 0 05 with an average removal efficiency of 84 46 fig 2 among the npeos np2eo and np1eo also showed a decreasing trend from rw to se but their removal rates were significantly lower fig 3 for example the average concentration of np1eo in rw and se was 7 61 μg l 1 11 15 22 μg l and 5 37 μg l 1 47 9 17 μg l respectively fig 3 in contrast the average concentration of np significantly increased from 4 83 μg l 1 03 10 89 μg l in rw to 14 29 μg l 7 83 25 94 μg l in se p 0 05 fig 3 in accordance with the estrogenicity changes from rw to se the degradation of npeos and the accumulation of np primarily occurred during the biological treatment processes the beqchem values of np2eo np1eo and np were calculated by converting chemical concentrations to in vitro bioanalytical eeq using the relative effect potency of each compound as shown in fig s3 the relative effect potency of np2eo np1eo and np were 5 66 10 6 1 18 10 5 and 1 58 10 4 respectively as a result the beqchem values of np2eo np1eo and np in the textile wastewater from the 10 wwtps ranged from 0 001 to 0 039 mean 0 014 ng e2 l 0 013 to 0 228 mean 0 081 ng e2 l and 0 16 to 4 10 mean 1 33 ng e2 l respectively fig 4 a pearson correlation analysis showed that the beqchem of np2eo np1eo and np were significantly and positively correlated with the measured beqbio of the textile wastewater r2 0 805 p 0 0054 fig 4b mixture toxicity modeling showed that np2eo np1eo and np could totally contribute 79 94 18 59 ranging from 43 18 to 123 48 to the measured in vitro estrogenic activity of the wastewater samples fig 4c with no significant difference between the rw spe ea and se fig s4 of the three intermediates np alone explained averagely 70 97 of the measured in vitro activity while np2eo and np1eo had average explanations of only 1 37 and 7 06 respectively fig 4c 3 3 effects of extending hrt on estrogenicity control of the 10 wwtps four plants i e wwtp1 wwtp2 wwtp3 and wwtp4 adopted the a o treatment process interestingly of the two plants wwtp3 and wwtp4 with a relatively short hrt 16 h the marked estrogenicity increase occurred in the aerobic treatment unit whereas in the two plants wwtp1 and wwtp2 with a longer hrt 24 h a marked estrogenicity increase was observed during the anaerobic treatment fig 1 to further confirm the changes of wastewater estrogenicity in response to different hrts synthetic textile wastewater spiked with different concentrations of np10eo were treated in laboratory a o reactors with both low hrt 8 h in r1 and high hrt 24 h in r2 in r1 the wastewater estrogenicity showed a continuous increase following the a o treatment at all stages especially during the aerobic treatment process and higher levels of spiked np10eo resulted in higher estrogenicity in the effluent fig 5 a a similar trend was observed in r2 except that the marked increase of the estrogenicity occurred during the anaerobic treatment fig 5a notably at all stages the estrogenicity of either ea or se in r2 were generally lower than their counterparts in r1 fig 5a all p 0 05 chemical analysis revealed that more than 94 48 of the spiked npeos were removed during the a o treatment at all stages fig 5b in both reactors concentrations of np markedly increased from ea to se but the fold changes of np from ea to se were higher in r1 when compared to r2 fig 5c which agrees with the survey results of the 10 wwtps in addition concentrations of np np1eo and np2eo in r2 were lower than their counterparts in r1 at all stages fig 5c although the total mass of the three intermediates detected in the effluent either ea or se only accounted for less than 3 of the spiked np10eo as revealed by the mass balance analysis regression analysis showed a good linear correlation between the beqchem of the three intermediates and the beqbio of the synthetic wastewater r2 0 919 p 0 0258 fig s5 4 discussion textile wastewater is known for its high toxicity with respect to risk assessment the majority of existing studies primarily focused on the acute toxicity of textile wastewater to aquatic organisms such as luminescent bacteria algae or daphnia liang et al 2018 pazdzior et al 2017 rodrigues de oliveira et al 2018 roshini et al 2017 in the present study we found that the textile wastewater sampled in all 10 well operated wwtps induced an er mediated estrogenicity with strong erα agonism in a t47d derived reporter gene cell line though the observed results of estrogenicity were based on human erα the conservation of er across vertebrates indicates a relevant estrogenic toxicity for other vertebrates as well following the discharge of textile wastewater nelson and habibi 2013 especially for the aquatic animals since textile wastewater are typically discharged into aquatic environments notably the biggest wwtp wwtp10 discharges 20 000 tons treated textile wastewater eeq of 2 95 ng e2 l per day to a nearby river with an estimated df of below 5 which would result in a receiving water eeq higher than the required e2 limitation of 0 4 ng l in surface water or artificial water bodies according to directive 2000 60 ec additionally from the perspective of protection goals including human health or environmental safety researchers have proposed erα specific effect based trigger values ranging from 0 5 to 0 1 ng e2 l as thresholds below which no environmental risk is expected escher et al 2018 jarosova et al 2014 van der oost et al 2017 the exceeded eeq value of the textile effluent indicates a potential risk of endocrine disruptive activity for the receiving environments which emphasizes the importance of endocrine disruption to be included in textile wastewater risk assessment it is worth noting that although the findings were obtained based on the survey of textile wwtps in china the relevant estrogenic toxicity is more than just a local issue but is rather more of a global problem as npeos have been widely used in the world especially in developing countries acir and guenther 2018 for example high concentrations of npeos have been detected in textile wastewater or clothing items from different geographical locations such as vietnam serbia and hungary antal et al 2016 gonzalez et al 2008 ho and watanabe 2017 indicating potential prevalence of endocrine disruption risk from discharge of npeos containing wastewater on a global scale to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the elevation of estrogenicity of textile wastewater by biological treatment processes biological treatment has been well known as a cost effective method to treat textile wastewater for not only being efficient in removing the chemical contaminants but also adequate in reducing the biological acute toxicity amaral et al 2014 ceretta et al 2018 sarayu and sandhya 2012 however the present study revealed significantly higher estrogenicity of the textile effluent after biological treatments when compared to the raw textile wastewater it is known that changes in wastewater toxicity are in sync with the degradation or transformation of the toxicants present in the wastewater previous studies have demonstrated potential links between the reduction of acute toxicity of textile wastewater and the degradation of azo dyes during biological treatments solis et al 2012 in the present study the relative accumulation of np2eo np1eo and np in contrast to the biodegradation of npeos is consistent with the increase of estrogenicity of textile wastewater as evidenced by the significant positive correlation between the beqchem of these estrogenic active compounds and the beqbio in both real and synthetic textile wastewater suggesting a potential relationship between the biodegradation of npeos and the estrogenicity change of textile wastewater during biological treatments mixture toxicity modeling and effect directed analysis using the beq approach has been extensively used to determine the fraction of the observed effects that can be explained by detected chemicals neale et al 2015 pochiraju et al 2020 specifically for the receptor mediated effects e g activation of the er studies have demonstrated that typically only a few highly bioactive molecules can explain a high proportion of the mixture effect observed by the cocktail of chemicals in a water sample escher et al 2018 hashmi et al 2018 neale et al 2017 using the beq approach we found that np2eo np1eo and np present in the textile wastewater explained nearly 80 of the estrogenicity of the wastewater due to a much higher estrogenic potency of np when compared to np1eo and np2eo np alone contributes more than 70 of the observed effect indicating that np serves as a dominant toxicant for inducing the estrogenicity of textile wastewater although studies have shown that short chain nonylphenol ethoxycarboxylates npecs which are also estrogenic active can be formed during npeos biodegradation they are much less estrogenically potent than np and present at lower concentration in comparison to the short chain npeos especially in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems zhou et al 2015 interestingly the beqchem of several wastewater samples were found to be higher than their corresponding beqbio the reason may be the presence of some antiestrogen compounds in the textile wastewater which leads to a less potent beqbio when compared to the beqchem similar results have also been reported in other samples of chemical mixtures including municipal wastewater and surface water conley et al 2017a it is known that npeos are subject to microbial biodegradation under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions gao et al 2014 lu et al 2008 and a lower rate of benzene ring cleavage than that found in ethoxy dropping would result in the relative accumulation of np lu et al 2008 this agrees with the results of the present study that the np concentrations and estrogenicity of both the real and synthetic textile wastewater increased after either anaerobic or aerobic biodegradation however if given enough time the accumulation of np would eventually come to an end when the estrogenicity reaches its summit then it would start to decline lu et al 2008 this is confirmed by the lab scale bioreactor simulation indicating that the effluent estrogenicity in r2 was lower than its counterpart in r1 these results indicate that the increase of wastewater estrogenicity in biological treatment systems follows an n shape curve in respond to increasing hrt therefore to reduce the effluent estrogenicity by extending hrt one should make sure that the extended hrt is longer than the time required for the estrogenicity to reach the summit the fact that the effluent estrogenicity in r2 was lower than that in r1 indicates that the summit time is shorter than 24 h the present study also shows that extending hrt of the a o treatment process may result in a narrowed estrogenicity difference between ea and se and even lower estrogenicity in se when compared to ea these findings are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating beneficial effects of extending hrt on the biodegradation of estrogenic micropollutants such as np estrogens and bisphenol a petrie et al 2014 boonnorat et al 2019 additionally it has been shown that ammonia oxidizing bacteria in wwtps contributes to the removal of estrogenic micropollutants via co metabolism biodegradation forrez et al 2009 sun et al 2012 which provides research outlooks on simultaneous nitrification and estrogenicity reduction for textile wastewater treatment notably the mass balance analysis revealed that more than 97 of the parent npeos were degraded into np and then transformed into non estrogenic products in conventional biological treatment systems and the estrogenicity inducing np were at trace concentrations to achieve effective estrogenicity reduction with no need to extend hrt some scientists have suggested acclimatized sludge bioaugmentation as an effective method for organic pollutant biodegradation especially for micropollutants with low concentrations boonnorat et al 2018 2019 alternatively tertiary treatments assembled with absorption or advanced oxidation with particular functions on removing micropollutants especially np are recommended for example mineral commercial activated carbons and photo fenton oxidation have proven effective in removing np in wastewater balabanic et al 2012 del bubba et al 2019 5 conclusions this study characterized the changes of estrogenicity of textile wastewater in biological treatment systems and their links with the biodegradation of npeos biological treatment is effective in removal of chemical pollutants however they can also increase the estrogenicity of textile wastewater increasing the risk of endocrine disruptive activity for the receiving waters the estrogenicity enhancement is primarily attributed to the formation of npeos biodegradation intermediates in which np accumulation plays a major role extending hrt of biological treatment processes to exceed the summit time is conducive to reducing estrogenicity as it allows for a relatively complete degradation of the estrogenic intermediates specifically np in textile wastewater

17664,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have long been recognized as point sources of n2o a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting agent multiple mechanisms both biotic and abiotic have been suggested to be responsible for n2o production from wwtps with basis on extrapolation from laboratory results and statistical analyses of metadata collected from operational full scale plants in this study random forest rf analysis a machine learning approach for feature selection from highly multivariate datasets was adopted to investigate n2o production mechanism in activated sludge tanks of wwtps from a novel perspective standardized measurements of n2o effluxes coupled with exhaustive metadata collection were performed at activated sludge tanks of three biological nitrogen removal wwtps at different times of the year the multivariate datasets were used as inputs for rf analyses computation of the permutation variable importance measures returned biomass normalized dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dic vss 1 and specific ammonia oxidation activity souraob as the most influential parameters determining n2o emissions from the aerated zones or phases of activated sludge bioreactors for the anoxic tanks dissolved organic carbon to no2 no3 ratio doc no2 n no3 n 1 was singled out as the most influential these data analysis results clearly indicate disparate mechanisms for n2o generation in the oxic and anoxic activated sludge bioreactors and provide evidences against significant contributions of n2o carryover across different zones or phases or niche specific microbial reactions with aerobic nh3 nh4 oxidation to no2 and anoxic denitrification predominantly responsible from aerated and anoxic zones or phases of activated sludge bioreactors respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment plants biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification random forest 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o has recently attracted immense scientific interest amid the escalating concern for global warming and climate change the global contribution of n2o to the net greenhouse gas emissions is relatively minor 6 in terms of co2eq as compared to those of co2 76 and ch4 16 developing strategies for mitigating n2o emissions is nevertheless crucial for curbing climate change given its high global warming potential 300 times greater than that of co2 in a 100 year scale ipcc 2014 the contribution of the wastewater treatment sector to the net anthropogenic n2o emissions used to be regarded insignificant at 3 5 with the recent upward adjustment of the emission factor from 0 00035 to 0 016 kg n2o n kg tn load however wwtps would now be one of the most potent n2o sources ipcc et al 2014 2019 further a steady increase in water usage is projected in the foreseeable future which would lead to further growth in global n2o emissions from the wastewater treatment sector flörke et al 2013 recently wwtps are increasingly viewed as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs lam et al 2020 coping with n2o emissions would undoubtedly be crucial for the transition of current wwtps to carbon neutral wrrfs as n2o is often considered as the largest contributor to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from wwtps vasilaki et al 2019 despite decades of investigation the n2o producing mechanisms in biological nitrogen removal bnr wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not yet fully understood in the conventional bnr systems where nh4 n is removed via nitrification nh3 nh4 to no3 oxidation via no2 and denitrification no3 to n2 reduction via no2 no and n2o 90 of n2o production originates from bioreactors where these n dissimilation reactions take place kampschreur et al 2009 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are the microbial guilds deemed majorly responsible for n2o production from nitrification and denitrification respectively kampschreur et al 2009 several hypotheses regarding conditions leading to increased n2o production from these microbial guilds have been suggested based on in vitro observations high ph low dissolved oxygen do concentration high nh4 and no2 concentrations and dissolved inorganic carbon dic excess or deficiency have been suggested to increase n2o formation from ammonia oxidation and low c n or cod n ratio low ph o2 intrusion and high no2 concentration have been hypothesized to increase n2o release from incomplete denitrification itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2012 peng et al 2014 peng et al 2015a b wunderlin et al 2012 whether n2o emissions from bnr bioreactors are actually affected by these conditions however has not been sufficiently supported with datasets collected from full scale operational wwtps kosonen et al 2016 rodríguez caballero et al 2015 over decades several researchers have attempted to statistically identify the effecters with greatest influence on n2o emissions from as bioreactors aboobakar et al 2013 ahn et al 2010 vasilaki et al 2018 considering the practical difficulty of n2o flux measurements in situ and the large numbers of parameters characterizing the as operations in wwtps limited sample size n and high dimensionality were the defining characters of the datasets used as inputs for these statistical analyses the multiple regression approach and feature extraction approach taken in these previous analyses may not have been the optimal methodological approaches given the circumstances multiple regression fitting too many effecters to a single outcome may often result in noisy and even arbitrary interpretations due mainly to the curse of dimensionality especially when the number of features far exceeds the sample size hastie et al 2005 krzywinski and altman 2015 expansion of the datasets by compiling previously published n2o emissions data can easily be considered an option as the solution to this dilemma although no shortage of on site n2o emission monitoring campaigns have been conducted at pilot and full scale wwtps across the globe inconsistent monitoring strategies have been adopted for these campaigns ahn et al 2010 daelman et al 2015 kampschreur et al 2009 kosonen et al 2016 the environmental protection agency epa certified standard method for n2o flux measurement has been established only as late as 2011 chandran 2011 even after its stipulation n2o emission data have continued to be collected with nonuniform methodologies that have not been cross validated ni et al 2013 vieira et al 2019 further the categories of metadata collected with the n2o flux measurements are often inconsistent across these previous studies ahn et al 2010 vasilaki et al 2018 due to these reasons amassing of existing datasets from the literature would not be the cure for curse of dimensionality principle component analysis pca using a feature extraction approach has been adopted as an alternative statistical method to circumvent the high dimensionality dilemma by reducing the dimensions of the original features the loss of intrinsic semantics of original features and susceptibility to misapplication often leading to potential misinterpretation of the outputs however can be problematic with this approach lever et al 2017 tang et al 2014 in this study random forest rf analysis was applied to associate the n2o emissions data to the wwtp metadata to approach the endeavor from a novel perspective this statistical method takes an embedded feature selection approach that has proven effective in analyzing datasets with limited number of data points and high dimensionality without sacrificing information embedded in the original features breiman 2001 tang et al 2014 random forest has proven effective in exploratory data analyses as 1 removal of irrelevant and or redundant features allows for improved comprehensibility 2 no assumption regarding the quality of data e g normality and linearity needs to be satisfied and 3 it is less sensitive to tampering of the hyperparameters and thus resistant to intentional or unintentional overfitting breiman 2001 statnikov et al 2008 vincenzi et al 2011 further rf analysis is especially convenient in narrowing down features according to their relative influences to the outcome as rf returns variable importance measures vim for each input feature gregorutti et al 2017 random forest analysis has been implemented in diverse disciplines of science including for example clinical sciences where genes most relevant to certain clinical outcomes were selected for more efficient analyses of microarray data and ecological sciences where environmental parameters associated with certain ecological phenomena were ranked according to their relative importance díaz uriarte and alvarez de andrés 2006 hollister et al 2016 vincenzi et al 2011 the datasets as inputs for the rf analyses were collected using uniform standardized methods from as tanks at three full scale wwtps with different configurations and operating conditions over a 10 month period from april 2018 to january 2019 the collected datasets were then utilized to compute the variable importance

treatment plants the monitoring campaign was carried out at three wwtps located near gwangju south korea over a 10 month span from april 2018 to january 2019 the names and the exact locations of the wwtps will not be disclosed due to confidentiality issues and the wwtps will be referred to as plants a b and c instead fig 1 table 1 the plant a is a conventional 8 train a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic wwtp with the return activated sludge ras rate of 1 300 m3 h 1 train 1 only one of the eight trains was monitored in the campaign the plant b is an ao anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor mbr that utilizes

denitrification takes place during the fill step removing no3 generated from nitrification of nh4 in the oxic steps the aeration and sedimentation steps of the preceding cycle no organic carbon supplement is added at any of the three wwtps detailed operating parameters of the three wwtps are presented in table 1 2 2 measurement of n2o emissions from the wwtps the n2o fluxes from the as bioreactors were measured using a floating flux chamber constructed according to the specification in the us epa guideline chandran 2011 the main body of the flux chamber was constructed with aluminum and glued to a rubber tire for flotation the schematic diagram presented in fig s1 one of the five gas ports fitted on the aluminum dome was connected via pfa teflon tubing to a teledyne t320e infrared gas analyzer san diego ca for on line measurement of n2o in effluent gas a gas port was used for streaming the tracer gas 10 v v he in n2 all gases were supplied by daeduk gas co daejeon korea through the chamber and another port for supply of carrier gas 99 999 n2 to meet the minimum flowrate for the gas analyzer when measuring n2o flux from quiescent bioreactors before each measurement two point calibration was performed using 99 999 n2 gas and n2 gas carrying 100 ppmv n2o the floating flux chamber was positioned at the geometric center of each bioreactor zone where the measured n2o flux would best represent the average flux from the zone chandran 2011 tracer gas was passed through the chamber at a flowrate of 1 l min 1 and the he concentration in the effluent gas was measured with a hp 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and porapak q column agilent technologies palo alto ca for n2o flux measurements at the aerated zones or phases of as bioreactors n2o and he concentrations in the off gases exiting through the flux chamber were measured without aid of external carrier gas for measurements of n2o flux from quiescent tanks high purity n2 sweep gas was blown into the headspace of the flux chamber at a constant flowrate of 5 l min 1 and the n2o and he concentrations in the effluent sweep gas were measured for the plants a and b the n2o flux was monitored for 30 min at each zone with different aeration regime the gas flowrates from the chambers placed on the aerated and quiescent zones or phases were calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively chandran 2011 1 q e q t r a c e r c h e t r a c e r c h e f c c h e f c 2 q e q t r a c e r c h e t r a c e r c h e f c c h e f c q s w e e p where q e is the flowrate

from the chamber was recorded every minute and the average of the concentrations was taken as the representative value as the plant c is an sbr with the n2o emission profile changing over time within each step a slightly different approach was taken for n2o flux measurement at the aeration and sedimentation steps the n2o concentration in the chamber effluent was monitored over the entire step e g for the entire hour of the aeration step and the concentrations were averaged for calculation of the representative n2o flux value due to technical difficulty n2o monitoring was not possible during the fill and draw steps the on line n2o measurements were intermittently cross checked with the n2o concentrations measured with hp6890 series gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector agilent palo alto ca usa the n2o flux was calculated using equation 3 3 j n 2 o q e c n 2 o a c where j n2o is the n2o flux m l 2 t 1 c n2o is the representative effluent n2o concentration m

souraob was measured using a batch respirometric assay as an estimate of the nh3 oxidation activity of an oxic as sample chandran and smets 2005 the culture medium contained per liter 500 mg khco3 27 2 mg kh2po4 300 mg mgso4 7h2o 180 mg cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml each of the trace element solutions i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 two sets of triplicate reaction vessels were prepared per sample with 30

souraob nob het value i e the sum of sours owing to respiration of aob nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophs the other set of triplicate vessels amended with 5 mg no2 l 1 was used to estimate the sournob het value the vessels were vigorously bubbled with compressed air prior to addition of the as biomass the assays were performed on site with the as samples collected during the n2o flux measurements at the aerated zones or phases the pellets collected from centrifugation of 30 ml samples were washed with 2 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 and resuspended in 2 ml buffer solution a 0 5 ml aliquot of the suspension was added to each of the triplicate respirometry chambers carrying aerated medium the decrease in the do dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored with a microrespiration system equipped with an ox mr microelectrode unisense for computation of the sour value the maximum observed linear oxygen consumption rate within the first 30 min of incubation was normalized with the biomass calculated from the volatile suspended solids vss concentration the souraob value was obtained by subtracting sournob het from souraob nob het no oxygen consumption was observed in the abiotic controls prepared identically but incubated without addition of as biomass all measurements were performed in triplicates and the average values were taken for further analysis the standard deviations of the souraob values were calculated with the propagation of error method 2 4 physico chemical characterization of collected wastewater samples the water temperature ph and do concentration of as were measured with an orion star a329 portable multiparameter meter thermo scientific waltham ma immediately before each n2o flux measurement simultaneously as samples were collected and 100 ml subsamples were passed through 0 2 μm filters advantec inc tokyo japan the filtrates were stored at 20 c until further analyses the total dissolved carbon tdc total dissolved

2 h incineration at 550 c from the initial suspended solid mass apha 2017 the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were measured using a 930 compact ic flex ion chromatograph metrohm herisau switzerland equipped with a metrosep a supp 5 anion exchange column and a metrosep c4 cation exchange column all measurements were performed in duplicates and their averages were used for further analyses 2 5 feature selection with random forest analysis the random forest rf method was used for feature selection from the collected datasets the rf algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm in which the final prediction is reached from the majority voting of the decisions made with multiple decision trees constructed with randomly permuted features and observations via recursive partitioning breiman 2001 the data collected from the wwtp monitoring campaigns tables s2 s4 were subdivided into in bag samples utilized as training sets 15 and 10 samples for aerated and anoxic as respectively for growing the random forest and out of bag oob samples as test sets for evaluating the prediction performance 5 and 3 samples for aerated and anoxic as respectively the random permutations of the in bag observations and features were used to grow the forest creating multiple decision trees with weakened intrinsic association between the observations and the features in the original dataset the nodes of each individual tree were hierarchically structured to minimize the gini impurity i e maximize the information gain at each bifurcation equation 4 breiman 2001 4 i g 1 f 1 2 f 2 2 where i g is the gini index for a binary split and f i is the proportion of the samples classified as the ith group at the node individual features were ranked according to their variable importance measures vim strobl et al 2007 the vim value of each feature was computed following its permutation in each of the trees in the random forest equation 5 janitza et al 2013 5 v i m x j 1 n t r e e t 1 n t r e e e t x j e t where vim x j is the variable importance measure of the feature x j n tree is the number of trees in the forest e t and e t x j are the misclassification rates of the tree t before and after permuting x j respectively as tested with the oob bag samples the rf classification was performed using the randomforest function of the randomforest package in rstudio v 1 2 5 liaw and wiener 2012 for binary classification the response variable n2o flux was discretized to categorical attributes with the threshold set to the median value 303 and 163 mg n2o n m 2d 1 for aerated and anoxic zones or phases respectively such that the outcome of the rf prediction can be classified as either high or low n2o emission the variables for construction of individual trees were randomly selected by bootstrapping with replacement the hyperparameters were set as follows ntree 500 mtry default the square root of the number of variables metric accuracy and importance true the classification performance was evaluated with the accuracy equation 6 sensitivity equation 7 and specificity equation 8 presented in a confusion matrix powers 2011 the vim values were computed using

homoscedasticity all statistical tests were performed using non parametric statistical tests statistical significances of pairwise comparisons were determined with the mann whitney test fay and proschan 2010 the kruskal wallis test was used when three measurements were compared kruskal and wallis 1952 bivariate associations between the as parameters were evaluated using tie corrected spearman tests dodge 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term monitoring of bnr wwtp performances and n2o emissions twenty sets of data including the operating parameters as characteristics and n2o flux records were collected from the three wwtps during the monitoring period tables s1 s4 the dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn removal performances were inconsistent with the removal efficiencies ranging between 7 8 57 9 and 17 0 95 5 respectively as with the removal efficiencies many of the operating parameters and as characteristics critical for proper functioning of the bnr systems exhibited large temporal fluctuations as well as variations across the wwtps the do doc dic tn nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in all examined as bioreactors exhibited temporal fluctuations amounting to percent relative ranges larger than 150 over the ten month span of the monitoring campaign the only parameter with statistically significant difference across the wwtps was the vss concentration activated sludge sampled from the aerated zone of plant b had significantly higher p 0 00 vss concentration 7050 1320 mg vss l 1 than aerated as from the plants a 1660 250 mg vss l 1 and c 2110 216 mg vss l 1 the anoxic zone of the plant b 3020 1010 mg vss l 1 also had significantly higher vss concentrations p 0 03 than the anoxic zone of the plant a 1260 500 mg vss l 1 the prolonged monitoring period enabled incorporation of temperature as an independent variable in the statistical analyses as the water temperature varied between 15 and 30 c at the wwtps during the period the n2o flux data were collected from the as bioreactors of the bnr systems fig 2 the three bnr systems exhibited substantially different n2o emission profiles at the full scale a2o plant plant a significantly larger n2o fluxes were measured at the aerated zone than at the anoxic zone on all eight occasions indicating that aerobic nitrification was majorly responsible for n2o emissions contrastingly the n2o flux was significantly higher at the anoxic zone than the aerated zone on three out of five occasions at the plant b suggesting that contribution of denitrification to n2o emissions was substantial at this mbr plant the effect of temperature was ambivalent from the n2o emissions data more intensified n2o emission was recorded in the warmer months august to october than in the colder months april and november to january at the plant a contrastingly the largest measure of n2o emissions were recorded in winter december at the plant c no clear seasonal distinction was observed at the plant b where the water temperature of the underground bioreactors was less affected by the outdoor air temperature although statistical comparisons across the wwtps do not tell much due to the large standard deviations both the maximum and the median values for the n2o fluxes from both oxic and anoxic as bioreactors were substantially higher at the plant a than at the plants b and c previously the larger n2o emission figures often observed from the aerated as were attributed to carryover of dissolved n2o produced from the anoxic counterpart as well as n2o production from nitrification sun et al 2013 toyoda et al 2010 the n2o flux measurements taken at the plant b in the months of september and october suggested such carryover of n2o was not likely the n2o fluxes measured at the anoxic zone were substantial 98 5 15 1 mg n2o n m 2 d 1 and 701 5 140 2 mg n2o n m 2d 1 in september and october respectively during this period indicating n2o production in the anoxic as the near absence of n2o flux from the aerated tank at the same time points suggested that n2o carryover from the anoxic zone was not a substantial contributor to n2o emissions from the aerobic zone the inconsistent ratio of n2o flux from the anoxic tank to that from the aerated tank at plant a 0 0 86 also suggested insignificance of n2o carryover from the anoxic zones to the aerated zones 3 2 random forest analyses and identification of key variables affecting n2o emission from oxic and anoxic tanks random forest analyses were implemented to rank the nineteen variables listed in table s5 in accordance to their impacts on n2o emissions from the oxic and anoxic as of the bnr wwtps fig 3 the first round of rf analysis with the dataset obtained from the aerated as screened out ten redundant variables with negative vim values temperature ph do doc nh4 n no2 n do vss 1 tn vss 1 no2 n vss 1 and no3 n vss 1 the second round of rf analysis using the remaining nine variables identified dic vss 1 and souraob as the most influential variables the rf analysis with the dataset obtained from the anoxic as identified doc no2 n no3 n 1 as the most influential parameters affecting n2o emissions out of the four variables with positive vim values in the first round of rf analysis the rf classification performance was evaluated by constructing a 2 2 confusion matrix and computing the evaluation metrics table s6 the accuracy sensitivity and specificity values were 0 70 0 75 and 0 67 respectively for dichotomous categorization of the aerate as datasets to high or low n2o emissions for anoxic as datasets the same calculations returned 0 77 0 80 and 0 75 respectively these metrics supported that the rf classifications were reliable given the limited data size and the temporally and spatially heterogeneous nature of the wwtps which allowed for only limited accuracy in the measurements the variables identified with high vim all significantly correlated with the n2o fluxes from the respective zones or phases of as bioreactors table s7 the n2o fluxes from the aerated as were significantly associated with the dic vss 1 r 0 49 p 0 03 and souraob r 0 47 p 0 03 similarly the doc no2 n no3 n 1 values were significantly associated with n2o fluxes r 0 62 p 0 02 from the anoxic as 3 3 analyses of the key variables the two parameters identified as the most influential determinants of n2o emissions from the aerated as bioreactors dic vss 1 and souraob were significantly correlated r 0 50 p 0 03 suggesting that dic availability has significant positive impacts on nh3 oxidation activity and n2o production thereof table s7 only a few studies have examined the relationship between dic availability and n2o production from nitrifying isolates or consortia and the results of these studies were largely contradictory jiang et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 peng et al 2015b jiang et al 2015 and mellbye et al 2016 reported increased n2o emissions at dic limiting conditions in axenic nitrosomonas europaea cultures the response of a complex nitrifying culture enriched from as to varied dic supply as reported by peng et al 2015b was contradictory to these pure culture results in that a positive linear correlation was observed between dic concentration and n2o emissions within the range of dic concentration between 4 8 and 56 mg c l 1 the observations in the current study generally agrees with the latter as the positive correlation between dic availability and n2o flux could be best explained with elevated n2o producing aob activity at high dic availability the range of dic concentrations in the aerated as 12 2 49 6 mg c l 1 was sufficiently high not to cause carbon limitation to aob as the estimate of inorganic carbon needed for aob growth per 1 mg nh4 l 1 is 77 μg c l 1 van loosdrecht et al 2016 nevertheless mechanistic or physiological explanation of the observed correlations is not possible at current stage due to the lack of information regarding the effect of excess dic on aob physiology previously nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification occurring upon oxygen deficiency had been regarded as the major mechanisms of n2o emissions from the aerated as kampschreur et al 2009 tallec et al 2006 that souraob was selected as one of the variables most influential to n2o flux from the aerated as and do concentration was an insignificant parameter suggested that the majority of n2o produced from the aerated as bioreactors originated from biological nh3 oxidation at oxygen replete condition on the contrary to the previous perception the aerated as bioreactors were generally maintained at high do concentrations the average of 4 3 2 2 mg l 1 over all 20 measurements taken at the three facilities and do concentrations below 2 0 mg l 1 were only recorded twice april and august at the aerated zone of the plant b mbr neither heterotrophic denitrification nor nitrifier denitrification activity was likely to be substantial at such well oxygenated conditions tallec et al 2006 thus the major n2o production mechanism from the aerated as reactors was presumably aerobic n2o production by aob although moderate in quantity as compared to nitrifier denitrification at oxygen limited condition aob has been known to produce n2o as a byproduct of nh3 oxidation in oxygen replete conditions jiang and bakken 1999 several recent studies have suggested involvement of hydroxylamine nh2oh the reactive intermediate of nh3 oxidation to no2 in the oxidative n2o production by aob liu et al 2017 song et al 2020 abiotic oxidation and n nitrosation as well as incomplete oxidation of nh2oh by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase with nitric oxide no as the intermediate have been suggested as the mechanisms of aerobic production of n2o as a byproduct of nh3 oxidation liu et al 2017 terada et al 2017 n2o emitted from the aerated as appears to have originated from these aerobic reactions previously regarded as minor n2o sources from nitrification the parameter with the largest impact to n2o flux from the anoxic as bioreactors of the plant a and b according to the rf analysis was doc no2 n no3 n 1 the high vim value of the parameter and its significant negative spearman s rank correlation table s7 r 0 62 p 0 02 with the n2o flux both supported that heterotrophic denitrification was likely the major n2o producing mechanism in the anoxic as denitrification is carried out in multiple steps and due to its modular nature each step may be carried out by different guilds of organisms in a complex microbial consortia such as as graf et al 2014 in the environments with low electron donor availability as signified by the low values of doc no2 n no3 n 1 or more conventional c n or cod n ratio limited electrons may be unevenly distributed to the different steps of denitrification pan et al 2013 the intensified competition for limited electrons may result in increased n2o production if electron donors are preferably consumed by the organismal groups responsible for the steps of denitrification upstream of n2o experimental results both supporting and contradicting this hypothesis have been reported over past few decades itokawa et al 2001 kishida et al 2004 lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2013 the more recent reports generally dispute against the significance of electron donor limitation to n2o emissions with basis on the batch kinetics of denitrifying as consortia provided with a single organic electron donor for interpretation of the current result however dated results from less controlled reactor experiments in which cod n ratios turned out to be critical determinants of n2o emissions appear to be more applicable due to the following reasons 1 neither plant a nor b use organic supplements for nitrogen removal enhancement therefore the source of labile organic electron donor presumably a small fraction of doc is of complex makeup different groups of denitrifiers favor different organic compounds as the sources of electrons and thus the kinetics of the denitrification steps in as with complex organics may substantially differ from those observed with single organic species e g methanol lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2013 2 the dissolved n2o concentrations used in the batch kinetic assays for determination of n2o reduction rates were orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations observed in anoxic zones of as bioreactors pan et al 2013 wunderlin et al 2012 as n2o reduction follows michaelis menten kinetics the n2o reduction rates expected in situ may be much lower than the linear n2o reduction rates observed in the kinetic assays yoon et al 2016 4 conclusion simultaneous monitoring of as properties wwtp performance and n2o flux at a full scale wwtp is an onerous and time consuming endeavor unless an automated monitoring system is already installed at the study site the quantity of data obtainable from in situ monitoring would be always limited as relative to the number of manifold potential effecters not many researchers are aided with such luxury as also was the case in this study in which only 13 20 datasets were in hand for statistical analyses of the association between as parameters and n2o fluxes although several successful cases of fitting bench scale reactor data or short term several days at the longest to modified activated sludge models asm have previously been reported the irregularity and sheer magnitudes of fluctuations in the n2o flux data collected in this study obviously indicated impossibility of developing a universal mathematical model estimating the n2o emissions from full scale as bioreactors at different oxygen regimes ni et al 2013 spérandio et al 2016 the approach taken here instead the machine learning based rf analysis allowed for reliable binary categorization of aerated and anoxic as conditions to high or low n2o emitting conditions besides the wwtp parameters identified as the most influential effecters supported that the overarching microbial metabolism responsible for n2o emissions from oxic and anoxic as are nh3 oxidation and denitrification respectively declaration

17664,wastewater treatment plants wwtps have long been recognized as point sources of n2o a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting agent multiple mechanisms both biotic and abiotic have been suggested to be responsible for n2o production from wwtps with basis on extrapolation from laboratory results and statistical analyses of metadata collected from operational full scale plants in this study random forest rf analysis a machine learning approach for feature selection from highly multivariate datasets was adopted to investigate n2o production mechanism in activated sludge tanks of wwtps from a novel perspective standardized measurements of n2o effluxes coupled with exhaustive metadata collection were performed at activated sludge tanks of three biological nitrogen removal wwtps at different times of the year the multivariate datasets were used as inputs for rf analyses computation of the permutation variable importance measures returned biomass normalized dissolved inorganic carbon concentration dic vss 1 and specific ammonia oxidation activity souraob as the most influential parameters determining n2o emissions from the aerated zones or phases of activated sludge bioreactors for the anoxic tanks dissolved organic carbon to no2 no3 ratio doc no2 n no3 n 1 was singled out as the most influential these data analysis results clearly indicate disparate mechanisms for n2o generation in the oxic and anoxic activated sludge bioreactors and provide evidences against significant contributions of n2o carryover across different zones or phases or niche specific microbial reactions with aerobic nh3 nh4 oxidation to no2 and anoxic denitrification predominantly responsible from aerated and anoxic zones or phases of activated sludge bioreactors respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrous oxide wastewater treatment plants biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification random forest 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o has recently attracted immense scientific interest amid the escalating concern for global warming and climate change the global contribution of n2o to the net greenhouse gas emissions is relatively minor 6 in terms of co2eq as compared to those of co2 76 and ch4 16 developing strategies for mitigating n2o emissions is nevertheless crucial for curbing climate change given its high global warming potential 300 times greater than that of co2 in a 100 year scale ipcc 2014 the contribution of the wastewater treatment sector to the net anthropogenic n2o emissions used to be regarded insignificant at 3 5 with the recent upward adjustment of the emission factor from 0 00035 to 0 016 kg n2o n kg tn load however wwtps would now be one of the most potent n2o sources ipcc et al 2014 2019 further a steady increase in water usage is projected in the foreseeable future which would lead to further growth in global n2o emissions from the wastewater treatment sector flörke et al 2013 recently wwtps are increasingly viewed as water resource recovery facilities wrrfs lam et al 2020 coping with n2o emissions would undoubtedly be crucial for the transition of current wwtps to carbon neutral wrrfs as n2o is often considered as the largest contributor to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from wwtps vasilaki et al 2019 despite decades of investigation the n2o producing mechanisms in biological nitrogen removal bnr wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not yet fully understood in the conventional bnr systems where nh4 n is removed via nitrification nh3 nh4 to no3 oxidation via no2 and denitrification no3 to n2 reduction via no2 no and n2o 90 of n2o production originates from bioreactors where these n dissimilation reactions take place kampschreur et al 2009 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria are the microbial guilds deemed majorly responsible for n2o production from nitrification and denitrification respectively kampschreur et al 2009 several hypotheses regarding conditions leading to increased n2o production from these microbial guilds have been suggested based on in vitro observations high ph low dissolved oxygen do concentration high nh4 and no2 concentrations and dissolved inorganic carbon dic excess or deficiency have been suggested to increase n2o formation from ammonia oxidation and low c n or cod n ratio low ph o2 intrusion and high no2 concentration have been hypothesized to increase n2o release from incomplete denitrification itokawa et al 2001 pan et al 2012 peng et al 2014 peng et al 2015a b wunderlin et al 2012 whether n2o emissions from bnr bioreactors are actually affected by these conditions however has not been sufficiently supported with datasets collected from full scale operational wwtps kosonen et al 2016 rodríguez caballero et al 2015 over decades several researchers have attempted to statistically identify the effecters with greatest influence on n2o emissions from as bioreactors aboobakar et al 2013 ahn et al 2010 vasilaki et al 2018 considering the practical difficulty of n2o flux measurements in situ and the large numbers of parameters characterizing the as operations in wwtps limited sample size n and high dimensionality were the defining characters of the datasets used as inputs for these statistical analyses the multiple regression approach and feature extraction approach taken in these previous analyses may not have been the optimal methodological approaches given the circumstances multiple regression fitting too many effecters to a single outcome may often result in noisy and even arbitrary interpretations due mainly to the curse of dimensionality especially when the number of features far exceeds the sample size hastie et al 2005 krzywinski and altman 2015 expansion of the datasets by compiling previously published n2o emissions data can easily be considered an option as the solution to this dilemma although no shortage of on site n2o emission monitoring campaigns have been conducted at pilot and full scale wwtps across the globe inconsistent monitoring strategies have been adopted for these campaigns ahn et al 2010 daelman et al 2015 kampschreur et al 2009 kosonen et al 2016 the environmental protection agency epa certified standard method for n2o flux measurement has been established only as late as 2011 chandran 2011 even after its stipulation n2o emission data have continued to be collected with nonuniform methodologies that have not been cross validated ni et al 2013 vieira et al 2019 further the categories of metadata collected with the n2o flux measurements are often inconsistent across these previous studies ahn et al 2010 vasilaki et al 2018 due to these reasons amassing of existing datasets from the literature would not be the cure for curse of dimensionality principle component analysis pca using a feature extraction approach has been adopted as an alternative statistical method to circumvent the high dimensionality dilemma by reducing the dimensions of the original features the loss of intrinsic semantics of original features and susceptibility to misapplication often leading to potential misinterpretation of the outputs however can be problematic with this approach lever et al 2017 tang et al 2014 in this study random forest rf analysis was applied to associate the n2o emissions data to the wwtp metadata to approach the endeavor from a novel perspective this statistical method takes an embedded feature selection approach that has proven effective in analyzing datasets with limited number of data points and high dimensionality without sacrificing information embedded in the original features breiman 2001 tang et al 2014 random forest has proven effective in exploratory data analyses as 1 removal of irrelevant and or redundant features allows for improved comprehensibility 2 no assumption regarding the quality of data e g normality and linearity needs to be satisfied and 3 it is less sensitive to tampering of the hyperparameters and thus resistant to intentional or unintentional overfitting breiman 2001 statnikov et al 2008 vincenzi et al 2011 further rf analysis is especially convenient in narrowing down features according to their relative influences to the outcome as rf returns variable importance measures vim for each input feature gregorutti et al 2017 random forest analysis has been implemented in diverse disciplines of science including for example clinical sciences where genes most relevant to certain clinical outcomes were selected for more efficient analyses of microarray data and ecological sciences where environmental parameters associated with certain ecological phenomena were ranked according to their relative importance díaz uriarte and alvarez de andrés 2006 hollister et al 2016 vincenzi et al 2011 the datasets as inputs for the rf analyses were collected using uniform standardized methods from as tanks at three full scale wwtps with different configurations and operating conditions over a 10 month period from april 2018 to january 2019 the collected datasets were then utilized to compute the variable importance

treatment plants the monitoring campaign was carried out at three wwtps located near gwangju south korea over a 10 month span from april 2018 to january 2019 the names and the exact locations of the wwtps will not be disclosed due to confidentiality issues and the wwtps will be referred to as plants a b and c instead fig 1 table 1 the plant a is a conventional 8 train a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic

supplement is added at any of the three wwtps detailed operating parameters of the three wwtps are presented in table 1 2 2 measurement of n2o emissions from the wwtps the n2o fluxes from the as bioreactors were measured using a floating flux chamber constructed according to the specification in the us epa guideline chandran 2011 the main body of the flux chamber was constructed with aluminum and glued to a rubber tire for flotation the schematic diagram presented in fig s1 one of the five gas ports fitted on the aluminum dome was connected via pfa teflon tubing to a teledyne t320e infrared gas analyzer san diego ca for on line measurement of n2o in effluent gas a gas port was used for streaming the tracer gas 10 v v he in n2 all gases were supplied by daeduk gas co daejeon korea through the chamber and another port for supply of carrier gas 99 999 n2 to meet the minimum flowrate for the gas analyzer when measuring n2o flux from quiescent bioreactors before each measurement two point calibration was performed using 99 999 n2 gas and n2 gas carrying 100 ppmv n2o the floating flux chamber was positioned at the geometric center of each bioreactor zone where the measured n2o flux would best represent the average flux from the zone chandran 2011 tracer gas was passed through the chamber at a flowrate of 1 l min 1 and the he concentration in the effluent gas was measured with a hp 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and porapak q column agilent technologies palo alto ca for n2o flux measurements at the aerated zones or phases of as bioreactors n2o and he concentrations in the off gases exiting through the flux chamber were measured without aid of external carrier gas for measurements of n2o flux from quiescent tanks high purity n2 sweep gas was blown into the headspace of the flux chamber at a constant flowrate of 5 l min 1 and the n2o and he concentrations in the effluent sweep gas were measured for the plants a and b the n2o flux was monitored for 30 min at each zone with different aeration regime the gas flowrates from the chambers placed on the aerated and quiescent zones or phases were calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively chandran 2011 1 q e q t r a c e r c h e t r a c e r c h e f c c h e f c 2 q e q t r a c e r c h e t r a c e r c h e f c c h e f c q s w e e p where q e is the flowrate

from the chamber was recorded every minute and the average of the concentrations was taken as the representative value as the plant c is an sbr with the n2o emission profile changing over time within each step a slightly different approach was taken for n2o flux measurement at the aeration and sedimentation steps the n2o concentration in the chamber effluent was monitored over the entire step e g for the entire hour of the aeration step and the concentrations were averaged for calculation of the representative n2o flux value due to technical difficulty n2o monitoring was not possible during the fill and draw steps the on line n2o measurements were intermittently cross checked with the n2o concentrations measured with hp6890 series gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector agilent palo alto ca usa the n2o flux was calculated using equation 3 3 j n 2 o q e c n 2 o a c where j n2o is the n2o flux m l 2 t 1 c n2o is the representative effluent n2o concentration m

souraob was measured using a batch respirometric assay as an estimate of the nh3 oxidation activity of an oxic as sample chandran and smets 2005 the culture medium contained per liter 500 mg khco3 27 2 mg kh2po4 300 mg mgso4 7h2o 180 mg cacl2 2h2o and 1 ml each of the trace element solutions i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 two sets of triplicate reaction vessels were prepared per sample with 30

souraob nob het value i e the sum of sours owing to respiration of aob nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophs the other set of triplicate vessels amended with 5 mg no2 l 1 was used to estimate the sournob het value the vessels were vigorously bubbled with compressed air prior to addition of the as biomass the assays were performed on site with the as samples collected during the n2o flux measurements at the aerated zones or phases the pellets collected from centrifugation of 30 ml samples were washed with 2 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 7 0 and resuspended in 2 ml buffer solution a 0 5 ml aliquot of the suspension was added to each of the triplicate respirometry chambers carrying aerated medium the decrease in the do dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored with a microrespiration system equipped with an ox mr microelectrode unisense for computation of the sour value the maximum observed linear oxygen consumption rate within the first 30 min of incubation was normalized with the biomass calculated from the volatile suspended solids vss concentration the souraob value was obtained by subtracting sournob het from souraob nob het no oxygen consumption was observed in the abiotic controls prepared identically but incubated without addition of as biomass all measurements were performed in triplicates and the average values were taken for further analysis the standard deviations of the souraob values were calculated with the propagation of error method 2 4 physico chemical characterization of collected wastewater samples the water temperature ph and do

switzerland equipped with a metrosep a supp 5 anion exchange column and a metrosep c4 cation exchange column all measurements were performed in duplicates and their averages were used for further analyses 2 5 feature selection with random forest analysis the random forest rf method was used for feature selection from the collected datasets the rf algorithm is an ensemble learning algorithm in which the final prediction is reached from the majority voting of the decisions made with multiple decision trees constructed with randomly permuted features and observations via recursive partitioning breiman 2001 the data collected from the wwtp monitoring campaigns tables s2 s4 were subdivided into in bag samples utilized as training sets 15 and 10 samples for aerated and anoxic as respectively for growing the random forest and out of bag oob samples as test sets for evaluating the prediction performance 5 and 3 samples for aerated and anoxic as respectively the random permutations of the in bag observations and features were used to grow the forest creating multiple decision trees with weakened intrinsic association between the observations and the features in the original dataset the nodes of each individual tree were hierarchically structured to minimize the gini impurity i e maximize the information gain at each bifurcation equation 4 breiman 2001 4 i g 1 f 1 2 f 2 2 where i g is the gini index for a binary split and f i is the proportion of the samples classified as the ith group at the node individual features were ranked according to their variable importance measures vim strobl et al 2007 the vim value of each feature was computed following its permutation in each of the trees in the random forest equation 5 janitza et al 2013 5 v i m x j 1 n t r e e t 1 n t r e e e t x j e t where vim x j is the variable importance measure of the feature x j n tree is the number of trees in the forest e t and e t x j are the misclassification rates of the tree t before and after permuting x j respectively as tested with the oob bag samples the rf classification was performed using the randomforest function of the randomforest package in rstudio v 1 2 5 liaw and wiener 2012 for binary classification the response variable n2o flux was discretized to categorical attributes with the threshold set to the median value 303 and 163 mg n2o n m 2d 1 for aerated and anoxic zones or phases respectively such that the outcome of the rf prediction can be classified as either high or low n2o emission the variables for construction of individual trees were randomly selected by bootstrapping with replacement the hyperparameters were set as follows ntree 500 mtry default the square root of the number of variables metric accuracy and importance true the classification performance was evaluated with the accuracy equation 6 sensitivity equation 7 and specificity equation 8 presented in a confusion matrix powers 2011 the vim values were computed using

proschan 2010 the kruskal wallis test was used when three measurements were compared kruskal and wallis 1952 bivariate associations between the as parameters were evaluated using tie corrected spearman tests dodge 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term monitoring of bnr wwtp performances and n2o emissions twenty sets of data including the operating parameters as characteristics and n2o flux records were collected from the three wwtps during the monitoring period tables s1 s4 the dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn removal performances were inconsistent with the removal efficiencies ranging between 7 8 57 9 and 17 0 95 5 respectively as with the removal efficiencies many of the operating parameters and as characteristics critical for proper functioning of the bnr systems exhibited large temporal fluctuations as well as variations across the wwtps the do doc dic tn nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in all examined as bioreactors exhibited temporal fluctuations amounting to percent relative ranges larger than 150 over the ten month span of the monitoring campaign the only parameter with statistically significant difference across the wwtps was the vss concentration activated sludge sampled from the aerated zone of plant b had significantly higher p 0 00 vss concentration 7050 1320 mg vss l 1 than aerated as from the plants a 1660 250 mg vss l 1 and c 2110 216 mg vss l 1 the anoxic zone of the plant b 3020 1010 mg vss l 1 also had significantly higher vss concentrations p 0 03 than the anoxic zone of the plant a 1260 500 mg vss l 1 the prolonged monitoring period enabled incorporation of temperature as an independent variable in the statistical analyses as the water temperature varied between 15 and 30 c at the wwtps during the period the n2o flux data were collected from the as bioreactors of the bnr systems fig 2 the three bnr systems exhibited substantially different n2o emission profiles at the full scale a2o plant plant a significantly larger n2o fluxes were measured at the aerated zone than at the anoxic zone on all eight occasions indicating that aerobic nitrification was majorly responsible for n2o emissions contrastingly the n2o flux was significantly higher at the anoxic zone than the aerated zone on three out of five occasions at the plant b suggesting that contribution of denitrification to n2o emissions was substantial at this mbr plant the effect of temperature was ambivalent from the n2o emissions data more intensified n2o emission was recorded in the warmer months august to october than in the colder months april and november to january at the plant a contrastingly the largest measure of n2o emissions were recorded in winter december at the plant c no clear seasonal distinction was observed at the plant b where the water temperature of the underground bioreactors was less affected by the outdoor air temperature although statistical comparisons across the wwtps do not tell much due to the large standard deviations both the maximum and the median values for the n2o fluxes from both oxic and anoxic as bioreactors were substantially higher at the plant a than at the plants b and c previously the larger n2o emission figures often observed from the aerated as were attributed to carryover of dissolved n2o produced from the anoxic counterpart as well as n2o production from nitrification sun et al 2013 toyoda et al 2010 the n2o flux measurements taken at the plant b in the months of september and october suggested such carryover of n2o was not likely the n2o fluxes measured at the anoxic zone were substantial 98 5 15 1 mg n2o n m 2 d 1 and 701 5 140 2 mg n2o n m 2d 1 in september and october respectively during this period indicating n2o production in the anoxic as the near absence of n2o flux from the aerated tank at the same time points suggested that n2o carryover from the anoxic zone was not a substantial contributor to n2o emissions from the aerobic zone the inconsistent ratio of n2o flux from the anoxic tank to that from the aerated tank at plant a 0 0 86 also suggested insignificance of n2o carryover from the anoxic zones to the aerated zones 3 2 random forest analyses and identification of key variables affecting n2o emission from oxic and anoxic tanks random forest analyses were implemented to rank the nineteen variables listed in table s5 in accordance to their impacts on n2o emissions from the oxic and anoxic as of the bnr wwtps fig 3 the first round of rf analysis with the dataset obtained from the aerated as screened out ten redundant variables with negative vim values temperature ph do doc nh4 n no2 n do vss 1 tn vss 1 no2 n vss 1 and no3 n vss 1 the second round of rf analysis using the remaining nine variables identified dic vss 1 and souraob as the most influential variables the rf analysis with the dataset obtained from the anoxic as identified doc no2 n no3 n 1 as the most influential parameters affecting n2o emissions out of the four variables with positive vim values in the first round of rf analysis the rf classification performance was evaluated by constructing a 2 2 confusion matrix and computing the evaluation metrics table s6 the accuracy sensitivity and specificity values were 0 70 0 75 and 0 67 respectively for dichotomous categorization of the aerate as datasets to high or low n2o emissions for anoxic as datasets the same calculations returned 0 77 0 80 and 0 75 respectively these metrics supported that the rf classifications were reliable given the limited data size and the temporally and spatially heterogeneous nature of the wwtps which allowed for only limited accuracy in the measurements the variables identified with high vim all significantly correlated with the n2o fluxes from the respective zones or phases of as bioreactors table s7 the n2o fluxes from the aerated as were significantly associated with the dic vss 1 r 0 49 p 0 03 and souraob r 0 47 p 0 03 similarly the doc no2 n no3 n 1 values were significantly associated with n2o fluxes r 0 62 p 0 02 from the anoxic as 3 3 analyses of the key variables the two parameters identified as the most influential determinants of n2o emissions from the aerated as bioreactors dic vss 1 and souraob were significantly correlated r 0 50 p 0 03 suggesting that dic availability has significant positive impacts on nh3 oxidation activity and n2o production thereof table s7 only a few studies have examined the relationship between dic availability and n2o production from nitrifying isolates or consortia and the results of these studies were largely contradictory jiang et al 2015 mellbye et al 2016 peng et al 2015b jiang et al 2015 and mellbye et al 2016 reported increased n2o emissions at dic limiting conditions in axenic nitrosomonas europaea cultures the response of a complex nitrifying culture enriched from as to varied dic supply as reported by peng et al 2015b was contradictory to these pure culture results in that a positive linear correlation was observed between dic concentration and n2o emissions within the range of dic concentration between 4 8 and 56 mg c l 1 the observations in the current study generally agrees with the latter as the positive correlation between dic availability and n2o flux could be best explained with elevated n2o producing aob activity at high dic availability the range of dic concentrations in the aerated as 12 2 49 6 mg c l 1 was sufficiently high not to cause carbon limitation to aob as the estimate of inorganic carbon needed for aob growth per 1 mg nh4 l 1 is 77 μg c l 1 van loosdrecht et al 2016 nevertheless mechanistic or physiological explanation of the observed correlations is not possible at current stage due to the lack of information regarding the effect of excess dic on aob physiology previously nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification occurring upon oxygen deficiency had been regarded as the major mechanisms of n2o emissions from the aerated as kampschreur et al 2009 tallec et al 2006 that souraob was selected as one of the variables most influential to n2o flux from the aerated as and do concentration was an insignificant parameter suggested that the majority of n2o produced from the aerated as bioreactors originated from biological nh3 oxidation at oxygen replete condition on the contrary to the previous perception the aerated as bioreactors were generally maintained at high do concentrations the average of 4 3 2 2 mg l 1 over all 20 measurements taken at the three facilities and do concentrations below 2 0 mg l 1 were only recorded twice april and august at the aerated zone of the plant b mbr neither heterotrophic denitrification nor nitrifier denitrification activity was likely to be substantial at such well oxygenated conditions tallec et al 2006 thus the major n2o production mechanism from the aerated as reactors was presumably aerobic n2o production by aob although moderate in quantity as compared to nitrifier denitrification at oxygen limited condition aob has been known to produce n2o as a byproduct of nh3 oxidation in oxygen replete conditions jiang and bakken 1999 several recent studies have suggested involvement of hydroxylamine nh2oh the reactive intermediate of nh3 oxidation to no2 in the oxidative n2o production by aob liu et al 2017 song et al 2020 abiotic oxidation and n nitrosation as well as incomplete oxidation of nh2oh by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase with nitric oxide no as the intermediate have been suggested as the mechanisms of aerobic production of n2o as a byproduct of nh3 oxidation liu et al 2017 terada et al 2017 n2o emitted from the aerated as appears to have originated from these aerobic reactions previously regarded as minor n2o sources from nitrification the parameter with the largest impact to n2o flux from the anoxic as bioreactors of the plant a and b according to the rf analysis was doc no2 n no3 n 1 the high vim value of the parameter and its significant negative spearman s rank correlation table s7 r 0 62 p 0 02 with the n2o flux both supported that heterotrophic denitrification was likely the major n2o producing mechanism in the anoxic as denitrification is carried out in multiple steps and due to its modular nature each step may be carried out by different guilds of organisms in a complex microbial consortia such as as graf et al 2014 in the environments with low electron donor availability as signified by the low values of doc no2 n no3 n 1 or more conventional c n or cod n ratio limited electrons may be unevenly distributed to the different steps of denitrification pan et al 2013 the intensified competition for limited electrons may result in increased n2o production if electron donors are preferably consumed by the organismal groups responsible for the steps of denitrification upstream of n2o experimental results both supporting and contradicting this hypothesis have been reported over past few decades itokawa et al 2001 kishida et al 2004 lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2013 the more recent reports generally dispute against the significance of electron donor limitation to n2o emissions with basis on the batch kinetics of denitrifying as consortia provided with a single organic electron donor for interpretation of the current result however dated results from less controlled reactor experiments in which cod n ratios turned out to be critical determinants of n2o emissions appear to be more applicable due to the following reasons 1 neither plant a nor b use organic supplements for nitrogen removal enhancement therefore the source of labile organic electron donor presumably a small fraction of doc is of complex makeup different groups of denitrifiers favor different organic compounds as the sources of electrons and thus the kinetics of the denitrification steps in as with complex organics may substantially differ from those observed with single organic species e g methanol lu and chandran 2010 pan et al 2013 2 the dissolved n2o concentrations used in the batch kinetic assays for determination of n2o reduction rates were orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations observed in anoxic zones of as bioreactors pan et al 2013 wunderlin et al 2012 as n2o reduction follows michaelis menten kinetics the n2o reduction rates expected in situ may be much lower than the linear n2o reduction rates observed in the kinetic assays yoon et al 2016 4 conclusion simultaneous monitoring of as properties wwtp performance and n2o flux at a full scale wwtp is an onerous and time consuming endeavor unless an automated monitoring system is already installed at the study site the quantity of data obtainable from in situ monitoring would be always limited as relative to the number of manifold potential effecters not many researchers are aided with such luxury as also was the case in this study in which only 13 20 datasets were in hand for statistical analyses of the association between as parameters and n2o fluxes although several successful cases of fitting bench scale reactor data or short term several days at the longest to modified activated sludge models asm have previously been reported the irregularity and sheer magnitudes of fluctuations in the n2o flux data collected in this study obviously indicated impossibility of developing a universal mathematical model estimating the n2o emissions from full scale as bioreactors at different oxygen regimes ni et al 2013 spérandio et al 2016 the approach taken here instead the machine learning based rf analysis allowed for reliable binary categorization of aerated and anoxic as conditions to high or low n2o emitting conditions besides the wwtp parameters identified as the most influential effecters supported that the overarching microbial metabolism responsible for n2o emissions from oxic and anoxic as are nh3 oxidation and denitrification respectively declaration
