12030,the depletion of groundwater resources threatens water security around the world and it is of prime concern minimization of the impact of unhealthy drinking water requires monitoring of contaminants and awareness to all stake holders the work is aimed at developing a water quality index wqi to assess and report water quality to policy makers and stake holders for comprehensive planning this new wqi method assigns individual weights to each sample point under consideration along with wholesome weights to account for the relative risk of each contaminant water quality is determined for pre and post monsoon seasons spatial distribution of water quality is used to estimate the probable impact on affected population a case study was carried out to validate the method for this purpose a total of 163 wells covering an area of 30 623 square km were sampled in a semi arid region in north india during pre and post monsoon seasons sixteen physico chemical parameters were measured and six parameters were deemed highly critical due to their coverage and associated health risk against the general belief a rise in the number of wells with permissible limits of chloride nitrite fluoride and tds is observed after the monsoon the wqi determined by the procedure indicates that only 47 and 59 of the local populace has access to groundwater of acceptable quality during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively keywords water quality groundwater management water security water quality index 1 introduction according to the world health organization 2017 access to safe drinking water is essential to health a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection it is also a pressing development issue at national regional and local levels depletion of non renewable groundwater and problems of water quality is a looming threat in many regions studies conclude that nearly 65 of the groundwater in the world is consumed domestically 20 employed for irrigation and 15 employed for industrial purposes adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 saeid et al 2018 water scarcity leads to over exploitation of groundwater which results in lowering of groundwater table mineral salts found in greater depths degrade the quality of groundwater the source of contaminants in groundwater sources depend largely on the land use soil type soil rock water interaction physico chemical quality presence of microbes and so on tirkey et al 2017 yousefi et al 2017 in many semi arid and arid regions across the world water quality is a more important limiting factor and not water quantity water quality is vital not only because of its impact on the availability of freshwater and human health but also because of its intrinsic value mccutcheon et al 1993 the depletion of groundwater resources threatens food and water security in india asoka et al 2017 found that between 2003 and 2013 groundwater storage has declined in northern india at the rate of 2 cm yr 1 the shekhawati region in northern india belongs to semi arid climatic zone and receives scanty rainfall spanning 30 623 square kilometers the 7 million residents of shekhawati are solely dependent on groundwater for their domestic and drinking needs with no feasible alternative this leads to overexploitation of groundwater which results in lowering of groundwater table and ultimately degrades the quality of water rising population growing urbanization and irrigated agriculture are among the other factors responsible for the poor quality of groundwater machiwal and jha 2014 according to thompson et al 2007 chemicals in water supplies can cause serious health problems including waterborne diseases whether the chemicals are naturally occurring or derive from sources of pollution in many parts of the world the long term consumption of hazardous naturally occurring chemicals such as arsenic and fluoride particularly through drinking groundwater is a major cause of chronic disease disablement and premature death in the shekhawati region several cases of birth defects and blue baby syndrome have been reported over the years other common health problems reported include dental and skeletal fluorosis osteoarthritis kidney stones and low fertility these health problems are attributed to the naturally occurring chemicals in the groundwater of the region water quality is often reported as a single dimensionless numeric score called the water quality index wqi water quality index is helpful to report large data volume of water quality as they are effective tool to minimize large amount of water quality data in a single numeric value that allows an easy understanding of the monitored data abbasi 2002 tirkey et al 2013 mangukiya et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2012 the use of an index translates the water quality monitoring data into a form that the public and policy makers can easily interpret and utilize house 1990 wqi combines large data about a variety of physico chemical parameters that have significant effects on safety for consumption yidana and yidana 2010 used water quality index wqi method to assess the suitability of groundwater for human consumption for effective planning and management of groundwater resources groundwater vulnerability assessment is most significant garewal et al 2017 thompson et al 2007 highlighted that identifying and prioritizing chemical risks presents a challenge especially in developing countries due to the lack of information on the presence of chemicals in water willis et al 2015 highlighted the contamination pathways and determinants of water quality and the associated public health risks and control measures the work describes the risk of water contamination by physico chemical and microbial contaminants from source to point of use delbari et al 2016 proved that the spatial correlation always exists between the samples and physico chemical analysis as in most studies the researchers focused on pollution caused by point sources and the statistical aspects of choosing the monitoring locations and sample sizes rajib et al 2016 lead to water quality improvement with reduction in surface runoff sediment nitrate and total phosphorus loadings this improvement in water quality is the reflection of the nature of land use conversion and associated activities which are characterized in this case by gain in low input agriculture with hay pasture area development ammonia is nitrified faster at higher temperatures via monod kinetics pirjo et al 2017 this indicates that even other compounds may change their kinetics in water at higher temperatures free ions that are either released from water or dissolved in it can increase the concentration of elements like nitrate fluoride and chloride and need to be assessed geomorphic parameters farhan and al shaikh 2017 play a major role in water quality these parameters are widely interconnected and have a strong influence on each other the wqi values can even range over 5000 felaniaina et al 2017 so the classification of wqi in safe and non safe categories varies from case to case the approach adopted by li et al 2017 combines particle swarm optimization chaos theory self adaptive strategy and back propagation artificial neural network to evaluate the water quality lori et al 2017 suggested that data collected by various agencies over a long period and data from multiple sources can be used to counterbalance the diminishing effect of inconsistencies for monitoring the water quality despite new tools being available for wqi the classical approach is still preferred as the advanced techniques are highly complex in nature and the data and rigorous training required for better results are limited to a smaller sample size this study assigns individual weights to every parameter of each sample to estimate the overall water quality of the entire region which is used for drinking purpose and is proposed to be the cause of several health problems the water samples were collected from 163 groundwater wells during both pre and post monsoon seasons 2 methodology the water quality index wqi was determined by two different sets set a and set b of equations as mentioned below under set a quality rating q i for the ith water quality parameter is obtained by the following relations mentioned from eqs a 1 to a 3 tiwari and ali 1988 a 1 q v i s i 100 the water quality index was calculated by aggregating these quality ratings linearly as follows a 2 w q i i 1 n q i the average water quality index awqi for n parameters was calculated using equation a 3 a w q i i 1 n q i n w q i n where q i quality rating of the ith parameter at a given sampling site v i observed value of the ith parameter at a given sampling site s i water quality standard for ith parameter and n number of parameters equations b 1 to b 5 are used in determination of water quality index reza and singh 2010 for computing wqi si was first determined for each parameter as given below weights are assigned to the parameters based on its deviation from recommended values and relative weight was calculated for each variable b 1 r w w i 1 n w i b 2 q i c i s i b 3 s i r w q i b 4 q i s i b 5 w q i q i where w i is the weight of ith parameter r wi is the relative weight of ith parameter c i is the concentration of ith parameter s i is the sub index standard of ith parameter q i is the rating based on concentration of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters qi j is quality index of physical and chemical parameters further we have established the relationship between these two water quality indexes and combined them together to suggest a novel all inclusive procedure to determine wqi for easier understanding the following nomenclature is used for various wqi f1 is wqi when s i min is used with set a f2 is wqi when s i max is used with set a f3 is wqi when s i min is used with set b and f4 is wqi when s i max is used with set b this naming is identical for both durations i e pre and post monsoon we can determine if whether using s i min or s i max results in a lower range of wqi values and adopt the same to report our results the ratios derived from various wqi help in understanding the conversion of one scale to another the required relations are established through the data used in the study if set a or set b equations are used in determination of wqi and s i min is used then following relation could be used to change the scale of wqi for s i max 1 w q i s i min k w q i s i max where wqi water quality index s i min minimum value of standard for parameter under desirable limit s i max maximum permissible value of standard for parameter under permissible limit in absence of alternative water source and the relation between wqi derived from set a and set b equations 2 w q i s e t b k w q i s e t a for both the above equations the value of the constant k is unique to the water sample and can be obtained by comparing the respective graphs of wqi these two eqns 1 and 2 can be used to convert the scale of water quality index from one method to another method easily when the range of index is high it may be confusing to assign categories to the index range so an attempt has been made to reduce the range of index by merging the above sets a b of equations the procedure is explained below in handy steps step 1 we have defined the weight given to the parameter by v i s i and s i is taken as the maximum permissible value for the same three conditions emerge from it as the weight can vary anywhere between 1 and 5 i v i s i is low the weight given to that point is less ii v i s i is high the weight given is greater and iii v i s i is negative the weight given is one in summary greater the deviation of a parameter from its maximum permissible limit greater the weight assigned to the parameter if zero weight is given the point would be insignificant in calculations the negative values indicate least affecting point when v i s i 50 w 1 v i s i 50 and 100 w 2 v i s i 100 and 150 w 3 v i s i 150 and 200 w 4 and v i s i 200 w 5 this difference in range can be decided based on the value range of the parameter or standard deviation here the weightage interval is decided by eqn 3 3 w e i g h t a g e int e r v a l m a x o f v i s i m a x o f w e i g h t adopting this interval changes the weight assigned to samples step 2 after defining the weight of each parameter sum the weight of that parameter for all samples 4 w w 1 w 2 w 3 w n then calculate the relative weight of each sample for the same parameter we can have different relative weights at different locations the highest weight can be assigned to parameters that pose grave health risks and whose presence above the critical concentration limits could limit the usability of the resource for domestic and drinking purposes şener et al 2017 5 r w w i w step 3 calculate the quality index or value normalization using relation 6 q i v i s i 100 calculate the sub index by using relation 7 s i p 1 q i r w step 4 add all sub index 8 w q i s i p 1 s i p 2 s i p 3 s i p n 9 thus w q i i p 1 n s i where pn indicates the n parameters used in study this will reduce the range of values drastically to within the range of 0 100 if still the range of wqi is exceeding the limit of 0 100 then divide the derived wqi with number of parameters used in the study and obtain average water quality index 10 a w q i i p 1 n s i n using the all physico chemical parameters water quality index is determined by established procedures it must be noted that with change in procedure results will vary this also implies that water quality index is not uniform for all parameters and will vary the range of quality categories the relationship between the 2 procedure used in this case study is established if water quality index is known for one scale the procedure will help determine the water quality index in another scale the relationship for conversion of wqi is as follows 11 w q i s e t b k w q i s e t a 12 w q i s i min k w q i s i max as mentioned earlier the values of the constant for conversion can be obtained by comparing the respective wqi scatter plots 3 case study 163 samples of groundwater from the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were used to investigate physico chemical properties the locations of samples are shown in fig 1 the sampling plan for collecting water sample was developed on the uniform grid with interval 15 km the sample was collected from the nearest well from the grid point in 2 l transparent bottles the water quality index was determined for all sampling locations for pre and post monsoon arcgis version 10 2 was used to create various maps used in the study to display spatial distribution table 1 provides the summary of the physico chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples for pre post monsoon seasons collected from the study area during the months of june and december of 2012 the standards prescribed by the government of india is 10500 2012 were used to categorize the groundwater in the study area table 2 compares the measured values of each parameter against the standards three categories based on the standards prescribed are described as follows 1 category 1 the values are lower than desirable limit known as below limit bl 2 category 2 the values falls between desirable and maximum permissible limit known as safe limit sl 3 category 3 the values are higher than permissible limit known as above limit al a water sample is acceptable for consumption only when the values lie within the safe limit the water quality index wqi was determined for 163 sampling wells in study area we have used two different methods to calculate wqi using the relevant equations eqs a 1 to a 3 for set a and eqs b 1 to b 5 for set b the wqi was measured using the 2 different values of s i first the minimum desirable value is used s i min after which the maximum permissible value is used s i max table 3 provides a summary of these computations as our sample collection year was 2012 the population was forecasted for the year 2012 based on the population data of 2011 obtained from census of india 2011 using arithmetical increase method whose formula is mentioned below in eqn 13 in comparison with other population forecasting methods for previous decades the arithmetic increase method was seen to be most accurate and was hence adopted in this study 13 population after n th decade will be p n p n c where p n is the population after n decades and p is present population c represents population growth rate figs 2 and 3 display the wqi of all 163 wells computed by 2 different set of equations during pre and post monsoon respectively they follow the same pattern of distribution of wqi when either s i min or s i max values are used the patterns derived by the set a and set b equations are also similar the negative values are considered zero in the final output the various ratios of wqi derived with s i min and s i max using set a and set b for pre monsoon are shown in fig 4 the same ratios for post monsoon are shown in fig 5 fig 6 displays the water quality index of the study area computed using the new hybrid method table 4 illustrates the summary of wqi values range computed by hybrid approach in study area for pre and post monsoon duration the study area has 7041712 inhabitants rural and urban as per government record census of india 2011 we cannot sample the entire inhabitant area as the sample size and economic requirements would be large based on overlay technique and assuming the nearby villages of sampled village have same aquifer the quality will remain the same for them spatial coverage of groundwater quality is determined and the population residing on that area is also determined using population density further we have tried to identify the number of inhabitants against the groundwater quality to provide a clearer picture of the imminent health risk fig 7 fig 8 show the spatial distribution of wqi in pre post monsoon using the modified method fig 9 shows the population density map of the region and helps in determining the number of inhabitants in region having access to good or bad quality of water the vulnerability of population was estimated for water quality in the study area table 5 shows the demographics and area covered under various categories of water index measured for pre and post monsoon fig 10 shows increment in area under safe category from pre monsoon to post monsoon while fig 11 shows a similar increment in population the similarity in increase and decrease is implied from the direct relation between the areal coverage and population 4 results and analysis the analysis of the results of case study undertaken above can be summarized as follows out of 16 parameters studied 6 most critical parameters are identified based on their coverage in region more than 95 of wells have mg concentration higher than the maximum permissible limit 70 and 60 wells show concentrations of total hardness and ca more than maximum permissible limit respectively in the study area 60 wells show chloride and fluoride concentration exceeding maximum permissible limit in study area 65 wells have shown nitrate concentration is exceeding maximum permissible limit and 50 wells have shown tds is exceeding maximum permissible limit in the study area respectively thus these parameters were decided as important and for the purpose of wqi computations tds fluoride and nitride were used attempt has been made to modify the procedure for determination of wqi by merging the two procedures set a and set b equations used in this case and the wqi is determined with the modified approach it helps in reducing the wqi range drastically even in the cases that exceed the value of 1000 and the comparison is tabulated in table 6 thus the hybrid wqi is successful in helping bring down the range of wqi sensitivity analysis was carried out by randomly selecting 10 wells from the data set and increasing the parameters tds fluoride and nitride by 10 and comparing the final change in wqi value the analysis concluded that the average change in premonsoon and postmonsoon wqi is 2 3 for fluoride 4 0 for no3 and 3 655 for tds thus the method is receptive to changes in the values of measured parameters the spatial distribution of wqi suggests that central region of study area is most significantly affected by poor and unacceptable quality of water the reason for bad quality of water is natural the aquifers present in deep zone in the area are highly mineralized the study shows that 47 and 59 population have access to safe category of groundwater during pre and post monsoon respectively to verify the validity of the novel wqi 10 premonsoon and postmonsoon water samples from bits pilani campus pilani were assessed the average wqi value was 12 53 for premonsoon and 12 47 for post monsoon seasons while maximum permissible was 21 this is aligned rightly with our preliminary estimate of wqi based on parameter values the inhabitants of shekhawati region face several health risks due to poor water quality these health risks include hypermagnesemia linked to mg intake cholesterol muscle cramp and kidney stones due to high ca intake eczema digestive issues and loss in fertility due to high intake of hard water fluorosis and osteosarcoma caused by high intake of fluoride while methemoglobinemia is caused by higher nitrate intake cheaper processes that can improve the quality of water in these villages are thus required 5 conclusion monitoring of water quality is critical for safeguarding public health water quality index is one of the most popular methods to ascertain and report water quality to policy makers and stakeholders people residing in regions with wqi outside the permissible range are prone to several health risks the groundwater wells of the semi arid shekhawati region were analyzed individually for 16 parameters and select few were deemed critical due to their presence in excess changes were observed in alkalinity hardness calcium chloride nitrate nitrite fluoride and tds post monsoon it was observed that the wells in safe zone for alkalinity hardness and calcium decrease in number from pre monsoon to post monsoon while chloride and nitrite increase from pre monsoon to post monsoon the wells in safe category for nitrate decreased from pre to post monsoon while wells in safe category for fluoride and total dissolved solids increased from pre to post monsoon at regional level water quality declines during drought conditions policy makers and stakeholders need to take note that constant monitoring and proper management of groundwater quality in semi arid regions is of prime importance the water quality index that has been determined for the shekhawati indicates that approximately only 47 and 59 of the local populace has access to groundwater of acceptable quality during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the groundwater of the area thus requires suitable treatment before consumption and needs to be protected from further contamination data availability statement some or all data models or code generated or used during the study are available from the corresponding author by request the data about the water samples from the wells are available with the author and will be provided upon request not to be published appendix a

12030,the depletion of groundwater resources threatens water security around the world and it is of prime concern minimization of the impact of unhealthy drinking water requires monitoring of contaminants and awareness to all stake holders the work is aimed at developing a water quality index wqi to assess and report water quality to policy makers and stake holders for comprehensive planning this new wqi method assigns individual weights to each sample point under consideration along with wholesome weights to account for the relative risk of each contaminant water quality is determined for pre and post monsoon seasons spatial distribution of water quality is used to estimate the probable impact on affected population a case study was carried out to validate the method for this purpose a total of 163 wells covering an area of 30 623 square km were sampled in a semi arid region in north india during pre and post monsoon seasons sixteen physico chemical parameters were measured and six parameters were deemed highly critical due to their coverage and associated health risk against the general belief a rise in the number of wells with permissible limits of chloride nitrite fluoride and tds is observed after the monsoon the wqi determined by the procedure indicates that only 47 and 59 of the local populace has access to groundwater of acceptable quality during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively keywords water quality groundwater management water security water quality index 1 introduction according to the world health organization 2017 access to safe drinking water is essential to health a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection it is also a pressing development issue at national regional and local levels depletion of non renewable groundwater and problems of water quality is a looming threat in many regions studies conclude that nearly 65 of the groundwater in the world is consumed domestically 20 employed for irrigation and 15 employed for industrial purposes adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 saeid et al 2018 water scarcity leads to over exploitation of groundwater which results in lowering of groundwater table mineral salts found in greater depths degrade the quality of groundwater the source of contaminants in groundwater sources depend largely on the land use soil type soil rock water interaction physico chemical quality presence of microbes and so on tirkey et al 2017 yousefi et al 2017 in many semi arid and arid regions across the world water quality is a more important limiting factor and not water quantity water quality is vital not only because of its impact on the availability of freshwater and human health but also because of its intrinsic value mccutcheon et al 1993 the depletion of groundwater resources threatens food and water security in india asoka et al 2017 found that between 2003 and 2013 groundwater storage has declined in northern india at the rate of 2 cm yr 1 the shekhawati region in northern india belongs to semi arid climatic zone and receives scanty rainfall spanning 30 623 square kilometers the 7 million residents of shekhawati are solely dependent on groundwater for their domestic and drinking needs with no feasible alternative this leads to overexploitation of groundwater which results in lowering of groundwater table and ultimately degrades the quality of water rising population growing urbanization and irrigated agriculture are among the other factors responsible for the poor quality of groundwater machiwal and jha 2014 according to thompson et al 2007 chemicals in water supplies can cause serious health problems including waterborne diseases whether the chemicals are naturally occurring or derive from sources of pollution in many parts of the world the long term consumption of hazardous naturally occurring chemicals such as arsenic and fluoride particularly through drinking groundwater is a major cause of chronic disease disablement and premature death in the shekhawati region several cases of birth defects and blue baby syndrome have been reported over the years other common health problems reported include dental and skeletal fluorosis osteoarthritis kidney stones and low fertility these health problems are attributed to the naturally occurring chemicals in the groundwater of the region water quality is often reported as a single dimensionless numeric score called the water quality index wqi water quality index is helpful to report large data volume of water quality as they are effective tool to minimize large amount of water quality data in a single numeric value that allows an easy understanding of the monitored data abbasi 2002 tirkey et al 2013 mangukiya et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2012 the use of an index translates the water quality monitoring data into a form that the public and policy makers can easily interpret and utilize house 1990 wqi combines large data about a variety of physico chemical parameters that have significant effects on safety for consumption yidana and yidana 2010 used water quality index wqi method to assess the suitability of groundwater for human consumption for effective planning and management of groundwater resources groundwater vulnerability assessment is most significant garewal et al 2017 thompson et al 2007 highlighted that identifying and prioritizing chemical risks presents a challenge especially in developing countries due to the lack of information on the presence of chemicals in water willis et al 2015 highlighted the contamination pathways and determinants of water quality and the associated public health risks and control measures the work describes the risk of water contamination by physico chemical and microbial contaminants from source to point of use delbari et al 2016 proved that the spatial correlation always exists between the samples and physico chemical analysis as in most studies the researchers focused on pollution caused by point sources and the statistical aspects of choosing the monitoring locations and sample sizes rajib et al 2016 lead to water quality improvement with reduction in surface runoff sediment nitrate and total phosphorus loadings this improvement in water quality is the reflection of the nature of land use conversion and associated activities which are characterized in this case by gain in low input agriculture with hay pasture area development ammonia is nitrified faster at higher temperatures via monod kinetics pirjo et al 2017 this indicates that even other compounds may change their kinetics in water at higher temperatures free ions that are either released from water or dissolved in it can increase the concentration of elements like nitrate fluoride and chloride and need to be assessed geomorphic parameters farhan and al shaikh 2017 play a major role in water quality these parameters are widely interconnected and have a strong influence on each other the wqi values can even range over 5000 felaniaina et al 2017 so the classification of wqi in safe and non safe categories varies from case to case the approach adopted by li et al 2017 combines particle swarm optimization chaos theory self adaptive strategy and back propagation artificial neural network to evaluate the water quality lori et al 2017 suggested that data collected by various agencies over a long period and data from multiple sources can be used to counterbalance the diminishing effect of inconsistencies for monitoring the water quality despite new tools being available for wqi the classical approach is still preferred as the advanced techniques are highly complex in nature and the data and rigorous training required for better results are limited to a smaller sample size this study assigns individual weights to every parameter of each sample to estimate the overall water quality of the entire region which is used for drinking purpose and is proposed to be the cause of several health problems the water samples were collected from 163 groundwater wells during both pre and post monsoon seasons 2 methodology the water quality index wqi was determined by two different sets set a and set b of equations as mentioned below under set a quality rating q i for the ith water quality parameter is obtained by the following relations mentioned from eqs a 1 to a 3 tiwari and ali 1988 a 1 q v i s i 100 the water quality index was calculated by aggregating these quality ratings linearly as follows a 2 w q i i 1 n q i the average water quality index awqi for n parameters was calculated using equation a 3 a w q i i 1 n q i n w q i n where q i quality rating of the ith parameter at a given sampling site v i observed value of the ith parameter at a given sampling site s i water quality standard for ith parameter and n number of parameters equations b 1 to b 5 are used in determination of water quality index reza and singh 2010 for computing wqi si was first determined for each parameter as given below weights are assigned to the parameters based on its deviation from recommended values and relative weight was calculated for each variable b 1 r w w i 1 n w i b 2 q i c i s i b 3 s i r w q i b 4 q i s i b 5 w q i q i where w i is the weight of ith parameter r wi is the relative weight of ith parameter c i is the concentration of ith parameter s i is the sub index standard of ith parameter q i is the rating based on concentration of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters qi j is quality index of physical and chemical parameters further we have established the relationship between these two water quality indexes and combined them together to suggest a novel all inclusive procedure to determine wqi for easier understanding the following nomenclature is used for various wqi f1 is wqi when s i min is used with set a f2 is wqi when s i max is used with set a f3 is wqi when s i min is used with set b and f4 is wqi when s i max is used with set b this naming is identical for both durations i e pre and post monsoon we can determine if whether using s i min or s i max results in a lower range of wqi values and adopt the same to report our results the ratios derived from various wqi help in understanding the conversion of one scale to another the required relations are established through the data used in the study if set a or set b equations are used in determination of wqi and s i min is used then following relation could be used to change the scale of wqi for s i max 1 w q i s i min k w q i s i max where wqi water quality index s i min minimum value of standard for parameter under desirable limit s i max maximum permissible value of standard for parameter under permissible limit in absence of alternative water source and the relation between wqi derived from set a and set b equations 2 w q i s e t b k w q i s e t a for both the above equations the value of the constant k is unique to the water sample and can be obtained by comparing the respective graphs of wqi these two eqns 1 and 2 can be used to convert the scale of water quality index from one method to another method easily when the range of index is high it may be confusing to assign categories to the index range so an attempt has been made to reduce the range of index by merging the above sets a b of equations the procedure is explained below in handy steps step 1 we have defined the weight given to the parameter by v i s i and s i is taken as the maximum permissible value for the same three conditions emerge from it as the weight can vary anywhere between 1 and 5 i v i s i is low the weight given to that point is less ii v i s i is high the weight given is greater and iii v i s i is negative the weight given is one in summary greater the deviation of a parameter from its maximum permissible limit greater the weight assigned to the parameter if zero weight is given the point would be insignificant in calculations the negative values indicate least affecting point when v i s i 50 w 1 v i s i 50 and 100 w 2 v i s i 100 and 150 w 3 v i s i 150 and 200 w 4 and v i s i 200 w 5 this difference in range can be decided based on the value range of the parameter or standard deviation here the weightage interval is decided by eqn 3 3 w e i g h t a g e int e r v a l m a x o f v i s i m a x o f w e i g h t adopting this interval changes the weight assigned to samples step 2 after defining the weight of each parameter sum the weight of that parameter for all samples 4 w w 1 w 2 w 3 w n then calculate the relative weight of each sample for the same parameter we can have different relative weights at different locations the highest weight can be assigned to parameters that pose grave health risks and whose presence above the critical concentration limits could limit the usability of the resource for domestic and drinking purposes şener et al 2017 5 r w w i w step 3 calculate the quality index or value normalization using relation 6 q i v i s i 100 calculate the sub index by using relation 7 s i p 1 q i r w step 4 add all sub index 8 w q i s i p 1 s i p 2 s i p 3 s i p n 9 thus w q i i p 1 n s i where pn indicates the n parameters used in study this will reduce the range of values drastically to within the range of 0 100 if still the range of wqi is exceeding the limit of 0 100 then divide the derived wqi with number of parameters used in the study and obtain average water quality index 10 a w q i i p 1 n s i n using the all physico chemical parameters water quality index is determined by established procedures it must be noted that with change in procedure results will vary this also implies that water quality index is not uniform for all parameters and will vary the range of quality categories the relationship between the 2 procedure used in this case study is established if water quality index is known for one scale the procedure will help determine the water quality index in another scale the relationship for conversion of wqi is as follows 11 w q i s e t b k w q i s e t a 12 w q i s i min k w q i s i max as mentioned earlier the values of the constant for conversion can be obtained by comparing the respective wqi scatter plots 3 case study 163 samples of groundwater from the pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons were used to investigate physico chemical properties the locations of samples are shown in fig 1 the sampling plan for collecting water sample was developed on the uniform grid with interval 15 km the sample was collected from the nearest well from the grid point in 2 l transparent bottles the water quality index was determined for all sampling locations for pre and post monsoon arcgis version 10 2 was used to create various maps used in the study to display spatial distribution table 1 provides the summary of the physico chemical characteristics of the groundwater samples for pre post monsoon seasons collected from the study area during the months of june and december of 2012 the standards prescribed by the government of india is 10500 2012 were used to categorize the groundwater in the study area table 2 compares the measured values of each parameter against the standards three categories based on the standards prescribed are described as follows 1 category 1 the values are lower than desirable limit known as below limit bl 2 category 2 the values falls between desirable and maximum permissible limit known as safe limit sl 3 category 3 the values are higher than permissible limit known as above limit al a water sample is acceptable for consumption only when the values lie within the safe limit the water quality index wqi was determined for 163 sampling wells in study area we have used two different methods to calculate wqi using the relevant equations eqs a 1 to a 3 for set a and eqs b 1 to b 5 for set b the wqi was measured using the 2 different values of s i first the minimum desirable value is used s i min after which the maximum permissible value is used s i max table 3 provides a summary of these computations as our sample collection year was 2012 the population was forecasted for the year 2012 based on the population data of 2011 obtained from census of india 2011 using arithmetical increase method whose formula is mentioned below in eqn 13 in comparison with other population forecasting methods for previous decades the arithmetic increase method was seen to be most accurate and was hence adopted in this study 13 population after n th decade will be p n p n c where p n is the population after n decades and p is present population c represents population growth rate figs 2 and 3 display the wqi of all 163 wells computed by 2 different set of equations during pre and post monsoon respectively they follow the same pattern of distribution of wqi when either s i min or s i max values are used the patterns derived by the set a and set b equations are also similar the negative values are considered zero in the final output the various ratios of wqi derived with s i min and s i max using set a and set b for pre monsoon are shown in fig 4 the same ratios for post monsoon are shown in fig 5 fig 6 displays the water quality index of the study area computed using the new hybrid method table 4 illustrates the summary of wqi values range computed by hybrid approach in study area for pre and post monsoon duration the study area has 7041712 inhabitants rural and urban as per government record census of india 2011 we cannot sample the entire inhabitant area as the sample size and economic requirements would be large based on overlay technique and assuming the nearby villages of sampled village have same aquifer the quality will remain the same for them spatial coverage of groundwater quality is determined and the population residing on that area is also determined using population density further we have tried to identify the number of inhabitants against the groundwater quality to provide a clearer picture of the imminent health risk fig 7 fig 8 show the spatial distribution of wqi in pre post monsoon using the modified method fig 9 shows the population density map of the region and helps in determining the number of inhabitants in region having access to good or bad quality of water the vulnerability of population was estimated for water quality in the study area table 5 shows the demographics and area covered under various categories of water index measured for pre and post monsoon fig 10 shows increment in area under safe category from pre monsoon to post monsoon while fig 11 shows a similar increment in population the similarity in increase and decrease is implied from the direct relation between the areal coverage and population 4 results and analysis the analysis of the results of case study undertaken above can be summarized as follows out of 16 parameters studied 6 most critical parameters are identified based on their coverage in region more than 95 of wells have mg concentration higher than the maximum permissible limit 70 and 60 wells show concentrations of total hardness and ca more than maximum permissible limit respectively in the study area 60 wells show chloride and fluoride concentration exceeding maximum permissible limit in study area 65 wells have shown nitrate concentration is exceeding maximum permissible limit and 50 wells have shown tds is exceeding maximum permissible limit in the study area respectively thus these parameters were decided as important and for the purpose of wqi computations tds fluoride and nitride were used attempt has been made to modify the procedure for determination of wqi by merging the two procedures set a and set b equations used in this case and the wqi is determined with the modified approach it helps in reducing the wqi range drastically even in the cases that exceed the value of 1000 and the comparison is tabulated in table 6 thus the hybrid wqi is successful in helping bring down the range of wqi sensitivity analysis was carried out by randomly selecting 10 wells from the data set and increasing the parameters tds fluoride and nitride by 10 and comparing the final change in wqi value the analysis concluded that the average change in premonsoon and postmonsoon wqi is 2 3 for fluoride 4 0 for no3 and 3 655 for tds thus the method is receptive to changes in the values of measured parameters the spatial distribution of wqi suggests that central region of study area is most significantly affected by poor and unacceptable quality of water the reason for bad quality of water is natural the aquifers present in deep zone in the area are highly mineralized the study shows that 47 and 59 population have access to safe category of groundwater during pre and post monsoon respectively to verify the validity of the novel wqi 10 premonsoon and postmonsoon water samples from bits pilani campus pilani were assessed the average wqi value was 12 53 for premonsoon and 12 47 for post monsoon seasons while maximum permissible was 21 this is aligned rightly with our preliminary estimate of wqi based on parameter values the inhabitants of shekhawati region face several health risks due to poor water quality these health risks include hypermagnesemia linked to mg intake cholesterol muscle cramp and kidney stones due to high ca intake eczema digestive issues and loss in fertility due to high intake of hard water fluorosis and osteosarcoma caused by high intake of fluoride while methemoglobinemia is caused by higher nitrate intake cheaper processes that can improve the quality of water in these villages are thus required 5 conclusion monitoring of water quality is critical for safeguarding public health water quality index is one of the most popular methods to ascertain and report water quality to policy makers and stakeholders people residing in regions with wqi outside the permissible range are prone to several health risks the groundwater wells of the semi arid shekhawati region were analyzed individually for 16 parameters and select few were deemed critical due to their presence in excess changes were observed in alkalinity hardness calcium chloride nitrate nitrite fluoride and tds post monsoon it was observed that the wells in safe zone for alkalinity hardness and calcium decrease in number from pre monsoon to post monsoon while chloride and nitrite increase from pre monsoon to post monsoon the wells in safe category for nitrate decreased from pre to post monsoon while wells in safe category for fluoride and total dissolved solids increased from pre to post monsoon at regional level water quality declines during drought conditions policy makers and stakeholders need to take note that constant monitoring and proper management of groundwater quality in semi arid regions is of prime importance the water quality index that has been determined for the shekhawati indicates that approximately only 47 and 59 of the local populace has access to groundwater of acceptable quality during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively the groundwater of the area thus requires suitable treatment before consumption and needs to be protected from further contamination data availability statement some or all data models or code generated or used during the study are

12031,lakshadweep archipelago is comprised of several tiny coral atolls and scattered in the arabian sea off the south west of india ground water is the only available fresh water resource for the islanders the groundwater quality is decreased in this island due to population growth and anthropogenic activities like sewage dumping and agricultural activities for this study a total of 20 groundwater samples was collected randomly from the open wells that cover the entire area of the island the physico chemical parameters of groundwater were analysed in pre and post monsoon seasons during the year 2016 2017 the concentration of a majority of the chemical constituents exceeds the standards of who during post monsoon than pre monsoon season ec content exhibited the violation of drinking water quality standards the highest value of ec range 1023 6874 μs cm recorded in post monsoon than pre monsoon tds concentration range from 574 6 to 1503 4 mg l and 665 4468 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons geochemical evolution diagram categories the groundwater facies into na k cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 in both seasons gibbs plot revealed that the evaporation is the dominant factor controlling the mechanism of ground water hydrochemistry the water quality index suggested that both pre monsoon and post monsoon around 93 95 of the samples are unsuitable for drinking purposes the suitability of groundwater for irrigation was studied by calculating the percent of sodium sodium adsorption ratio magnesium hazard and reveille s index the wilcox and ussl plots also indicated that most of the groundwater samples are found to be unsuitable for irrigation hfe diagram productively delineates that groundwater of the study area has strong influence of sea water in the fresh water aquifers the highest level of significant correlation was observed between mg th r 0 87 ec tds r 0 86 and cl na r 0 77 respectively as a whole it is observed that the groundwater is not suitable for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes due to the exceeding of chemical parameters from their standard limits therefore groundwater management measures may be worked out regionally to improve water quality by artificial recharge rain water harvesting periodic disinfection of the wells and saving the fresh water stocks in the island accordingly graphical abstract image 1 keywords atoll lagoon seasonal variability water quality kavaratti island groundwater 1 introduction lakshadweep archipelago is one of the most important spectacular island ecosystems consisting of 36 coral islands located in the arabian sea off the western coast of india groundwater is the only available freshwater resource for the islanders for drinking purposes kavaratti atoll is the capital of the lakshadweep group of islands which comprised of pristine white sand beaches and calm coral attached shallow lagoon anu et al 2007 the alternative sources of freshwater are limited due to the particular geography of these islands the groundwater resources of kavaratti island are exposed to an intensive utilization by an increasing population and agricultural activities which leads to severe damages to the freshwater supply of the island banerjee and singh 2011 2013 mondal et al 2009 singh et al 2009 atolls are the low lying reef carbonate land areas characterized by a series of narrow islands surrounding a shallowed seawater lagoon enclosing it either partially or fully falkland and custodio 1991 the excessive pumping from dug wells which leads to ingression of sea water and the effect of salinization has limited the availability of fresh water to the islanders sundaresan 1993 kavaratti island is highly vulnerable to groundwater scarcity and affected saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifers the aspect ratio of the island substantiates that the shape of the island has a significant role in the stability of freshwater resources in this region najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 the availability of fresh ground water occurs in the depth of 2 5 5 m and the freshwater lenses are depleted in times of low rainfall banerjee and singh 2013 prasad 2011 even at high rainfall events the groundwater level of the island seems to be persistent which indicates that the freshwater lens floating over the seawater gets re adjusted prasad and hameed 2010 in the coastal regions the magnitude of the sea water intrusion is influenced by the thickness or saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer ferreira and chachadi 2005 in small atoll islands the fresh groundwater lens is generally thin and had a brackish mixing zone usually separate fresh groundwater lens from underlying seawater werner et al 2017 the natural exchange between surface water and underlying aquifer can strongly influence the chemical composition and suitability of both water bodies findlay 1995 brunke and gonser 1997 soulsby et al 2005 the ever growing demand for freshwater human consumption become a worldwide concern the deterioration of the ground water in quality in the coastal aquifer is mainly due to strong agricultural development accompanied by low recharge infiltration to the phreatic aquifers and sea water intrusion alfarrah et al 2017 ben asher et al 2000 edmunds and milne 2001 the atoll islands are considered as the most vulnerable ecosystems worldwide because of freshwater scarcity and depletion of water resources due to climate change low elevation geographic remoteness and small land surface bailey et al 2014 atolls are very sensitive to seawater intrusion especially climate change has a potential role in causing inundation saltwater intrusion erosion and the change of aquifer geometry church et al 2006 petra 2009 the combined effect of buoyancy forces tides complex geology and human impacts creates the dynamics in fresh groundwater lens in atoll islands werner et al 2017 warrier and hameed 2006 the natural processes such as saline water intrusion wind driven sea spray and marine aerosols deposited on the top soil evaporation and interaction of groundwater with brines and sedimentary formation also causes the degradation of the ground water quality in coastal aquifers sanford et al 2007 the usability of the groundwater is immensely significant in regions that are geographically isolated systems like coral islands hence the submarine groundwater discharge has received rapid attention in recent decades especially the coral reef regions of tropical countries jiang et al 2018 the hydrogeological studies of lakshadweep island are found to be limited singh et al 2009 studied the hydrogeological characteristics of the groundwater from the andrott island in lakshadweep and identified the potential fresh groundwater resources with vulnerable parts of the island prasad and hameed 2010 reported the groundwater fluctuation level at 0 07 m 0 50 m in the minicoy island of lakshadweep najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 reported the role of rainfall and surplus in controlling the groundwater quality of lakshadweep joy et al 2019 reported the trace element deposition in the lagoon and shores of kavaratti and found that lead pb remains as an eco toxicological risk though the island receives high rainfall the lack of surface storage and limited ground water storage capacity is sustain the fresh water is occurring as a small lens floating over the saltwater which makes the freshwater more precious commodity due the dense population and over exploitation the waste water mixed with freshwater resources is common in the island therefore a better understanding of groundwater resources is vital for addressing the threats to groundwater resources especially the fresh groundwater lens in the island a proper understanding of the groundwater condition is important in order to meet this increasing demand and to formulate future development and management strategies the evaluation of groundwater in terms of quality availability and distribution is necessary to meet the increasing demand for freshwater and thereby sustain the quality of life on the island hence the present study aims to investigate the groundwater quality in terms of drinking and irrigation purposes along with the seasonal change of the water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lakshadweep archipelago in the southwest arabian sea consist of several small oceanic island between latitude 10 12 n and longitude 72 74 e the present study area covers the coastal aquifer of the kavaratti island which located in the central part of the lakshadweep archipelago between the latitude of 10 31 50 032 n to 10 35 3 713 n and longitude of 72 36 31 411 e to 72 39 34 144 e with an area of 8 96 km2 the island comprised of a vast lagoon in its western side and fringing reef in the eastern part without a lagoon in between the sediment of the island and the lagoon composed of coralline materials the west part of kavaratti the lagoon water covers 5 5 km that oriented towards north east and southwest direction and occupied with a shallow lagoon of depth of 2 m joy et al 2019 the maximum length of the island is about 5 5 km and maximum of 1 4 km width and it is oriented in a ne sw direction the ground water in the island is a delicate balance with sea water and which is floating over the saline water the depth to water table varies between 0 5 m and 3 5 m below the ground level the slope of the water table is towards the lagoon than towards the open sea prakash et al 2014 prasad 2011 the fresh water on this island occurs as lenses of various dimensions floating over the sea water in hydraulic continuity with the sea water the tidal influence is seen in the wells of the island and the water is periodically renewed by rainfall varma et al 1989 the island has surface layer of approximately 1 2 m thickness of coral debris followed by compact but porous crust of limestone conglomerate the lagoons of the lakshadweep island are enclosed by coral reefs and which are connected to the open sea through various openings chakraborty and ramesh 1997 the seasonal variation of the temperature recorded was 27 5 c to 31 6 c suresh and mathew 1993 the main reason for the seasonable variability is the sst changes caused by the upwelling during the south west monsoon chakraborty and ramesh 1997 a large change of both physical environment and chemical composition are known to occur in the island is response to the monsoon elnino and indian ocean dipole chakraborty and ramesh 1997 the transport of the water from sea to lagoon is controlled by the action of surf which breaks across the reef 2 2 sample collection and hydrochemical analysis in kavaratti island about 1325 dug wells filter points are used for domestic purposes the population density is very high in kavaratti island and is around 2920 km2 and each house is having limited area of land and also is having at least one well system in the present study a total of 20 groundwater samples were collected from the kavaratti island which covers the entire area of the island and most of the wells are very closely situated therefore we chosen the cluster of wells by keeping a ratio of 1 66 for a single sampling procedure fig 1 shows the distribution of wells sampled from the kavaratti island and almost showing the equal distribution of groundwater sampling the average depth of the dug wells rage from 0 6 to 4 2 m with depth to the water ranges from 0 4 to 4 2 m najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 the groundwater samples were collected during the pre monsoon and post monsoon season of the year 2016 2017 the water samples were taken from the 0 5 m below the water table the diameter of the wells in lakshadweep varies from 1 to 2 0 m and the average thickness of the aquifer is 0 04 m 0 56 m the collected samples were stored in pre cleaned polythene bottles of 1 l capacity all samples are kept in 4 c in the laboratory until analysis water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a portable water quality analyser eutech cyberscan pcd 650 for the analysis of major ions ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 and cl the standard method prescribed by american public health association apha 2012 were employed among the major ions na and k were assessed by means of flame photometer elico cl 378 ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl ions were analysed by volumetric methods sulphate so4 2 and nitrate no3 was estimated using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv1800 all the analyses were performed using the standard procedures published elsewhere apha 2012 suitability of groundwater for domestic purposes was evaluated by comparing the values of different water quality parameters with the water quality standard of the world health organization who 2011 and bis guidelines for water quality table 2 the pearson s correlation matrices of the water quality parameters of both seasons were analysed by using spss version 16 0 for windows aquachem version 5 1 software was used for generating salinity diagrams and piper diagrams and wilcox diagrams respectively geographical information system gis 10 3 was used for generating study area map and water quality index map respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical analysis the physicochemical characteristics of the analytical data of the well water samples are presented in tables 3 and 4 the ph in the study area ranges from 7 26 to 8 85 7 84 0 46 during the pre monsoon and 7 27 to 8 38 7 8 0 28 during the post monsoon period the results found that the groundwater samples in the kavaratti island are mainly alkaline in nature the ph of the water is a very important indicator for its quality and controlled by the equilibrium of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate present in the ground water hem 1991 ghandour et al 1985 the ph value above 8 5 often caused by the high carbonate content co3 2 the high co3 2 causes the calcium and magnesium ions to form insoluble minerals leaving the sodium as the dominant ions in the water rabeiy 2017 the ionic strength and the mineralization were determined mostly measured using electrical conductivity ec the who and bis standard for ec is 1400 μs cm who 2011 and bis 2012 the ec μs cm of the ground water samples of the study area ranges from 884 to 2313 1507 2 397 53 and 1023 6874 3005 9 1998 39 during pre and post monsoon period singh et al 2009 previously reported the variation of ec ranges from 598 to 3550 and 457 to 1515 during pre and post monsoon period from the ground waters samples of lakshadweep island saraswat et al 2019 reported the range of ec μs cm from 1156 83 to 3478 12 in groundwater samples of western coastal aquifer in the state of gujarat india highest values of ec in the present study 1023 6874 μs cm during the post monsoon period indicates the presence of high amount of inorganic substances in the island higher values of ec indicate the enrichment of salts in the groundwater and depend up on the temperature concentration and the type of various ions present hem 1985 the higher values of ec suggest high content of dissolved solids and thus the ionic strength also increased along with anthropogenic inputs the effect of ph also increases the dissolution processes which eventually increases the values of ec prasanth et al 2012 the concentration of total dissolved solids ranges from 574 6 to 1503 4 mg l 979 68 258 39 and 665 4468 mg l 1953 84 1298 96 during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively total dissolved solids tds in groundwater mainly contributed by the dissolution of salts present in the unsaturated zones through the percolation of rain water anoubam et al 2017 senthilkumar et al 2017 reported the highest tds values in the range of 420 1734 mg l from coastal aquifers of south india similarly previous studies of mondal et al 2009 reported the comparable values of tds ranged from 389 to 2308 mg l from aquifers of lakshadweep islands the residual waste migrates down to the water table and discharged into the wells also contribute the higher tds in the study area in both seasons it varies from the desirable limit 500 mg l of indian standard for drinking water the residual waste migrates down to the water table and discharged into the wells also contribute the higher tds in the study area in both seasons it varies the desirable limit 500 mg l of indian standard for drinking water the dominant cation in the present study exhibited na ca mg and k pattern of variance similarly the major anions are in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 respectively the concentration of na mg l during pre and post monsoon season ranges from 17 32 to 267 1 and 46 35 to 2564 respectively similarly the concentration of ca2 mg l during pre and post monsoon season ranges from 15 27 to 87 33 and 45 26 to 456 36 respectively the range of mg mg l ranges from 1 02 to 84 25 and 26 56 to 2875 56 during pre and post monsoon season respectively the concentration of k during pre and post monsoon season varied from 5 31 to 66 85 and 3 58 721 mg l respectively the higher content of na than ca2 to the total cation is due to the ion exchange precipitation of caco3 silicate weathering and dissolution of soil salts stored by evaporation and anthropogenic origin todd 1980 the higher content of ca2 and mg2 in ground water is due to the presence of calcite and dolomite minerals sharma et al 2017 usually the presence of calcium in ground water is due to the weathering of rocks and minerals brindha et al 2014 in contrast to the other cations the k content observed to be low because of more resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering and fixation of k ions on clay product while the increased content of k ions are could be due to the application of chemical fertilizers in to the study area hem 1985 similarly in the case of anions the values of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 during pre monsoon season ranges from 44 64 to 291 16 mg l 24 02 384 3 mg l 3 16 42 69 mg l and 6 52 17 34 mg l respectively similarly during the post monsoon season the values of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 were rages from 164 68 to 1854 mg l 74 68 4785 mg l 8 64 48 56 mg l and 6 24 27 61 mg l respectively the maximum permissible limit of total hardens for drinking water is 500 mg l who 2011 in pre monsoon season total hardness th ranges from 62 55 to 481 97 mg l with an average of 229 62 mg l while in post monsoon th ranges from 247 94 to 2930 69 mg l with an average of 1052 02 mg l respectively hardness of the water increases due to the increase of alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium narasimha and sudharshan 2017 the carbonate and bicarbonate are probably derived from the weathering of silicate rocks and dissolution of carbonate precipitates jeong 2001 the higher concentration of hco3 384 3 mg l indicates the dominance of mineral dissolution in the ground water kumaran et al 2015 the dominance of the hco3 in both seasons is due to the interaction of coral formation with aquifer mondal et al 2009 according to the who 2011 standards the maximum permissible limit of chloride in groundwater is 600 mg l the higher concentration of cl persist in the post monsoon indicates the influence of sea water in the study area roy et al 2018 the increased concentration of chloride in groundwater is an indication of the sea water intrusion raju and ram 2011 the extend and magnitude of sea water intrusion related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer parizi et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2018 reported the comparable values of chloride in post monsoon 21 895 mg l and pre monsoon 19 1976 mg l from coastal aquifers of tamil nadu south india the contribution of so4 2 content in the groundwater is due to the application of soil amendments like gypsum and chemical fertilizers of sulphates the presence of gypsum anhydrate and oxidation of sulphide minerals are also contribute the higher concentration of so4 2 in groundwater han et al 2013 in natural conditions the value of nitrate no3 does not exceed 10 mg l in groundwater cushing and kantrowitz ih 1973 typically the nitrate pollution comes from nitrogen compounds in sewage and waste water ferrer et al 2019 thus the higher no3 values 6 52 17 34 mg l and 6 24 27 61 mg l during pre and post monsoon seasons were beyond the limit is an indication of man made pollution in the kavaratti island the no3 is a non lithological source however the poor sanitary condition and indiscriminate usage of nitrogen containing fertilizers are also responsible for the high content of no3 in groundwater menon et al 2005 3 2 drinking water quality water quality index wqi is a technique of rating which delivers the composite influence of individual water quality parameters on the overall quality of water for human consumption mitra 1998 the wqi is helpful to determine the groundwater quality for drinking purposes and can reduce the large volume of information into a single value to express the data in a simplified logical manner achari et al 2017 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method of algorithm was used in the wqi map the wqi map was generated with generated by using the software arc gis version 10 3 wqi was analysed by weighted arithmetic water quality index method brown et al 1972 by using the following expression 1 w q i w i q i w i 2 w i 1 s i si standard permissible value of particular parameter who 3 q i v o v i 100 v s v i vo observed value or mean of the observed values of any parameter vi ideal value of particular parameter 0 for all parameters except ph vs standard permissible value of particular parameter according to sahu and sikdar 2008 the wqi values are classified into different categories as follows 50 excellent water 50 100 good water 100 200 poor water 200 300 very poor water 300 water unfit for drinking the relative weight of water quality parameters in the present study were shown in table 1 the result of water quality index wqi depicted in the spatial interpolation map fig 2 the water quality index values of each sampling stations with their classification type also presented in table 5 according to the wqi values 66 8 of sample during pre monsoon and 93 9 of samples in post monsoon are unsuitable for drinking purposes during the pre monsoon wqi values are ranged from 38 to 211 with a mean value of 108 35 according to the wqi values 66 8 of samples in pre monsoon w1 w10 w13 w14 w15 w16 w17 w19 and w20 falling in unfit type while 17 59 of samples w2 w5 w7 w8 w11 and w12 fall in the poor category also 12 32 of the samples w4 w6 and w9 coming under as the very poor category and rest of 4 1 samples w3 and w18 exhibited as good quality water for drinking purpose the wqi values of the post monsoon ranged from 48 to 645 with a mean value of 384 65 during the post monsoon 93 89 samples were w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w8 w9 w10 w13 w14 w15 w17 w18 and w20 falls under unfit criteria and which is unsuitable for human consumption whereas only 0 62 of sample w1 fall in good 4 82 in very poor w7 w11 w12 and w19 and 0 66 w16 of ground water sample is exhibited as poor quality the over exploitation of aquifer and sea water intrusion in to the fresh water zones causes the unsuitability of the ground water in coastal aquifers hamlat and guidoum 2018 the result of the present study comparable with the previous study reported by palliyakkal and rajan 2018 where the 35 71 of the samples fall in unsuitable condition for human consumption while in the present study the majority of the samples 93 89 in post monsoon is unsuitable than pre monsoon season the wqi result in both seasons showed that the study area has strong relation with proximity to sea coast most of the wqi values increases with increasing the proximity of sampling station to the sea coast the very poor water quality is noted along northwestern part of the study area might be due to the influence of ion exchange reaction and impact of domestic activities in the island the limited number of samples does not influence the proximity of the sea coast where they performing the artificial recharging of the rain water 3 3 mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry in this study groundwater hydrochemical facies and constituent water type have been identified using hill piper trilinear diagram piper arthur 1994 there are three types of hydrochemical facies were observed in different aquifers of the study area fig 3 a during the pre monsoon season the water samples w1 w3 w4 w5 and w14 shows saline water type with hydrochemical facies of na k cl so4 2 majority of the groundwater samples fall in sodium dominant cation type to chloride dominant anion type high sodium concentration is due to the mixing of sea water and cation exchange processes in the mixing zones in those mixing zones the sea water exchanges sodium ions for calcium in the aquifer this enhances the increases of ca mg hco3 type of water to na cl type emenike et al 2018 furthermore the stations such as w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 w11 w12 w13 w15 and w16 fall in temporary hardness water type with hydro chemical facies of ca2 mg2 hco3 respectively here the water shows non dominant cations and bicarbonate anion characteristics as represented in the plot fig 3a groundwater from stations such as w2 w17 w18 w19 and w20 fall in mixed regions in the diamond plot because of the overlapping of adjacent prominent hydro chemical facies hence in these regions a clear water type cannot be identified during post monsoon season most of the groundwater sources depict changes in their hydrochemical facies and shifting their water type due to the dilution of monsoon effect and regular interaction of seawater the groundwater samples from stations w2 w3 w4 w6 w8 w10 and w15 have saline water type na k cl so4 2 whereas stations w7 w9 w11 w12 and w19 falls in temporary hardness water type region ca2 mg2 hco3 of the diamond plot fig 3b the na cl type of water indicates the sea water intrusion and anthropogenic activities in the coastal region the magnesium dominant groundwater is occurring in dolomite terrain in the present study dissolution of limestone and the consequent release of magnesium contribute the excess of magnesium in the ground water vinayachandran et al 2013 the perforation like drilling which acts as a conduit for up coning of sea water affects the ground water quality the island is composed of coral reefs and material derived from them the hard coral limestone is generally exposed along the coast during low tides and is also seen in well sections of the island ground water occurs under phreatic conditions as a thin lens floating over the sea water in hydraulic continuity with it and hence is influenced by tidal fluctuations the position and the thickness of the interface between fresh and saline water mainly depends on the diurnal tidal fluctuation ground water recharge and draft and dispersion of the flow pattern the sampling stations such as w1 w13 w14 w16 w17 w18 and w20 got a mixed behavior and failed to show any of the four major water types sampling station w5 alone falls in permanent hardness water type with hydrochemical facies of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 having magnesium dominant cation to chloride dominant water type the high sodium content among cation in the groundwater during the study period could be due to the halite dissolution which was enhanced by the evapo transpiration and silicate weathering processes ravikumar and somashekar 2017 the dissolution of the dolomite is responsible for the ca2 mg2 contribution in the groundwater samples latifa et al 2017 prasanth et al 2012 also reported the predominance of ca2 mg2 in post monsoon from southern coastal stretch of kerala the dominance of bicarbonate and sulphate than calcium and magnesium reflect that silicate weathering was predominated in the study area therefore which responsible for the increase in concentration of hco3 in groundwater joji 2019 4 assessment of ground water for irrigation 4 1 magnesium adsorption ratio mar or magnesium hazard mh generally in most groundwater resources ca2 and mg2 ions maintain a state of stability hem 1985 in equilibrium more content of mg2 in water will harmfully affect the crop yields index of magnesium hazard more than 50 would harmfully affect the crop yield and soil becomes more alkaline paliwal 1972 the magnesium hazard was calculated by the following equations 4 m a r m g 2 100 c a 2 m g 2 in the study area values of magnesium hazard falls in the range of 7 81 25 to 92 in pre and post monsoon respectively table 6 according to magnesium hazard 92 47 of groundwater during the post monsoon was unsuitable for irrigation purpose except for stations such as w1 w12 and w16 where mar 50 however during pre monsoon most of the sampling stations shows the ratio of mar 50 it is clear that groundwater samples from station w1 is suitable for irrigation during both post and pre monsoon seasons groundwater from the stations w1 w7 w8 w9 w10 w 17 and w19 are unsuitable for irrigation purposes for both of the study periods as where the mar 50 respectively 4 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio is commonly used as an index for evaluating the sodium hazard associated with irrigation water supply irrigation standard of water is categorized based on sar who 2011 therefore evaluation of sodium hazard is essential for irrigation purposes the sar is defined as the square root of the ratio of the sodium na to calcium magnesium ca mg it can be calculated by the following equation 5 s a r n a c a m g 2 the sar values of the present study ranges from 0 4 to 11 4 with an average of 2 49 during pre monsoon and 0 9 to 90 2 with an average of 10 84 in post monsoon table 7 according to richards 1954 the sar value 10 is categorized as excellent water for irrigation in the present study groundwater collected in pre monsoon included in low sodium water type with the sar 10 class s1 except in station w5 where it was slightly increased to medium sodium water class s2 type both are considered as suitable for irrigation purposes during post monsoon most of the groundwater sources remained in excellent to good category class s1 and s2 however groundwater collected from station w2 and w15 become degraded to class s3 that indicates high sodium hazard and bad water quality in terms of irrigation station w3 got sar 26 with very high sodium water that is considered as poor water quality and unsuitable for irrigation 4 3 sodium percentage na sodium is reacting with soil and reducing its permeability which indicates that the concentration of sodium is very important for classification in irrigation water quality high content of sodium in irrigation water is adsorbed by clay particles of the soil this results in the exchange of na in water and displacing of ca2 and mg2 from the soil the permeability of the soil was decreased with poor internal drainage and resulting the limited air and water circulation during the wet conditions when it dry these type of soil became change to hard salesh and al ruwaigh 1999 the sodium percentage of the sample was calculated from the following formula 6 na na k 100 ca mg na k ionic concentrations in meq l the na analysis in the present study reveals that the majority of the samples were found to be good for irrigation purposes during post monsoon while in monsoon the samples were found to be doubtful to good category for irrigation table 8 in general the higher na are indicating the predominance of ion exchange and weathering of rock the lithological units of the study area srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 based on sodium percentage classification wilcox 1955 three w10 w16 and w18 samples during the pre monsoon and two samples w5 and w12 during post monsoon were coming under the class of excellent category 4 4 wilcox diagram wilcox diagram for ground water samples of the study area presented in fig 4 in the present study ec and tds values of groundwater samples during the pre monsoon the wilcox plot highlights 31 80 of water samples were noticed from the zone of good to permissible category while 24 97 belongs to doubtful 20 14 falls in unsuitable 16 84 belongs to permissible to doubtful and remaining 6 24 coming under excellent category for irrigation use in post monsoon season the wilcox plot depicted in 51 8 in doubtful 24 25 in permissible 20 44 in good and rest of 3 49 falls under the excellent category for irrigation use compare to the pre monsoon post monsoon season ground water samples exhibited as permissible to doubtful category previous study of raheem et al 2018 also reported that groundwater from kavaratti the sar values of 50 of water samples falls within the range of excellent to good category and 35 7 of samples unsuitable for irrigational purposes 4 5 salinization hazard based on ec and sodicity hazard based on sar percentage of sodium is plotted against conductivity is designated as a wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 the plot classifies the suitability of groundwater into five fields fresh water zone samples coming under the category excellent and good on the basis of ec and tds ayers and westco 1985 the salinity laboratory of the united states proposed a classification of irrigation water quality based on electrical conductivity ec of water and sar in which ec is taken as a salinity hazard and sar is taken as alkalinity hazard the sar and ec values of the water samples of the study area were plotted in the graphical diagram of irrigated water us salinity laboratory 1954 during the pre monsoon the entire fresh water of the island falls into the c3s1 high salinity low sodium c3s2 high salinity medium sodium and c3s3 high salinity high sodium categories which reveals that the high saline water samples are unable for irrigation purposes fig 5 also during the post monsoon the samples were falling in to c3s1 high salinity low sodium c4s1 very high salinity low sodium c4s2 very high salinity medium sodium c4s4 very high salinity very high sodium and c3s4 high salinity very high sodium categories fig 6 in both seasons a relatively high salinity hazard was correlated with sea water intrusion in the ground water higher demand of groundwater in the regions results in over exploitation and subsequent sea water intrusion which increases the percentage of na2 content in the sea water kumar et al 2009 the ec of the groundwater in the samples vary from 884 to 2313 μs cm pre monsoon and 1023 6874 μs cm post monsoon respectively the higher value of ec in groundwater is due to the presence of high dissolved solids which may subscribe the conductivity and has direct influence on the percentage of total solids srinivas et al 2000 the value of ec 1500 μs cm and cl 250 mg l are more than the permissible limit isi 1983 in both study periods particularly in post monsoon which is due to the influence saline water intrusion raheem et al 2018 reported the highest conductivity 42 800 μs cm in kavaratti groundwater samples which also corroborate the present results classification of ground water on the basis of variation of electrical conductivity ec 1500 μs cm coming under type 1 enrichment salts are low type ii where the ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm enrichment salts are medium and type iii ec 3000 μs cm enrichment salts are high respectively according to these classifications the groundwater samples coming under the type ii and type iii in pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively 4 6 hydro chemical facies evolution diagram hfe d gimenez forcada 2014 proposed the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d to interpret the effect of sea water intrusion within coastal regions the diagram demarcates two main phases such as freshening and intrusion zone based on the major ion chemistry and ion exchange processes the x axis represents the base exchange reactions and y axis prevail the mixing phenomenon this multi rectangular triangular diagram can help to interpret the sweater and freshwater mixing processes in coastal environment seenipandi 2019 the hfe d was generated by using excel spread sheet hydro chemical facies evolution diagram of the present study presented in fig 7 a hfe diagram of the post monsoon season shows 12 hydrological faces as follows 1 mixna cl 2 mixca cl 3 mixca mixhco3 4 mixna hco3 5 mixna mixcl 6 mixmg co3 7 mixca hco3 8 mg hco3 9 mixca cl 10 mixmg cl 11 ca cl 12 and mg cl during the pre monsoon also 12 hydrological faces are detected as follows 1 na cl 2 mixna hco3 3

and sea water field which indicating the zone of mixing in the hfe plot most of the samples fall under the sea water intrusion zone na cl some of the samples fall under the succession of faces along the mixing line the samples near by the vicinity of the sea experiences the sea water intrusion that showed the beneath of the plot and there is a remarked reverse ion exchange reaction of na ca that is recognized by the characteristics of ca cl faces indicating the initial increasing of the salinity hfe d reveals that most of the samples fall under the sea water intrusion zone however some of the samples on the stage of succession to fresh water zone respectively 4 7 revelle s coefficient revelle s coefficient is considered as an important criterion to determine the sea water intrusion in groundwater samples the values of r are considered as the valid indication of seawater intrusion revelle s co efficient r 1 indicates an intrusion of salt water to the groundwater aquifers lee and song 2007 in the present study the degree of saline water intrusion was determined by the revelle index ri revelle 1941 as indicated in equation 7 ri rcl rhco3 rco3 where r meq l cl chloride hco3 bicarbonate co3 carbonate according to revelle 1941 ri values are classified into three categories 0 5 meq l unaffected 0 5 6 6meq l slightly affected and 6 6 meq l strongly affected kavaratti island is completely situated in the proximity of the sea there still exist the freshwater pockets fig 8 during the pre monsoon period r 1 is a characteristic feature of groundwater which is freshwater in origin the serious contamination of groundwater with sea water is observed in station w2 and w3 during post monsoon period as r 10 which is very near to the proximity of the sea the higher concentration of cl persist in the post monsoon indicates the influence of sea water in the study area roy et al 2018 4 8 hydrochemical characters controlling the ground water chemistry hydro chemical facies analysis is an essential tool for determining the pattern of flow and origin of the chemical histories of the groundwater chung et al 2014 gibb s diagram is used to interpret the effect of hydro geochemical processes such as precipitation water rock interaction and evaporation on groundwater chemistry the assessment of groundwater is primarily depending on the relationship between underground rock formations and water compositions kalaivanan et al 2017 the reaction between subsurface water and the mineral of aquifer has a significant role in the quality of water that helps to understand the water genesis gibbs 1970 gibb s diagram shows three different regions such as rainfall dominance evaporation dominance and weathering dominance the gibb s diagram is explained in the basis of ratios of cation and anion as a function of tds gibb s ratio is calculated by using the following equation 8 ratio 1 for cation na k na k ca 9 ratio 2 for anion cl cl hco3 gibb s diagrams were constructed by plotting ratios of the dominant anions and cations with tds cl cl hco3 na k na k ca2 in the present study of pre monsoon season majority of the samples fall in evaporation dominant and rock water interaction field of the gibbs diagram fig 9 a and b also in the post monsoon most of the samples exhibited as the evaporation dominant area of the plot fig 10 a and b this reveals that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by the rock forming chemical weathering the samples fall in evaporation dominant zone show the process of evaporation in the groundwater which increases with increase in water level because of which lay the proximity to the sea surface todd 1980 this may increase the concentration of ion in the groundwater and the anthropogenic activities also affected the changes in ionic concentration of the groundwater samples in the study area 4 9 correlation analysis the results of correlation matrix during both seasons were different which showed significant seasonal variation of ground water in the study area in the present study the perfect correlation between ec and tds pre and post monsoon season indicates that ec is a measure of dissolved solids in the ground water since the correlation coefficient of na and cl is fairly high during the pre monsoon seasons table 9 strong positive correlation exhibit p 0 05 between mg th r 0 87 cl na r 0 77 ca th r 0 66 hco3 ph r 0 66 mg ph r 0 53 and slight correlation between th ph r 0 49 ec co3 r 0 43 no3 ph r 0 42 and so4 na r 0 42 this suggested that the presence of mg2 ca2 co3 hco3 cl and na2 were greatly influences the total hardness of the water and had great dependence of hardness on calcium magnesium chloride and sulphate bhunia et al 2018 reported the moderate correlation of th ph saha et al 2019 reported the correlation between ec and mg the correlation between ec and hco3 signifies the mineralization of the groundwater kumar et al 2017 fadili et al 2015 dadgar and payandeh 2017 reported the correlation between no3 and ph and found that the increasing level of no3 in groundwater decreasing the level of ph during the post monsoon season tables 9 and 10 the correlation matrices of the data shows positive correlation between ec tds r 0 86 ec th r 0 64 ec mg r 0 64 ec na r 0 57 ec k r 0 58 ec hco3 r 0 60 and ec cl r 0 56 respectively this suggested that the presence of th sodium magnesium potassium bicarbonate and chloride were greatly influenced the tds and ec concentration of the groundwater in the study area the similar correlation among the hydrochemical parameters was reported by reported by kaur et al 2017 5 conclusion this paper summarizes the assessment of groundwater quality in kavaratti island in view of drinking and irrigation purposes the overall water quality was evaluated by wqi method which reveals that the groundwater quality during pre monsoon is better than that of post monsoon the results are substantial to conclude that the ground water in the island is not suitable for drinking purposes and it is not recommended to consume it without proper treatment however seasonal variations of the hydrochemical data clearly suggest that the saline water intrusion is a major concern in the island the indices and diagrams depicting the irrigation suitability in pre monsoon samples are more suitable for irrigation than the post monsoon the geochemical characteristics of groundwater determined by the piper s diagram showed that the groundwater has a significant contribution from rainfall and its chemistry is governed by salt dissolution the groundwater quality parameters were compared with the who standards and found that many of the physical chemical parameters exceed the maximum permissible limits in post monsoon the major water types such as na k cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 was dominating in majority of the ground water samples among the ionic concentration hco3 and cl are the most dominant anions while na2 and mg2 are the dominant cation during the study based on the wqi classification only the 8 samples in the study area are perfectly suitable for drinking purposes the calculated parameters such as na sar ri and uss salinity diagram indicating that the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation purposes and there is a seasonal change in water quality high values of electrical conductivity and ions such as na2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were present in the water samples is due to the dissolution of mineral phases and the impact of anthropogenic influences the gibb s plots reveal that the groundwater chemistry was controlled by weathering of rocks and evaporation the study area belongs to saline water intrusion area and therefore implementing rain water harvesting by suitable artificial structures as well as rejuvenate the persisting dug wells can help to increase the availability of fresh ground water in the kavaratti island declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

12031,lakshadweep archipelago is comprised of several tiny coral atolls and scattered in the arabian sea off the south west of india ground water is the only available fresh water resource for the islanders the groundwater quality is decreased in this island due to population growth and anthropogenic activities like sewage dumping and agricultural activities for this study a total of 20 groundwater samples was collected randomly from the open wells that cover the entire area of the island the physico chemical parameters of groundwater were analysed in pre and post monsoon seasons during the year 2016 2017 the concentration of a majority of the chemical constituents exceeds the standards of who during post monsoon than pre monsoon season ec content exhibited the violation of drinking water quality standards the highest value of ec range 1023 6874 μs cm recorded in post monsoon than pre monsoon tds concentration range from 574 6 to 1503 4 mg l and 665 4468 mg l in pre and post monsoon seasons geochemical evolution diagram categories the groundwater facies into na k cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 in both seasons gibbs plot revealed that the evaporation is the dominant factor controlling the mechanism of ground water hydrochemistry the water quality index suggested that both pre monsoon and post monsoon around 93 95 of the samples are unsuitable for drinking purposes the suitability of groundwater for irrigation was studied by calculating the percent of sodium sodium adsorption ratio magnesium hazard and reveille s index the wilcox and ussl plots also indicated that most of the groundwater samples are found to be unsuitable for irrigation hfe diagram productively delineates that groundwater of the study area has strong influence of sea water in the fresh water aquifers the highest level of significant correlation was observed between mg th r 0 87 ec tds r 0 86 and cl na r 0 77 respectively as a whole it is observed that the groundwater is not suitable for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes due to the exceeding of chemical parameters from their standard limits therefore groundwater management measures may be worked out regionally to improve water quality by artificial recharge rain water harvesting periodic disinfection of the wells and saving the fresh water stocks in the island accordingly graphical abstract image 1 keywords atoll lagoon seasonal variability water quality kavaratti island groundwater 1 introduction lakshadweep archipelago is one of the most important spectacular island ecosystems consisting of 36 coral islands located in the arabian sea off the western coast of india groundwater is the only available freshwater resource for the islanders for drinking purposes kavaratti atoll is the capital of the lakshadweep group of islands which comprised of pristine white sand beaches and calm coral attached shallow lagoon anu et al 2007 the alternative sources of freshwater are limited due to the particular geography of these islands the groundwater resources of kavaratti island are exposed to an intensive utilization by an increasing population and agricultural activities which leads to severe damages to the freshwater supply of the island banerjee and singh 2011 2013 mondal et al 2009 singh et al 2009 atolls are the low lying reef carbonate land areas characterized by a series of narrow islands surrounding a shallowed seawater lagoon enclosing it either partially or fully falkland and custodio 1991 the excessive pumping from dug wells which leads to ingression of sea water and the effect of salinization has limited the availability of fresh water to the islanders sundaresan 1993 kavaratti island is highly vulnerable to groundwater scarcity and affected saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifers the aspect ratio of the island substantiates that the shape of the island has a significant role in the stability of freshwater resources in this region najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 the availability of fresh ground water occurs in the depth of 2 5 5 m and the freshwater lenses are depleted in times of low rainfall banerjee and singh 2013 prasad 2011 even at high rainfall events the groundwater level of the island seems to be persistent which indicates that the freshwater lens floating over the seawater gets re adjusted prasad and hameed 2010 in the coastal regions the magnitude of the sea water intrusion is influenced by the thickness or saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer ferreira and chachadi 2005 in small atoll islands the fresh groundwater lens is generally thin and had a brackish mixing zone usually separate fresh groundwater lens from underlying seawater werner et al 2017 the natural exchange between surface water and underlying aquifer can strongly influence the chemical composition and suitability of both water bodies findlay 1995 brunke and gonser 1997 soulsby et al 2005 the ever growing demand for freshwater human consumption become a worldwide concern the deterioration of the ground water in quality in the coastal aquifer is mainly due to strong agricultural development accompanied by low recharge infiltration to the phreatic aquifers and sea water intrusion alfarrah et al 2017 ben asher et al 2000 edmunds and milne 2001 the atoll islands are considered as the most vulnerable ecosystems worldwide because of freshwater scarcity and depletion of water resources due to climate change low elevation geographic remoteness and small land surface bailey et al 2014 atolls are very sensitive to seawater intrusion especially climate change has a potential role in causing inundation saltwater intrusion erosion and the change of aquifer geometry church et al 2006 petra 2009 the combined effect of buoyancy forces tides complex geology and human impacts creates the dynamics in fresh groundwater lens in atoll islands werner et al 2017 warrier and hameed 2006 the natural processes such as saline water intrusion wind driven sea spray and marine aerosols deposited on the top soil evaporation and interaction of groundwater with brines and sedimentary formation also causes the degradation of the ground water quality in coastal aquifers sanford et al 2007 the usability of the groundwater is immensely significant in regions that are geographically isolated systems like coral islands hence the submarine groundwater discharge has received rapid attention in recent decades especially the coral reef regions of tropical countries jiang et al 2018 the hydrogeological studies of lakshadweep island are found to be limited singh et al 2009 studied the hydrogeological characteristics of the groundwater from the andrott island in lakshadweep and identified the potential fresh groundwater resources with vulnerable parts of the island prasad and hameed 2010 reported the groundwater fluctuation level at 0 07 m 0 50 m in the minicoy island of lakshadweep najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 reported the role of rainfall and surplus in controlling the groundwater quality of lakshadweep joy et al 2019 reported the trace element deposition in the lagoon and shores of kavaratti and found that lead pb remains as an eco toxicological risk though the island receives high rainfall the lack of surface storage and limited ground water storage capacity is sustain the fresh water is occurring as a small lens floating over the saltwater which makes the freshwater more precious commodity due the dense population and over exploitation the waste water mixed with freshwater resources is common in the island therefore a better understanding of groundwater resources is vital for addressing the threats to groundwater resources especially the fresh groundwater lens in the island a proper understanding of the groundwater condition is important in order to meet this increasing demand and to formulate future development and management strategies the evaluation of groundwater in terms of quality availability and distribution is necessary to meet the increasing demand for freshwater and thereby sustain the quality of life on the island hence the present study aims to investigate the groundwater quality in terms of drinking and irrigation purposes along with the seasonal change of the water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lakshadweep archipelago in the southwest arabian sea consist of several small oceanic island between latitude 10 12 n and longitude 72 74 e the present study area covers the coastal aquifer of the kavaratti island which located in the central part of the lakshadweep archipelago between the latitude of 10 31 50 032 n to 10 35 3 713 n and longitude of 72 36 31 411 e to 72 39 34 144 e with an area of 8 96 km2 the island comprised of a vast lagoon in its western side and fringing reef in the eastern part without a lagoon in between the sediment of the island and the lagoon composed of coralline materials the west part of kavaratti the lagoon water covers 5 5 km that oriented towards north east and southwest direction and occupied with a shallow lagoon of depth of 2 m joy et al 2019 the maximum length of the island is about 5 5 km and maximum of 1 4 km width and it is oriented in a ne sw direction the ground water in the island is a delicate balance with sea water and which is floating over the saline water the depth to water table varies between 0 5 m and 3 5 m below the ground level the slope of the water table is towards the lagoon than towards the open sea prakash et al 2014 prasad 2011 the fresh water on this island occurs as lenses of various dimensions floating over the sea water in hydraulic continuity with the sea water the tidal influence is seen in the wells of the island and the water is periodically renewed by rainfall varma et al 1989 the island has surface layer of approximately 1 2 m thickness of coral debris followed by compact but porous crust of limestone conglomerate the lagoons of the lakshadweep island are enclosed by coral reefs and which are connected to the open sea through various openings chakraborty and ramesh 1997 the seasonal variation of the temperature recorded was 27 5 c to 31 6 c suresh and mathew 1993 the main reason for the seasonable variability is the sst changes caused by the upwelling during the south west monsoon chakraborty and ramesh 1997 a large change of both physical environment and chemical composition are known to occur in the island is response to the monsoon elnino and indian ocean dipole chakraborty and ramesh 1997 the transport of the water from sea to lagoon is controlled by the action of surf which breaks across the reef 2 2 sample collection and hydrochemical analysis in kavaratti island about 1325 dug wells filter points are used for domestic purposes the population density is very high in kavaratti island and is around 2920 km2 and each house is having limited area of land and also is having at least one well system in the present study a total of 20 groundwater samples were collected from the kavaratti island which covers the entire area of the island and most of the wells are very closely situated therefore we chosen the cluster of wells by keeping a ratio of 1 66 for a single sampling procedure fig 1 shows the distribution of wells sampled from the kavaratti island and almost showing the equal distribution of groundwater sampling the average depth of the dug wells rage from 0 6 to 4 2 m with depth to the water ranges from 0 4 to 4 2 m najeeb and vinayachandran 2011 the groundwater samples were collected during the pre monsoon and post monsoon season of the year 2016 2017 the water samples were taken from the 0 5 m below the water table the diameter of the wells in lakshadweep varies from 1 to 2 0 m and the average thickness of the aquifer is 0 04 m 0 56 m the collected samples were stored in pre cleaned polythene bottles of 1 l capacity all samples are kept in 4 c in the laboratory until analysis water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a portable water quality

major ions na and k were assessed by means of flame photometer elico cl 378 ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl ions were analysed by volumetric methods sulphate so4 2 and nitrate no3 was estimated using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv1800 all the analyses were performed using the standard procedures published elsewhere apha 2012 suitability of groundwater for domestic purposes was evaluated by comparing the values of different water quality parameters with the water quality standard of the world health organization who 2011 and bis guidelines for water quality table 2 the pearson s correlation matrices of the water quality parameters of both seasons were analysed by using spss version 16 0 for windows aquachem version 5 1 software was used for generating salinity diagrams and piper diagrams and wilcox diagrams respectively geographical information system gis 10 3 was used for generating study area map and water quality index map respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physiochemical analysis the physicochemical characteristics of the analytical data of the well water samples are presented in tables 3 and 4 the ph in the study area ranges from 7 26 to 8 85 7 84 0 46 during the pre monsoon and 7 27 to 8 38 7 8 0 28 during the post monsoon period the results found that the groundwater samples in the kavaratti island are mainly alkaline in nature the ph of the water is a very important indicator for its quality and controlled by the equilibrium of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate present in the ground water hem 1991 ghandour et al 1985 the ph value above 8 5 often caused by the high carbonate content co3 2 the high co3 2 causes the calcium and magnesium ions to form insoluble minerals leaving the sodium as the dominant ions in the water rabeiy 2017 the ionic strength and the mineralization were determined mostly measured using electrical conductivity ec the who and bis standard for ec is 1400 μs cm who 2011 and bis 2012 the ec μs cm of the ground water samples of the study area ranges from 884 to 2313 1507 2 397 53 and 1023 6874 3005 9 1998 39 during pre and post monsoon period singh et al 2009 previously reported the variation of ec ranges from 598 to 3550 and 457 to 1515 during pre and post monsoon period from the ground waters samples of lakshadweep island saraswat et al 2019 reported the range of ec μs cm from 1156 83 to 3478 12 in groundwater samples of western coastal aquifer in the state of gujarat india highest values of ec in the present study 1023 6874 μs cm during the post monsoon period indicates the presence of high amount of inorganic substances in the island higher values of ec indicate the enrichment of salts in the groundwater and depend up on the temperature concentration and the type of various ions present hem 1985 the higher values of ec suggest high content of dissolved solids and thus the ionic strength also increased along with anthropogenic inputs the effect of ph also increases the dissolution processes which eventually increases the values of ec prasanth et al 2012 the concentration of total dissolved solids ranges from 574 6 to 1503 4 mg l 979 68 258 39 and 665 4468 mg l 1953 84 1298 96 during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively total dissolved solids tds in groundwater mainly contributed by the dissolution of salts present in the unsaturated zones through the percolation of rain water anoubam et al 2017 senthilkumar et al 2017 reported the highest tds values in the range of 420 1734 mg l from coastal aquifers of south india similarly previous studies of mondal et al 2009 reported the comparable values of tds ranged from 389 to 2308 mg l from aquifers of lakshadweep islands the residual waste migrates down to the water table and discharged into the wells also contribute the higher tds in the study area in both seasons it varies from the desirable limit 500 mg l of indian standard for drinking water the residual waste migrates down to the water table and discharged into the wells also contribute the higher tds in the study area in both seasons it varies the desirable limit 500 mg l of indian standard for drinking water the dominant cation in the present study exhibited na ca mg and k pattern of variance similarly the major anions are in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 respectively the concentration of na mg l during pre and post monsoon season ranges from 17 32 to 267 1 and 46 35 to 2564 respectively similarly the concentration of ca2 mg l during pre and post monsoon season ranges from 15 27 to 87 33 and 45 26 to 456 36 respectively the range of mg mg l ranges from 1 02 to 84 25 and 26 56 to 2875 56 during pre and post monsoon season respectively the concentration of k during pre and post monsoon season varied from 5 31 to 66 85 and 3 58 721 mg l respectively the higher content of na than ca2 to the total cation is due to the ion exchange precipitation of caco3 silicate weathering and dissolution of soil salts stored by evaporation and anthropogenic origin todd 1980 the higher content of ca2 and mg2 in ground water is due to the presence of calcite and dolomite minerals sharma et al 2017 usually the presence of calcium in ground water is due to the weathering of rocks and minerals brindha et al 2014 in contrast to the other cations the k content observed to be low because of more resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering and fixation of k ions on clay product while the increased content of k ions are could be due to the application of chemical fertilizers in to the study area hem 1985 similarly in the case of anions the values of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 during pre monsoon season ranges from 44 64 to 291 16 mg l 24 02 384 3 mg l 3 16 42 69 mg l and 6 52 17 34 mg l respectively similarly during the post monsoon season the values of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 were rages from 164 68 to 1854 mg l 74 68 4785 mg l 8 64 48 56 mg l and 6 24 27 61 mg l respectively the maximum permissible limit of total hardens for drinking water is 500 mg l who 2011 in pre monsoon season total hardness th ranges from 62 55 to 481 97 mg l with an average of 229 62 mg l while in post monsoon th ranges from 247 94 to 2930 69 mg l with an average of 1052 02 mg l respectively hardness of the water increases due to the increase of alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium narasimha and sudharshan 2017 the carbonate and bicarbonate are probably derived from the weathering of silicate rocks and dissolution of carbonate precipitates jeong 2001 the higher concentration of hco3 384 3 mg l indicates the dominance of mineral dissolution in the ground water kumaran et al 2015 the dominance of the hco3 in both seasons is due to the interaction of coral formation with aquifer mondal et al 2009 according to the who 2011 standards the maximum permissible limit of chloride in groundwater is 600 mg l the higher concentration of cl persist in the post monsoon indicates the influence of sea water in the study area roy et al 2018 the increased concentration of chloride in groundwater is an indication of the sea water intrusion raju and ram 2011 the extend and magnitude of sea water intrusion related to the saturated thickness of the aquifer parizi et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2018 reported the comparable values of chloride in post monsoon 21 895 mg l and pre monsoon 19 1976 mg l from coastal aquifers of tamil nadu south india the contribution of so4 2 content in the groundwater is due to the application of soil amendments like gypsum and chemical fertilizers of sulphates the presence of gypsum anhydrate and oxidation of sulphide minerals are also contribute the higher concentration of so4 2 in groundwater han et al 2013 in natural conditions the value of nitrate no3 does not exceed 10 mg l in groundwater cushing and kantrowitz ih 1973 typically the nitrate pollution comes from nitrogen compounds in sewage and waste water ferrer et al 2019 thus the higher no3 values 6 52 17 34 mg l and 6 24 27 61 mg l during pre and post monsoon seasons were beyond the limit is an indication of man made pollution in the kavaratti island the no3 is a non lithological source however the poor sanitary condition and indiscriminate usage of nitrogen containing fertilizers are also responsible for the high content of no3 in groundwater menon et al 2005 3 2 drinking water quality water quality index wqi is a technique of rating which delivers the composite influence of individual water quality parameters on the overall quality of water for human consumption mitra 1998 the wqi is helpful to determine the groundwater quality for drinking purposes and can reduce the large volume of information into a single value to express the data in a simplified logical manner achari et al 2017 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method of algorithm was used in the wqi map the wqi map was generated with generated by using the software arc gis version 10 3 wqi was analysed by weighted arithmetic water quality index method brown et al 1972 by using the following expression 1 w q i w i q i w i 2 w i 1 s i si standard permissible value of particular parameter who 3 q i v o v i 100 v s v i vo observed value or mean of the observed values of any parameter vi ideal value of particular parameter 0 for all parameters except ph vs standard permissible value of particular parameter according to sahu and sikdar 2008 the wqi values are classified into different categories as follows 50 excellent water 50 100 good water 100 200 poor water 200 300 very poor water 300 water unfit for drinking the relative weight of water quality parameters in the present study were shown in table 1 the result of water quality index wqi depicted in the spatial interpolation map fig 2 the water quality index values of each sampling stations with their classification type also presented in table 5 according to the wqi values 66 8 of sample during pre monsoon and 93 9 of samples in post monsoon are unsuitable for drinking purposes during the pre monsoon wqi values are ranged from 38 to 211 with a mean value of 108 35 according to the wqi values 66 8 of samples in pre monsoon w1 w10 w13 w14 w15 w16 w17 w19 and w20 falling in unfit type while 17 59 of samples w2 w5 w7 w8 w11 and w12 fall in the poor category also 12 32 of the samples w4 w6 and w9 coming under as the very poor category and rest of 4 1 samples w3 and w18 exhibited as good quality water for drinking purpose the wqi values of the post monsoon ranged from 48 to 645 with a mean value of 384 65 during the post monsoon 93 89 samples were w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w8 w9 w10 w13 w14 w15 w17 w18 and w20 falls under unfit criteria and which is unsuitable for human consumption whereas only 0 62 of sample w1 fall in good 4 82 in very poor w7 w11 w12 and w19 and 0 66 w16 of ground water sample is exhibited as poor quality the over exploitation of aquifer and sea water intrusion in to the fresh water zones causes the unsuitability of the ground water in coastal aquifers hamlat and guidoum 2018 the result of the present study comparable with the previous study reported by palliyakkal and rajan 2018 where the 35 71 of the samples fall in unsuitable condition for human consumption while in the present study the majority of the samples 93 89 in post monsoon is unsuitable than pre monsoon season the wqi result in both seasons showed that the study area has strong relation with proximity to sea coast most of the wqi values increases with increasing the proximity of sampling station to the sea coast the very poor water quality is noted along northwestern part of the study area might be due to the influence of ion exchange reaction and impact of domestic activities in the island the limited number of samples does not influence the proximity of the sea coast where they performing the artificial recharging of the rain water 3 3 mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry in this study groundwater hydrochemical facies and constituent water type have been identified using hill piper trilinear diagram piper arthur 1994 there are three types of hydrochemical facies were observed in different aquifers of the study area fig 3 a during the pre monsoon season the water samples w1 w3 w4 w5 and w14 shows saline water type with hydrochemical facies of na k cl so4 2 majority of the groundwater samples fall in sodium dominant cation type to chloride dominant anion type high sodium concentration is due to the mixing of sea water and cation exchange processes in the mixing zones in those mixing zones the sea water exchanges sodium ions for calcium in the aquifer this enhances the increases of ca mg hco3 type of water to na cl type emenike et al 2018 furthermore the stations such as w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 w11 w12 w13 w15 and w16 fall in temporary hardness water type with hydro chemical facies of ca2 mg2 hco3 respectively here the water shows non dominant cations and bicarbonate anion characteristics as represented in the plot fig 3a groundwater from stations such as w2 w17 w18 w19 and w20 fall in mixed regions in the diamond plot because of the overlapping of adjacent prominent hydro chemical facies hence in these regions a clear water type cannot be identified during post monsoon season most of the groundwater sources depict changes in their hydrochemical facies and shifting their water type due to the dilution of monsoon effect and regular interaction of seawater the groundwater samples from stations w2 w3 w4 w6 w8 w10 and w15 have saline water type na k cl so4 2 whereas stations w7 w9 w11 w12 and w19 falls in temporary hardness water type region ca2 mg2 hco3 of the diamond plot fig 3b the na cl type of water indicates the sea water intrusion and anthropogenic activities in the coastal region the magnesium dominant groundwater is occurring in dolomite terrain in the present study dissolution of limestone and the consequent release of magnesium contribute the excess of magnesium in the ground water vinayachandran et al 2013 the perforation like drilling which acts as a conduit for up coning of sea water affects the ground water quality the island is composed of coral reefs and material derived from them the hard coral limestone is generally exposed along the coast during low tides and is also seen in well sections of the island ground water occurs under phreatic conditions as a thin lens floating over the sea water in hydraulic continuity with it and hence is influenced by tidal fluctuations the position and the thickness of the interface between fresh and saline water mainly depends on the diurnal tidal fluctuation ground water recharge and draft and dispersion of the flow pattern the sampling stations such as w1 w13 w14 w16 w17 w18 and w20 got a mixed behavior and failed to show any of the four major water types sampling station w5 alone falls in permanent hardness water type with hydrochemical facies of ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 having magnesium dominant cation to chloride dominant water type the high sodium content among cation in the groundwater during the study period could be due to the halite dissolution which was enhanced by the evapo transpiration and silicate weathering processes ravikumar and somashekar 2017 the dissolution of the dolomite is responsible for the ca2 mg2 contribution in the groundwater samples latifa et al 2017 prasanth et al 2012 also reported the predominance of ca2 mg2 in post monsoon from southern coastal stretch of kerala the dominance of bicarbonate and sulphate than calcium and magnesium reflect that silicate weathering was predominated in the study area therefore which responsible for the increase in concentration of hco3 in groundwater joji 2019 4 assessment of ground water for irrigation 4 1 magnesium adsorption ratio mar or magnesium hazard mh generally in most groundwater resources ca2 and mg2 ions maintain a state of stability hem 1985 in equilibrium more content of mg2 in water will harmfully affect the crop yields index of magnesium hazard more than 50 would harmfully affect the crop yield and soil becomes more alkaline paliwal 1972 the magnesium hazard was calculated by the following equations 4 m a r m g 2 100 c a 2 m g 2 in the study area values of magnesium hazard falls in the range of 7 81 25 to 92 in pre and post monsoon respectively table 6 according to magnesium hazard 92 47 of groundwater during the post monsoon was unsuitable for irrigation purpose except for stations such as w1 w12 and w16 where mar 50 however during pre monsoon most of the sampling stations shows the ratio of mar 50 it is clear that groundwater samples from station w1 is suitable for irrigation during both post and pre monsoon seasons groundwater from the stations w1 w7 w8 w9 w10 w 17 and w19 are unsuitable for irrigation purposes for both of the study periods as where the mar 50 respectively 4 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium adsorption ratio is commonly used as an index for evaluating the sodium hazard associated with irrigation water supply irrigation standard of water is categorized based on sar who 2011 therefore evaluation of sodium hazard is essential for irrigation purposes the sar is defined as the square root of the ratio of the sodium na to calcium magnesium ca mg it can be calculated by the following equation 5 s a r n a c a m g 2 the sar values of the present study ranges from 0 4 to 11 4 with an average of 2 49 during pre monsoon and 0 9 to 90 2 with an average of 10 84 in post monsoon table 7 according to richards 1954 the sar value 10 is categorized as excellent water for irrigation in the present study groundwater collected in pre monsoon included in low sodium water type with the sar 10 class s1 except in station w5 where it was slightly increased to medium sodium water class s2 type both are considered as suitable for irrigation purposes during post monsoon most of the groundwater sources remained in excellent to good category class s1 and s2 however groundwater collected from station w2 and w15 become degraded to class s3 that indicates high sodium hazard and bad water quality in terms of irrigation station w3 got sar 26 with very high sodium water that is considered as poor water quality and unsuitable for irrigation 4 3 sodium percentage na sodium is reacting with soil and reducing its permeability which indicates that the concentration of sodium is very important for classification in irrigation water quality high content of sodium in irrigation water is adsorbed by clay particles of the soil this results in the exchange of na in water and displacing of ca2 and mg2 from the soil the permeability of the soil was decreased with poor internal drainage and resulting the limited air and water circulation during the wet conditions when it dry these type of soil became change to hard salesh and al ruwaigh 1999 the sodium percentage of the sample was calculated from the following formula 6 na na k 100 ca mg na k ionic concentrations in meq l the na analysis in the present study reveals that the majority of the samples were found to be good for irrigation purposes during post monsoon while in monsoon the samples were found to be doubtful to good category for irrigation table 8 in general the higher na are indicating the predominance of ion exchange and weathering of rock the lithological units of the study area srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 based on sodium percentage classification wilcox 1955 three w10 w16 and w18 samples during the pre monsoon and two samples w5 and w12 during post monsoon were coming under the class of excellent category 4 4 wilcox diagram wilcox diagram for ground water samples of the study area presented in fig 4 in the present study ec and tds values of groundwater samples during the pre monsoon the wilcox plot highlights 31 80 of water samples were noticed from the zone of good to permissible category while 24 97 belongs to doubtful 20 14 falls in unsuitable 16 84 belongs to permissible to doubtful and remaining 6 24 coming under excellent category for irrigation use in post monsoon season the wilcox plot depicted in 51 8 in doubtful 24 25 in permissible 20 44 in good and rest of 3 49 falls under the excellent category for irrigation use compare to the pre monsoon post monsoon season ground water samples exhibited as permissible to doubtful category previous study of raheem et al 2018 also reported that groundwater from kavaratti the sar values of 50 of water samples falls within the range of excellent to good category and 35 7 of samples unsuitable for irrigational purposes 4 5 salinization hazard based on ec and sodicity hazard based on sar percentage of sodium is plotted against conductivity is designated as a wilcox diagram wilcox 1955 the plot classifies the suitability of groundwater into five fields fresh water zone samples coming under the category excellent and good on the basis of ec and tds ayers and westco 1985 the salinity laboratory of the united states proposed a classification of irrigation water quality based on electrical conductivity ec of water and sar in which ec is taken as a salinity hazard and sar is taken as alkalinity hazard the sar and ec values of the water samples of the study area were plotted in the graphical diagram of irrigated water us salinity laboratory 1954 during the pre monsoon the entire fresh water of the island falls into the c3s1 high salinity low sodium c3s2 high salinity medium sodium and c3s3 high salinity high sodium categories which reveals that the high saline water samples are unable for irrigation purposes fig 5 also during the post monsoon the samples were falling in to c3s1 high salinity low sodium c4s1 very high salinity low sodium c4s2 very high salinity medium sodium c4s4 very high salinity very high sodium and c3s4 high salinity very high sodium categories fig 6 in both seasons a relatively high salinity hazard was correlated with sea water intrusion in the ground water higher demand of groundwater in the regions results in over exploitation and subsequent sea water intrusion which increases the percentage of na2 content in the sea water kumar et al 2009 the ec of the groundwater in the samples vary from 884 to 2313 μs cm pre monsoon and 1023 6874 μs cm post monsoon respectively the higher value of ec in groundwater is due to the presence of high dissolved solids which may subscribe the conductivity and has direct influence on the percentage of total solids srinivas et al 2000 the value of ec 1500 μs cm and cl 250 mg l are more than the permissible limit isi 1983 in both study periods particularly in post monsoon which is due to the influence saline water intrusion raheem et al 2018 reported the highest conductivity 42 800 μs cm in kavaratti groundwater samples which also corroborate the present results classification of ground water on the basis of variation of electrical conductivity ec 1500 μs cm coming under type 1 enrichment salts are low type ii where the ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm enrichment salts are medium and type iii ec 3000 μs cm enrichment salts are high respectively according to these classifications the groundwater samples coming under the type ii and type iii in pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively 4 6 hydro chemical facies evolution diagram hfe d gimenez forcada 2014 proposed the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d to interpret the effect of sea water intrusion within coastal regions the diagram demarcates two main phases such as freshening and intrusion zone based on the major ion chemistry and ion exchange processes the x axis represents the base exchange reactions and y axis prevail the mixing phenomenon this multi rectangular triangular diagram can help to interpret the sweater and freshwater mixing processes in coastal environment seenipandi 2019 the hfe d was generated by using excel spread sheet hydro chemical facies evolution diagram of the present study presented in fig 7 a hfe diagram of the post monsoon season shows 12 hydrological faces as follows 1 mixna cl 2 mixca cl 3 mixca mixhco3 4 mixna hco3 5 mixna mixcl 6 mixmg co3 7 mixca hco3 8 mg hco3 9 mixca cl 10 mixmg cl 11 ca cl 12 and mg cl during the pre monsoon also 12 hydrological faces are detected as follows 1 na cl 2 mixna hco3 3 mixmg mixcl 4 mixmg mixhco3 5 mg hco3 6 mixca cl 7 mixca hco3 8 mixna hco3 9 mg mixhco3 10 mixmg cl 11 ca cl and 12 mg cl fig 7b in the hfe d a mixing line flows through the fresh water line cahco3 and sea water field which indicating the zone of mixing in the hfe plot most of the samples fall under the sea water intrusion zone na cl some of the samples fall under the succession of faces along the mixing line the samples near by the vicinity of the sea experiences the sea water intrusion that showed the beneath of the plot and there is a remarked reverse ion exchange reaction of na ca that is recognized by the characteristics of ca cl faces indicating the initial increasing of the salinity hfe d reveals that most of the samples fall under the sea water intrusion zone however some of the samples on the stage of succession to fresh water zone respectively 4 7 revelle s coefficient revelle s coefficient is considered as an important criterion to determine the sea water intrusion in groundwater samples the values of r are considered as the valid indication of seawater intrusion revelle s co efficient r 1 indicates an intrusion of salt water to the groundwater aquifers lee and song 2007 in the present study the degree of saline water intrusion was determined by the revelle index ri revelle 1941 as indicated in equation 7 ri rcl rhco3 rco3 where r meq l cl chloride hco3 bicarbonate co3 carbonate according to revelle 1941 ri values are classified into three categories 0 5 meq l unaffected 0 5 6 6meq l slightly affected and 6 6 meq l strongly affected kavaratti island is completely situated in the proximity of the sea there still exist the freshwater pockets fig 8 during the pre monsoon period r 1 is a characteristic feature of groundwater which is freshwater in origin the serious contamination of groundwater with sea water is observed in station w2 and w3 during post monsoon period as r 10 which is very near to the proximity of the sea the higher concentration of cl persist in the post monsoon indicates the influence of sea water in the study area roy et al 2018 4 8 hydrochemical characters controlling the ground water chemistry hydro chemical facies analysis is an essential tool for determining the pattern of flow and origin of the chemical histories of the groundwater chung et al 2014 gibb s diagram is used to interpret the effect of hydro geochemical processes such as precipitation water rock interaction and evaporation on groundwater chemistry the assessment of groundwater is primarily depending on the relationship between underground rock formations and water compositions kalaivanan et al 2017 the reaction between subsurface water and the mineral of aquifer has a significant role in the quality of water that helps to understand the water genesis gibbs 1970 gibb s diagram shows three different regions such as rainfall dominance evaporation dominance and weathering dominance the gibb s diagram is explained in the basis of ratios of cation and anion as a function of tds gibb s ratio is calculated by using the following equation 8 ratio 1 for cation na k na k ca 9 ratio 2 for anion cl cl hco3 gibb s diagrams were constructed by plotting ratios of the dominant anions and cations with tds cl cl hco3 na k na k ca2 in the present study of pre monsoon season majority of the samples fall in evaporation dominant and rock water interaction field of the gibbs diagram fig 9 a and b also in the post monsoon most of the samples exhibited as the evaporation dominant area of the plot fig 10 a and b this reveals that the groundwater chemistry is controlled by the rock forming chemical weathering the samples fall in evaporation dominant zone show the process of evaporation in the groundwater which increases with increase in water level because of which lay the proximity to the sea surface todd 1980 this may increase the concentration of ion in the groundwater and the anthropogenic activities also affected the changes in ionic concentration of the groundwater samples in the study area 4 9 correlation analysis the results of correlation matrix during both seasons were different which showed significant seasonal variation of ground water in the study area in the present study the perfect correlation between ec and tds pre and post monsoon season indicates that ec is a measure of dissolved solids in the ground water since the correlation coefficient of na and cl is fairly high during the pre monsoon seasons table 9 strong positive correlation exhibit p 0 05 between mg th r 0 87 cl na r 0 77 ca th r 0 66 hco3 ph r 0 66 mg ph r 0 53 and slight correlation between th ph r 0 49 ec co3 r 0 43 no3 ph r 0 42 and so4 na r 0 42 this suggested that the presence of mg2 ca2 co3 hco3 cl and na2 were greatly influences the total hardness of the water and had great dependence of hardness on calcium magnesium chloride and sulphate bhunia et al 2018 reported the moderate correlation of th ph saha et al 2019 reported the correlation between ec and mg the correlation between ec and hco3 signifies the mineralization of the groundwater kumar et al 2017 fadili et al 2015 dadgar and payandeh 2017 reported the correlation between no3 and ph and found that the increasing level of no3 in groundwater decreasing the level of ph during the post monsoon season tables 9 and 10 the correlation matrices of the data shows positive correlation between ec tds r 0 86 ec th r 0 64 ec mg r 0 64 ec na r 0 57 ec k r 0 58 ec hco3 r 0 60 and ec cl r 0 56 respectively this suggested that the presence of th sodium magnesium potassium bicarbonate and chloride were greatly influenced the tds and ec concentration of the groundwater in the study area the similar correlation among the hydrochemical parameters was reported by reported by kaur et al 2017 5 conclusion this paper summarizes the assessment of groundwater quality in kavaratti island in view of drinking and irrigation purposes the overall water quality was evaluated by wqi method which reveals that the groundwater quality during pre monsoon is better than that of post monsoon the results are substantial to conclude that the ground water in the island is not suitable for drinking purposes and it is not recommended to consume it without proper treatment however seasonal variations of the hydrochemical data clearly suggest that the saline water intrusion is a major concern in the island the indices and diagrams depicting the irrigation suitability in pre monsoon samples are more suitable for irrigation than the post monsoon the geochemical characteristics of groundwater determined by the piper s diagram showed that the groundwater has a significant contribution from rainfall and its chemistry is governed by salt dissolution the groundwater quality parameters were compared with the who standards and found that many of the physical chemical parameters exceed the maximum permissible limits in post monsoon the major water types such as na k cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 was dominating in majority of the ground water samples among the ionic concentration hco3 and cl are the most dominant anions while na2 and mg2 are the dominant cation during the study based on the wqi classification only the 8 samples in the study area are perfectly suitable for drinking purposes the calculated parameters such as na sar ri and uss salinity diagram indicating that the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation purposes and there is a seasonal change in water quality high values of electrical conductivity and ions such as na2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were present in the water samples is due to the dissolution of mineral phases and the impact of anthropogenic influences the gibb s plots reveal that the groundwater chemistry was controlled by weathering of rocks and evaporation the study area belongs to saline water intrusion area and therefore implementing rain water harvesting by suitable artificial structures

role in waste management of the ecosystem the nanomaterials are unique in the sense of their extremely small size and as a result the highly elevated surface to volume ratios compared to their bulk counterparts the nanomaterials are being used as catalysts in many areas of science and technology especially particular interest is the utilization of nanomaterials in water purification if the nanomaterial synthesis also involves a greener approach then the overall process of synthesis and application of nanomaterials in water purification becomes truly environmentally friendlier andersen et al 2014 dey et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2013 the plant extracts are being used for green synthesis of nanoparticle which is stand out as an environmentally friendly methodology for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles the plant extracts which are capable of reducing a variety of iron salts to generate iron nanoparticles can be replaced the inorganic reducing agents like borohydrides kónya et al 2007 nikalje 2015 shanmugavel and karthikeyan 2013 the synthesis of iron nanoparticles by using extracts from biological sources is significantly easier when compared to conventional chemical methods this is because the biological sources act as self reducing agent and self surfactant green synthesis of iron nanoparticles has an additional advantage that the compounds present in plant extracts can impart steric stabilization of iron nanoparticles against aggregation this would enable to overcome the concerns related to using the reducing agents such as sodium borohydride in routine synthesis adapted so far recently the successful synthesis of iron nanoparticles utilizing green tea leaf and sorghum bran extracts have been found kónya et al 2007 iron nanoparticles were readily

degraded naturally though various methods have been developed for the degradation of p nitrophenol p np the utilization of catalysts to electrochemically degrade p np has become a novel and effective methodology where two magnetic nanoparticles carbon encapsulated iron fe c carbon encapsulated cobalt co c were employed as catalysts the above mentioned both types of modified electrodes showed favourable stability and excellent electrocatalytic activity for p np degradation dave and chopda 2014 sharma et al 2012 herrera becerra et al 2010 meeks et al 2012 in this study we carried out some basic water quality parameters such as ec tds salinity turbidity and ph for an entire year and the heavy metals such as cd and pb further we proposed a greener method is most suitable to an aquifer contaminated by waste oil in addition we discover a strategy to predict the oil contamination and destroy btex in short period of time it is a cheap and fruitful method for water treatment 2 materials

further purification 2 2 sample collection the sample collection was done in the selected places with a special instrument designed by our own the cleaned glass bottle can be replaced instead of cylinder and immersed into the water by using thread 1 and 2 then thread 2 is gradually lifted below the surface of the water to open the lid finally thread 2 is loosed to close the lid as soon as the cylinder gets filled the water containing bottles are transferred in an icebox for further analysis and the analysis was finished on the same day of the sample collection the following tests such as electric conductivity ec salinity total dissolved solids tds ph and turbidity were analyzed in one location minimum of five samples were collected for the analysis from which the average was calculated in addition cadmium cd and lead pb were analyzed according to the manual of the autolab and samples are collected in selected dug wells which are located near automobile service stations in jaffna peninsula fig 1 s1 s8 and tables s1 s3 2 3 preparation of zero valence iron nanoparticles zvinp 2 3 1 chemical synthesis ofzvinp freshly prepared 5 ml of 0 001 m fecl3 solution was added drop by drop into the 5 ml of 0 01 m of cold nabh4 and then the temperature of the system increased and maintain between at 50 60 c with continuous stirring the ph of the system was monitored between 6 and 7 during the process 2 3 2 green synthesis of zvinp by using green tea extraction the commercial green tea was washed thoroughly with distilled water for three times and dried at 101 c then the green tea was ground in to finely powder by using mortar and pestle then 5 g of it was heated in 50 ml distilled water at 60 c in a 100 ml beaker for 30 min the extract was separated by filter paper 45 μm pore size whatman and the extract was collected for zvin synthesis then freshly prepared 5 ml of 0 001 m of fecl3 solution was drop wisely added into 5 ml of hot 50 60 c green tea extract with continuous stirring the product was collected and utilized for deposition purpose 2 4 deposition of zvinp on to activated carbon pores zvinpac 1 g of granular activated carbon was washed with diluted 50 ml of 0 1 m phosphoric acid and subsequently washed with ample amount of distilled water then it was heated at 110 c for 30 min then the temperature of pre treated granular activated carbon was increased up to 250 c and remains unchanged during the treatment the synthesized zvinpswas added dropwise while stirring and the temperature of the system was increased up to 500 c for 1 h the black colour product was cooled down to room temperature in a desiccator for 24 h and it was directly utilized for oil degradation purpose 2 5 degradation of used oil and btex in water by zvinpac this test was performed electrochemically by using commercially available carbon electrodes were used the positive electrode was kept in a perforated glass vessel with the dimension of 4 cm 4 cm 8 cm which containing zvinpac both electrodes were kept in the 500 ml beaker containing 300 ml of used oil or btex aqueous solution the electrodes were connected with 900 ma dc source the degradation reaction was carried out at a ph of 4 during the reaction 5 ml of the solution was drawn in 10 min intervals for further analysis which was done at frog 4000 portable gas chromatography 2 6 characterization x ray diffraction xrd was performed using siemens d5000 powder x ray diffractometer cu kαλ 0 154 nm and scanning rate of 1 min 1 rigaku usa the morphology was analyzed by using hitachi su6600 scanning electron microscope sem japan the btex was examined by frog 4000 gas chromatography usa the heavy metals were analysed buy using auto lab rde directive 89 336 eec netherlands the ph was measured by

dr1900 portable spectrophotometer usa the whole analysis was done according to standard procedure recommended by instrumental manuals the graphs were plotted using a savitzky golay function origin 2017 graphing and analysis origin lab usa 3 results 3 1 structural analysis 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the xrd profile is used deduced structural features of materials and the xrd profile of iron nanoparticle deposited activated carbon shown in fig 2 it is obious that two broad 23 98 24 16 and 43 42 42 88 and small peaks 20 84 65 19 66 80 and 68 42 indicate that the compositions are amorphous in nature this phenomena is due to the presence of higher volume of activated carbon compare to the nanoparticles the chemically synthesized iron nanoparticle embedded activated carbon exhibited bragg s angles at 43 42 and 23 98 disclosed the occurrence of both zero valent iron and iron ii iii oxide crystalline phases fig 2 rajasooriyar et al 2002 owa 2013 vithanage et al 2014 eventhough peak positions of greenly synthesized siligthly differe 42 88 and 24 16 which is due to the presence of pholyphenol and structural features of iron nanoparticles fig 2 in addition it is noticeable that the weak peaks at about 15 30 and 40 50 are responsible for the reflection plans of activated carbon 002 and 101 respectively the peak at about 23 implys presence of the iron oxides whereas the peak at 44 confirms bcc zero valent iron nanoparticle owa 2013 vithanage et al 2014 furthermore the characteristic small peaks are used to confirm iron nanoparticle embedded activated carbon composition hence the composition consist both zero valent iron nanoparticle and iron oxide nanoparticles 3 2 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the sem images of both green synthesized and chemically iron nanomaterials are shown in fig 3 the pore of the activated carbon in microscale in which nanoscale pores are present fig s9 embedding the iron nanoparticle into the nanoscale pores is a tactic of this work the embedded particles morphologies were cone and spherical shape with size ranging from 40 nm to 110 nm and are arranged in the nanopores of carbon in an irregular fashion the particle size of cone shape varies between 87 nm and 94 nm while spherical shape ranged from 64 nm to 76 nm as shown in fig 3a b in addition chemical synthesis influences the size of the particle that chemically synthesized nanoparticles were smaller than those of greenly synthesized further the deposited patterns resembles internal branches within the activated carbon pores gunaalan et al 2018 this indicates that the precursor solution diffused well into the entrenching branches of the pore the maximum size of the pore in the barely activated carbon was observed is 117 nm which imply that the size of the nanoparticles is smaller than that of activated carbon pore fig 3a b s9 furthermore nanoparticles well settled within the pores 3 3 water quality analysis of the jaffna peninsula the basic water quality parameters of jaffna peninsula were tested over a year and the average was calculated for this study according to our observation during the dry season the salinity ec and turbidity were high compared with the corresponding rainy season according to the jaffna territory the excess rainwater reached to some particular areas such as thondaimaanaaru arriyalai and araly in which the thondaimaanaaru saline fresh water gates are biggest in the jaffna peninsula ganeshalingam et al 2012 when the water level reached a maximum of 3 5 feet in thondaimaanaaru the gates are opened and excess fresh water released to sea during the rainy season the thondaimaanaaru barrage prevents the entering of seawater into the vadamarachi lagoon where as the arriyalai barrage blocked the seawater entering into the uppararu and araly barrage allowsvallukai aruoverflow water into the sea the vallukaiaaru is considered as the river for jaffnaand active during the rainy season in general the salinity tds and ec are gradually reduced when move barrage to inside the land it is remarkable in the vaddamarachi lagoon that mulli area consists dense of mangrove plants where the tds ec and salinity were low compared with other places hence the mangrove plays a major role in balance the salinity in the land the groundwater of jaffna greatly polluted by various activites such as uses of excess amount of artificial fertilizers weedicides insecticides automobile waster oils leaking of lubricant from fuel filling stations excessive use of household cleaning chemicals navaratnarajah 1994 some fertilizers weedicides and insecticides consist phosphate and nitrate counterparts which are the main contaminant in the jaffna peninsula we observed that the agricultural area manthigai consist the higher amount of nitrate compare with highly populated jaffna town area ponds such as pullukulam ariyakulam and kannathiddykulam the phosphate content was lower in agriculture area than town area table 1 jeevaratnam et al reported that the nitrate concentration of jaffna peninsula ranging 20 30 mg l but we found that the agriculture area hit up to 51 mg l the nitrates are readily soluble in water cannot be retained by soil thus it is easily reached groundwater and causes the various health issues the sls standard of phosphate is 2 mg l but the concentration of phosphate is higher in town area compare to agricultural area which indicates that the algal blooming prevails in town area ponds jeevaratnam et al 2018 hence the regulations are needed about artificial fertilizers insecticides weedicides and etc the government established many agricultural centres where inefficient staff fail to bring about side effect of excessive use of artificial elements in agriculture and government fails to control about imports of artificial fertilizers our survey indicates that among the farmers of the peninsula don t have much knowledge about amount of the use of artificial elements in farming virtually they don t have the knowledge about diseases caused by the excess usage of fertilizers the farmers purely inclined to get good yield from their product for which they unintentionally use artificial elements the average value of parameters ofec salinity turbidity and tds are indicating that it varies from place to place fig 4 a d the range of ec salinity turbidity and tds were 0 34 18 03 ms cm 0 26 4 38 g l 0 54 5 94 ntu and 0 60 5 23 g l respectively the karaveddy poinpetro maruthankeny located near vadamarachi lagoon whereas chavakacheri and kopay have a connection with upparu the vallukai aru go through the area such as thellipallai chankanai sandilipay and jaffna kytes vellanai delf and karanagar mostly cover by saline water and near the sea among vellanaiarea showed higher deviation than other places hence they show comparatively higher ec tds and salinity fig 4a d and table 2 the water schemes like vadamarachi lagoon upparu lagoon and valukkai aru ec ranging 29 7 12 2 30 5 4 5 and 38 1 2 0 ms cm respectively where as the corresponding salinity range is 20 2 6 4 21 2 2 5 and 24 3 1 1 g l respectively in the water schemes of jaffna the salinity is very high compared to the far away from the sea there is some general question that some well near seaside has good quality water this is because of the poor management of gates during the civil war thus the seawater enters into the land now the desalinization process is carried out by using surface water flow in the region but it is a long term process that the saline water bodies are being converted to freshwater lagoon which becomes surface water source for jaffna the ph of the groundwater seems neutral whereas sri lankan standard sls lies between 6 5 and 8 5 mahagamage et al 2019 hence ph of the surface water body in jaffna peninsula is good the ec is due to the dissolved ions such as ca2 na mg2 co3 2 no3 and so4 2 and sls is set it as 750 μs cm whereas who standard is 8 523 ms cm mahagamage et al 2019 the surface water and most of the dug wells are above the sls standard except the maruthankeny area and all areas found to be under who standard level fig 4a and table 2 the tds is higher in coastal area due to presence of the sodium ion the remarkable thing is that the parameters like salinity ec and tds is lower than that of water schemes this indicates that if the water schemes become freshwater body and the groundwater quality will be good and can be saved for future generation the turbidity values varies place to place and that is depending on the place where the concentration of water body organisms clouds of dust and other factors varies from place to place 3 4 cadmium and lead analysis in selected dug well in jaffna the samples were collected in the selected areas and the analysis done according to the auto lab standard procedure figs s1 s8 and tables s1 s3 the results indicates that the pb majorly distributed than cd the maximum amount of pb concentration found to be as 0 132 mg l and minimum concentration found to be as 0 0006 mg l the maximum and minimum concentration of cd found to be as 0 092 mg l and 0 0012 mg l respectively the heavy metals cause serious health issue as they interact with function of organs the interaction caused malfunction of body and finally caused deadliest effect the heavy metals enter into the body by food chains which are inevitable as heavy metals spread out by the various human activities the pb and cd enter into the body by inhalation and swallowing as they are present in lead based paints cigarette smoke household dust potteries lead based pipe fuels and various machines the lead remarkably affects from fetal to adult in various level of concentration the concentration below 50 ppb 5 μg dl causes decrease the intelligence quotient iq level the concentration of pb in blood below 100 ppb 10 μg dl casues reduction of hearing iq postnatal growth and delayed puberty in child while in adults it causes tumour increase blood pressure and hypertension https www niehs nih gov 2019 the cd exposure is higher in asian countries than europe and united state of america the cd causes the chronic kidney diseases mal function of mitochondria affect metabolizing of glucose and fat thus this phenomenon lead to dead chunhabundit 2016a nowadays the commercials foods like carbonated water coffee rice orange chicken egg apple juice oatmeal corn tomato soya wheat animal products like beef and seafoods and potato all consist particular amount of heavy metals such as cd pb cr as and organic substances like benzene diazinon and chlorpyrifos therefore modern people all around the globe consume heavy metals and other stuff inevitably table 3 moschandreas et al 2002 chandorkar and deota 2013 chunhabundit 2016 kim and wolt 2011 tóth et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 3 5 analysis of btex containing solution the reaction process was carried out by using a special reactive vessel shown below fig 5 the carbon electrodes were used for the electrolysis process the anode working electrode was kept in modified activated carbon contained vessels which consist of many pores for the interchanging of electrolyte the reactivity of modified activated carbon was tested by using 100 ppb btex standard solution with water fig 5 during the reaction the gas bubbles were observed in both electrode region these gases were collected by using glass bottle and tested by using flame sticks in cathode the flame put off with pop sound while in anode the flame burnt with shining which indicated that cathode releases the hydrogen while anode releases the oxygen this reaction is similar to photocatalytic reaction raagulan et al 2019 gunaalan et al 2018 the oxidation of btex occurred in the presence of active oxygen and iron nanoparticles which promote the oxidation via the free radical pathway and oxidation of btex were fastest at 900 ma moreover 90 of btex vanished within 30 min at 900 ma the electrolysis was done in the acidic medium ph 5 6 thus cathode and anode produce hydrogen and oxygen respectively the collision of oxygen with activated carbon surface generates reactive oxygen species because of the electron transfer from nanoparticle to oxygen the electric field induced this electron transfer process vithanage et al 2014 gunaalan et al 2018 the resultant reactive oxygen species participated in the consecutive reaction the concentration of btex components gradually decrease and it is obvious that initial species converted into unknown species during the reaction even though at first the btex species converted into at least one component of btex fig 6 and table 4 ultimately this leads to diminishing of the btex qualitatively the unknown compound can be compared based on the height of the peak varies with the time that implies the concentration changing during the treatment the initial concentration of the benzene is 3 55 ppb which hits up to 5 96 ppb at 10 min then it gradually decreases with time and after 50 min benzene totally disappeared whereas similar trend showed by ethylbenzene but it was eradicated within 10min in addition benzene prevails for a longer period of time compared with other components the xylene totally disappeared in 10 min hence xylene species such as p m xylene and o xylene with an initial concentration of 13 59 and 9 21 ppb respectively are less stable under a given condition and those were removed within 10 min from the solution the mtbe concentration remained unchanged up to 30 min and then disappeared in 40 min fig 6 and table 4 so the persistence of the species in water can be arranged from lower to high as following xylene toluene ethylbenzene mtbe and benzene table 4 and fig 6 the schematic representation of the gc spectrum is available in the supplementary materialss1 s7 the mechanism proposed that anode produces oxygen molecules which makes the collisions with iron nanoparticle inp leads surface generating reactive oxygen species radical raagulan et al 2019 the above reactive oxygen species is entered to the consecutive reaction and degradated btex into co2 and h2o the corresponding reactions are shown below see table 5 3 6 analysis of treated oil solution most of the used oil in sri lanka disposed directly or indirectly to the environment without following any regulation as the rainwater or surface water seeped to underground through waste water saturated soil this natural process helps to reach oil content to the groundwater as groundwater is consumed as portable water in jaffna which affects the human dramatically the engine oils consist inorganic elemental additives such as fe pb cr sn cu mo ca mg ba al ti and si this concentration increases with the useage this is considered due to the corrosion of engine parts when engine under working the corrosive oxide formed in the oil due to the corrosive oil becomes dark in colour inorganic and phenolic antioxidative additives are added to improve function and life fan of the oil ahmad et al 2018 oils made up of 99 7 of aliphatic hydrocarbons 0 27 of aromatic hydrocarbons and 0 03 olefinic hydrocarbon the ratio between aromatic to aliphatic gets increase with the use kupareva et al 2012 further the used oil consist carbonyl compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons rudyk and spirov 2017 the btex which is naturally available in crude oil released during volcanic eruption forest fire while man made cosmetic paints adhesive fuel station petroleum refining vehicle cigarette and aircraft smoking also consist btex world annually produce tones of petroleum products which is main cause of btex the level of btex concentration varies based on the source and location for instance 4 g l of benzene is available in crude oil whereas in 0 8 ppb of benzene found in seawater where petroleum is naturally deposited the concentration of benzene toloene ethyl benzene xylene in industrial centre with high traffic density is 349 1310 360 and 775 μg m respectively in generally btex is available in groundwater in very little percentage which is applicable to contaminated surface water where toluene is difficult to find if the groundwater gets contaminate with btex the expected concentration will be as 330 3500 2000 and 1340 μg m respectively leusch and bartkow 2010 gasoline consists of 11 12 of toluene 5 of benzene 2 of ethylene benzene and content of xylene depend on the formula of the fuel exposures to btex for a long period of time caused high health impact in human among btex the benzene is more toxic and even higher concentration 10 000 000 ppb causes death long term exposure with low concentration causes headache unconsciousness leukaemia dizziness and tremors while when benzene is swallowed creates the symptoms like sleepiness dizziness vomiting comma rapid heart rate and death the toluene can easily absorb by digestive system and it preferably reached kidney brain liver and adipose tissue which finally affect the nervous system the ethylbenzene especially affects the hearing ability and enlargement of liver and kidney the xylene can easily reach the body by inhalation which causes reduction of sense of balance diminution of muscle coordination and affect the nervous system the btex reaches water body by various sources like automobile power station fuel stations and industries the organisms in the water bodies btex concentration above 1 mg l acutely affect those organisms interact with water and btex stability also affect the water temperature leusch and bartkow 2010 dórea et al 2007 bergerson et al 2014 the methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is one of the contents added in fuel to increase the fuel efficiency and its concentration varies from 84 to 234 ppm one litere of used oil spoil 5000 l of potable water the mtbe can easily dissolve in water than btex baker et al 2002 hence disposal of waste oil in jaffna peninsula completely destroy the underground water velauthamurty and kurukulasuriya 2016 initially mtbe and btex is available in the sample and the peaks slightly shifted towards the left hand side with the increasing heights along with the time the fluctuation of the concentration of the btex species with time considered as that the one species converted into another the toluene concentration upsurge greatly whereas others significantly decline and the concentration of the benzene almost remains constant fig 7 and table 6 after 20 min table 2 benzene concentration hike drastically and others diminish which indicate that the benzene derivatives were converted into other forms and finally disappeared further benzene is most stable than others fig 7 and table 6 the spectra showed that there is fluctuation in the concentration of unknown species such as mtbe which formed during the reaction the benzene showed a similar trend in oil sample like in btex containing solution whereas mtbe exhibit strange behaviour which is considered due to presence of metals in oils and as the mtbe solubility is high it persists for a long time the mtbe almost persisted for a longer time at the experimental condition andthe xylene compounds were absent in oil sample stability of compound can be arranged like xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene and mtbe spill of fuels on the ground and leakage of from underground fuel storage tank are the main reason for the the contamination the fuel station leak reached the dug well which exhibit the fuel like ordos and oily layer on the top of the well the result is miraculous only mtbe is present with the concentration of 92 08 ppb in the contaminated water further other parameters like ec tds turbidity and fluoride were 1 297 ms cm 842 mg l 3 8 ntu and 0 2 mg l respectively we consider that these factors also affect the prevailing of the btex in dug well the schematic representation of the gc spectrum is available in the supplementary materials figs s10 s23 and tables s6 s19 4 conclusions the nitrate concentration ranging from 0 7 to 51 ppm whereas the phosphate content ranging from 3 8 to 1 3 ppm in jaffna peninsula the average value of parameters like ec salinity turbidity and tds are indicating that it varies from place to place the range of ec salinity turbidity and tds were 0 34 18 03 ms cm 0 26 4 38 g l 0 54 5 94 ntu and 0 60 5 23 g l respectively the water schemes behave differently as they showed comparatively higher ec tds and salinity the water schemes like vadamarachi lagoon upparu lagoon and valukkai aru ec ranging 29 7 12 2 30 5 4 5 and 38 1 2 0 ms cm respectively whereas the corresponding salinity range is 20 2 6 4 21 2 2 5 and 24 3 1 1 g l respectively the maximum amount of pb concentration was 0 132 mg l and minimum concentration was 0 0006 mg l whereas the maximum and minimum concentration of cd was 0 092 mg l and 0 0012 mg l respectively the environmentally friendly iron nanoparticle successfully deposited on activated carbon the deposited iron nanoparticle inp particle size is ranging from 40 nm to 110 nm which included zero valent iron and iron ii iii oxide nanoparticles the modified activated carbon act as an electrochemical catalyst offered surface degradation of volatile organic substance like btex the volatile organic substances completely eradicated by the electrochemical system in 40 min in addition btex the mtbe more stable in water than btex the oil contamination of water can be confirmed by presence of mtbe in water this method is low cost and

12032,the jaffna peninsulais northern part of sri lanka longitude 80 06 2 28 e and latitude 9 41 12 20 n mainly gains water from groundwater which is continuously protected by various human activity even with reckless deterioration the maximum nitrate concentration reached up to 51 ppm whereas the amount of phosphate found to be as 3 8 ppm the average ec for a year is 38 1 ms cm and corresponding salinity and tds found to be as 20 2 and 24 3 g l respectively the middle region of the territory consists less saline water and 0 132 ppm of pb and 0 092 ppm cd presence in the groundwater the btex has been completely eradicated by using the cost effective environmentally friendly electrochemical system the developed system can be utilized the application areas such as service station mechanic stores hospitals universities and household purpose keywords btex iron nanoparticle tds ec heavy metals 1 introduction the water is one of the crucial natural element for the survival of the various living organism in the planet the globe faces the serious problem that is the scarcity of the water for various purpose including household needs this depends on economic growth development climate change season and human activity due to the human activity the vast amount of contamination discharge to the environment from various anthropogenic sources those causes detrimental impact on the environment is a growing concern marara and palamuleni 2019 jaffna peninsula is the dry zone of sri lanka mainly depend on groundwater the groundwater consumption dramatically increased due to the increasing population introduction of electric and other water pump and dense tube wells the groundwater source in jaffna is limited and the aquifers received water through seasonal rain reckless anthropogenic activity released various water soluble components to the environment and invading of seawater affects the impinging living things directly or indirectly rajasooriyar et al 2002 the water pollution consists of duel effects such as on the environment and living organisms in the aquatic systems the pollution affects the productivity diminution and elimination of environmentally sensitive organisms in the world nearly 14 000 people died every day due to water pollution various pollutants in water affect the water bodies by changing the properties like algal blooming ph changes turbidity tds conductivity salinity odour sulphate content and carbon dioxide content owa 2013 the northern part of sri lankan where the population heavily rely on underground water tanks pond and small rivers the territory mostly covered by miocene caco3 which mainly causing water hardness that is a common issue recently due to the modernization the increasing numbers of vehicles and automobile service stations usage of electronic equipment cracked mirrors ceramics and deforestation have been drastically increased along with the poor wastewater management lead to a serious threat to the whole environment vithanage et al 2014 the people of the jaffna significantly utilize the groundwater for irrigation and household activities due to the overexploitation of the groundwater the saline water intrusion is a crucial issue gunaalan et al 2018 the heavy metals area severe hazard to the normal functioning of aquatic systems even at lower concentration they are very toxic non biodegradable and are involved in biochemical cycles it also affects the human beings and causes disorders in reneal and nervous system moreover in the case of unmanaged disposal of lead acid batteries automobile oils fuels and fertilizers relatively increase the amounts of pb cd in the environment in addition during the war the useage of lead cadmium containing explosives cracked mirrors electronic equipment and ceramics became the potential source of heavy metal pollution as a consequence of the above mentioned issues the groundwater becomes polluted with heavy metals which in turn cause adverse health effects upon ingestion belkhiri et al 2018 oyeku and eludoyin 2010 momodu and anyakora 2010 wu et al 2015 mohankumar et al 2016 mridul and sarma 2013 nanoscience plays a major role in waste management of the ecosystem the nanomaterials are unique in the sense of their extremely small size and as a result the highly elevated surface to volume ratios compared to their bulk counterparts the nanomaterials are being used as catalysts in many areas of science and technology especially particular interest is the utilization of nanomaterials in water purification if the nanomaterial synthesis also involves a greener approach then the overall process of synthesis and application of nanomaterials in water purification becomes truly environmentally friendlier andersen et al 2014 dey et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2013 the plant extracts are being used for green synthesis of nanoparticle which is stand out as an environmentally friendly methodology for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles the plant extracts which are capable of reducing a variety of iron salts to generate iron nanoparticles can be replaced the inorganic reducing agents like borohydrides kónya et al 2007 nikalje 2015 shanmugavel and karthikeyan 2013 the synthesis of iron nanoparticles by using extracts from biological sources is significantly easier when compared to conventional chemical methods this is because the biological sources act as self reducing agent and self surfactant green synthesis of iron nanoparticles has an additional advantage that the compounds present in plant extracts can impart steric stabilization of iron nanoparticles against aggregation this would enable to overcome the concerns related to using the reducing agents such as sodium borohydride in routine synthesis adapted so far recently the successful synthesis of iron nanoparticles utilizing green tea leaf and sorghum bran extracts have been found kónya et al 2007 iron nanoparticles were readily synthesized by using green tea leaf extracts gt fe nps green tea is known to be contain polyphenols that act both as a reducing agent and a capping agent kónya et al 2007 nikalje 2015 shanmugavel and karthikeyan 2013 dave and chopda 2014 meyers et al 2006 the utilization of natural or organic acids is also an alternate way for the iron nanoparticle preparation herrera becerra et al used tannic acid and gallic acid as reducing agents to prepare iron oxide nanoparticles whereas meeks et al had successfully used ascorbic acid for the synthesis of iron based nanoparticles devi and singh 2016 sharma et al 2012 herrera becerra et al 2010 meeks et al 2012 the common organic pollutant in industrial and agricultural wastewater is one of those materials that are extremely difficult to be degraded naturally though various methods have been developed for the degradation of p nitrophenol p np the utilization of catalysts to electrochemically degrade p np has become a novel and effective methodology where two magnetic nanoparticles carbon encapsulated iron fe c carbon encapsulated cobalt co c were employed as catalysts the above mentioned both types of modified electrodes showed favourable stability and excellent electrocatalytic activity for p np degradation dave and chopda 2014 sharma et al 2012 herrera becerra et al 2010 meeks et al 2012 in this study we carried out some basic water quality parameters such as ec tds salinity turbidity and ph for an entire year and the heavy metals such as cd and pb further we proposed a greener method is most suitable to an aquifer contaminated by waste oil in addition we discover a strategy to predict the oil contamination and destroy btex in short period of time it is a cheap and fruitful method for water treatment 2 materials

2017 graphing and analysis origin lab usa 3 results 3 1 structural analysis 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the xrd profile is used deduced structural features of materials and the xrd profile of iron nanoparticle deposited activated carbon shown in fig 2 it is obious that two broad 23 98 24 16 and 43 42 42 88 and small peaks 20 84 65 19 66 80 and 68 42 indicate that the compositions are amorphous in nature this phenomena is due to the presence of higher volume of activated carbon compare to the nanoparticles the chemically synthesized iron nanoparticle embedded activated carbon exhibited bragg s angles at 43 42 and 23 98 disclosed the occurrence of both zero valent iron and iron ii iii oxide crystalline phases fig 2 rajasooriyar et al 2002 owa 2013 vithanage et al 2014 eventhough peak positions of greenly synthesized siligthly differe 42 88 and 24 16 which is due to the presence of pholyphenol and structural features of iron nanoparticles fig 2 in addition it is noticeable that the weak peaks at about 15 30 and 40 50 are responsible for the reflection plans of activated carbon 002 and 101 respectively the peak at about 23 implys presence of the iron oxides whereas the peak at 44 confirms bcc zero valent iron nanoparticle owa 2013 vithanage et al 2014 furthermore the characteristic small peaks are used to confirm iron nanoparticle embedded activated carbon composition hence the composition consist both zero valent iron nanoparticle and iron oxide nanoparticles 3 2 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the sem images of both green synthesized and chemically iron nanomaterials are shown in fig 3 the pore of the activated carbon in microscale in which nanoscale pores are present fig s9 embedding the iron nanoparticle into the nanoscale pores is a tactic of this work the embedded particles morphologies were cone and spherical shape with size ranging from 40 nm to 110 nm and are arranged in the nanopores of carbon in an irregular fashion the particle size of cone shape varies between 87 nm and 94 nm while spherical shape ranged from 64 nm to 76 nm as shown in fig 3a b in addition chemical synthesis influences the size of the particle that chemically synthesized nanoparticles were smaller than those of greenly synthesized further the deposited patterns resembles internal branches within the activated carbon pores gunaalan et al 2018 this indicates that the precursor solution diffused well into the entrenching branches of the pore the maximum size of the pore in the barely activated carbon was observed is 117 nm which imply that the size of the nanoparticles is smaller than that of activated carbon pore fig 3a b s9 furthermore nanoparticles well settled within the pores 3 3 water quality analysis of the jaffna peninsula the basic water quality parameters of jaffna peninsula were tested over a year and the average was calculated for this study according to our observation during the dry season the salinity ec and turbidity were high compared with the corresponding rainy season according to the jaffna territory the excess rainwater reached to some particular areas such as thondaimaanaaru arriyalai and araly in which the thondaimaanaaru saline fresh water gates are biggest in the jaffna peninsula ganeshalingam et al 2012 when the water level reached a maximum of 3 5 feet in thondaimaanaaru the gates are opened and excess fresh water released to sea during the rainy season the thondaimaanaaru barrage prevents the entering of seawater into the vadamarachi lagoon where as the arriyalai barrage blocked the seawater entering into the uppararu and araly barrage allowsvallukai aruoverflow water into the sea the vallukaiaaru is considered as the river for jaffnaand active during the rainy season in general the salinity tds and ec are gradually reduced when move barrage to inside the land it is remarkable in the vaddamarachi lagoon that mulli area consists dense of mangrove plants where the tds ec and salinity were low compared with other places hence the mangrove plays a major role in balance the salinity in the land the groundwater of jaffna greatly polluted by various activites such as uses of excess amount of artificial fertilizers weedicides insecticides automobile waster oils leaking of lubricant from fuel filling stations excessive use of household cleaning chemicals navaratnarajah 1994 some fertilizers weedicides and insecticides consist phosphate and nitrate counterparts which are the main contaminant in the jaffna peninsula we observed that the agricultural area manthigai consist the higher amount of nitrate compare with highly populated jaffna town area ponds such as pullukulam ariyakulam and kannathiddykulam the phosphate content was lower in agriculture area than town area table 1 jeevaratnam et al reported that the nitrate concentration of jaffna peninsula ranging 20 30 mg l but we found that the agriculture area hit up to 51 mg l the nitrates are readily soluble in water cannot be retained by soil thus it is easily reached groundwater and causes the various health issues the sls standard of phosphate is 2 mg l but the concentration of phosphate is higher in town area compare to agricultural area which indicates that the algal blooming prevails in town area ponds jeevaratnam et al 2018 hence the regulations are needed about artificial fertilizers insecticides weedicides and etc the government established many agricultural centres where inefficient staff fail to bring about side effect of excessive use of artificial elements in agriculture and government fails to control about imports of artificial fertilizers our survey indicates that among the farmers of the peninsula don t have much knowledge about amount of the use of artificial elements in farming virtually they don t have the knowledge about diseases caused by the excess usage of fertilizers the farmers purely inclined to get good yield from their product for which they unintentionally use artificial elements the average value of parameters ofec salinity turbidity and tds are indicating that it varies from place to place fig 4 a d the range of ec salinity turbidity and tds were 0 34 18 03 ms cm 0 26 4 38 g l 0 54 5 94 ntu and 0 60 5 23 g l respectively the karaveddy poinpetro maruthankeny located near vadamarachi lagoon whereas chavakacheri and kopay have a connection with upparu the vallukai aru go through the area such as thellipallai chankanai sandilipay and jaffna kytes vellanai delf and karanagar mostly cover by saline water and near the sea among vellanaiarea showed higher deviation than other places hence they show comparatively higher ec tds and salinity fig 4a d and table 2 the water schemes like vadamarachi lagoon upparu lagoon and valukkai aru ec ranging 29 7 12 2 30 5 4 5 and 38 1 2 0 ms cm respectively where as the corresponding salinity range is 20 2 6 4 21 2 2 5 and 24 3 1 1 g l respectively in the water schemes of jaffna the salinity is very high compared to the far away from the sea there is some general question that some well near seaside has good quality water this is because of the poor management of gates during the civil war thus the seawater enters into the land now the desalinization process is carried out by using surface water flow in the region but it is a long term process that the saline water bodies are being converted to freshwater lagoon which becomes surface water source for jaffna the ph of the groundwater seems neutral whereas sri lankan standard sls lies between 6 5 and 8 5 mahagamage et al 2019 hence ph of the surface water body in jaffna peninsula is good the ec is due to the dissolved ions such as ca2 na mg2 co3 2 no3 and so4 2 and sls is set it as 750 μs cm whereas who standard is 8 523 ms cm mahagamage et al 2019 the surface water and most of the dug wells are above the sls standard except the maruthankeny area and all areas found to be under who standard level fig 4a and table 2 the tds is higher in coastal area due to presence of the sodium ion the remarkable thing is that the parameters like salinity ec and tds is lower than that of water schemes this indicates that if the water schemes become freshwater body and the groundwater quality will be good and can be saved for future generation the turbidity values varies place to place and that is depending on the place where the concentration of water body organisms clouds of dust and other factors varies from place to place 3 4 cadmium and lead analysis in selected dug well in jaffna the samples were collected in the selected areas and the analysis done according to the auto lab standard procedure figs s1 s8 and tables s1 s3 the results indicates that the pb majorly distributed than cd the maximum amount of pb concentration found to be as 0 132 mg l and minimum concentration found to be as 0 0006 mg l the maximum and minimum concentration of cd found to be as 0 092 mg l and 0 0012 mg l respectively the heavy metals cause serious health issue as they interact with function of organs the interaction caused malfunction of body and finally caused deadliest effect the heavy metals enter into the body by food chains which are inevitable as heavy metals spread out by the various human activities the pb and cd enter into the body by inhalation and swallowing as they are present in lead based paints cigarette smoke household dust potteries lead based pipe fuels and various machines the lead remarkably affects from fetal to adult in various level of concentration the concentration below 50 ppb 5 μg dl causes decrease the intelligence quotient iq level the concentration of pb in blood below 100 ppb 10 μg dl casues reduction of hearing iq postnatal growth and delayed puberty in child while in adults it causes tumour increase blood pressure and hypertension https www niehs nih gov 2019 the cd exposure is higher in asian countries than europe and united state of america the cd causes the chronic kidney diseases mal function of mitochondria affect metabolizing of glucose and fat thus this phenomenon lead to dead chunhabundit 2016a nowadays the commercials foods like carbonated water coffee rice orange chicken egg apple juice oatmeal corn tomato soya wheat animal products like beef and seafoods and potato all consist particular amount of heavy metals such as cd pb cr as and organic substances like benzene diazinon and chlorpyrifos therefore modern people all around the globe consume heavy metals and other stuff inevitably table 3 moschandreas et al 2002 chandorkar and deota 2013 chunhabundit 2016 kim and wolt 2011 tóth et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 3 5 analysis of btex containing solution the reaction process was carried out by using a special reactive vessel shown below fig 5 the carbon electrodes were used for the electrolysis process the anode working electrode was kept in modified activated carbon contained vessels which consist of many pores for the interchanging of electrolyte the reactivity of modified activated carbon was tested by using 100 ppb btex standard solution with water fig 5 during the reaction the gas bubbles were observed in both electrode region these gases were collected by using glass bottle and tested by using flame sticks in cathode the flame put off with pop sound while in anode the flame burnt with shining which indicated that cathode releases the hydrogen while anode releases the oxygen this reaction is similar to photocatalytic reaction raagulan et al 2019 gunaalan et al 2018 the oxidation of btex occurred in the presence of active oxygen and iron nanoparticles which promote the oxidation via the free radical pathway and oxidation of btex were fastest at 900 ma moreover 90 of btex vanished within 30 min at 900 ma the electrolysis was done in the acidic medium ph 5 6 thus cathode and anode produce hydrogen and oxygen respectively the collision of oxygen with activated carbon surface generates reactive oxygen species because of the electron transfer from nanoparticle to oxygen the electric field induced this electron transfer process vithanage et al 2014 gunaalan et al 2018 the resultant reactive oxygen species participated in the consecutive reaction the concentration of btex components gradually decrease and it is obvious that initial species converted into unknown species during the reaction even though at first the btex species converted into at least one component of btex fig 6 and table 4 ultimately this leads to diminishing of the btex qualitatively the unknown compound can be compared based on the height of the peak varies with the time that implies the concentration changing during the treatment the initial concentration of the benzene is 3 55 ppb which hits up to 5 96 ppb at 10 min then it gradually decreases with time and after 50 min benzene totally disappeared whereas similar trend showed by ethylbenzene but it was eradicated within 10min in addition benzene prevails for a longer period of time compared with other components the xylene totally disappeared in 10 min hence xylene species such as p m xylene and o xylene with an initial concentration of 13 59 and 9 21 ppb respectively are less stable under a given condition and those were removed within 10 min from the solution the mtbe concentration remained unchanged up to 30 min and then disappeared in 40 min fig 6 and table 4 so the persistence of the species in water can be arranged from lower to high as following xylene toluene ethylbenzene mtbe and benzene table 4 and fig 6 the schematic representation of the gc spectrum is available in the supplementary materialss1 s7 the mechanism proposed that anode produces oxygen molecules which makes the collisions with iron nanoparticle inp leads surface generating reactive oxygen species radical raagulan et al 2019 the above reactive oxygen species is entered to the consecutive reaction and degradated btex into co2 and h2o the corresponding reactions are shown below see table 5 3 6 analysis of treated oil solution most of the used oil in sri lanka disposed directly or indirectly to the environment without following any regulation as the rainwater or surface water seeped to underground through waste water saturated soil this natural process helps to reach oil content to the groundwater as groundwater is consumed as portable water in jaffna which affects the human dramatically the engine oils consist inorganic elemental additives such as fe pb cr sn cu mo ca mg ba al ti and si this concentration increases with the useage this is considered due to the corrosion of engine parts when engine under working the corrosive oxide formed in the oil due to the corrosive oil becomes dark in colour inorganic and phenolic antioxidative additives are added to improve function and life fan of the oil ahmad et al 2018 oils made up of 99 7 of aliphatic hydrocarbons 0 27 of aromatic hydrocarbons and 0 03 olefinic hydrocarbon the ratio between aromatic to aliphatic gets increase with the use kupareva et al 2012 further the used oil consist carbonyl compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons rudyk and spirov 2017 the btex which is naturally available in crude oil released during volcanic eruption forest fire while man made cosmetic paints adhesive fuel station petroleum refining vehicle cigarette and aircraft smoking also consist btex world annually produce tones of petroleum products which is main cause of btex the level of btex concentration varies based on the source and location for instance 4 g l of benzene is available in crude oil whereas in 0 8 ppb of benzene found in seawater where petroleum is naturally deposited the concentration of benzene toloene ethyl benzene xylene in industrial centre with high traffic density is 349 1310 360 and 775 μg m respectively in generally btex is available in groundwater in very little percentage which is applicable to contaminated surface water where toluene is difficult to find if the groundwater gets contaminate with btex the expected concentration will be as 330 3500 2000 and 1340 μg m respectively leusch and bartkow 2010 gasoline consists of 11 12 of toluene 5 of benzene 2 of ethylene benzene and content of xylene depend on the formula of the fuel exposures to btex for a long period of time caused high health impact in human among btex the benzene is more toxic and even higher concentration 10 000 000 ppb causes death long term exposure with low concentration causes headache unconsciousness leukaemia dizziness and tremors while when benzene is swallowed creates the symptoms like sleepiness dizziness vomiting comma rapid heart rate and death the toluene can easily absorb by digestive system and it preferably reached kidney brain liver and adipose tissue which finally affect the nervous system the ethylbenzene especially affects the hearing ability and enlargement of liver and kidney the xylene can easily reach the body by inhalation which causes reduction of sense of balance diminution of muscle coordination and affect the nervous system the btex reaches water body by various sources like automobile power station fuel stations and industries the organisms in the water bodies btex concentration above 1 mg l acutely affect those organisms interact with water and btex stability also affect the water temperature leusch and bartkow 2010 dórea et al 2007 bergerson et al 2014 the methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is one of the contents added in fuel to increase the fuel efficiency and its concentration varies from 84 to 234 ppm one litere of used oil spoil 5000 l of potable water the mtbe can easily dissolve in water than btex baker et al 2002 hence disposal of waste oil in jaffna peninsula completely destroy the underground water velauthamurty and kurukulasuriya 2016 initially mtbe and btex is available in the sample and the peaks slightly shifted towards the left hand side with the increasing heights along with the time the fluctuation of the concentration of the btex species with time considered as that the one species converted into another the toluene concentration upsurge greatly whereas others significantly decline and the concentration of the benzene almost remains constant fig 7 and table 6 after 20 min table 2 benzene concentration hike drastically and others diminish which indicate that the benzene derivatives were converted into other forms and finally disappeared further benzene is most stable than others fig 7 and table 6 the spectra showed that there is fluctuation in the concentration of unknown species such as mtbe which formed during the reaction the benzene showed a similar trend in oil sample like in btex containing solution whereas mtbe exhibit strange behaviour which is considered due to presence of metals in oils and as the mtbe solubility is high it persists for a long time the mtbe almost persisted for a longer time at the experimental condition andthe xylene compounds were absent in oil sample stability of compound can be arranged like xylene ethylbenzene toluene benzene and mtbe spill of fuels on the ground and leakage of from underground fuel storage tank are the main reason for the the contamination the fuel station leak reached the dug well which exhibit the fuel like ordos and oily layer on the top of the well the result is miraculous only mtbe is present with the concentration of 92 08 ppb in the contaminated water further other parameters like ec tds turbidity and fluoride were 1 297 ms cm 842 mg l 3 8 ntu and 0 2 mg l respectively we consider that these factors also affect the prevailing of the btex in dug well the schematic representation of the gc spectrum is available in the supplementary materials figs s10 s23 and tables s6 s19 4 conclusions the nitrate concentration ranging from 0 7 to 51 ppm whereas the phosphate content ranging from 3 8 to 1 3 ppm in jaffna peninsula the average value of parameters like ec salinity turbidity and tds are indicating that it varies from place to place the range of ec salinity turbidity and tds were 0 34 18 03 ms cm 0 26 4 38 g l 0 54 5 94 ntu and 0 60 5 23 g l respectively the water schemes behave differently as they showed comparatively higher ec tds and salinity the water schemes like vadamarachi lagoon upparu lagoon and valukkai aru ec ranging 29 7 12 2 30 5 4 5 and 38 1 2 0 ms cm respectively whereas the corresponding salinity range is 20 2 6 4 21 2 2 5 and 24 3 1 1 g l respectively the maximum amount of pb concentration was 0 132 mg l and minimum concentration was 0 0006 mg l whereas the maximum and minimum concentration of cd was 0 092 mg l and 0 0012 mg l respectively the environmentally friendly iron nanoparticle successfully deposited on activated carbon the deposited iron nanoparticle inp particle size is ranging from 40 nm to 110 nm which included zero valent iron and iron ii iii oxide nanoparticles the modified activated carbon act as an electrochemical catalyst offered surface degradation of volatile organic substance like btex the volatile organic substances completely eradicated by the electrochemical system in 40 min in addition btex the mtbe more stable in water than btex the oil contamination of water can be confirmed by presence of mtbe in water this method is low cost and

12033,the current study focuses on determination of extent of groundwater contamination on a typical tropical coastal aquifer due to a landfill located at vamnjoor in dakshina kannada district india with the help of groundwater flow model modflow and mt3dms when remediated with permanent reactive barrier of nano iron the aquifer considered is a shallow unconfined one with laterite soil which gets good rains during monsoon and will be dry during rest of the year the adsorption by laterite soil has been considered the specific yield and transmissivity were estimated to be 7 85 and 213m2 day respectively after calibrating successfully with nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 8 horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set as 7 m day validation of model was then done with the field data and is applied for forecasting the spread of contaminant for anticipated future scenarios the results show that in spite of retardation offered by lateritic soil contaminant trail is expanding with a velocity of 0 15 m day in downstream direction when permeable reactive barrier of nano iron which can adsorb nearly 65 of chemical oxygen demand is installed it is showing that the contaminant spread can be reduced to 400 mg l at the observation well located at 1 km from landfill hence a comprehensive remedial alternative of permanent reactive barrier of nano iron can be recommended for preventing groundwater contamination from landfill leachate graphical abstract image 1 keywords leachate landfill groundwater modelling pollution contaminant 1 introduction landfills are main sources of air and water pollution still dumping wastes in sanitary landfills is one of the most commonly used method for disposal of solid waste around the world as it is economical and environmentally sustainable option of waste management but when the decomposition of waste starts and when rainwater or groundwater mixes with the refuse leachate a highly toxic and stinking liquid dark brown in colour which is heterogeneous in nature comes out of the wastes the emission of leachate from landfill is alarming because of its toxic impact on the environment when it is released unchecked the leachate when penetrates in to the soil and reaches the underlying aquifer it causes groundwater pollution to prevent the percolation of leachate the landfill has to be lined and also the leachate has to be collected and treated before it reaches the underlying aquifer effective treatment has to be given to landfill leachate so as to meet water quality standards set by regulatory authorities the treatment measure has to be so chosen that it should be based on the characteristics of the waste disposed and the natural conditions prevailing in the landfill site the alternative remedial measure before adopting has to be screened in laboratory conditions or pilot study has to be conducted in the field guo et al 2009 new researches suggest nanotechnology as economically benefitted as well as an eco friendly way for the treatment of leachate nowadays nano particles are widely used for environmental remediation of various organic and inorganic pollutants because of their exclusive chemical and physical properties cundy et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2016 the higher reactive surface area smaller particle size and also higher dispersivity compared to other nano particles nano irons are widely used in the environmental clean up permanent reactive barriers are in situ treatment method where immobilization or degradation of contaminant takes place as leachate passes through reactive barrier obiri nyarko et al 2014 singh et al 2020 when the contaminated water passes through reactive bed it transforms the pollutant into environmentally accepted form various studies discuss the ability of permeable reactive barriers with various filling materials that are efficient in the in situ remediation of leachate contamination from landfill wang et al 2016 kumarasinghe et al 2018 groundwater modelling simulates the complexes involved in movement of groundwater and can replicate and forecast its flow and transport visual modflow is one among the numerous simulating tools to model groundwater flow three dimensionally and mt3dms is solute transport software used to simulate the movement of solute in variably saturated heterogeneous medium subjected to a variety of boundary conditions da et al 2013 srivastava and ramanathan 2018 with add on reaction packages to address phenomenon such as advection dispersion and chemical reaction by developing numerical model and applying the simulation technique in the contamination of groundwater the effects of remedial alternatives which can be applied on the field can be analysed which greatly saves the time as well as cost mangalore located at coastal region of dakshina kannada district karnataka india is experiencing an extraordinary growth of population since last decade due to urbanisation the mangalore city corporation is collecting the waste on a daily basis and dumping it into a landfill at vamanjoor located nearly 8 5 km from city centre the landfill has got a bottom liner but there is no system for the collecting leachate and hence it is getting disposed without treatment thus all the leachate formed at the bottom finds its trails into the neighbouring environment polluting the underlying aquifer studies shows that during post monsoon season because of the increase in hydraulic head there is downward flow of contaminant from the site where landfill is located mishra et al 2019 the geology of the basin under consideration is characterised by laterite of depth varying from 5 to 30 m as lateritic soil adsorbs various chemicals and heavy metals the sorption by laterite soil which retards the flow of pollutant has been considered nayanthika et al 2018 even though several simulation studies has been conducted to know about the contaminant transport seldom focussed on landfills located in unconfined coastal aquifer which receives lot of monsoon rains the current study is taken up with an objective to understand the contaminant transport of leachate and evaluates the applicability of permanent reactive barrier of nano iron around the landfill as a possible remedial alternative in order to achieve this objective recent and most effective tool modflow clubbed with mt3dms has been used the result of the study can be used for assisting in drafting a control plan so as to prevent the contamination from landfill 2 description of study area 2 1 location mangalore is an important city in the western indian coast located in the state of karnataka the city is located at an average elevation of 22 m above the mean sea level and it covers an area of 132 45 sq km the population is around 488 968 as per 2011 census topographically the city is plain up to 30 km inside the coast beyond which it changes to undulating hilly terrain towards the east in western ghats

2000 and mt3dms 5 2 zheng and wang 1999 zheng 2006 a transport model was used to solve the space and time based groundwater level and concentration of pollutant in the sub basin the region where flow takes place is further divided into small blocks with uniform properties of medium the rate of flow and cumulative volume which is balanced from the type of inflow which is entering the cell and the outflow which is flowing out of the cell is calculated for every time step the mass of the solute that is transported through the porous media because of groundwater flow is mainly due to the process of advection mechanical dispersion and also due to the process of molecular dispersion mt3dms has a set of comprehensive selections which is capable of simulating the process such as advection dispersion along with chemical reactions of pollutants in the flow of groundwater system for a generalised condition of hydrogeology of region the various steps involved in the simulation of the model are represented in the form of a flow chart below fig 6 3 2 conceptual model structure and hydrogeological parameters the established conceptual model has 1622 active cells in domain which is covering the total area with each cell dimensions being 100 m 100 m the domain extends to 30 m in the vertical direction beneath the mean sea level that represents an unconfined aquifer of single layer in order to create digital elevation model dem the contour lines of the toposheets 48 l 13 ne and no 48 l 13 nw scale 1 25000 were considered the spatial discretization details of the model is given by x or longitudinal direction 485640 e and y or latitudinal direction 1427956 n with respect to origin of utm wgs 1984 zone 43 number of cells in x and y direction being 41 for modelling purpose every day time step was used for defining the topmost layer arc gis 9 3 was used as the due to the variability of the surface the vertical section is characterised as a grid of single layer of varying depth the discretization of the basin is as shown in fig 7 in order to get the surface elevation of the model the raster dem was down loaded and imported to gms and is interpolated the lower base of conceptual model was kept as 30 m below sea level which is corresponding to the base of unconfined aquifer the elevation of surface was found to vary between 4 m and 123 m above mean sea level fig 8 the time and space based discretization were arrived after first stages which was based on the precision of results the pumping test analysis data by honnanagoudar 2015 was utilised for getting the trasmissivity of the aquifer and specific yield while calibrating the values of both hydraulic conductivity as well as specific yield of the aquifer varied within range the horizontal anisotropy was considered as 1 for the model for calibration longitudinal dispersivity value which is ranging between 15 m and 150 m was taken bhosale and kumar 2001 as per cobaner et al 2012 horizontal dispersivity in the transverse direction was taken as 10 of longitudinal dispersivity 3 3 initial and boundary conditions modflow 2000 was used to simulate groundwater flow for the current study the water head of 23 observation wells were measured in the year 2016 2017 on seasonal basis pre monsoon and post monsoon and was used to calibrate the model which was then assigned as initial head for simulation of groundwater for transient flow fig 1 shows the location of 23 observation wells in the sub basin mt3dms requires the concentration of pollutant chloride ion mass transport was taken for the contaminant mass evolution because it is the most consistent parameter in order to find leachate contamination papadopoulou et al 2007 us saba et al 2016 hence concentration of chloride of leachate measured during october 2016 is assigned to the cells corresponding to landfill and was taken as initial concentration of transport model in the model grid it is difficult to replicate the same geometry and characteristics of the river rushton 2007 therefore the river aquifer interaction corresponds to river conductance is incorporated with equation which relates to the river aquifer flow to the difference between the levels of the water surface in the river package of modflow the rivers on the northern boundary of the sub basin are denoted by arc feature and allocated as river boundary with the help of the river riv package of modflow this is used to model the effects of flow between surface water and groundwater systems the river stage data on monthly basis were taken in to account in the model which was duly reduced as per the elevation of river bed the river width was measured using google earth which varied from 175 m to 225 m during the month of october the river bed thickness was assumed as 1 m as per field surveillance river bed conductivity was taken between the values ranging from 2 5 to 12 m day for fine and medium sand todd and mays 2005 a non permeable boundary which is also called as no flow boundary is modelled by specifying cells for which the flow equation is not solved in addition to that the flow between a no flow cell and its adjacent cell is zero further no flow cells were employed to remove the portion of the group of cells which is beyond the boundary of aquifer in this case it is employed everywhere in the model other than on the northern boundary the drain package was used to characterise the network of drainage which has a width of 3 m and depth of 1 5 m that is active only during the monsoon season i e from months june to september which will be discharged as surface run off to the river flowing along the northern boundary the precipitation during monsoon is the main source of recharge of the aquifer for lateritic type of soil the co efficient of recharge value recommended by groundwater estimation committee of india gec 1997 is 7 previous works also suggest the value of coefficient of recharge varied between 8 and 26 5 udayakumar 2008 the recharge package rch was used to simulate the areal recharge of the basin the groundwater of the area of the sub basin is widely used for agricultural and domestic purposes a local survey was done and found 68 of pumping wells to identify the agricultural area the lulc map fig 3 of the area is used the withdrawal of water from wells from aquifer in the specified rate throughout the stress period is modelled with the help of a package called well wel package in modflow the well discharge is handled in the well package by specifying the rate q at which each individual well removes water from the aquifer during each stress period in the absence of actual well draft data the withdrawal per well is allocated as per the requirement of water for the crops from the previous study it was observed that the evapotranspiration for the study area is 7 mm day 6 mm day and 5 mm day during the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons kumar 2010 accordingly the abstraction was calculated for the sub basin was calculated 3 4 calibration and validation in order to choose the initial parameters the steady state calibration had been done from the 23 observation wells water head as well as various physico chemical parameters has been measured afterwards in transient mode the model was run for around 1 year 2017 2018 with daily time step same hydrogeologic conditions were applied for the model during this time pest version 12 2 was used for calibrating the model for this study all the parameters such as recharge of the basin due to precipitation the effective porosity of the aquifer longitudinal as well as transverse dispersivity and also the coefficient of molecular diffusion were also taken as uniform throughout the basin as done by several other case studies langevin et al 2008 bauer et al 2006 narayan et al 2007 lin et al 2009 el kadi et al 2014 green and mac quarrie 2014 the calibrated simulation of water head is shown in fig 9 during the month of october 2016 post monsoon period and may 2017 pre monsoon period and may 2018 pre monsoon period according to the simulation the water head ranges from 5 m to 11 m during post monsoon period where as in pre monsoon period it ranges from 5 m to 15 m the evaluation of the model was done after the comparison of simulated water heads with that of observed values in order to know about the genuineness of the model prior to predictive scenario simulation validation was performed by comparing simulated water head data with that of observed head which was maintained at the central groundwater board and department of mines and geology government of karnataka 3 5 model performance the model calibration is a process in which the hydraulic parameter are varied until the simulated values of groundwater heads matched the observed groundwater heads thus improving the accuracy of the model the model simulated and measured groundwater head are compared using the following methods root mean square error rmse iv nash sutcliffe efficiency google earth imagery is used to establish the elevation of well location the rmse value for the observed and simulated values of head was obtained as 0 425 m and nse between the observed and simulated head for the present study was obtained 0 958 the aquifer is said to reach steady state condition during a period of time when aquifer attain a balance of flow and level of water will not vary over that time period the data for the current study area is limited hence based on a preliminary investigation it was found that the aquifer system was nearing steady state condition during the month of october hence the water head measured during the month of october 2016 is taken up for running and the calibration of the model under steady state and assigned as the starting head for the transient simulation the groundwater head of the observation well measured during the month of may 2017 and also the record of honnanagoudar 2015 is compared with the simulated values obtained for the sub basin for the process of calibration the rmse and nse values got after analysing the observed and calibrated groundwater head were 0 6092 m and 0 709 for the sub basin the calibration graph shows a convincingly good agreement with observed and simulated groundwater head fig 10 after successful calibration the recharge co efficient of 10 porosity of 30 and bed conductance of 15 m day are obtained as suitable parameters and the horizontal conductivity was estimated to be 7 m day the specific yield value and the transmissivity were 7 85 and 213 m2 day respectively the rmse and nse values got after analysing the observed and simulated groundwater head were 0 554 m and 0 6784 for the sub basin the model was valuated with a reasonable accuracy for future application the results are found to be consistent with that of calibrated results and therefore model is considered to be reliable for future prediction 3 6 solute transport modelling the parameters such as chloride concentration and cod of the leachate of landfill were measured and were given as the input value for concentration of percolating solution from landfill the resultant concentration at the observation is simulated and the value is compared with the actual concentration measured since the chloride concentration is comparatively high it was taken as the trace pollutant for identifying the spread of contaminant around landfill cod concentration has been taken for remediation experiments the source of pollution is being set as a point source where the continuous injection of pollutant take place which means the pollutant is entering the aquifer continuously for the analysis of transport of the contaminant mt3dms was used for the recognition of transport parameters 3 6 1 initial conditions the concentration of parameters such as chloride and cod of the landfill leachate were measured during the month of october 2016 and assigned to each cell of the landfill as initial concentration for transport model the water sample of observation wells were collected to find out the observed concentration 3 6 2 sorption the effect of sorption results in a retardation in the rate of migration of pollution plume the concentration of the pollutant and the sorbed mass is assumed to have a linear relationship and it also assumes that the action of sorption is a rapid process and the retardation factor is computed as 1 r 1 ρ k d n where ρ is the bulk density kd is distribution coefficient which is the slope of isotherm which is got as 0 17 and slope n is porosity by giving the value of sorption constant as 0 0002134 m3 kg in the chemical reaction package of mt3dms the model was run to find out the pollutant concentration at the observation wells 3 6 3 transport and density parameters in addition to aquifer parameters the solute transport parameter namely the hydrodynamic dispersivity is essential in solving the solute transport equation this is initially assigned as per available data which is adjusted by trial and error method at the time of calibration it was assumed that longitudinal dispersion is much larger than the transverse dispersion for transport simulation also the horizontal transverse dispersivity of 1 10th is suggested by cobaner et al 2012 the longitudinal dispersivity between 15 and 150 m is arrived by bhosale and kumar 2001 under similar aquifer conditions the calibration of transport parameters is performed similar to that of the flow parameters fig 11 gives the groundwater flow directions from modpath which shows the direction of advective movement of contaminants from landfill the water collected from observation wells were analysed to find the chloride as well as cod level it was found that groundwater within 1 km radius around the landfill is only polluted and hence the 10 observation wells located near the landfill are only considered for solute transport model the chloride concentration of groundwater of observation wells were analysed and were compared with the simulated values the steady state simulation was done by comparing the observed and simulated values of chloride level during the month of october 2016 for validation the observed chloride level were compared with the values maintained at karnataka state pollution control board mean absolute error as 129 2 mg l shows that the model performance is satisfactory as the values were well within the acceptable ranges the transport parameter such as longitudinal dispersivity 25 m and transverse dispersivity as 2 5 m were obtained after successful calibration fig 12 gives spatial distribution of chloride concentration during the month of october 2016 may 2017 and may 2018 the simulated ans observed chloride level is tabulated table 1 a good agreement was found between simulated and observed chloride level for the situation prevailed fig 13 as the results were again found to be reliable with mean absolute error as 70 9 mg l the model is considered to be trustworthy for future prediction here the current study is intended to evaluate the possibility of permeable reactive barrier using nano iron as a remedial alternative for that adsorption studies has been conducted using nano iron 3 6 4 adsorption studies a comparison of batch and column reactor has been done with nano iron to remediate a known concentration of chemical oxygen demand of synthetic leachate in the study it was observed that continuous fixed bed column was more effective in removal of cod in the remediation of leachate which may be due to the adsorption by laterite soil evaluation of freundlich and langmuir isotherm was done it was observed from the fitting curve that the correlation coefficient is higher for langmuir adsorption isotherm 0 96 fig 14 compared to that of the freundlich model 0 945 fig 15 more over previous studies show that because of the fast reaction kinetics and high removal efficiency nano iron has the fine potential to become an effective remedial agent in treatment of leachate li et al 2010 kashitarash et al 2012 hence it can be used in permeable reactive barriers because of its excellent removal efficiency shown during continuous fixed bed column studies divya et al 2018 3 6 5 permanent reactive barrier permanent reactive barriers are specially designed reactive zone which extends beneath water table which intercepts and degrade the contaminants in groundwater while passing through the barrier the pollutants will either get treated or get retained in the barrier method of installation of permanent reactive barrier includes construction of a trench across the flow path of contaminant either by using funnel and gate system or by constructing a continuous reactive barrier the gate or the continuous reactive barrier is filled with nano iron which reacts with the target contaminant to form by products which are biodegradable and non toxic 4 results and discussion 4 1 contaminant transport forecast before and after taking remedial measure assuming that there is no measure to control the pollutant ejection from the landfill the already established groundwater flow model and contaminant transport model was applied for the simulation of transport of pollutant in water table as the pollutant plume is continuously injecting from pollutant source which is landfill the pollutant plume was constantly expanding in the downstream direction at a velocity of 0 15 m day and the pollutant concentration is decreasing gradually as it moves forward as shown in figure fig 16 when the permeable reactive barrier is installed which can reduce the cod level by 65 it can be seen that the concentration of cod of groundwater of highly polluted observation well well no 3 which is located at 1 km from the landfill can be reduced from 600 mg l to nearly 400 mg l fig 17 the values of cod level before and after installing permanent reactive barrier is given in table 2 a graph showing the reduction in cod level has been shown in fig 18 which shows that there is a considerable reduction in concentration of cod can be achieved in the surrounding area if the reactive barrier is installed around landfill as many educational institutes are situated very near to landfill urgent attention needs to be given for the disposal of leachate 5 concluding remarks in the current study an effort was made for the simulation of response of the unconfined aquifer which receives plenty of monsoon rains with underlying lateritic soil for future predicted scenarios arising due to the spread of contaminant from landfill the modflow was used in simulating groundwater head and mt3dms were used for the simulation for finding the trail of contaminant the sorption of the laterite soil was considered as lateritic soil is a good adsorbent the sub basin was divided into 1622 elements with only one layer over the depth with size of each element being 100 m 100 m based on earlier studies the aquifer parameters were selected that were then subjected to transient calibrations it was observed that sub basin was having reasonable groundwater potential with specific yield value and the transmissivity were 7 85 and 213 m2 day respectively and also the horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set as 7 m day during the calibration it was observed that the model performance was satisfactory with nash sutcliffe efficiency range of 0 834 predictive simulation shows that if the permanent reactive barrier of nano iron is installed the pollutant concentration can be reduced to 400 mg l the results of the study will be helpful for the further extension of the work into field scale and implementing it for the prevention of propagation of pollutant plume this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors appendix a supplementary data the following

12033,the current study focuses on determination of extent of groundwater contamination on a typical tropical coastal aquifer due to a landfill located at vamnjoor in dakshina kannada district india with the help of groundwater flow model modflow and mt3dms when remediated with permanent reactive barrier of nano iron the aquifer considered is a shallow unconfined one with laterite soil which gets good rains during monsoon and will be dry during rest of the year the adsorption by laterite soil has been considered the specific yield and transmissivity were estimated to be 7 85 and 213m2 day respectively after calibrating successfully with nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 8 horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set as 7 m day validation of model was then done with the field data and is applied for forecasting the spread of contaminant for anticipated future scenarios the results show that in spite of retardation offered by lateritic soil contaminant trail is expanding with a velocity of 0 15 m day in downstream direction when permeable reactive barrier of nano iron which can adsorb nearly 65 of chemical oxygen demand is installed it is showing that the contaminant spread can be reduced to 400 mg l at the observation well located at 1 km from landfill hence a comprehensive remedial alternative of permanent reactive barrier of nano iron can be recommended for preventing groundwater contamination from landfill leachate graphical abstract image 1 keywords leachate landfill groundwater modelling pollution contaminant 1 introduction landfills are main sources of air and water pollution still dumping wastes in sanitary landfills is one of the most commonly used method for disposal of solid waste around the world as it is economical and environmentally sustainable option of waste management but when the decomposition of waste starts and when rainwater or groundwater mixes with the refuse leachate a highly toxic and stinking liquid dark brown in colour which is heterogeneous in nature comes out of the wastes the emission of leachate from landfill is alarming because of its toxic impact on the environment when it is released unchecked the leachate when penetrates in to the soil and reaches the underlying aquifer it causes groundwater pollution to prevent the percolation of leachate the landfill has to be lined and also the leachate has to be collected and treated before it reaches the underlying aquifer effective treatment has to be given to landfill leachate so as to meet water quality standards set by regulatory authorities the treatment measure has to be so chosen that it should be based on the characteristics of the waste disposed and the natural conditions prevailing in the landfill site the alternative remedial measure before adopting has to be screened in laboratory conditions or pilot study has to be conducted in the field guo et al 2009 new researches suggest nanotechnology as economically benefitted as well as an eco friendly way for the treatment of leachate nowadays nano particles are widely used for environmental remediation of various organic and inorganic pollutants because of their exclusive chemical and physical properties cundy et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2016 the higher reactive surface area smaller particle size and also higher dispersivity compared to other nano particles nano irons are widely used in the environmental clean up permanent reactive barriers are in situ treatment method where immobilization or degradation of contaminant takes place as leachate passes through reactive barrier obiri nyarko et al 2014 singh et al 2020 when the contaminated water passes through reactive bed it transforms the pollutant into environmentally accepted form various studies discuss the ability of permeable reactive barriers with various filling materials that are efficient in the in situ remediation of leachate contamination from landfill wang et al 2016 kumarasinghe et al 2018 groundwater modelling simulates the complexes involved in movement of groundwater and can replicate and forecast its flow and transport visual modflow is one among the numerous simulating tools to model groundwater flow three dimensionally and mt3dms is solute transport software used to simulate the movement of solute in variably saturated heterogeneous medium subjected to a variety of boundary conditions da et al 2013 srivastava and ramanathan 2018 with add on reaction packages to address phenomenon such as advection dispersion and chemical reaction by developing numerical model and applying the simulation technique in the contamination of groundwater the effects of remedial alternatives which can be applied on the field can be analysed which greatly saves the time as well as cost mangalore located at coastal region of dakshina kannada district karnataka india is experiencing an extraordinary growth of population since last decade due to urbanisation the mangalore city corporation is collecting the waste on a daily basis and dumping it into a landfill at vamanjoor located nearly 8 5 km from city centre the landfill has got a bottom liner but there is no system for the collecting leachate and hence it is getting disposed without treatment thus all the leachate formed at the bottom finds its trails into the neighbouring environment polluting the underlying aquifer studies shows that during post monsoon season because of the increase in hydraulic head there is downward flow of contaminant from the site where landfill is located mishra et al 2019 the geology of the basin under consideration is characterised by laterite of depth varying from 5 to 30 m as lateritic soil adsorbs various chemicals and heavy metals the sorption by laterite soil which retards the flow of pollutant has been considered nayanthika et al 2018 even though several simulation studies has been conducted to know about the contaminant transport seldom focussed on landfills located in unconfined coastal aquifer which receives lot of monsoon rains the current study is taken up with an objective to understand the contaminant transport of leachate and evaluates the applicability of permanent reactive barrier of nano iron around the landfill as a possible remedial alternative in order to achieve this objective recent and most effective tool modflow clubbed with mt3dms has been used the result of the study can be used for assisting in drafting a control plan so as to prevent the contamination from landfill 2 description of study area 2 1 location mangalore is

hydrogeologic conditions were applied for the model during this time pest version 12 2 was used for calibrating the model for this study all the parameters such as recharge of the basin due to precipitation the effective porosity of the aquifer longitudinal as well as transverse dispersivity and also the coefficient of molecular diffusion were also taken as uniform throughout the basin as done by several other case studies langevin et al 2008 bauer et al 2006 narayan et al 2007 lin et al 2009 el kadi et al 2014 green and mac quarrie 2014 the calibrated simulation of water head is shown in fig 9 during the month of october 2016 post monsoon period and may 2017 pre monsoon period and may 2018 pre monsoon period according to the simulation the water head ranges from 5 m to 11 m during post monsoon period where as in pre monsoon period it ranges from 5 m to 15 m the evaluation of the model was done after the comparison of simulated water heads with that of observed values in order to know about the genuineness of the model prior to predictive scenario simulation validation was performed by comparing simulated water head data with that of observed head which was maintained at the central groundwater board and department of mines and geology government of karnataka 3 5 model performance the model calibration is a process in which the hydraulic parameter are varied until the simulated values of groundwater heads matched the observed groundwater heads thus improving the accuracy of the model the model simulated and measured groundwater head are compared using the following methods root mean square error rmse iv nash sutcliffe efficiency google earth imagery is used to establish the elevation of well location the rmse value for the observed and simulated values of head was obtained as 0 425 m and nse between the observed and simulated head for the present study was obtained 0 958 the aquifer is said to reach steady state condition during a period of time when aquifer attain a balance of flow and level of water will not vary over that time period the data for the current study area is limited hence based on a preliminary investigation it was found that the aquifer system was nearing steady state condition during the month of october hence the water head measured during the month of october 2016 is taken up for running and the calibration of the model under steady state and assigned as the starting head for the transient simulation the groundwater head of the observation well measured during the month of may 2017 and also the record of honnanagoudar 2015 is compared with the simulated values obtained for the sub basin for the process of calibration the rmse and nse values got after analysing the observed and calibrated groundwater head were 0 6092 m and 0 709 for the sub basin the calibration graph shows a convincingly good agreement with observed and simulated groundwater head fig 10 after successful calibration the recharge co efficient of 10 porosity of 30 and bed conductance of 15 m day are obtained as suitable parameters and the horizontal conductivity was estimated to be 7 m day the specific yield value and the transmissivity were 7 85 and 213 m2 day respectively the rmse and nse values got after analysing the observed and simulated groundwater head were 0 554 m and 0 6784 for the sub basin the model was valuated with a reasonable accuracy for future application the results are found to be consistent with that of calibrated results and therefore model is considered to be reliable for future prediction 3 6 solute transport modelling the parameters such as chloride concentration and cod of the leachate of landfill were measured and were given as the input value for concentration of percolating solution from landfill the resultant concentration at the observation is simulated and the value is compared with the actual concentration measured since the chloride concentration is comparatively high it was taken as the trace pollutant for identifying the spread of contaminant around landfill cod concentration has been taken for remediation experiments the source of pollution is being set as a point source where the continuous injection of pollutant take place which means the pollutant is entering the aquifer continuously for the analysis of transport of the contaminant mt3dms was used for the recognition of transport parameters 3 6 1 initial conditions the concentration of parameters such as chloride and cod of the landfill leachate were measured during the month of october 2016 and assigned to each cell of the landfill as initial concentration for transport model the water sample of observation wells were collected to find out the observed concentration 3 6 2 sorption the effect of sorption results in a retardation in the rate of migration of pollution plume the concentration of the pollutant and the sorbed mass is assumed to have a linear relationship and it also assumes that the action of sorption is a rapid process and the retardation factor is computed as 1 r 1 ρ k d n where ρ is the bulk density kd is distribution coefficient which is the slope of isotherm which is got as 0 17 and slope n is porosity by giving the value of sorption constant as 0 0002134 m3 kg in the chemical reaction package of mt3dms the model was run to find out the pollutant concentration at the observation wells 3 6 3 transport and density parameters in addition to aquifer parameters the solute transport parameter namely the hydrodynamic dispersivity is essential in solving the solute transport equation this is initially assigned as per available data which is adjusted by trial and error method at the time of calibration it was assumed that longitudinal dispersion is much larger than the transverse dispersion for transport simulation also the horizontal transverse dispersivity of 1 10th is suggested by cobaner et al 2012 the longitudinal dispersivity between 15 and 150 m is arrived by bhosale and kumar 2001 under similar aquifer conditions the calibration of transport parameters is performed similar to that of the flow parameters fig 11 gives the groundwater flow directions from modpath which shows the direction of advective movement of contaminants from landfill the water collected from observation wells were analysed to find the chloride as well as cod level it was found that groundwater within 1 km radius around the landfill is only polluted and hence the 10 observation wells located near the landfill are only considered for solute transport model the chloride concentration of groundwater of observation wells were analysed and were compared with the simulated values the steady state simulation was done by comparing the observed and simulated values of chloride level during the month of october 2016 for validation the observed chloride level were compared with the values maintained at karnataka state pollution control board mean absolute error as 129 2 mg l shows that the model performance is satisfactory as the values were well within the acceptable ranges the transport parameter such as longitudinal dispersivity 25 m and transverse dispersivity as 2 5 m were obtained after successful calibration fig 12 gives spatial distribution of chloride concentration during the month of october 2016 may 2017 and may 2018 the simulated ans observed chloride level is tabulated table 1 a good agreement was found between simulated and observed chloride level for the situation prevailed fig 13 as the results were again found to be reliable with mean absolute error as 70 9 mg l the model is considered to be trustworthy for future prediction here the current study is intended to evaluate the possibility of permeable reactive barrier using nano iron as a remedial alternative for that adsorption studies has been conducted using nano iron 3 6 4 adsorption studies a comparison of batch and column reactor has been done with nano iron to remediate a known concentration of chemical oxygen demand of synthetic leachate in the study it was observed that continuous fixed bed column was more effective in removal of cod in the remediation of leachate which may be due to the adsorption by laterite soil evaluation of freundlich and langmuir isotherm was done it was observed from the fitting curve that the correlation coefficient is higher for langmuir adsorption isotherm 0 96 fig 14 compared to that of the freundlich model 0 945 fig 15 more over previous studies show that because of the fast reaction kinetics and high removal efficiency nano iron has the fine potential to become an effective remedial agent in treatment of leachate li et al 2010 kashitarash et al 2012 hence it can be used in permeable reactive barriers because of its excellent removal efficiency shown during continuous fixed bed column studies divya et al 2018 3 6 5 permanent reactive barrier permanent reactive barriers are specially designed reactive zone which extends beneath water table which intercepts and degrade the contaminants in groundwater while passing through the barrier the pollutants will either get treated or get retained in the barrier method of installation of permanent reactive barrier includes construction of a trench across the flow path of contaminant either by using funnel and gate system or by constructing a continuous reactive barrier the gate or the continuous reactive barrier is filled with nano iron which reacts with the target contaminant to form by products which are biodegradable and non toxic 4 results and discussion 4 1 contaminant transport forecast before and after taking remedial measure assuming that there is no measure to control the pollutant ejection from the landfill the already established groundwater flow model and contaminant transport model was applied for the simulation of transport of pollutant in water table as the pollutant plume is continuously injecting from pollutant source which is landfill the pollutant plume was constantly expanding in the downstream direction at a velocity of 0 15 m day and the pollutant concentration is decreasing gradually as it moves forward as shown in figure fig 16 when the permeable reactive barrier is installed which can reduce the cod level by 65 it can be seen that the concentration of cod of groundwater of highly polluted observation well well no 3 which is located at 1 km from the landfill can be reduced from 600 mg l to nearly 400 mg l fig 17 the values of cod level before and after installing permanent reactive barrier is given in table 2 a graph showing the reduction in cod level has been shown in fig 18 which shows that there is a considerable reduction in concentration of cod can be achieved in the surrounding area if the reactive barrier is installed around landfill as many educational institutes are situated very near to landfill urgent attention needs to be given for the disposal of leachate 5 concluding remarks in the current study an effort was made for the simulation of response of the unconfined aquifer which receives plenty of monsoon rains with underlying lateritic soil for future predicted scenarios arising due to the spread of contaminant from landfill the modflow was used in simulating groundwater head and mt3dms were used for the simulation for finding the trail of contaminant the sorption of the laterite soil was considered as lateritic soil is a good adsorbent the sub basin was divided into 1622 elements with only one layer over the depth with size of each element being 100 m 100 m based on earlier studies the aquifer parameters were selected that were then subjected to transient calibrations it was observed that sub basin was having reasonable groundwater potential with specific yield value and the transmissivity were 7 85 and 213 m2 day respectively and also the horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set as 7 m day during the calibration it was observed that the model performance was satisfactory with nash sutcliffe efficiency range of 0 834 predictive simulation shows that if the permanent reactive barrier of nano iron is installed the pollutant concentration can be reduced to 400 mg l the results of the study will be helpful for the further extension of the work into field scale and implementing it for the prevention of propagation of pollutant plume this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors appendix a supplementary data the following

12034,the falling piezometric level of groundwater is one of the major concerns because of its immense importance especially in areas where treated surface water is not easily accessible an attempt is made to identify the areas of maximum depletion of groundwater in kmc area by studying the post monsoon groundwater level data for the years 1991 2010 the arc gis software is used for the representation of the secondary data and also for the easy comparison of data the study is done to find the groundwater trough in the region by predicting the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and validating the result with the data collected from the field the result thus obtained is analysed with the help of the said software using the idw inverse distance weightage technique thus it is seen that gis forms an excellent platform for the analysis of groundwater data and is very helpful in the present study a comparative analysis has been made and it is seen that at maximum places in kmc region the water level is receding places like narendrapur chitpur sinthi ballygunge park street jadavpur all show a receding trend few places being exception like mukundapur kalikapur where there has been a slight rise in the groundwater level over the years with the advancement in the surface water supply by the kolkata municipal corporation and with the decrease in population density there is no respite in the groundwater level recession in the city blessed with river hooghly alongside the potable water issue is solved to a greater extent but still the southern kolkata shows dependence on groundwater due to the falling groundwater level the chances of land subsidence is seem to be high in the city graphical abstract image 1 keywords piezometric level groundwater depletion geographical information system gis inverse distance weightage idw mbgl metre below ground level 1 introduction kolkata is one of the most populated metropolitan cities of india for the last 300 years the city has witnessed a high population growth due to increasing urban development and increasing population the demand for water mainly for domestic use has risen by many folds the main source of water supply for the city is derived from the hooghly river through the tala pumping station and garden reach pumping station in spite of this surface water sources a huge amount of water is withdrawn from the groundwater aquifers this consistent withdrawal of groundwater has created a trough due to depletion of groundwater jadavpur centre for study of earth science 2019 many parts of kolkata receive a mix of treated surface water and groundwater by deep tube wells and hand tube wells due to the shortage of surface water supply from 2005 kmc started replacing the groundwater supply by surface water thus there has been a reduction in the quantum of groundwater withdrawal by kmc owned tube wells from 2005 roy et al 2012 since the water supply was not available in larger areas of the kmc which forced the population to tap the available groundwater resources biswas and saha 1985 thus reassessing the groundwater scenario of the region becomes essential withdrawal of groundwater in kmc region by kmc owned tube wells increased from 121 5 mld in 1986 to 209 7 mld in 1998 and continuing up to 2004 roy et al 2012 this being on the legal count there are many illegal ways of withdrawal of groundwater there are many private tube wells running simultaneously which is one of the reasons of deepening of trough in the region the groundwater occurring in kolkata region is in two zones groundwater in the upper clay beds is in unconfined aquifer while the groundwater in the deeper zones is held under pressure water table in the shallow zone is very close to the land surface i e just 2 3 mbgl biswas and saha 1985 but this level has fallen due to lower infiltration rate caused due to increasing built up in the area the piezometric level as stated by biswas and saha 1985 was 9 10 m but in the present paper it is seen that the level has fallen down to as low as 19 mbgl at some places thus indicating a declining trend groundwater being a renewable resource has become the lender of last resort alley et al 1999 heavy pumping of groundwater in regions of flat lowlands can alter the hydrological system the incessant pumping of groundwater may lead to a change in the recharge area locations shifting it closer to the city centre thus increasing the chances of contamination the falling piezometric level due to over pumpage may lead to a change in the aquifer condition from confined to unconfined one resulting in the loss of water from the overlying aquiclude into the underlying aquifer if this water contains toxic materials then the fresh water aquifer may get polluted even the loss of water may lead to compression leading to land subsidence sahu and sikdar 2008 sahu et al 2013 providing safe drinking water to its masses is one of the biggest challenges of the authority despite having a high annual rainfall the city faces water crisis the biggest factor being the huge built up due to which the entire precipitation forms run off and is unable to recharge the groundwater as the natural intervention by human activities increases significantly the groundwater circulation system becomes increasingly complex and the variation of groundwater level presents new horizons as to understanding the law of groundwater circulation and its influential factors under different situations is one of the greatest concern in hydrogeology kaur et al 2015 wriedt 2017 liu et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2019 the unplanned development of the city also adds to its havoc mukherjee et al 2018 having good ecological diversity with river hooghly on one side and the wetlands on the other still the city faces water challenges the main reason is its incessant growth in population and wastage of valuable water the over exploitation of the resource thus manifest itself in the form of land subsidence bringing havoc to the region waikar and nilawar 2014 quantification of groundwater resources is often critical and no single comprehensive technique is yet identified which is capable of estimating accurate groundwater assessment groundwater is a concealed natural resource the physical accessibility is limited due to which its study becomes limited but its assessment is very much needed for the identification of water supply and control of pollution integrated studies using traditional survey techniques along with satellite image data and gis tools are useful in the study of groundwater resources bhunia et al 2012 sankar 2002 the urban landscape is undergoing a rapid change leading to many environmental risks which in turn is also affecting the groundwater reserves an effective management of the same requires an evidence based technique for ruling out the risk arising from it khadim et al 2016 advancement has been made in the field of gis which provides a platform for the execution of spatial data and has proved to be an efficient and useful tool in the study of groundwater resources kamaraju et al 1996 it helps in the integration of data in a short span of time and is effective in planning at managerial front ramamoorthy and rammohan 2015 assessment of temporal and spatial patterns of groundwater level becomes essential to carry out plans to meet the rising demand in a sustainable way eshtawi et al 2015 despite advances in remote sensing technologies image classification methods are always not that accurate mtibaa and irie 2016 and hence a ground check becomes very essential much of the work on the level of groundwater has not been carried out in kolkata because of which an attempt was made to study out the temporal and spatial variations in groundwater level in kmc area the study included the secondary data of groundwater for the post monsoon period in all wards of kmc primary survey was carried out to measure the groundwater level at different places in kolkata and validate the result with the predicted data the present work also attempts to identify risk zones and analyse the several factors leading to the same 2 study area the city of kolkata the capital of the indian state of west bengal as seen in fig 1 is located in the lower deltaic plains of the ganga bhagirathi river system with river hooghly draining its western boundary extending from 22 28 n to 22 37 30 n and 88 17 30 e to 88 25 e covering an area of 187 33 sq km the city is divided into 141 wards three more wards having been added recently the greater part of the plain land is drained by river hooghly along the north western part and also by several canals like bagjola in the north beleighata and circular khal in the central part and adi ganga and tolly nallah in the southern part but the major part of these khals and nalas are silted gib 2007 it is a deltaic flat land with an elevation of 3 5 m 6 m above mean sea level sloping towards the south the city has many low lying depressions like marshes shallow lakes many of which are a remnant of the earlier river channels of bhagirathi the important geomorphologic units found in the region are levees deltaic plain inter distributory marsh paleo channels the younger levees are found adjacent to the river hooghly and older levees are found on both sides of the adi ganga as seen in fig 2 the kolkata metropolitan is underlain by quaternary sediments of fluvio deltaic origin clay is found at the top and the thickness of the clay is not same everywhere at college ghat street shibpur it is 16 m and 54 m near gobra 35 m near barrackpur and 45 m near sealdah thus it the clay layer varies in thickness from 30 to 50 m having a mixture of silt and sand water bearing zones consisting of medium to coarse sand and pebble generally occur between the depths of 60 80 m thus it is seen that aquifers are bound between two low permeability beds occurring at 30 50 m below land surface and other at depths of more than 300 m below land surface 3 methodology the post monsoon groundwater level data for kmc area for the year 1991 2010 were collected from state water investigation directorate swid under government of west bengal a total of 40 stations monitored the groundwater level as shown in fig 3 a which is taken into consideration for the present study the exact locations latitudinal and longitudinal extent were extracted from google earth pro and these kml keyhole markup language points were converted into shape file using arcgis 10 3 software these earth points contain the water level data for the year 1991 2010 hence using the arc gis software the entire kmc area was mapped using idw inverse distance weightage technique which determines cell values using a linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points the weight being a function of inverse distance and the surface that is to be interpolated is of locational dependent variable the interpolated maps were generated for the post monsoon period of 1991 2010 with the help of the above technique the entire area was mapped and since in kolkata the confined aquifer is tapped the trend of the piezometric level of groundwater was determined for the study area within the given time frame from the interpolated maps contour lines were drawn depicting the groundwater level of the kmc area following the trend of groundwater depletion the statistical analysis of linear regression was used for prediction of gwl using the following formulas eqs 1 3 1 y 1 μ ν x 1 2 μ n 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 n 1 x 1 2 x 1 2 3 ν y 1 μ x 1 n 1 where x 1 y 1 are two variables on regression line μ slope of the line ν y 1 intercept of the line x 1 and y 1 are the values of the first and second data set respectively linear regression was used for predicting the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and these data were validated with the field survey data that was collected from the following 15 stations mentioned in table 1 and fig 3 b using the tlc temperature water level and conductivity metre the survey was done during post monsoon period in 2018 in the month of november and a comparative study was done using the predicted and actual data the root mean square error rmse was calculated to see the compatibility of the predicted value and measured value of gwl eq 4 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f o 2 where f forecasts expected unknown results and o observed values this technique helped in the better understanding of the problem and also to delineate the areas where the risk of groundwater hazard is likely to be the maximum contours or isolines were prepared from the interpolated data so that the comparison becomes easier the trend of groundwater level in the city was co related with rainfall data acquired from indian meteorological department population density data from census of india and the distribution of surface water supply data from kolkata municipal corporation in order to analyse the state of groundwater in the city the entire methodology is summarised in the form of a flow chart shown in fig 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater level trends in the city and formation of trough area the overall analysis of the groundwater level of the kolkata city shows a mix trend of groundwater level but maximum areas experience lowering of groundwater level gwl the water level fluctuation for the year 1991 2010 is between 1 03 mbgl to 19 38 mbgl there has been a fall of 1 m 6 m of ground water level in the city for the above decadal period as seen in fig 5 a recession or lowering of groundwater level in the city is seen both in north and south kolkata in the year 1991 the lowest groundwater level is seen in hedua which is around 7 5 mbgl the northern part of kolkata shows a comparatively better gwl than its southern counterparts chitpur has a level of 12 mbgl but maximum depletion in northern kolkata is seen in bagbazar with a value of 13 mbgl the same level of groundwater is indicated in ballygunge in south kolkata these two places show the maximum depletion the contour of 12 m encloses bantala as seen in fig 5 a the trough is formed in the south central part of the city in the following year the area of maximum depletion remains the same around ballygunge and bagbazar mostly places in south like tollygunge behala jadavpur deshapriya park hazra all have gwl below 12 m as seen in fig 5 a and even in north kolkata chitpur shows the above gwl the contour depicting gwl for the year 1991 and 1992 does not show much of a difference for the year 1993 the maximum depletion is found in hedua where the level has fallen from 7 27 mbgl in 1992 to 11 64 mbgl in 1993 the contour of 12 mbgl encircles the area as seen in fig 5 c around bagbazar and ballygunge the contour value still remains the highest the gwl in the eastern corner of the city i e in bantala remains around 11 12 mbgl places like kalighat deshapriya park shows a slight increase in the gwl this is indicated by the shift in the contour value as seen in fig 5 a in 1994 there has been a depletion of 1m on an average in the entire area the trough zone remains the same but with more lowering of the groundwater levels the contour value of 13 m earlier encircled ballygunge area is now replaced with 14 m contour for bantala there has been a fall of 1 m even for sinthi chitpur bagbazar the level of depletion remains the same increase in gwl is only seen around hazra whereas all other places show a depletion all other factors remaining the same a noticeable amount of depletion is seen at hazra in the year 1995 a fall of around 2 m in the gwl the rise in the preceding year could be because of some local variations but the place shows a receding trend the 1996 trend of gwl shows a conspicuous decline in gwl a noticeable amount of groundwater is depleted in just a year the maximum depletion is noticed in areas around park circus where there has been a fall of 3 m in the gwl the water level fell from 13 77 mbgl in the preceding year to 16 72 mbgl in 1996 a sharp fall of 5 5 m is seen at kalighat a noticeable depletion in just a year is a matter of concern even at rajabazar there has been a fall of 3 m which can be compared from the contour levels shown in fig 5 at keyatola the depletion has been from 11 48 m to 15 25 m thus the contour of 15 m encircles the area this sudden depletion is due to the reckless withdrawal of groundwater for consumption by household and industrial sector and also with the growing urbanization the demand for groundwater increases for construction purpose the following year witnesses a further decrease in the gwl the depletion zone widens covering a larger area the contour of 16m covers garden reach kalighat behala tollygunge hazra tiljala thus it is seen that the trough area or the zone of maximum depletion is formed in the central and south central part of the city as seen in fig 5 b the gwl rose a bit at some places as it is evident from the contour map of 1998 at sinthi the gwl rose from 14 88 mbgl to 11 73 mbgl at bagbazar there is a rise of 2 m on an average even at kalighat the gwl has risen by 2 m a significant increase in gwl is seen at bantala the water rose to 9 46 mbgl places in the extreme south shows a higher level of gwl this could be because of less population pressure as compared to the northern part of the city garia has a level as high as 7 8 mbgl in kalikapur sonarpur the gwl varies between 5 7 mbgl an increasing trend is noticed in rajabazar the gwl further increases 10mbgl at babughat there has been a decrease of 3 m a further increase of 1 m is seen at bantala which is evident from the 8 m contour level thus it is seen that at the eastern end of the city there is an increasing trend and on the western part the groundwater is depleting there has been a 1 m rise at hazra and garia and at kundghat there has been a fall of 2 m at sarsuna the gwl rose from 11 mbgl to 8 mbgl the contour map for the year 2000 shows the same trend as for 1998 the level at rajabazar fell back to 12 m bantala back to 9 m and the gwl dropped by 2 m and 3 m at belgharia and garia respectively in 2001 the maximum lowering of groundwater level is as low as 16 m around keyatola area more than 15 mbgl is found in bagbazar beckbagan tollygunge khidirpur park circus park street kalighat area comparatively the southern part of the city has got a well placed groundwater level as high as 3 74 mbgl around narendrapur thus the trough area is found along the western and northern part of the city even in the year 2002 same trend is observed the maximum recession is seen in the northern and western part of the kolkata administrative boundary maximum lowering of level is seen around hastings alipur where the water level is as low as 16mbgl bagbazar and beckbagan have got a level of 14mbgl as seen in fig 5 b not much of a difference is seen in the next year the level remains as low as 16 mbgl bagbazar khidirpur have a level of below 15 mbgl garden reach kalighat ballygunge have values of 14 mbgl the southern part of the city shows a better groundwater level in comparison to its northern counterparts the following year shows a rise in the groundwater level in some parts of the city namely sinthi babughat kalighat bantala kasba hazra kalikapur narendrapur whereas a sharp fall of 5 m is observed at garia the same being for the year 2005 as seen in fig 5 c in 2006 there has been a fall of 1m in the groundwater level on an average in the city may be due to huge withdrawal of groundwater but a rise in the level is seen at kudghat and narendrapur a remarkable rise in groundwater level is seen at babughat and kalighat around 4 m of rise at these places this may be due to the influence of the local factors the following year again shows a receding level at these places and on an average there has been a fall of 1 2 m of gwl in the following year there has been again a rise seen at babughat a noticeable fluctuation is seen around babughat this might be due to the influence of the river hugli in 2010 the gwl has much declined it has fallen to as low as 19 38 mbgl a lot of groundwater is being withdrawn which shows the high dependence on groundwater resource the lowest level is observed at bagbazar chitpur area a level of 17 mbgl and 18 mbgl around beniatola and sinthi a rise of 4 m at babughat and 2 m rise in garia and narendrapur is observed as shown in fig 5 d the overall analysis shows that the maximum recession has been found in the south western part of the city at narendrapur where there has been a fall of 7 76 mbgl in the given decade which can be compared from the contours drawn in fig 4 in post monsoon 2001 the groundwater level had been 3 24 mbgl which fell to 11 mbgl in 2010 the excessive groundwater recession is found in south kolkata due to excessive withdrawal of groundwater to meet the daily requirement of water as the surface water supply was not adequate a high recession is also seen in bhawanipore area where there has been a fall of 6 m in 2001 the gwl was 12 03 mbgl which went down to 18 2 mbgl in 2010 even in ballygunge area there has been a fall of 4 31 m excessive groundwater recession is also seen in sarsuna and thakurpukur where the fall has been of 4 46 mbgl and 3 99 mbgl respectively in haridevpur area there has been a decline of 4 41 m in north kolkata the scenario is equally alarming maximum recession in the north is seen in chitpur bagbazar and sinthi around bagbazar and chitpur where the groundwater level gwl is as low as 19 mbgl the trend shows that depletion has taken place at a very fast rate in this area in 1991 the gwl had been 13 05 mbgl which is lowered to 19 25 mbgl in the year 2010 a depletion of around 6m in areas around sinthi the gwl was 11 98 mbgl in 2001 which is lowered to 18 55 mbgl in 2010 same being for rajabazar sealdah places like kashipur paikpara belgachia shyambazar beckbagan jorabagan maniktala dumdum and park circus all have a lower water level below 17 18 mbgl in bantala there has been a fall of 5 82 m in the given decade there has been a striking depletion at hedua the gwl was as high as 7 5 mbgl in 1991 which fell to 16 85mbgl a maximum recession of 9 35 in 20 years even at kasba and rajabazar there has been a fall of 5m approximately there are many places in the city where the water level is below 16m chitpur entally parkstreet beckbagan bijaygarh behala hazra keyatola bantala park circus bhawanipore sinthi ballygunge and jadavpur the highest drawdown is seen in chitpur and entally where the level is as low as 19 25 mbgl and 19 1 mbgl respectively as seen in fig 6 thus a receding trough has been found in the above zones there being a few exceptions in the city where the gwl has shown a slight increase over the decade this may be due to less dependence on groundwater and tapping of surface water for meeting the water demands the area near babughat where water level was around 13 14 mbgl in the year 2001 and 2002 increased to 6 35 mbgl in 2010 even at garia the water level increased from 11 mbgl to 7 95 mbgl this may be due to the surface water that is being supplied by the corporation because of which the dependence on the groundwater resources is decreasing behala mukundapur picnic garden has shown a rise in the water level fig 6 shows the percentage change in gwl over a period of 20 years from 1991 2010 it is seen that maximum change is seen in chingrighata babughat belgharia whereas slight change is seen in kasba hazra garia it is seen that maximum change has taken place in the northern part of the city in comparison to its southern counterparts 4 2 estimating the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and validating the result following the trend of gwl an attempt has been made to estimate the groundwater level for the year 2018 for post monsoon period time series regression analysis has been used for predicting the gwl for kmc area the predicted value of gwl for the year 2018 is shown in fig 7 from the figure it is clearly seen that the area of maximum depletion is found in the northern and central part of the city places around bagbazar entally park circus alipur and garden reach show greater depletion of gwl good level of groundwater is witnessed in southern and eastern kolkata around mukundapur sarsuna thakurpukur and bantala respectively from the map it is clearly seen that only places around mukundapur and garia has gwl level between 9 11 mbgl whereas all other places shows a lower gwl places in the eastern and southern part of the city like bantala sarsuna kalikapur thakurpukur panchasayer kudghat sahapur have values around 11 13 mbgl other places shows a depleting gwl level majority of places in the southern part like ballygunge kalighat bhawanipur all have values between 13 15 mbgl the northern part of the city shows a higher depletion hedua a p c road tiljala hastings have a gwl of 15 17 mbgl the maximum groundwater depletion is seen in chitpur sinthi bagbazar entally beckbagan and alipur thus from the estimated value it is seen that the maximum depletion is seen in the northern part of the city though it is not limited to the north even the gwl in the south is getting depleted but as a whole the northern part of the city is at a higher risk of groundwater depletion the southern part of the city shows a comparatively better gwl this may be due to the lesser population pressure and presence of more open spaces the estimated value of gwl has been validated from the data collected from field survey the findings are interpolated in arc gis 10 3 and are depicted in the map shown in fig 8 the entire city of kolkata is likely to face groundwater hazard if the resource remains to be over utilised the reckless use of the groundwater resource can lead to many ecological problems in the city from the data collected during the survey the entire city can be grouped into five zones the northern part of the city including bagbazar chitpur sinthi girish park entally all fall under high risk zone where the groundwater is between 17 20 mbgl the central part of the city falls in the vulnerable zone where the gwl is between 15 16 mbgl the southern part of the city shows a water level between 14 16mbgl with exception being mukundapur and garia where the level is 12 14 mbgl only sarsuna is comparatively better placed with values between 10 12 mbgl this might be due to the influence of the surface water body thus the trough zone is formed in the northern part of the city and stringent measures needs to be taken to arrest the problem to validate the data field survey was taken up and the surveyed gwl for the post monsoon period 2018 was collected at 15 points spread over the entire region the data has been interpolated and the maps have been prepared in arcgis software as shown in fig 7 the predicted value and estimated value were correlated and the correlation is found to be 0 736 as shown in fig 9 and the rmse was calculated to be 2 33 which prove the fact that the predicted value for gwl is very close to the estimated one thus from the surveyed data it can be established that the maximum depletion is seen around north and north western part of the city areas around sinthi bagbazar entally park street are at a higher risk of groundwater depletion followed by alipur gardenreach tiljala comparatively the south and south east part of the city shows a higher gwl and thus are at a lower risk of groundwater depletion the predicted and measured gwl perfectly correlates out of 15 measured points 13 points fall within 20 that is 80 of the data has been properly correlated only two points fall within 30 only thakurpukur falls in the line of perfect agreement where the estimated and predicted values of gwl are almost same places like hedua chitpur park circus bantala sarsuna alipur haridebpur garden reach entally deshapriya park the values are within 20 which indicates a good correlation only two places i e garia and mukundapur falls within the zone of 30 due to the higher variations in the gwl in these two areas 4 3 groundwater level and rainfall kolkata is blessed to receive a good amount of rainfall during the monsoon months the rainfall pattern of the city for the year 1991 2010 is shown in fig 10 a there has not been much of a variation in the rainfall pattern there are years of flood and years where rainfall has not been good but overall the city receives a good amount of rainfall it is quite evident that rainfall pattern of kolkata area has not much of an impact on the groundwater level of the region but still there is some connection between the two fig 10 a shows the relationship between rainfall and average groundwater level of kolkata area in the year 1999 when the rainfall is quite high the gwl also show a rise this was due to the increase in the amount of recharge even for the year 2007 a similar trend is observed in the year 2009 and 2010 when the rainfall is quite low the gwl has fallen the aquifer of kolkata area gets recharged from the nearby districts there is no recharge for the aquifer in the city itself the aquifer gets recharged from the surrounding districts of nadia 24 parganas hugli and howrah it is very uncertain to demarcate the actual region of groundwater recharge thus a weighatge method is adopted to get an average of recharge from rainfall for this area two parallel lines were drawn touching the eastern and western extreme of the city and the area for each district falling into the zone was given a weightage according to the area and an average rainfall from the recharge zones is calculated a correlation is done between the rainfall from the recharge zone and average groundwater level of kolkata and it is seen that there exists a considerable amount of correlation between the two variables the correlation is around 0 5694 as seen in fig 10 b thus rainfall plays an impactful role in affecting the groundwater level of the city a land use change in the above districts is likely to affect the groundwater condition of the city 4 4 population density and groundwater level the availability of any resource in any region is determined by the extraction of the resources that is the demand for the resource groundwater resource is directly related to the population pressure of the region the higher the population the greater is the demand for water the demand increases further if surface water supply is not adequately present to understand the relationship between groundwater level and the population of the city the population density of the region is considered since the area of each ward is not the same the population density of the city of kolkata for the year 1991 2001 and 2011 is shown in fig 11 a below the above are the census years which are taken into consideration which takes place at an interval of 10 years the higher population density for the year 1991 is seen in wards 49 52 54 56 62 77 107 and 125 in the southern part it is clearly visible that higher population density is seen in the northern part of the city in 2001 it is seen that there has been a decrease in population density of many wards the wards which showed a higher population density in the previous census shows a fall in population in the current census in 2011 it is seen that the population density of the city has further decreased this is mainly due to development of the bidhannagar municipality and the newtown rajarhat areas which has led to the expansion of the city and movement of the population to these newly reclaimed areas and thus decreasing the population pressure with decrease in population density the demand for groundwater has not decreased which should have been and thus the groundwater resources is still being depleted the higher population density in the northern part of the city directly correlates with the lower gwl in the region the change in population for the year 2001 2011 shows a vast change in population in the city in many wards there has been a decreasing growth rate which is a clear indication of the expansion of population in the adjoining areas the decrease in population density is significant than its increase there has been a considerable decrease in population density in wards 43 46 47 70 16 25 39 4 6 9 10 and many other wards the increase has not been so much it is very much clear from the graph in fig 11 b 4 5 surface water supply and groundwater level there are many water works with different capacity in kolkata metropolitan district kmd run by different organizations namely kolkata municipal corporation kmc kolkata metropolitan development authority kmda kolkata metropolitan water and sanitation authority kmda kolkata metropolitan water and sanitation authority kmw sa howrah municipal corporation hmc public health directorate phed indira gandhi water treatment plant igwtp also known as palta water works operated by kmc is the largest and oldest water treatment plant in kolkata water works that provide potable water are listed below in table 2 at present there are five water works involved to supply potable water to kmc area igwtp supplies drinking water to north central and part of south kolkata borough number i to vii of kmc jai hind jal prakalpa distributes water to ward no 101 to 110 66 and 57 jorabagan water treatment plant feed the areas of burabazar and dalhousie kmc ward numbers 21 22 23 24 25 41 42 and 45 watgunj water treatment plant caters water in watgunj khidirpore and hastings area garden reach water works is engaged to provide water to southern part of kmc and some other municipalities fig 12 shows the area of kmc fed by different sources the present north kolkata was getting treated ganges water produced by igwtp supplied by tallah pumping station but there was a scarcity of treated surface water in the southern part of the city the inhabitants by tradition are dependent on groundwater which in itself was hazardous as the water was contaminated with iron arsenic fluoride and other contaminants after the installation of grww the resident of south kolkata found some respite as a trans municipal project it also began to supply potable water to some south suburban areas along with south kmc areas i e entire borough numbers viii to xv and more than 50 of borough number xvi covering ward numbers 74 part of 78 and 79 80 to 84 87 to 100 111 to 115 part of 116 and 117 118 to 140 and part of 141 it serves the people in two ways 1 by supplying water directly in distribution grids during pressure hours and 2 by filling more than 20 numbers bps and 10 numbers esr as well during non pressure hour presently grww is involved in supplying potable water to three municipalities viz pujali budgebudge and mahestala along with vast areas of south kolkata like metiabrutz garden reach khidirpore parnashree taratala chetla kalighat gariahat rabindra sarobar tollygunge golfgreen jadavpur garfa ranikuthi bansdroni behala daspara siriti in kmc areas currently it is the 2nd largest water works in kma area contributing more than 38 approximately 145 mgd of total potable water supplied by all the water works owned by kmc serving more than 20 lakh people it is seen that the maximum dependence on groundwater is in the southern part but still the depletion of gwl is noticed in the northern part of kolkata this might be due to the illegal means of water withdrawal in the northern part of the city the density being high in the northern part due to which the water demand is also high leading to the depletion of the resource sarkar 2016 4 6 land subsidence in city groundwater over pumping is the chief contributor to land subsidence it is a hazard in disguise land subsidence takes time to surface its effect over exploitation of groundwater leads to difference in pore pressure leading to the subsidence of land above keeping in mind the depletion of water level in the city the need to assess land subsidence becomes utmost important extending the work of bhattacharya et al 2014 the present land subsidence scenario of the city is calculated bhattacharya et al 2014 carried out the work at four different places in the city namely shyambazar gariahat minto park and science city using the logarithmic theory approach the summarised outcome of the study is given below in table 3 the rate of subsidence r s per annum as well as rate of subsidence per meter drop in gwl was found highest at science city if the gwl of these four locations mentioned in table 3 are compared with the gwl of the recent two decades then it is seen that there is a fall in the gwl over the years the trend of gwl for these four places for the years 1991 2010 is shown in fig 13 the declining gwl trends at these four locations confirm that there is a sequential depletion of gwl thus the chances of land subsidence are expected high at these places during 1991 2010 using the above outcomes land subsidence in the last two decades shown in table 4 is estimated assuming the same soil characteristics as was considered by bhattacharya et al 2014 total subsidence in cm for the period 2000 2018 has been calculated using the rate of subsidence per meter drop in gwl for the period 1956 2000 exception being gariahat where the period between 1958 1999 was taken into consideration it is found out that the maximum subsidence is seen around science city area which is probably due to the rapid urbanisation thereby the over exploitation of the groundwater resources the percentage change in r s has been calculated using eq 5 5 percentage change in r s r s 2000 2018 r s 1956 2000 r s 1956 2000 100 the average annual decrease of gwl at gariahat and minto park during 1991 2000 is 0 185 and 0 084 m whereas earlier during 1991 2000 it was 0 287 and 0 267 respectively it confirms that rate of annual groundwater withdraw at gariahat and minto park has been decreased during 2000 2018 compared to that of 1956 2000 whereas rate of annual groundwater withdraw at science city and shyambazar has been increased during 2000 2018 compared to that of 1956 2000 especially for science city the rate of subsidence is expected to be huge due to the increasing urbanization in the area the area has immensely developed in the past years and the fall in the gwl is mainly due to over withdrawal of groundwater for construction as well as for consumption purposes therefore the percentage change in subsidence is found to be highest at science city followed by shyambazar thus the eastern and northern parts of the city are probably at a higher risk of land subsidence due to huge withdrawal of the groundwater resources the risk of subsidence further increases with fall in the gwl 5 conclusions the groundwater resource is of immense importance and its judicial usage is the need of the hour it is seen that groundwater depletion in the city is solely the result of the incessant pumping or usage of the resource by its inhabitants its depletion is partially related to rainfall and surface water supply though the corporation is doing its best to provide treated water to its masses so that the dependence on the groundwater is reduced but still there are places in south kolkata where treated water has not reached to the people and people are totally dependent on the groundwater people should be made aware of the problem of the area and its consequences strict legislations need to be imposed so that illegal mining of groundwater can be put a stop also the wastage of surface water is leading to the depletion of groundwater due to the increasing demand for water with increasing urbanization and population growth the groundwater in the kmc area is depleting and its use should be instantly arrested to prevent its further depletion leading to ecological problem the maximum depletion of groundwater is seen in the northern and central part of the city leading to the formation of a trough in the region around sinthi chitpur bagbazar park street and park circus the decreasing gwl in the city puts the city is at a higher risk of land subsidence it is seen that the eastern and northern part of the city is at a higher risk of land subsidence there have been many surface water treatment plants being installed by kmc so that the dependence on the groundwater is reduced the dependence on groundwater can be reduced if rain water harvesting is adopted in the city on a larger scale the rainwater that forms a runoff if stored and harvested can solve the problem to a greater extent also artificial recharge if done can help in the replenishment of the underlying groundwater this natural resource can replenish itself provided the time is given to it in the city the withdrawal is becoming more than recharge due to which the groundwater level is receding thus a constant check is needed to prevent major water hazard in the city a lot has been done on the quality of groundwater in the kmc area but its quantity is equally important thus a constant monitoring over the level of groundwater is needed many programs are launched for its betterment but a reassessment is always required the exact technique for the study of groundwater cannot be précised since it is not easily accessible but it is seen that gis forms an excellent platform for the analysis of the groundwater data and also aids in better comparison thus it can help in the study of groundwater an integrated groundwater study needs to be done to understand the actual movement of groundwater as groundwater movement cannot be defined by administrative boundary the groundwater not having physical accessibility poses problem in its research thus the exploitation of groundwater needs to be controlled for a sustainable ecology of the region proper developmental planning is the current need to solve these problems and ensure sustainability of the resources improving the information base and proper management steps are quite essential for proper development planning processes eshtawi et al 2015 acknowledgements we would like to thank the director of state water investigation department for providing the groundwater level data and mr bibhas kumar maiti ex officio director general and ex ceo department of water supply kmc and mr amitava pal deputy chief engineer department of water supply kmc for allowing us to do the

12034,the falling piezometric level of groundwater is one of the major concerns because of its immense importance especially in areas where treated surface water is not easily accessible an attempt is made to identify the areas of maximum depletion of groundwater in kmc area by studying the post monsoon groundwater level data for the years 1991 2010 the arc gis software is used for the representation of the secondary data and also for the easy comparison of data the study is done to find the groundwater trough in the region by predicting the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and validating the result with the data collected from the field the result thus obtained is analysed with the help of the said software using the idw inverse distance weightage technique thus it is seen that gis forms an excellent platform for the analysis of groundwater data and is very helpful in the present study a comparative analysis has been made and it is seen that at maximum places in kmc region the water level is receding places like narendrapur chitpur sinthi ballygunge park street jadavpur all show a receding trend few places being exception like mukundapur kalikapur where there has been a slight rise in the groundwater level over the years with the advancement in the surface water supply by the kolkata municipal corporation and with the decrease in population density there is no respite in the groundwater level recession in the city blessed with river hooghly alongside the potable water issue is solved to a greater extent but still the southern kolkata shows dependence on groundwater due to the falling groundwater level the chances of land subsidence is seem to be high in the city graphical abstract image 1 keywords piezometric level groundwater depletion geographical information system gis inverse distance weightage idw mbgl metre below ground level 1 introduction kolkata is one of the most populated metropolitan cities of india for the last 300 years the city has witnessed a high population growth due to increasing urban development and increasing population the demand for water mainly for domestic use has risen by many folds the main source of water supply for the city is derived from the hooghly river through the tala pumping station and garden reach pumping station in spite of this surface water sources a huge amount of water is withdrawn from the groundwater aquifers this consistent withdrawal of groundwater has created a trough due to depletion of groundwater jadavpur centre for study of earth science 2019 many parts of kolkata receive a mix of treated surface water and groundwater by deep tube wells and hand tube wells due to the shortage of surface water supply from 2005 kmc started replacing the groundwater supply by surface water thus there has been a reduction in the quantum of groundwater withdrawal by kmc owned tube wells from 2005 roy et al 2012 since the water supply was not available in larger areas of the kmc which forced the population to tap the available groundwater resources biswas and saha 1985 thus reassessing the groundwater scenario of the region becomes essential withdrawal of groundwater in kmc region by kmc owned tube wells increased from 121 5 mld in 1986 to 209 7 mld in 1998 and continuing up to 2004 roy et al 2012 this being on the legal count there are many illegal ways of withdrawal of groundwater there are many private tube wells running simultaneously which is one of the reasons of deepening of trough in the region the groundwater occurring in kolkata region is in two zones groundwater in the upper clay beds is in unconfined aquifer while the groundwater in the deeper zones is held under pressure water table in the shallow zone is very close to the land surface i e just 2 3 mbgl biswas and saha 1985 but this level has fallen due to lower infiltration rate caused due to increasing built up in the area the piezometric level as stated by biswas and saha 1985 was 9 10 m but in the present paper it is seen that the level has fallen down to as low as 19 mbgl at some places thus indicating a declining trend groundwater being a renewable resource has become the lender of last resort alley et al 1999 heavy pumping of groundwater in regions of flat lowlands can alter the hydrological system the incessant pumping of groundwater may lead to a change in the recharge area locations shifting it closer to the city centre thus increasing the chances of contamination the falling piezometric level due to over pumpage may lead to a change in the aquifer condition from confined to unconfined one resulting in the loss of water from the overlying aquiclude into the underlying aquifer if this water contains toxic materials then the fresh water aquifer may get polluted even the loss of water may lead to compression leading to land subsidence sahu and sikdar 2008 sahu et al 2013 providing safe drinking water to its masses is one of the biggest challenges of the authority despite having a high annual rainfall the city faces water crisis the biggest factor being the huge built up due to which the entire precipitation forms run off and is unable to recharge the groundwater as the natural intervention by human activities increases significantly the groundwater circulation system becomes increasingly complex and the variation of groundwater level presents new horizons as to understanding the law of groundwater circulation and its influential factors under different situations is one of the greatest concern in hydrogeology kaur et al 2015 wriedt 2017 liu et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2019 the unplanned development of the city also adds to its havoc mukherjee et al 2018 having good ecological diversity with river hooghly on one side and the wetlands on the other still the city faces water challenges the main reason is its incessant growth in population and wastage of valuable water the over exploitation of the resource thus manifest itself in the form of land subsidence bringing havoc to the region waikar and nilawar 2014 quantification of groundwater resources is often critical and no single comprehensive technique is yet identified which is capable of estimating accurate groundwater assessment groundwater is a concealed natural resource the physical accessibility is limited due to which its study becomes limited but its assessment is very much needed for the identification of water supply and control of pollution integrated studies using traditional survey techniques along with satellite image data and gis tools are useful in the study of groundwater resources bhunia et al 2012 sankar 2002 the urban landscape is undergoing a rapid change leading to many environmental risks which in turn is also affecting the groundwater reserves an effective management of the same requires an evidence based technique for ruling out the risk arising from it khadim et al 2016 advancement has been made in the field of gis which provides a platform for the execution of spatial data and has proved to be an efficient and useful tool in the study of groundwater resources kamaraju et al 1996 it helps in the integration of data in a short span of time and is effective in planning at managerial front ramamoorthy and rammohan 2015 assessment of temporal and spatial patterns of groundwater level becomes essential to carry out plans to meet the rising demand in a sustainable way eshtawi et al 2015 despite advances in remote sensing technologies image classification methods are always not that accurate mtibaa and irie 2016 and hence a ground check becomes very essential much of the work on the level of groundwater has not been carried out in kolkata because of which an attempt was made to study out the temporal and spatial variations in groundwater level in kmc area the study included the secondary data of groundwater for the post monsoon period in all wards of kmc primary survey was carried out to measure the groundwater level at different places in kolkata and validate the result with the predicted data the present work also attempts to identify risk zones and analyse the several factors leading to the same 2 study area the city of kolkata the capital of the indian state of west bengal as seen in fig 1 is located in the lower deltaic plains of the ganga bhagirathi river system with river hooghly draining its western boundary extending from 22 28 n to 22 37 30 n and 88 17 30 e to 88 25 e covering an area of 187 33 sq km the city is divided into 141 wards three more wards having been added recently the greater part of the plain land is drained by river hooghly along the north western part and also by several canals like bagjola in the north beleighata and circular khal in the central part and adi ganga and tolly nallah in the southern part but the major part of these khals and nalas are silted gib 2007 it is a deltaic flat land with an elevation of 3 5 m 6 m above mean sea level sloping towards the south the city has many low lying depressions like marshes shallow lakes many of which are a remnant of the earlier river channels of bhagirathi the important geomorphologic units found in the region are levees deltaic plain inter distributory marsh paleo channels the younger levees are found adjacent to the river hooghly and older levees are found on both sides of the adi ganga as seen in fig 2 the kolkata metropolitan is underlain by quaternary sediments of fluvio deltaic origin clay is found at the top and the thickness of the clay is not same everywhere at college ghat street shibpur it is 16 m and 54 m near gobra 35 m near barrackpur and 45 m near sealdah thus it the clay layer varies in thickness from 30 to 50 m having a mixture of silt and sand water bearing zones consisting of medium to coarse sand and pebble generally occur between the depths of 60 80 m thus it is seen that aquifers are bound between two low permeability beds occurring at 30 50 m below land surface and other at depths of more than 300 m below land surface 3 methodology the post monsoon groundwater level data for kmc area for the year 1991 2010 were collected from state water investigation directorate swid under government of west bengal a total of 40 stations monitored the groundwater level as shown in fig 3 a which is taken into consideration for the present study the exact locations latitudinal and longitudinal extent were extracted from google earth pro and these kml keyhole markup language points were converted into shape file using arcgis 10 3 software these earth points contain the water level data for the year 1991 2010 hence using the arc gis software the entire kmc area was mapped using idw inverse distance weightage technique which determines cell values using a linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points the weight being a function of inverse distance and the surface that is to be interpolated is of locational dependent variable the interpolated maps were generated for the post monsoon period of 1991 2010 with the help of the above technique the entire area was mapped and since in kolkata the confined aquifer is tapped the trend of the piezometric level of groundwater was determined for the study area within the given time frame from the interpolated maps contour lines were drawn depicting the groundwater level of the kmc area following the trend of groundwater depletion the statistical analysis of linear regression was used for prediction of gwl using the following formulas eqs 1 3 1 y 1 μ ν x 1 2 μ n 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 n 1 x 1 2 x 1 2 3 ν y 1 μ x 1 n 1 where x 1 y 1 are two variables on regression line μ slope of the line ν y 1 intercept of the line x 1 and y 1 are the values of the first and second data set respectively linear regression was used for predicting the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and these data were validated with the field survey data that was collected from the following 15 stations mentioned in table 1 and fig 3 b using the tlc temperature water level and conductivity metre the survey was done during post monsoon period in 2018 in the month of november and a comparative study was done using the predicted and actual data the root mean square error rmse was calculated to see the compatibility of the predicted value and measured value of gwl eq 4 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n f o 2 where f forecasts expected unknown results and o observed values this technique helped in the better understanding of the problem and also to delineate the areas where the risk of groundwater hazard is likely to be the maximum contours or isolines were prepared from the interpolated data so that the comparison becomes easier the trend of groundwater level in the city was co related with rainfall data acquired from indian meteorological department population density data from census of india and the distribution of surface water supply data from kolkata municipal corporation in order to analyse the state of groundwater in the city the entire methodology is summarised in the form of a flow chart shown in fig 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater level trends in the city and formation of trough area the overall analysis of the groundwater level of the kolkata city shows a mix trend of groundwater level but maximum areas experience lowering of groundwater level gwl the water level fluctuation for the year 1991 2010 is between 1 03 mbgl to 19 38 mbgl there has been a fall of 1 m 6 m of ground water level in the city for the above decadal period as seen in fig 5 a recession or lowering of groundwater level in the city is seen both in north and south kolkata in the year 1991 the lowest groundwater level is seen in hedua which is around 7 5 mbgl the northern part of kolkata shows a comparatively better gwl than its southern counterparts chitpur has a level of 12 mbgl but maximum depletion in northern kolkata is seen in bagbazar with a value of 13 mbgl the same level of groundwater is indicated in ballygunge in south kolkata these two places show the maximum depletion the contour of 12 m encloses bantala as seen in fig 5 a the trough is formed in the south central part of the city in the following year the area of maximum depletion remains the same around ballygunge and bagbazar mostly places in south like tollygunge behala jadavpur deshapriya park hazra all have gwl below 12 m as seen in fig 5 a and even in north kolkata chitpur shows the above gwl the contour depicting gwl for the year 1991 and 1992 does not show much of a difference for the year 1993 the maximum depletion is found in hedua where the level has fallen from 7 27 mbgl in 1992 to 11 64 mbgl in 1993 the contour of 12 mbgl encircles the area as seen in fig 5 c around bagbazar and ballygunge the contour value still remains the highest the gwl in the eastern corner of the city i e in bantala remains around 11 12 mbgl places like kalighat deshapriya park shows a slight increase in the gwl this is indicated by the shift in the contour value as seen in fig 5 a in 1994 there has been a depletion of 1m on an average in the entire area the trough zone remains the same but with more lowering of the groundwater levels the contour value of 13 m earlier encircled ballygunge area is now replaced with 14 m contour for bantala there has been a fall of 1 m even for sinthi chitpur bagbazar the level of depletion remains the same increase in gwl is only seen around hazra whereas all other places show a depletion all other factors remaining the same a noticeable amount of depletion is seen at hazra in the year 1995 a fall of around 2 m in the gwl the rise in the preceding year could be because of some local variations but the place shows a receding trend the 1996 trend of gwl shows a conspicuous decline in gwl a noticeable amount of groundwater is depleted in just a year the maximum depletion is noticed in areas around park circus where there has been a fall of 3 m in the gwl the water level fell from 13 77 mbgl in the preceding year to 16 72 mbgl in 1996 a sharp fall of 5 5 m is seen at kalighat a noticeable depletion in just a year is a matter of concern even at rajabazar there has been a fall of 3 m which can be compared from the contour levels shown in fig 5 at keyatola the depletion has been from 11 48 m to 15 25 m thus the contour of 15 m encircles the area this sudden depletion is due to the reckless withdrawal of groundwater for consumption by household and industrial sector and also with the growing urbanization the demand for groundwater increases for construction purpose the following year witnesses a further decrease in the gwl the depletion zone widens covering a larger area the contour of 16m covers garden reach kalighat behala tollygunge hazra tiljala thus it is seen that the trough area or the zone of maximum depletion is formed in the central and south central part of the city as seen in fig 5 b the gwl rose a bit at some places as it is evident from the contour map of 1998 at sinthi the gwl rose from 14 88 mbgl to 11 73 mbgl at bagbazar there is a rise of 2 m on an average even at kalighat the gwl has risen by 2 m a significant increase in gwl is seen at bantala the water rose to 9 46 mbgl places in the extreme south shows a higher level of gwl this could be because of less population pressure as compared to the northern part of the city garia has a level as high as 7 8 mbgl in kalikapur sonarpur the gwl varies between 5 7 mbgl an increasing trend is noticed in rajabazar the gwl further increases 10mbgl at babughat there has been a decrease of 3 m a further increase of 1 m is seen at bantala which is evident from the 8 m contour level thus it is seen that at the eastern end of the city there is an increasing trend and on the western part the groundwater is depleting there has been a 1 m rise at hazra and garia and at kundghat there has been a fall of 2 m at sarsuna the gwl rose from 11 mbgl to 8 mbgl the contour map for the year 2000 shows the same trend as for 1998 the level at rajabazar fell back to 12 m bantala back to 9 m and the gwl dropped by 2 m and 3 m at belgharia and garia respectively in 2001 the maximum lowering of groundwater level is as low as 16 m around keyatola area more than 15 mbgl is found in bagbazar beckbagan tollygunge khidirpur park circus park street kalighat area comparatively the southern part of the city has got a well placed groundwater level as high as 3 74 mbgl around narendrapur thus the trough area is found along the western and northern part of the city even in the year 2002 same trend is observed the maximum recession is seen in the northern and western part of the kolkata administrative boundary maximum lowering of level is seen around hastings alipur where the water level is as low as 16mbgl bagbazar and beckbagan have got a level of 14mbgl as seen in fig 5 b not much of a difference is seen in the next year the level remains as low as 16 mbgl bagbazar khidirpur have a level of below 15 mbgl garden reach kalighat ballygunge have values of 14 mbgl the southern part of the city shows a better groundwater level in comparison to its northern counterparts the following year shows a rise in the groundwater level in some parts of the city namely sinthi babughat kalighat bantala kasba hazra kalikapur narendrapur whereas a sharp fall of 5 m is observed at garia the same being for the year 2005 as seen in fig 5 c in 2006 there has been a fall of 1m in the groundwater level on an average in the city may be due to huge withdrawal of groundwater but a rise in the level is seen at kudghat and narendrapur a remarkable rise in groundwater level is seen at babughat and kalighat around 4 m of rise at these places this may be due to the influence of the local factors the following year again shows a receding level at these places and on an average there has been a fall of 1 2 m of gwl in the following year there has been again a rise seen at babughat a noticeable fluctuation is seen around babughat this might be due to the influence of the river hugli in 2010 the gwl has much declined it has fallen to as low as 19 38 mbgl a lot of groundwater is being withdrawn which shows the high dependence on groundwater resource the lowest level is observed at bagbazar chitpur area a level of 17 mbgl and 18 mbgl around beniatola and sinthi a rise of 4 m at babughat and 2 m rise in garia and narendrapur is observed as shown in fig 5 d the overall analysis shows that the maximum recession has been found in the south western part of the city at narendrapur where there has been a fall of 7 76 mbgl in the given decade which can be compared from the contours drawn in fig 4 in post monsoon 2001 the groundwater level had been 3 24 mbgl which fell to 11 mbgl in 2010 the excessive groundwater recession is found in south kolkata due to excessive withdrawal of groundwater to meet the daily requirement of water as the surface water supply was not adequate a high recession is also seen in bhawanipore area where there has been a fall of 6 m in 2001 the gwl was 12 03 mbgl which went down to 18 2 mbgl in 2010 even in ballygunge area there has been a fall of 4 31 m excessive groundwater recession is also seen in sarsuna and thakurpukur where the fall has been of 4 46 mbgl and 3 99 mbgl respectively in haridevpur area there has been a decline of 4 41 m in north kolkata the scenario is equally alarming maximum recession in the north is seen in chitpur bagbazar and sinthi around bagbazar and chitpur where the groundwater level gwl is as low as 19 mbgl the trend shows that depletion has taken place at a very fast rate in this area in 1991 the gwl had been 13 05 mbgl which is lowered to 19 25 mbgl in the year 2010 a depletion of around 6m in areas around sinthi the gwl was 11 98 mbgl in 2001 which is lowered to 18 55 mbgl in 2010 same being for rajabazar sealdah places like kashipur paikpara belgachia shyambazar beckbagan jorabagan maniktala dumdum and park circus all have a lower water level below 17 18 mbgl in bantala there has been a fall of 5 82 m in the given decade there has been a striking depletion at hedua the gwl was as high as 7 5 mbgl in 1991 which fell to 16 85mbgl a maximum recession of 9 35 in 20 years even at kasba and rajabazar there has been a fall of 5m approximately there are many places in the city where the water level is below 16m chitpur entally parkstreet beckbagan bijaygarh behala hazra keyatola bantala park circus bhawanipore sinthi ballygunge and jadavpur the highest drawdown is seen in chitpur and entally where the level is as low as 19 25 mbgl and 19 1 mbgl respectively as seen in fig 6 thus a receding trough has been found in the above zones there being a few exceptions in the city where the gwl has shown a slight increase over the decade this may be due to less dependence on groundwater and tapping of surface water for meeting the water demands the area near babughat where water level was around 13 14 mbgl in the year 2001 and 2002 increased to 6 35 mbgl in 2010 even at garia the water level increased from 11 mbgl to 7 95 mbgl this may be due to the surface water that is being supplied by the corporation because of which the dependence on the groundwater resources is decreasing behala mukundapur picnic garden has shown a rise in the water level fig 6 shows the percentage change in gwl over a period of 20 years from 1991 2010 it is seen that maximum change is seen in chingrighata babughat belgharia whereas slight change is seen in kasba hazra garia it is seen that maximum change has taken place in the northern part of the city in comparison to its southern counterparts 4 2 estimating the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and validating the result following the trend of gwl an attempt has been made to estimate the groundwater level for the year 2018 for post monsoon period time series regression analysis has been used for predicting the gwl for kmc area the predicted value of gwl for the year 2018 is shown in fig 7 from the figure it is clearly seen that the area of maximum depletion is found in the northern and central part of the city places around bagbazar entally park circus alipur and garden reach show greater depletion of gwl good level of groundwater is witnessed in southern and eastern kolkata around mukundapur sarsuna thakurpukur and bantala respectively from the map it is clearly seen that only places around mukundapur and garia has gwl level between 9 11 mbgl whereas all other places shows a lower gwl places in the eastern and southern part of the city like bantala sarsuna kalikapur thakurpukur panchasayer kudghat sahapur have values around 11 13 mbgl other places shows a depleting gwl level majority of places in the southern part like ballygunge kalighat bhawanipur all have values between 13 15 mbgl the northern part of the city shows a higher depletion hedua a p c road tiljala hastings have a gwl of 15 17 mbgl the maximum groundwater depletion is seen in chitpur sinthi bagbazar entally beckbagan and alipur thus from the estimated value it is seen that the maximum depletion is seen in the northern part of the city though it is not limited to the north even the gwl in the south is getting depleted but as a whole the northern part of the city is at a higher risk of groundwater depletion the southern part of the city shows a comparatively better gwl this may be due to the lesser population pressure and presence of more open spaces the estimated value of gwl has been validated from the data collected from field survey the findings are interpolated in arc gis 10 3 and are depicted in the map shown in fig 8 the entire city of kolkata is likely to face groundwater hazard if the resource remains to be over utilised the reckless use of the groundwater resource can lead to many ecological problems in the city from the data collected during the survey the entire city can be grouped into five zones the northern part of the city including bagbazar chitpur sinthi girish park entally all fall under high risk zone where the groundwater is between 17 20 mbgl the central part of the city falls in the vulnerable zone where the gwl is between 15 16 mbgl the southern part of the city shows a water level between 14 16mbgl with exception being mukundapur and garia where the level is 12 14 mbgl only sarsuna is comparatively better placed with values between 10 12 mbgl this might be due to the influence of the surface water body thus the trough zone is formed in the northern part of the city and stringent measures needs to be taken to arrest the problem to validate the data field survey was taken up and the surveyed gwl for the post monsoon period 2018 was collected at 15 points spread over the entire region the data has been interpolated and the maps have been prepared in arcgis software as shown in fig 7 the predicted value and estimated value were correlated and the correlation is found to be 0 736 as shown in fig 9 and the rmse was calculated to be 2 33 which prove the fact that the predicted value for gwl is very close to the estimated one thus from the surveyed data it can be established that the maximum depletion is seen around north and north western part of the city areas around sinthi bagbazar entally park street are at a higher risk of groundwater depletion followed by alipur gardenreach tiljala comparatively the south and south east part of the city shows a higher gwl and thus are at a lower risk of groundwater depletion the predicted and measured gwl perfectly correlates out of 15 measured points 13 points fall within 20 that is 80 of the data has been properly correlated only two points fall within 30 only thakurpukur falls in the line of perfect agreement where the estimated and predicted values of gwl are almost same places like hedua chitpur park circus bantala sarsuna alipur haridebpur garden reach entally deshapriya park the values are within 20 which indicates a good correlation only two places i e garia and mukundapur falls within the zone of 30 due to the higher variations in the gwl in these two areas 4 3 groundwater level and rainfall kolkata is blessed to receive a good amount of rainfall during the monsoon months the rainfall pattern of the city for the year 1991 2010 is shown in fig 10 a there has not been much of a variation in the rainfall pattern there are years of flood and years where rainfall has not been good but overall the city receives a good amount of rainfall it is quite evident that rainfall pattern of kolkata area has not much of an impact on the groundwater level of the region but still there is some connection between the two fig 10 a shows the relationship between rainfall and average groundwater level of kolkata area in the year 1999 when the rainfall is quite high the gwl also show a rise this was due to the increase in the amount of recharge even for the year 2007 a similar trend is observed in the year 2009 and 2010 when the rainfall is quite low the gwl has fallen the aquifer of kolkata area gets recharged from the nearby districts there is no recharge for the aquifer in the city itself the aquifer gets recharged from the surrounding districts of nadia 24 parganas hugli and howrah it is very uncertain to demarcate the actual region of groundwater recharge thus a weighatge method is adopted to get an average of recharge from rainfall for this area two parallel lines were drawn touching the eastern and western extreme of the city and the area for each district falling into the zone was given a weightage according to the area and an average rainfall from the recharge zones is calculated a correlation is done between the rainfall from the recharge zone and average groundwater level of kolkata and it is seen that there exists a considerable amount of correlation between the two variables the correlation is around 0 5694 as seen in fig 10 b thus rainfall plays an impactful role in affecting the groundwater level of the city a land use change in the above districts is likely to affect the groundwater condition of the city 4 4 population density and groundwater level the availability of any resource in any region is determined by the extraction of the resources that is the demand for the resource groundwater resource is directly related to the population pressure of the region the higher the population the greater is the demand for water the demand increases further if surface water supply is not adequately present to understand the relationship between groundwater level and the population of the city the population density of the region is considered since the area of each ward is not the same the population density of the city of kolkata for the year 1991 2001 and 2011 is shown in fig 11 a below the above are the census years which are taken into consideration which takes place at an interval of 10 years the higher population density for the year 1991 is seen in wards 49 52 54 56 62 77 107 and 125 in the southern part it is clearly visible that higher population density is seen in the northern part of the city in 2001 it is seen that there has been a decrease in population density of many wards the wards which showed a higher population density in the previous census shows a fall in population in the current census in 2011 it is seen that the population density of the city has further decreased this is mainly due to development of the bidhannagar municipality and the newtown rajarhat areas which has led to the expansion of the city and movement of the population to these newly reclaimed areas and thus decreasing the population pressure with decrease in population density the demand for groundwater has not decreased which should have been and thus the groundwater resources is still being depleted the higher population density in the northern part of the city directly correlates with the lower gwl in the region the change in population for the year 2001 2011 shows a vast change in population in the city in many wards there has been a decreasing growth rate which is a clear indication of the expansion of population in the adjoining areas the decrease in population density is significant than its increase there has been a considerable decrease in population density in wards 43 46 47 70 16 25 39 4 6 9 10 and many other wards the increase has not been so much it is very much clear from the graph in fig 11 b 4 5 surface water supply and groundwater level there are many water works with different capacity in kolkata metropolitan district kmd run by different organizations namely kolkata municipal corporation kmc kolkata metropolitan development authority kmda kolkata metropolitan water and sanitation authority kmda kolkata metropolitan water and sanitation authority kmw sa howrah municipal corporation hmc public health directorate phed indira gandhi water treatment plant igwtp also known as palta water works operated by kmc is the largest and oldest water treatment plant in kolkata water works that provide potable water are listed below in table 2 at present there are five water works involved to supply potable water to kmc area igwtp supplies drinking water to north central and part of south kolkata borough number i to vii of kmc jai hind jal prakalpa distributes water to ward no 101 to 110 66 and 57 jorabagan water treatment plant feed the areas of burabazar and dalhousie kmc ward numbers 21 22 23 24 25 41 42 and 45 watgunj water treatment plant caters water in watgunj khidirpore and hastings area garden reach water works is engaged to provide water to southern part of kmc and some other municipalities fig 12 shows the area of kmc fed by different sources the present north kolkata was getting treated ganges water produced by igwtp supplied by tallah pumping station but there was a scarcity of treated surface water in the southern part of the city the inhabitants by tradition are dependent on groundwater which in itself was hazardous as the water was contaminated with iron arsenic fluoride and other contaminants after the installation of grww the resident of south kolkata found some respite as a trans municipal project it also began to supply potable water to some south suburban areas along with south kmc areas i e entire borough numbers viii to xv and more than 50 of borough number xvi covering ward numbers 74 part of 78 and 79 80 to 84 87 to 100 111 to 115 part of 116 and 117 118 to 140 and part of 141 it serves the people in two ways 1 by supplying water directly in distribution grids during pressure hours and 2 by filling more than 20 numbers bps and 10 numbers esr as well during non pressure hour presently grww is involved in supplying potable water to three municipalities viz pujali budgebudge and mahestala along with vast areas of south kolkata like metiabrutz garden reach khidirpore parnashree taratala chetla kalighat gariahat rabindra sarobar tollygunge golfgreen jadavpur garfa ranikuthi bansdroni behala daspara siriti in kmc areas currently it is the 2nd largest water works in kma area contributing more than 38 approximately 145 mgd of total potable water supplied by all the water works owned by kmc serving more than 20 lakh people it is seen that the maximum dependence on groundwater is in the southern part but still the depletion of gwl is noticed in the northern part of kolkata this might be due to the illegal means of water withdrawal in the northern part of the city the density being high in the northern part due to which the water demand is also high leading to the depletion of the resource sarkar 2016 4 6 land subsidence in city groundwater over pumping is the chief contributor to land subsidence it is a hazard in disguise land subsidence takes time to surface its effect over exploitation of groundwater leads to difference in pore pressure leading to the subsidence of land above keeping in mind the depletion of water level in the city the need to assess land subsidence becomes utmost important extending the work of bhattacharya et al 2014 the present land subsidence scenario of the city is calculated bhattacharya et al 2014 carried out the work at four different places in the city namely shyambazar gariahat minto park and science city using the logarithmic theory approach the summarised outcome of the study is given below in table 3 the rate of subsidence r s per annum as well as rate of subsidence per meter drop in gwl was found highest at science city if the gwl of these four locations mentioned in table 3 are compared with the gwl of the recent two decades then it is seen that there is a fall in the gwl over the years the trend of gwl for these four places for the years 1991 2010 is shown in fig 13 the declining gwl trends at these four locations confirm that there is a sequential depletion of gwl thus the chances of land subsidence are expected high at these places during 1991 2010 using the above outcomes land subsidence in the last two decades shown in table 4 is estimated assuming the same soil characteristics as was considered by bhattacharya et al 2014 total subsidence in cm for the period 2000 2018 has been calculated using the rate of subsidence per meter drop in gwl for the period 1956 2000 exception being gariahat where the period between 1958 1999 was taken into consideration it is found out that the maximum subsidence is seen around science city area which is probably due to the rapid urbanisation thereby the over exploitation of the groundwater resources the percentage change in r s has been calculated using eq 5 5 percentage change in r s r s 2000 2018 r s 1956 2000 r s 1956 2000 100 the average annual decrease of gwl at gariahat and minto park during 1991 2000 is 0 185 and 0 084 m whereas earlier during 1991 2000 it was 0 287 and 0 267 respectively it confirms that rate of annual groundwater withdraw at gariahat and minto park has been decreased during 2000 2018 compared to that of 1956 2000 whereas rate of annual groundwater withdraw at science city and shyambazar has been increased during 2000 2018 compared to that of 1956 2000 especially for science city the rate of subsidence is expected to be huge due to the increasing urbanization in the area the area has immensely developed in the past years and the fall in the gwl is mainly due to over withdrawal of groundwater for construction as well as for consumption purposes therefore the percentage change in subsidence is found to be highest at science city followed by shyambazar thus the eastern and northern parts of the city are probably at a higher risk of land subsidence due to huge withdrawal of the groundwater resources the risk of subsidence further increases with fall in the gwl 5 conclusions the groundwater resource is of immense importance and its judicial usage is the need of the hour it is seen that groundwater depletion in the city is solely the result of the incessant pumping or usage of the resource by its inhabitants its depletion is partially related to rainfall and surface water supply though the corporation is doing its best to provide treated water to its masses so that the dependence on the groundwater is reduced but still there are places in south kolkata where treated water has not reached to the people and people are totally dependent on the groundwater people should be made aware of the problem of the area and its consequences strict legislations need to be imposed so that illegal mining of groundwater can be put a stop also the wastage of surface water is leading to the depletion of groundwater due to the increasing demand for water with increasing urbanization and population growth the groundwater in the kmc area is depleting and its use should be instantly arrested to prevent its further depletion leading to ecological problem the maximum depletion of groundwater is seen in the northern and central part of the city leading to the formation of a trough in the region around sinthi chitpur bagbazar park street and park circus the decreasing gwl in the city puts the city is at a higher risk of land subsidence it is seen that the eastern and northern part of the city is at a higher risk of land subsidence there have been many surface water treatment plants being installed by kmc so that the dependence on the groundwater is reduced the dependence on groundwater can be reduced if rain water harvesting is adopted in the city on a larger scale the rainwater that forms a runoff if stored and harvested can solve the problem to a greater extent also artificial recharge if done can help in the replenishment of the underlying groundwater this natural resource can replenish itself provided the time is given to it in the city the withdrawal is becoming more than recharge due to which the groundwater level is receding thus a constant check is needed to prevent major water hazard in the city a lot has been done on the quality of groundwater in the kmc area but its quantity is equally important thus a constant monitoring over the level of groundwater is needed many programs are launched for its betterment but a reassessment is always required the exact technique for the study of groundwater cannot be précised since it is not easily accessible but it is seen that gis forms an excellent platform for the analysis of the groundwater data and also aids in better comparison thus it can help in the study of groundwater an integrated groundwater study needs to be done to understand the actual movement of groundwater as groundwater movement cannot be defined by administrative boundary the groundwater not having physical accessibility poses problem in its research thus the exploitation of groundwater needs to be controlled for a sustainable ecology of the region proper developmental planning is the current need to solve these problems and ensure sustainability of the resources improving the information base and proper management steps are quite essential for proper development planning processes eshtawi et al 2015 acknowledgements we would like to thank the director of state water investigation department for providing the groundwater level
