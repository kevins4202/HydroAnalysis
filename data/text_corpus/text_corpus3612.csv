18060,oxidation is a widely used method in drinking water treatment to mitigate the membrane fouling caused by the natural organic matters nom from the surface water during ultra filtration uf and nano filtration nf processes and h2o2 is one of the common oxidants for it however the oxidation capability of h2o2 at neutral ph is lower compared to the acidic and alkaline conditions in order to improve the efficiency of nom oxidation at neutral ph a carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn was synthesized in this study and used as a high performance catalyst for h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical the oxygen containing groups on the carbon structure of cfpn can form an acidic microenvironment allowing h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radical by catalysis in neutral conditions the results of hydrophilicity analysis zeta potential high performance liquid size exclusion chromatography hpsec fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir and flux indicated that the hydroxyl radical can oxidize the hydrophobic matters of humic acid ha into hydrophilic matters by fenton reaction or electrophilic addition reaction which can mitigate the fouling of nf membranes the results of the same test for the bovine serum albumin bsa indicated that the hydroxyl radical can mitigate the fouling of uf membranes by degrading the tertiary and secondary structures of bsa and partly oxidizing the side chain groups in addition two types of surface water samples were used to verify the above mechanism and the results indicated that the hydroxyl radical treatment at neutral ph is a new viable and effective strategy to significantly mitigate the nom fouling of uf and nf membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe3o4 nanozyme hydrophilic transition membrane fouling neutral ph 1 introduction the fouling of the widespread natural organic matters nom in surface water organics in the surface water is one of the great challenges to the application of membrane technology kimura et al 2018 yang et al 2018 nom usually consists of polysaccharides proteins humic substances hs and some small molecules tian et al 2018 among them polysaccharides and proteins are collectively called biopolymers the molecular weight of which are mainly in the range of 100 10 kda huber et al 2011 kimura et al 2014 2018 yin et al 2019 hs is a major part of nom li et al 2016b with a molecular weight distribution in the range of 10 1 kda yu et al 2018a there are two main fouling mechanisms for nom the size effect and adsorption effect for the size effect previous researches indicated that when the molecular weight distribution of nom is close to the cut off molecular weight of the membrane the nom will block the membrane pores to cause serious pollution zhu et al 2010 for the adsorption effect the reported studies indicated that the hydrophilic membranes pa or pes membrane would be prone to be fouled by the hydrophobic nom whereas the hydrophilic nom after oxidation is hard to foul the hydrophilic membranes yu et al 2016b 2018a in summary changing the molecular weight distribution and hydrophilicity of nom could be a feasible pretreatment to mitigate the membrane fouling oxidation is the easiest way to modify nom despite many catalytical oxidation methods of nom for membrane fouling mitigation have been reported in the previous studies and the oxidation can actually change the properties of nom most studies aimed at the mineralization of nom or breaking nom into small molecules rather than changing the properties of nom cheng et al 2018 dai et al 2018 daugherty et al 2017 this process not only requires a large number of oxidants but also may make the membrane fouling get worse or even cause chemical damage to membranes gohil and suresh 2017 zhu et al 2010 therefore it is requiring for an effective and moderate catalytical oxidation method to mitigate membrane fouling while avoiding the aforementioned potential risks at neutral ph in recent years the fe3o4 nanoparticles are considered as a peroxidase like nanozyme with an excellent catalytical property at catalyzing h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals and had been widely used in the biochemical assay and industrial production which cause little production of fe2 fe3 hydroxides during catalysis du et al 2017 gao et al 2007 however like the fe2 fe3 most of the fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme can only play its catalytic role in an acidic environment to generate hydroxyl radical wang et al 2016a xu and wang 2012 several attempts such as doping cu2 in the fe3o4 or loading the fe3o4 on sio2 nanoparticles have been taken to improve the catalytic performance of fe3o4 in the neutral environment yang et al 2015 however the mechanism of the two mentioned methods is still unclear besides for the cu2 doping method the introduction of heavy metals may increase the risk of water quality while the sio2 loading method will reduce the catalytic property per unit weight of the catalyst according to previous researches carboxyl groups can be formed on the surface of carbon structures of organic fe materials because of the trace oxygen in the materials itself or from the protective gases during the anoxic heating treatment process chao et al 2004 yang et al 2017 the carboxyl groups will form an acidic micro environment around the nanomaterials when it was in a near neutral aqueous solution chao et al 2004 besides the hybrid fe3o4 can improve the conversion efficiency of fe3 fe2 to accelerate the reaction rate of hydroxyl generating qiu et al 2016 therefore a flower like hollow sphere structure fe3o4 nanoflakes cluster was used as peroxidase like nanozyme which was named as carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn in this work firstly the cfpn was prepared and the morphology chemical constitution and catalytical properties of the cfpn were characterized to verify whether the cfpn was successfully synthesized secondly in order to demonstrate that a low dosage cfpn can catalyze h2o2 in a low concentration to form hydroxyl radicals in a neutral ph the esr spectra were used to detect the hydroxyl radicals by using dmpo as the capturer thirdly bsa and ha were used as the mimic of nom in the surface water to study the oxidation effect of cfpn on nom by catalyzing h2o2 the ftir spectra zeta potential hydrophilic and hydrophobic components analysis and hpsec were used to verify the effect of cfpn on degradating and changing the hydrophilicity of above samples then filtration experiments were conducted to explore the membrane fouling mitigation by cfpn and h2o2 finally two kinds of surface water samples were used to further verify the above conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn the

times the precipitate was dried in an oven at 70 c and then a glyceric acid iron fe glycerate precursor was obtained the cfpn was synthesized by heating the fe glycerate precursor to 350 c with a slow heating rate of 1 c min in a tube furnace and kept for 3 h under n2 aeration with the flow rate of 200 ml min the non modified fe3o4 nanoparticles fe3o4 nps used for the control group were synthesized

undertaken using a stirred cell amicon 8400 millipore usa with constant pressures 0 4 mpa for the nf membrane 0 1 mpa for the uf membrane and 0 05 mpa for both backwash procedures under nitrogen gas polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration uf membranes and nano filtration nf membranes beijing separate equipment co ltd china were used in this paper the as prepared ha and bsa solutions as well as surface water samples were selected as the raw water for uf nf membrane fouling source the cut off molecular weights were 10 kda and 1 kda for the uf membrane and nf membrane respectively each membrane was immersed in di water for 1 day before being used to remove impurities and production residues and then the membrane flushed using 100 ml di water before filtering the samples in order to stable the permeate flux of the membrane and further clean the membrane pores after the uf membrane filtering 100 ml samples 50 ml for nf membranes the membrane was turned upside down to backwash with 20 ml di water 10 ml for nf membranes the performance of the membrane was evaluated by recording the variation of normalized flux as a function of flux 3 results 3 1 characterization and the catalysis mechanism of the cfpn from the sem image fig 1 a it was found that the as prepared cfpn had a flower like morphology and hollow sphere structure and its diameter was between 300 nm and 400 nm compared with the cfpn the fe3o4 nps with a diameter around 400 nm had a porous sphere but no flower like structure fig s1 the flower like or nano flacks structure is considered to increase the exposure area of activity sites which could improve the utilization of the cfpn ma et al 2015 sheng et al 2018 in the xrd spectra of fe3o4 nps and cfpn fig 1b it was seen that the feature peaks of fe3o4 were clearly observed which revealed that it was completely composed of pure fe3o4 hou et al 2014 meanwhile the peaks of graphite carbon 2θ 24 and fecxoy 2θ 18 21 and 38 jcpds no 14 0807 and 14 0762 could also be observed in the spectrum of cfpn which indicated the possible existence of carboxyl and graphite like structure kim et al 2015 to further verify the existence of carboxyl the ftir spectra were used to characterize the difference between cfpn and fe3o4 nps fig 1c the peaks between 3000 cm 1 and 2700 cm 1 belong to the ch2 and ch tao et al 2015 the peaks between 1700 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were considered as the carboxyl yu et al 2015 which shifted to lower wavenumber because of the existence of fe as can be seen the ftir spectra of cfpn showed the existence of carboxyl and methyl methylene which did not exist in fe3o4 nps it was considered that during the formation process of cfpn the carbon and oxygen elements of glyceric acid transformed into carboxyl and other carbon structures during the heating treatment which agreed with the results of xrd spectra the zeta potential analysis is usually used to reflect the amount of positive and negative charge groups on a material surface which could unveil the dispersion stability of particles in water to some extent the zeta potential of cfpn was much more negative than fe3o4 nps fig 1d which indicated the negative charge groups mainly carboxyl on the cfpn surface were relatively more than that on fe3o4 nps yu et al 2018a based on the ftir and zeta potential results it can be inferred that a large number of carboxyl groups on the surface of cfpn may form an acidic microenvironment around the cfpn in aqueous solution zhang et al 2017 which may enhance the production efficiency of hydroxyl radical at neutral ph 3 2 the catalytic mechanism of the cfpn in order to investigate the catalytical mechanism of cfpn in neutral conditions the esr spectra were used to identify the type of radical by using the dmpo as the radical capturer dmpo can be oxidized by the superoxide radical or hydroxyl radical in the methanol solution and aqueous solution respectively which can generate different oxidation products li et al 2016a it can be seen that there was no signal of superoxide radical detected even 30 min after h2o2 was added into the methanol solution the final concentration of h2o2 was 1 mm the same below with 10 mg l cfpn fig 2 a but in di water the signal of hydroxyl radical increased with the time after the h2o2 and cfpn were added fig 2b the esr results indicated that h2o2 was directly catalyzed by the cfpn surface to hydroxyl radical which was the same as in acidic solution wang et al 2016a but the catalysis property of the fe3o4 nps was extremely limited at neutral ph combined with the previous characterization and test results it can be speculated that the oxygen containing groups on cfpn formed an acidic micro environment near the surface of cfpn which lead h2o2 to be converted into hydroxyl radicals by the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph 3 3 variation of ha and bsa the concentration of h2o2 and the dosage of cfpn were chosen by considering the results of fig s2 the cfpn dosage was 10 mg l and the h2o2 concentration was 1 mm the eem spectra of ha raw ha h2o2 haox and the ha sample treated with h2o2 fe3o4 nps were shown in fig s3 and it was found that the changes of haox were more obvious than others according to the eem spectra of ha with cfpn catalytical reaction after different reaction times it was found that the optimal reaction time was 60 min fig s4 in order to analyze the changes of different treatments ftir spectra were used to characterize ha raw ha h2o2 and haox samples after being freeze dried fig 3 a for ha h2o2 the peak of hydroxyl 3450 cm 1 decreased and the peaks of carboxyl 1710 cm 1 1625 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 increased ho et al 2018 which indicated that a part of hydroxyl of ha might be oxidized into carboxyl by h2o2 the decrease of ch2 ch3 2900 2700 cm 1 in ha h2o2 and haox samples indicated that a part of the ch2 ch3 were oxidized by h2o2 or hydroxyl radical which may cause the increase of carboxyl 1700 1600 cm 1 and hydroxyl 3700 3000 cm 1 especially for haox compared with ha h2o2 the peaks of c o c in haox 1170 cm 1 1020 cm 1 and 889 cm 1 increased which indicated that cfpn might catalyze the oxidation process of ha samples and generate another structure besides oh and cooh by the epoxidation or other oxygen adding reaction al jorani et al 2018 cusso et al 2016 jiang and xu 1995 yu et al 2018b for bsa samples the ftir spectra were mainly used to characterize the differences of the protein structures between the bsa before and after oxidation fig 3b the several peaks near 3630 cm 1 were considered to represent the hydrogen bonds of the intramolecular hydroxyl groups of bsa carpenter and crowe 1989 which decreased after adding h2o2 and vanished after reacting with hydroxyl radical the peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 1500 1400 cm 1 and 1300 1200 cm 1 belong to amide i amide ii and amide iii which respectively represent the primary secondary and tertiary structure of proteins chou et al 2016 li et al 2019 the peak at 1655 cm 1 represented the α helix structures of bsa they were similar in all of the bsa samples which indicated the primary structure of bsa was not damaged by h2o2 or hydroxyl radical the peaks of amide ii and amide iii both decreased in bsa h2o2 and bsaox especially for bsaox which could be attributed to the damages of the secondary and tertiary structures of bsa the series peaks of benzene rings structures ar between 1035 cm 1 and 944 cm 1 c h of ar 665 cm 1 c s 1450 cm 1 and so2 1320 cm 1 decreased while the peak of c o 1125 cm 1 increased only in bsaox levitsky et al 2012 the changes of these peaks indicated that a part of benzene structures in bsaox was oxidized and the c s group might be oxidized into so2 group in summary on account of hydroxyl radical treatment the tertiary and secondary structures of bsa might be damaged by the oxidation of c s groups as known the c s h groups assist in the formation of spatial structures of proteins in the form of disulfide bond and benzene structures however the primary structure of bsa had not been obviously damaged since the oxidation had little effect on the α helix to further verify the influence of hydroxyl and carboxyl on the chemical property of ha and bsa xad 4 dax 8 resins were used to analyze the hydrophilic as toc of ha samples in fig 3c the results showed that the weakly hydrophobic composition of ha h2o2 increased obviously and the hydrophilic composition increased slightly for haox the obvious increase of hydrophilic composition indicated that ha was more efficiently to be oxidized to generate hydroxyl and carboxyl by hydroxyl radical than h2o2 in addition there was little change in the toc value of ha samples after different treatments it indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ha oxidation by h2o2 and hydroxyl radical were very low in a neutral condition then the hydrophilicity analysis results of the bsa samples were shown in fig 3d it was found that the strongly hydrophobic composition of bsa raw was very low which was less than 10 the weakly hydrophobic composition was nearly 30 and the rest was hydrophilic composition after reacting with h2o2 all compositions almost unchanged however for bsaox the strongly hydrophobic composition was completely oxidized and the weakly hydrophobic composition decreased while the hydrophilic composition increased the results of the xad 4 dax 8 resin analysis indicated that under the catalysis of cfpn h2o2 could oxidize the hydrophobic composition of bsa more efficiently and simultaneously the h2o2 and hydroxyl radical almost cannot mineralize the bsa at neutral ph which was similar to the results of ha sample it is worth noting that in the research of xiao s study mu et al 2019 xad 4 dax 8 analysis under neutral conditions can accurately reflect the content of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances in water however in this work the test under acidic conditions can accurately reflect the trend of changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances at the same time when the content of hydrophilic substances such as bsa is relatively high the apparent hydrophobic substance content would increase under acidic conditions it can reflect the changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances more accurately the zeta potential was related to the mutual adsorption performance between the particles or molecules in the solution patil et al 2007 in fig 3e it was seen that the zeta potential of haox 55 0 mv was much more negative than that of ha raw 27 3 mv and ha h2o2 33 9 mv which indicated the oxidation effect of hydroxyl radical was greater than h2o2 at neutral ph while for the bsa samples it was found that the zeta potential of bsaox obviously increased in a negative direction meanwhile the zeta potential of bsa h2o2 was similar to bsa raw and was more positive than bsaox fig 3f the results of zeta potential as well as the ftir spectra and the hydrophilicity analysis indicated that the hydrophilicity of ha samples increased with the oxidation especially by the catalysis with cfpn and for the bsa samples the zeta potential of bsa increased to negative direction with the breaking down of the tertiary and secondary structure as well as the oxidation of c s and benzene structures which confirmed the increase of hydrophilic component 3 4 membrane fouling test of ha and bsa samples in the uf and nf membranes filtration test the decrease of the flux was nearly the same during the uf membranes filtration of all the ha samples i e the flux all decrease to about 77 after filtering 100 ml of all ha samples and recovered to around 90 after backwashing fig 4 a however the fouling of the nf membranes after filtering different ha samples presented a certain difference the most severe membrane fouling was caused by ha raw fig 4b during the filtration of ha raw the flux rapidly dropped to about 96 at the beginning of the first filtration and remained essentially unchanged in the subsequent filtering after backwashing the flux recovered to 98 and then dropped to 96 again just like the first filtration for ha h2o2 the flux change during the nf membrane filtering was similar to ha raw but recovered to approximately 100 after backwashing as for haox the flux slowly dropped to approximately 97 after the first filtration and almost recovered to 100 after backwashing the uf nf membranes flux results suggested that the fouling of uf membranes by ha samples were similar however for the nf membrane the haox caused the lowest membrane fouling and the membrane fouling caused by ha h2o2 was a little lower than that by ha raw the adsorbed nom that on the surface and in the pores of the uf nf membranes can change the hydrophilicity of the membranes and therefore the contact angle results of uf membranes fouled by the three ha samples were different fig 4c haox fouled uf membrane had the smallest contact angle ha raw fouled uf membrane had the largest contact angle and these results were similar to ha raw fouled nf membrane it may be that the zeta potential of the pes membrane was negative and haox also had the largest negative zeta potential which made the haox hardly to foul the membranes for the reason of greatest charge repelling force low et al 2018 hpsec was used to investigate the molecular weight distribution changes of the unfiltered uf membrane filtered and the nf membrane filtered ha samples it was found that the difference of the molecular weight distribution between ha raw and ha h2o2 was negligible but for haox the molecular weight distribution between 20 10 kda and 5 1 kda increased while the molecular weight distribution between 10 and 5 kda decreased fig s5a the changes in haox may be caused by the polymerization of some ha molecules through free radical reactions yu et al 2017 from the hpsec results of the uf membranes filtered ha samples it was found that the 10 kda uf membranes can almost completely intercept substances with a molecular weight greater than 10 kda and also had a certain interception effect on substances with a molecular weight less than 10 kda fig 4e g for nf membranes the interception rates for ha h2o2 and haox were similar but both were higher than the interception rate for ha raw it was found that for the matters with the molecular weight distribution 30 10 kda both uf and nf membranes had a higher interception rate during filtering haox than ha raw and ha h2o2 the possible reason was that haox molecules had the highest degree of oxidation and therefore they have the smallest intramolecular electrostatic action inducing unfolded molecular structures lan et al 2016 which make it difficult for haox molecules to pass through the pores of the membrane resulting in an increase of the interception rate all of the above results indicated that the interception rate of the nf uf membranes for ha samples increased with the increase of the hydrophilic groups which were generated by the oxidation yu et al 2018a combining the above results it can be inferred that for uf membranes the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the irreversible contamination in the pores that were blocked with the matters of molecular weight distribution about 10 kda in ha samples for the nf membrane the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the adsorption because ha raw ha h2o2 and haox were beyond the cut off molecular weight of the nf membranes since haox had the lowest adsorption capacity on the nf membrane the fouling of the nf membrane by haox was lower than that caused by ha raw and ha h2o2 same as the ha samples bsa samples were also used for the uf nf membranes flux test to study their membrane fouling behavior for the uf membrane when filtering bsaox the flux decreased to 87 and recovered to 97 after backwashing but for bsa raw and bsa h2o2 both of the flux decreased to 82 after filtration and recovered to 93 after backwashing fig 5 a for the nf membrane the membrane fouling was different fig 5b the flux rapidly decreased to 92 and stay still when filtering bsa raw and then recovered to 97 after backwashing for bsa h2o2 the flux rapidly decreased to 95 and recovered to 97 after backwashing but for bsaox the flux decreased to 96 at a slow rate and recovered to 99 after backwashing the differences in flux results revealed that the fouling mechanisms for uf nf membranes by bsa raw bsa h2o2 and bsaox should be different the continuous contact angle test was then performed on uf nf membranes fouled by bsa raw bsa h2o2 and bsaox for the uf membrane it was found that bsa raw fouled membrane had the largest contact angle and bsaox fouled membrane had the smallest but their difference was not too large fig 5c for the nf membrane the contact angles of membranes fouled by bsa raw and bsa h2o2 were similar to the uf membranes but the contact angle of the bsaox fouled membrane was much smaller than the others and it was very close to the new nf membrane fig 5d the effects of different treatments on the bsa molecular weight distribution can be intuitively reflected by hpsec for bsa h2o2 compared with bsa raw there was no appearance of any new peaks but a slight reduction of the peak area was observed for bsaox several peaks appeared between the molecular weight distributions of 15 2 kda which suggested that bsa was oxidized to generate some new small molecular substances fig s5b after uf membrane filtration organic matters in bsa raw and bsa h2o2 were completely filtered however in bsaox the organic matters with molecular weight lower than 10 kda were barely filtered fig 5e g after nf membrane filtration the organic matters in each bsa samples were completely filtered according to the above results it was found that the fouling of uf and nf membranes by bsaox were both the lightest according to the hydrophobicity analysis results and the contact angle results of the uf membranes it was found that the adsorption amounts of bsa samples on uf membranes were nearly equivalent combined with the changes of protein structures obtained from the ftir spectra the reason of the uf membrane had the lightest fouling may be caused by the destroying of protein structures of bsaox molecules that lead the molecular morphology to change from spherical to linear which greatly reduced the probability to completely block the membrane pores for the nf membrane the hydrophobicity analysis results indicated that the adsorption amount of bsaox on the nf membrane was lower than bsa raw and bsa h2o2 which may also due to the most negative zeta potential of bsaox sample at the same time it can be seen from the eem spectra of bsa that under the catalysis of cfpn figs s7a c h2o2 can destroy the tryptophan and tyrosine chromophores of bsa more effectively which resulted in a large decrease of the fluorescence signal intensity in bsaox eem is usually used to analyze different components in surface water and reflect changing trend of this componnents the eem spectra of ha samples fig s6 and bsa samples fig s7 before and after uf nf membranes filtration showed the same trend as the hpsec the toc results also indicated that the interception rate of membranes of ha and bsa decreased with the increase of oxidation hydroxylation and carboxylation degree figs s9a b which was consistent with the hpsec results 3 5 variations of surface water samples the surface water samples were undergone with the same experiments of ha and bsa samples the ftir spectra of jm samples were shown in fig 6 a the peaks at 3530 cm 1 and 3240 cm 1 belong to phenolic hydroxyl ar oh and c oh respectively kubo and kadla 2005 the peaks of ar oh and c oh both increased in jm h2o2 and jmox and increased more significantly in jmox than jm h2o2 it was found that the peaks of β sheet 1683 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 1618 cm 1 as part of the amide i 1700 1600 cm 1 and the peak of the coc which belong to ethers 1130 cm 1 obviously increased in jm h2o2 and jmox li et al 2019 while the peaks of ch2 ch3 2920 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 and amide ii iii 1495 1320 cm 1 decreased the generation of c o c which belongs to ethers might be generated from the unsaturated compounds by the epoxidation reaction of h2o2 cusso et al 2016 jiang and xu 1995 the results of ftir indicated that in jm h2o2 and jmox the molecules which contained ch2 ch3 and the protein like substance were both damaged and changed to β sheet the only obvious difference between jm h2o2 and jmox was the content of oh meanwhile in fig s8 it can be seen that at the presence of cfpn the consumption rate of h2o2 in the jmox was higher than that in the jm h2o2 without cfpn catalysis and the concentration of h2o2 in the jmox was much lower than it in the jm h2o2 at 180 min which indicated that the utilization rate of h2o2 was improved by cfpn the above results meant that h2o2 had a stronger hydroxylation ability for the nom from surface water under the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph the ftir spectra of ol samples were shown in fig 6b the peaks of ar oh 3530 cm 1 and c oh 3240 cm 1 both increased in ol h2o2 and olox and the increase in olox was much greater than that in ol h2o2 but for the peaks of ch2 ch3 2950 cm 1 and 2870 cm 1 they only decreased in olox for the peaks of amide i li et al 2019 the peak of α helix 1650 cm 1 stayed the same while the peak of β sheet 1635 cm 1 increased in ol h2o2 however for the spectrum of olox the decrease of the α helix peak and the increase of the β sheet peak can be clearly observed similarly in ol h2o2 it was found that the treatment of h2o2 did not significantly change the peaks of amide ii 1450 1360 cm 1 but decreased the peak of amide iii 1240 cm 1 however in olox the peaks of amide ii and amide iii both decreased compared with jm samples the results indicated that the nom from ol samples was more difficult to be oxidized than that of jm samples by h2o2 under the catalysis of cfpn h2o2 can effectively oxidize the nom from ol samples to increase the number of oh and to effectively destroy the spatial structure of the protein like substances the hydrophilicity analysis results of jm samples were shown in fig 6c it was found that the hydrophilic components of jm h2o2 increased to 1 5 times higher than jm raw and the strongly hydrophobic component decreased to about 80 of jm raw for jmox which was treated by h2o2 and cfpn the hydrophilic component increased dramatically to reach about 55 and the strongly hydrophobic component also decreased significantly the toc value of jm h2o2 and jmox decreased by less than 15 after treatment for ol samples the toc was much higher than that of jm samples for ol h2o2 and olox it was found that the toc values of the two samples were close and about 10 lower than ol raw the hydrophilic component increased and the weakly strongly hydrophobic component both decreased in ol h2o2 for olox the weakly hydrophobic component was much lower than that in ol h2o2 and the hydrophilic component obviously increased with the strongly hydrophobic component largely decreased fig 6d the results revealed that in the neutral condition the hydroxyl radical can effectively oxidize the nom from hydrophilicity to hydrophilicity rather than mineralize it the zeta potential of all jm samples was negative fig 6e the zeta potential increased in negative direction after oxidation which indicated that the nom in jm samples was oxidized to form some negative charge groups like carboxyl et al the jmox sample had the most negative zeta potential which indicated that it had the most negative charge groups which were formed by hydroxyl radical for ol samples the trend of zeta potential was similar to jm samples fig 6f combined with the zeta potential results with the ftir spectra and the hydrophilicity analysis results it was inferred that the nom in surface water samples preferentially underwent the hydroxylation and carboxylation reactions rather the mineralization reaction in a neutral condition in the nf and uf membrane filtration experiment the fouling of uf membranes by jm raw and jm h2o2 are same and the flux decreased to 90 and then recovered to 94 after backwashing for jmox the flux went down to 94 but recovered to 97 after backwashing fig 7 a for nf membrane jm raw caused the most serious membrane fouling that made the flux to went down to about 92 the membrane fouling by jm h2o2 lowered the flux to around 94 for jmox it caused the minimum membrane fouling which made the flux only decreased to about 96 fig 7b to further explore the effects of jm samples on uf nf membrane fouling the continuous contact angle analysis was used to determine the changes in the hydrophilicity of uf nf membranes before and after contamination for the uf membrane the contact angle of jm h2o2 and jm raw fouled membranes were very close jmox fouled membrane had the smallest contact angle which was much smaller than the others but just a little higher than the new uf membrane fig 7c for the nf membrane the results were much similar to the uf membranes fig 7d to explore the mechanism of the membrane fouling by jm samples hpsec was used to detect the possible changes in the molecular weight distribution of the nom from jm samples compared with jm samples it was found that biopolymers significantly decreased after oxidation especially for jmox meanwhile the content of the matters with the molecular weight between 10 kda and 1 kda increased fig s5c the uf membrane could remove most of the biopolymers and the nf membrane additionally removes parts of hs fig 7e g for ol samples the flux of uf membranes decreased to 85 and recovered to 94 after backwashing during the filtration of ol raw and ol h2o2 however for the filtration of olox the flux just decreased to 92 and recovered to 96 after backwashing fig 8 a for the nf membrane ol raw caused the most serious membrane fouling that leads the flux to decrease to about 90 in contrast the flux reduction of ol h2o2 and olox was 95 and 97 respectively after backwashing the flux recovered to 95 for ol raw 97 for ol h2o2 and 99 for olox fig 8b the continuous contact angle of ol raw and ol h2o2 fouled uf membranes were very close and the continuous contact angle of olox fouled uf membranes was the smallest fig 8c for nf membranes the results were very similar to that of uf membranes fig 8d different from the others the continuous contact angle of the olox fouled uf nf membranes were close to that of new uf nf membranes which were similar to the continuous contact angle results of ha samples and bsa samples finally hpsec was used to study the changes in molecular weight distribution of ol samples before and after filtration by uf nf membranes it was clearly seen that the biopolymers of ol samples can be completely intercepted by uf membranes fig 8e g however before the uf membrane filtering it can be found that the biopolymers significantly decreased after oxidation especially for the olox meanwhile the organic matters between 10 kda and 1 kda increased which was similar to the results of jm samples fig s5d for nf membranes the removal rate of biopolymers and hs were a little higher than uf membranes as can be found from the hpsec results of ol samples and jm samples the protein like substances in ol samples can be effectively oxidized by hydroxyl radical into smaller molecules and the oxidation of ol samples was more easily to happen than jm samples although the component and the hydrophobicity were different in jm samples and ol samples the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation was the same the eem spectra of jm samples and ol samples that before and after filtration not only indicated the chemical changes of the nom after the oxidation by h2o2 and hydroxyl radical but also showed the same trend with the toc results of jm samples and ol samples figs s9 and s10 and s11c s11d based on the above results it can be inferred that for the uf membranes the main factor of membrane fouling was the adsorption of biopolymers on the membrane surface and the second factor was the adsorption of hs in the membrane pores for nf membranes the main cause of membrane fouling was the hs and the degradation products of biopolymers rather than the biopolymers themselves under the catalysis of the cfpn h2o2 can effectively change the tertiary and secondary structures of the protein like substance of biopolymers and degrade it which could effectively mitigate the uf membrane fouling meanwhile it can also improve the hydrophilicity of nom and increase its zeta potential to negative direction which could be responsible for mitigating the fouling of both uf and nf membranes 3 6 the analysis of the catalysis mechanism in general the hydroxyl radical reaction known as fenton like reaction can degrade most of the organic matters lei et al 2015 wu et al 2014 but in this work under the oxidation of hydroxyl radical the hydroxylation and carboxylation reaction was superior to the degradation reaction at neutral ph fig s11 the reason of this phenomenon might be related to the stability and oxidative capacity of hydroxyl radical under neutral condition which led the organic matters to be oxidized through the electrophilic addition reaction but not the degradation reaction he et al 2012 janzen and kotake 1992 li et al 2012 the possible reaction mechanism pathway was shown in scheme 1 firstly the cfpn could form an acidic microenvironment that allows the h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical by the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph secondly in the acidic environment nom can be completely degraded into co2 and h2o by the hydroxyl radical in the neutral environment hydroxyl radical will undergo an electrophilic addition reaction with nom and transform it into hydroxylated nom or further generate the carboxylated nom thereby altering the hydrophilicity of nom for protein like matters in the surface water the dominating result of oxidation was the changes in protein structure and fragmentation of partial peptide chains 4 conclusions in this paper a carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn was synthesized which could catalyze h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical at neutral ph because of the acidic micro environment generated by the carboxyl on the cfpn then the cfpn was used to oxidize ha bsa and two kinds of surface water samples the results indicated that the hydrophobic matters in the samples were efficiently oxidized to the hydrophilic matters at neutral ph which obviously mitigated the fouling of the uf nf membranes in the subsequent filtration experiments in further research it was found that the nom prefers to be hydroxylated and carboxylated rather than be degraded by the hydroxyl radical at neutral ph mitigating membrane fouling by increasing the hydrophilicity of nom furthermore the hydroxyl radical could also degrade the secondary structure and tertiary structure of the protein like substance which can mitigate the uf membrane fouling this work showed that the cfpn is a promising nanozyme catalyst which can be applied

18060,oxidation is a widely used method in drinking water treatment to mitigate the membrane fouling caused by the natural organic matters nom from the surface water during ultra filtration uf and nano filtration nf processes and h2o2 is one of the common oxidants for it however the oxidation capability of h2o2 at neutral ph is lower compared to the acidic and alkaline conditions in order to improve the efficiency of nom oxidation at neutral ph a carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn was synthesized in this study and used as a high performance catalyst for h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical the oxygen containing groups on the carbon structure of cfpn can form an acidic microenvironment allowing h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radical by catalysis in neutral conditions the results of hydrophilicity analysis zeta potential high performance liquid size exclusion chromatography hpsec fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir and flux indicated that the hydroxyl radical can oxidize the hydrophobic matters of humic acid ha into hydrophilic matters by fenton reaction or electrophilic addition reaction which can mitigate the fouling of nf membranes the results of the same test for the bovine serum albumin bsa indicated that the hydroxyl radical can mitigate the fouling of uf membranes by degrading the tertiary and secondary structures of bsa and partly oxidizing the side chain groups in addition two types of surface water samples were used to verify the above mechanism and the results indicated that the hydroxyl radical treatment at neutral ph is a new viable and effective strategy to significantly mitigate the nom fouling of uf and nf membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe3o4 nanozyme hydrophilic transition membrane fouling neutral ph 1 introduction the fouling of the widespread natural organic matters nom in surface water organics in the surface water is one of the great challenges to the application of membrane technology kimura et al 2018 yang et al 2018 nom usually consists of polysaccharides proteins humic substances hs and some small molecules tian et al 2018 among them polysaccharides and proteins are collectively called biopolymers the molecular weight of which are mainly in the range of 100 10 kda huber et al 2011 kimura et al 2014 2018 yin et al 2019 hs is a major part of nom li et al 2016b with a molecular weight distribution in the range of 10 1 kda yu et al 2018a there are two main fouling mechanisms for nom the size effect and adsorption effect for the size effect previous researches indicated that when the molecular weight distribution of nom is close to the cut off molecular weight of the membrane the nom will block the membrane pores to cause serious pollution zhu et al 2010 for the adsorption effect the reported studies indicated that the hydrophilic membranes pa or pes membrane would be prone to be fouled by the hydrophobic nom whereas the hydrophilic nom after oxidation is hard to foul the hydrophilic membranes yu et al 2016b 2018a in summary changing the molecular weight distribution and hydrophilicity of nom could be a feasible pretreatment to mitigate the membrane fouling oxidation is the easiest way to modify nom despite many catalytical oxidation methods of nom for membrane fouling mitigation have been reported in the previous studies and the oxidation can actually change the properties of nom most studies aimed at the mineralization of nom or breaking nom into small molecules rather than changing the properties of nom cheng et al 2018 dai et al 2018 daugherty et al 2017 this process not only requires a large number of oxidants but also may make the membrane fouling get worse or even cause chemical damage to membranes gohil and suresh 2017 zhu et al 2010 therefore it is requiring for an effective and moderate catalytical oxidation method to mitigate membrane fouling while avoiding the aforementioned potential risks at neutral ph in recent years the fe3o4 nanoparticles are considered as a peroxidase like nanozyme with an excellent catalytical property at catalyzing h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals and had been widely used in the biochemical assay and industrial production which cause little production of fe2 fe3 hydroxides during catalysis du et al 2017 gao et al 2007 however like the fe2 fe3 most of the fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme can only play its catalytic role in an acidic environment to generate hydroxyl radical wang et al 2016a xu and wang 2012 several attempts such as doping cu2 in the fe3o4 or loading the fe3o4 on sio2 nanoparticles have been taken to improve the catalytic performance of fe3o4 in the neutral environment yang et al 2015 however the mechanism of the two mentioned methods is still unclear besides for the cu2 doping method the introduction of heavy metals may increase the risk of water quality while the sio2 loading method will reduce the catalytic property per unit weight of the catalyst according to previous researches carboxyl groups can be formed on the surface of carbon structures of organic fe materials because of the trace oxygen in the materials itself or from the protective gases during the anoxic heating treatment process chao et al 2004 yang et al 2017 the carboxyl groups will form an acidic micro environment around the nanomaterials when it was in a near neutral aqueous solution chao et al 2004 besides the hybrid fe3o4 can improve the conversion efficiency of fe3 fe2 to accelerate the reaction rate of hydroxyl generating qiu et al 2016 therefore a flower like hollow sphere structure fe3o4 nanoflakes cluster was used as peroxidase like nanozyme which was named as carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn in this work firstly the cfpn was prepared and the morphology chemical constitution and catalytical properties of the cfpn were characterized to verify whether the cfpn was successfully synthesized secondly in order to demonstrate that a low dosage cfpn can catalyze h2o2 in a low concentration to form hydroxyl radicals in a neutral ph the esr spectra were used to detect the hydroxyl radicals by using dmpo as the capturer thirdly bsa and ha were used as the mimic of nom in the surface water to study the oxidation effect of cfpn on nom by catalyzing h2o2 the ftir spectra zeta potential hydrophilic and hydrophobic components analysis and hpsec were used to verify the effect of cfpn on degradating and changing the hydrophilicity of above samples then filtration experiments were conducted to explore the membrane fouling mitigation by cfpn and h2o2 finally two kinds of surface water samples were used to further verify the above conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn the synthesis method of cfpn was from previous research ma et al 2015 in detail 52 5 ml isopropanol ipa was transferred into a 100 ml teflon autoclave and then 0 202 g 0 5 mm ferric nitrate nonahydrate fe

times the precipitate was dried in an oven at 70 c and then a glyceric acid iron fe glycerate precursor was obtained the cfpn was synthesized by heating the fe glycerate precursor to 350 c with a slow heating rate of 1 c min in a tube furnace and kept for 3 h under n2 aeration with the flow rate of 200 ml min the non modified fe3o4 nanoparticles fe3o4 nps used for the control group were synthesized

polyethersulfone pes ultrafiltration uf membranes and nano filtration nf membranes beijing separate equipment co ltd china were used in this paper the as prepared ha and bsa solutions as well as surface water samples were selected as the raw water for uf nf membrane fouling source the cut off molecular weights were 10 kda and 1 kda for the uf membrane and nf membrane respectively each membrane was immersed in di water for 1 day before being used to remove impurities and production residues and then the membrane flushed using 100 ml di water before filtering the samples in order to stable the permeate flux of the membrane and further clean the membrane pores after the uf membrane filtering 100 ml samples 50 ml for nf membranes the membrane was turned upside down to backwash with 20 ml di water 10 ml for nf membranes the performance of the membrane was evaluated by recording the variation of normalized flux as a function of flux 3 results 3 1 characterization and the catalysis mechanism of the cfpn from the sem image fig 1 a it was found that the as prepared cfpn had a flower like morphology and hollow sphere structure and its diameter was between 300 nm and 400 nm compared with the cfpn the fe3o4 nps with a diameter around 400 nm had a porous sphere but no flower like structure fig s1 the flower like or nano flacks structure is considered to increase the exposure area of activity sites which could improve the utilization of the cfpn ma et al 2015 sheng et al 2018 in the xrd spectra of fe3o4 nps and cfpn fig 1b it was seen that the feature peaks of fe3o4 were clearly observed which revealed that it was completely composed of pure fe3o4 hou et al 2014 meanwhile the peaks of graphite carbon 2θ 24 and fecxoy 2θ 18 21 and 38 jcpds no 14 0807 and 14 0762 could also be observed in the spectrum of cfpn which indicated the possible existence of carboxyl and graphite like structure kim et al 2015 to further verify the existence of carboxyl the ftir spectra were used to characterize the difference between cfpn and fe3o4 nps fig 1c the peaks between 3000 cm 1 and 2700 cm 1 belong to the ch2 and ch tao et al 2015 the peaks between 1700 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 were considered as the carboxyl yu et al 2015 which shifted to lower wavenumber because of the existence of fe as can be seen the ftir spectra of cfpn showed the existence of carboxyl and methyl methylene which did not exist in fe3o4 nps it was considered that during the formation process of cfpn the carbon and oxygen elements of glyceric acid transformed into carboxyl and other carbon structures during the heating treatment which agreed with the results of xrd spectra the zeta potential analysis is usually used to reflect the amount of positive and negative charge groups on a material surface which could unveil the dispersion stability of particles in water to some extent the zeta potential of cfpn was much more negative than fe3o4 nps fig 1d which indicated the negative charge groups mainly carboxyl on the cfpn surface were relatively more than that on fe3o4 nps yu et al 2018a based on the ftir and zeta potential results it can be inferred that a large number of carboxyl groups on the surface of cfpn may form an acidic microenvironment around the cfpn in aqueous solution zhang et al 2017 which may enhance the production efficiency of hydroxyl radical at neutral ph 3 2 the catalytic mechanism of the cfpn in order to investigate the catalytical mechanism of cfpn in neutral conditions the esr spectra were used to identify the type of radical by using the dmpo as the radical capturer dmpo can be oxidized by the superoxide radical or hydroxyl radical in the methanol solution and aqueous solution respectively which can generate different oxidation products li et al 2016a it can be seen that there was no signal of superoxide radical detected even 30 min after h2o2 was added into the methanol solution the final concentration of h2o2 was 1 mm the same below with 10 mg l cfpn fig 2 a but in di water the signal of hydroxyl radical increased with the time after the h2o2 and cfpn were added fig 2b the esr results indicated that h2o2 was directly catalyzed by the cfpn surface to hydroxyl radical which was the same as in acidic solution wang et al 2016a but the catalysis property of the fe3o4 nps was extremely limited at neutral ph combined with the previous characterization and test results it can be speculated that the oxygen containing groups on cfpn formed an acidic micro environment near the surface of cfpn which lead h2o2 to be converted into hydroxyl radicals by the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph 3 3 variation of ha and bsa the concentration of h2o2 and the dosage of cfpn were chosen by considering the results of fig s2 the cfpn dosage was 10 mg l and the h2o2 concentration was 1 mm the eem spectra of ha raw ha h2o2 haox and the ha sample treated with h2o2 fe3o4 nps were shown in fig s3 and it was found that the changes of haox were more obvious than others according to the eem spectra of ha with cfpn catalytical reaction after different reaction times it was found that the optimal reaction time was 60 min fig s4 in order to analyze the changes of different treatments ftir spectra were used to characterize ha raw ha h2o2 and haox samples after being freeze dried fig 3 a for ha h2o2 the peak of hydroxyl 3450 cm 1 decreased and the peaks of carboxyl 1710 cm 1 1625 cm 1 and 1420 cm 1 increased ho et al 2018 which indicated that a part of hydroxyl of ha might be oxidized into carboxyl by h2o2 the decrease of ch2 ch3 2900 2700 cm 1 in ha h2o2 and haox samples indicated that a part of the ch2 ch3 were oxidized by h2o2 or hydroxyl radical which may cause the increase of carboxyl 1700 1600 cm 1 and hydroxyl 3700 3000 cm 1 especially for haox compared with ha h2o2 the peaks of c o c in haox 1170 cm 1 1020 cm 1 and 889 cm 1 increased which indicated that cfpn might catalyze the oxidation process of ha samples and generate another structure besides oh and cooh by the epoxidation or other oxygen adding reaction al jorani et al 2018 cusso et al 2016 jiang and xu 1995 yu et al 2018b for bsa samples the ftir spectra were mainly used to characterize the differences of the protein structures between the bsa before and after oxidation fig 3b the several peaks near 3630 cm 1 were considered to represent the hydrogen bonds of the intramolecular hydroxyl groups of bsa carpenter and crowe 1989 which decreased after adding h2o2 and vanished after reacting with hydroxyl radical the peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 1500 1400 cm 1 and 1300 1200 cm 1 belong to amide i amide ii and amide iii which respectively represent the primary secondary and tertiary structure of proteins chou et al 2016 li et al 2019 the peak at 1655 cm 1 represented the α helix structures of bsa they were similar in all of the bsa samples which indicated the primary structure of bsa was not damaged by h2o2 or hydroxyl radical the peaks of amide ii and amide iii both decreased in bsa h2o2 and bsaox especially for bsaox which could be attributed to the damages of the secondary and tertiary structures of bsa the series peaks of benzene rings structures ar between 1035 cm 1 and 944 cm 1 c h of ar 665 cm 1 c s 1450 cm 1 and so2 1320 cm 1 decreased while the peak of c o 1125 cm 1 increased only in bsaox levitsky et al 2012 the changes of these peaks indicated that a part of benzene structures in bsaox was oxidized and the c s group might be oxidized into so2 group in summary on account of hydroxyl radical treatment the tertiary and secondary structures of bsa might be damaged by the oxidation of c s groups as known the c s h groups assist in the formation of spatial structures of proteins in the form of disulfide bond and benzene structures however the primary structure of bsa had not been obviously damaged since the oxidation had little effect on the α helix to further verify the influence of hydroxyl and carboxyl on the chemical property of ha and bsa xad 4 dax 8 resins were used to analyze the hydrophilic as toc of ha samples in fig 3c the results showed that the weakly hydrophobic composition of ha h2o2 increased obviously and the hydrophilic composition increased slightly for haox the obvious increase of hydrophilic composition indicated that ha was more efficiently to be oxidized to generate hydroxyl and carboxyl by hydroxyl radical than h2o2 in addition there was little change in the toc value of ha samples after different treatments it indicated that the mineralization efficiency of ha oxidation by h2o2 and hydroxyl radical were very low in a neutral condition then the hydrophilicity analysis results of the bsa samples were shown in fig 3d it was found that the strongly hydrophobic composition of bsa raw was very low which was less than 10 the weakly hydrophobic composition was nearly 30 and the rest was hydrophilic composition after reacting with h2o2 all compositions almost unchanged however for bsaox the strongly hydrophobic composition was completely oxidized and the weakly hydrophobic composition decreased while the hydrophilic composition increased the results of the xad 4 dax 8 resin analysis indicated that under the catalysis of cfpn h2o2 could oxidize the hydrophobic composition of bsa more efficiently and simultaneously the h2o2 and hydroxyl radical almost cannot mineralize the bsa at neutral ph which was similar to the results of ha sample it is worth noting that in the research of xiao s study mu et al 2019 xad 4 dax 8 analysis under neutral conditions can accurately reflect the content of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances in water however in this work the test under acidic conditions can accurately reflect the trend of changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances at the same time when the content of hydrophilic substances such as bsa is relatively high the apparent hydrophobic substance content would increase under acidic conditions it can reflect the changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances more accurately the zeta potential was related to the mutual adsorption performance between the particles or molecules in the solution patil et al 2007 in fig 3e it was seen that the zeta potential of haox 55 0 mv was much more negative than that of ha raw 27 3 mv and ha h2o2 33 9 mv which indicated the oxidation effect of hydroxyl radical was greater than h2o2 at neutral ph while for the bsa samples it was found that the zeta potential of bsaox obviously increased in a negative direction meanwhile the zeta potential of bsa h2o2 was similar to bsa raw and was more positive than bsaox fig 3f the results of zeta potential as well as the ftir spectra and the hydrophilicity analysis indicated that the hydrophilicity of ha samples increased with the oxidation especially by the catalysis with cfpn and for the bsa samples the zeta potential of bsa increased to negative direction with the breaking down of the tertiary and secondary structure as well as the oxidation of c s and benzene structures which confirmed the increase of hydrophilic component 3 4 membrane fouling test of ha and bsa samples in the uf and nf membranes filtration test the decrease of the flux was nearly the same during the uf membranes filtration of all the ha samples i e the flux all decrease to about 77 after filtering 100 ml of all ha samples and recovered to around 90 after backwashing fig 4 a however the fouling of the nf membranes after filtering different ha samples presented a certain difference the most severe membrane fouling was caused by ha raw fig 4b during the filtration of ha raw the flux rapidly dropped to about 96 at the beginning of the first filtration and remained essentially unchanged in the subsequent filtering after backwashing the flux recovered to 98 and then dropped to 96 again just like the first filtration for ha h2o2 the flux change during the nf membrane filtering was similar to ha raw but recovered to approximately 100 after backwashing as for haox the flux slowly dropped to approximately 97 after the first filtration and almost recovered to 100 after backwashing the uf nf membranes flux results suggested that the fouling of uf membranes by ha samples were similar however for the nf membrane the haox caused the lowest membrane fouling and the membrane fouling caused by ha h2o2 was a little lower than that by ha raw the adsorbed nom that on the surface and in the pores of the uf nf membranes can change the hydrophilicity of the membranes and therefore the contact angle results of uf membranes fouled by the three ha samples were different fig 4c haox fouled uf membrane had the smallest contact angle ha raw fouled uf membrane had the largest contact angle and these results were similar to ha raw fouled nf membrane it may be that the zeta potential of the pes membrane was negative and haox also had the largest negative zeta potential which made the haox hardly to foul the membranes for the reason of greatest charge repelling force low et al 2018 hpsec was used to investigate the molecular weight distribution changes of the unfiltered uf membrane filtered and the nf membrane filtered ha samples it was found that the difference of the molecular weight distribution between ha raw and ha h2o2 was negligible but for haox the molecular weight distribution between 20 10 kda and 5 1 kda increased while the molecular weight distribution between 10 and 5 kda decreased fig s5a the changes in haox may be caused by the polymerization of some ha molecules through free radical reactions yu et al 2017 from the hpsec results of the uf membranes filtered ha samples it was found that the 10 kda uf membranes can almost completely intercept substances with a molecular weight greater than 10 kda and also had a certain interception effect on substances with a molecular weight less than 10 kda fig 4e g for nf membranes the interception rates for ha h2o2 and haox were similar but both were higher than the interception rate for ha raw it was found that for the matters with the molecular weight distribution 30 10 kda both uf and nf membranes had a higher interception rate during filtering haox than ha raw and ha h2o2 the possible reason was that haox molecules had the highest degree of oxidation and therefore they have the smallest intramolecular electrostatic action inducing unfolded molecular structures lan et al 2016 which make it difficult for haox molecules to pass through the pores of the membrane resulting in an increase of the interception rate all of the above results indicated that the interception rate of the nf uf membranes for ha samples increased with the increase of the hydrophilic groups which were generated by the oxidation yu et al 2018a combining the above results it can be inferred that for uf membranes the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the irreversible contamination in the pores that were blocked with the matters of molecular weight distribution about 10 kda in ha samples for the nf membrane the membrane fouling was mainly caused by the adsorption because ha raw ha h2o2 and haox were beyond the cut off molecular weight of the nf membranes since haox had the lowest adsorption capacity on the nf membrane the fouling of the nf membrane by haox was lower than that caused by ha raw and ha h2o2 same as the ha samples bsa samples were also used for the uf nf membranes flux test to study their membrane fouling behavior for the uf membrane when filtering bsaox the flux decreased to 87 and recovered to 97 after backwashing but for bsa raw and bsa h2o2 both of the flux decreased to 82 after filtration and recovered to 93 after backwashing fig 5 a for the nf membrane the membrane fouling was different fig 5b the flux rapidly decreased to 92 and stay still when filtering bsa raw and then recovered to 97 after backwashing for bsa h2o2 the flux rapidly decreased to 95 and recovered to 97 after backwashing but for bsaox the flux decreased to 96 at a slow rate and recovered to 99 after backwashing the differences in flux results revealed that the fouling mechanisms for uf nf membranes by bsa raw bsa h2o2 and bsaox should be different the continuous contact angle test was then performed on uf nf membranes fouled by bsa raw bsa h2o2 and bsaox for the uf membrane it was found that bsa raw fouled membrane had the largest contact angle and bsaox fouled membrane had the smallest but their difference was not too large fig 5c for the nf membrane the contact angles of membranes fouled by bsa raw and bsa h2o2 were similar to the uf membranes but the contact angle of the bsaox fouled membrane was much smaller than the others and it was very close to the new nf membrane fig 5d the effects of different treatments on the bsa molecular weight distribution can be intuitively reflected by hpsec for bsa h2o2 compared with bsa raw there was no appearance of any new peaks but a slight reduction of the peak area was observed for bsaox several peaks appeared between the molecular weight distributions of 15 2 kda which suggested that bsa was oxidized to generate some new small molecular substances fig s5b after uf membrane filtration organic matters in bsa raw and bsa h2o2 were completely filtered however in bsaox the organic matters with molecular weight lower than 10 kda were barely filtered fig 5e g after nf membrane filtration the organic matters in each bsa samples were completely filtered according to the above results it was found that the fouling of uf and nf membranes by bsaox were both the lightest according to the hydrophobicity analysis results and the contact angle results of the uf membranes it was found that the adsorption amounts of bsa samples on uf membranes were nearly equivalent combined with the changes of protein structures obtained from the ftir spectra the reason of the uf membrane had the lightest fouling may be caused by the destroying of protein structures of bsaox molecules that lead the molecular morphology to change from spherical to linear which greatly reduced the probability to completely block the membrane pores for the nf membrane the hydrophobicity analysis results indicated that the adsorption amount of bsaox on the nf membrane was lower than bsa raw and bsa h2o2 which may also due to the most negative zeta potential of bsaox sample at the same time it can be seen from the eem spectra of bsa that under the catalysis of cfpn figs s7a c h2o2 can destroy the tryptophan and tyrosine chromophores of bsa more effectively which resulted in a large decrease of the fluorescence signal intensity in bsaox eem is usually used to analyze different components in surface water and reflect changing trend of this componnents the eem spectra of ha samples fig s6 and bsa samples fig s7 before and after uf nf membranes filtration showed the same trend as the hpsec the toc results also indicated that the interception rate of membranes of ha and bsa decreased with the increase of oxidation hydroxylation and carboxylation degree figs s9a b which was consistent with the hpsec results 3 5 variations of surface water samples the surface water samples were undergone with the same experiments of ha and bsa samples the ftir spectra of jm samples were shown in fig 6 a the peaks at 3530 cm 1 and 3240 cm 1 belong to phenolic hydroxyl ar oh and c oh respectively kubo and kadla 2005 the peaks of ar oh and c oh both increased in jm h2o2 and jmox and increased more significantly in jmox than jm h2o2 it was found that the peaks of β sheet 1683 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 1618 cm 1 as part of the amide i 1700 1600 cm 1 and the peak of the coc which belong to ethers 1130 cm 1 obviously increased in jm h2o2 and jmox li et al 2019 while the peaks of ch2 ch3 2920 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 and amide ii iii 1495 1320 cm 1 decreased the generation of c o c which belongs to ethers might be generated from the unsaturated compounds by the epoxidation reaction of h2o2 cusso et al 2016 jiang and xu 1995 the results of ftir indicated that in jm h2o2 and jmox the molecules which contained ch2 ch3 and the protein like substance were both damaged and changed to β sheet the only obvious difference between jm h2o2 and jmox was the content of oh meanwhile in fig s8 it can be seen that at the presence of cfpn the consumption rate of h2o2 in the jmox was higher than that in the jm h2o2 without cfpn catalysis and the concentration of h2o2 in the jmox was much lower than it in the jm h2o2 at 180 min which indicated that the utilization rate of h2o2 was improved by cfpn the above results meant that h2o2 had a stronger hydroxylation ability for the nom from surface water under the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph the ftir spectra of ol samples were shown in fig 6b the peaks of ar oh 3530 cm 1 and c oh 3240 cm 1 both increased in ol h2o2 and olox and the increase in olox was much greater than that in ol h2o2 but for the peaks of ch2 ch3 2950 cm 1 and 2870 cm 1 they only decreased in olox for the peaks of amide i li et al 2019 the peak of α helix 1650 cm 1 stayed the same while the peak of β sheet 1635 cm 1 increased in ol h2o2 however for the spectrum of olox the decrease of the α helix peak and the increase of the β sheet peak can be clearly observed similarly in ol h2o2 it was found that the treatment of h2o2 did not significantly change the peaks of amide ii 1450 1360 cm 1 but decreased the peak of amide iii 1240 cm 1 however in olox the peaks of amide ii and amide iii both decreased compared with jm samples the results indicated that the nom from ol samples was more difficult to be oxidized than that of jm samples by h2o2 under the catalysis of cfpn h2o2 can effectively oxidize the nom from ol samples to increase the number of oh and to effectively destroy the spatial structure of the protein like substances the hydrophilicity analysis results of jm samples were shown in fig 6c it was found that the hydrophilic components of jm h2o2 increased to 1 5 times higher than jm raw and the strongly hydrophobic component decreased to about 80 of jm raw for jmox which was treated by h2o2 and cfpn the hydrophilic component increased dramatically to reach about 55 and the strongly hydrophobic component also decreased significantly the toc value of jm h2o2 and jmox decreased by less than 15 after treatment for ol samples the toc was much higher than that of jm samples for ol h2o2 and olox it was found that the toc values of the two samples were close and about 10 lower than ol raw the hydrophilic component increased and the weakly strongly hydrophobic component both decreased in ol h2o2 for olox the weakly hydrophobic component was much lower than that in ol h2o2 and the hydrophilic component obviously increased with the strongly hydrophobic component largely decreased fig 6d the results revealed that in the neutral condition the hydroxyl radical can effectively oxidize the nom from hydrophilicity to hydrophilicity rather than mineralize it the zeta potential of all jm samples was negative fig 6e the zeta potential increased in negative direction after oxidation which indicated that the nom in jm samples was oxidized to form some negative charge groups like carboxyl et al the jmox sample had the most negative zeta potential which indicated that it had the most negative charge groups which were formed by hydroxyl radical for ol samples the trend of zeta potential was similar to jm samples fig 6f combined with the zeta potential results with the ftir spectra and the hydrophilicity analysis results it was inferred that the nom in surface water samples preferentially underwent the hydroxylation and carboxylation reactions rather the mineralization reaction in a neutral condition in the nf and uf membrane filtration experiment the fouling of uf membranes by jm raw and jm h2o2 are same and the flux decreased to 90 and then recovered to 94 after backwashing for jmox the flux went down to 94 but recovered to 97 after backwashing fig 7 a for nf membrane jm raw caused the most serious membrane fouling that made the flux to went down to about 92 the membrane fouling by jm h2o2 lowered the flux to around 94 for jmox it caused the minimum membrane fouling which made the flux only decreased to about 96 fig 7b to further explore the effects of jm samples on uf nf membrane fouling the continuous contact angle analysis was used to determine the changes in the hydrophilicity of uf nf membranes before and after contamination for the uf membrane the contact angle of jm h2o2 and jm raw fouled membranes were very close jmox fouled membrane had the smallest contact angle which was much smaller than the others but just a little higher than the new uf membrane fig 7c for the nf membrane the results were much similar to the uf membranes fig 7d to explore the mechanism of the membrane fouling by jm samples hpsec was used to detect the possible changes in the molecular weight distribution of the nom from jm samples compared with jm samples it was found that biopolymers significantly decreased after oxidation especially for jmox meanwhile the content of the matters with the molecular weight between 10 kda and 1 kda increased fig s5c the uf membrane could remove most of the biopolymers and the nf membrane additionally removes parts of hs fig 7e g for ol samples the flux of uf membranes decreased to 85 and recovered to 94 after backwashing during the filtration of ol raw and ol h2o2 however for the filtration of olox the flux just decreased to 92 and recovered to 96 after backwashing fig 8 a for the nf membrane ol raw caused the most serious membrane fouling that leads the flux to decrease to about 90 in contrast the flux reduction of ol h2o2 and olox was 95 and 97 respectively after backwashing the flux recovered to 95 for ol raw 97 for ol h2o2 and 99 for olox fig 8b the continuous contact angle of ol raw and ol h2o2 fouled uf membranes were very close and the continuous contact angle of olox fouled uf membranes was the smallest fig 8c for nf membranes the results were very similar to that of uf membranes fig 8d different from the others the continuous contact angle of the olox fouled uf nf membranes were close to that of new uf nf membranes which were similar to the continuous contact angle results of ha samples and bsa samples finally hpsec was used to study the changes in molecular weight distribution of ol samples before and after filtration by uf nf membranes it was clearly seen that the biopolymers of ol samples can be completely intercepted by uf membranes fig 8e g however before the uf membrane filtering it can be found that the biopolymers significantly decreased after oxidation especially for the olox meanwhile the organic matters between 10 kda and 1 kda increased which was similar to the results of jm samples fig s5d for nf membranes the removal rate of biopolymers and hs were a little higher than uf membranes as can be found from the hpsec results of ol samples and jm samples the protein like substances in ol samples can be effectively oxidized by hydroxyl radical into smaller molecules and the oxidation of ol samples was more easily to happen than jm samples although the component and the hydrophobicity were different in jm samples and ol samples the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation was the same the eem spectra of jm samples and ol samples that before and after filtration not only indicated the chemical changes of the nom after the oxidation by h2o2 and hydroxyl radical but also showed the same trend with the toc results of jm samples and ol samples figs s9 and s10 and s11c s11d based on the above results it can be inferred that for the uf membranes the main factor of membrane fouling was the adsorption of biopolymers on the membrane surface and the second factor was the adsorption of hs in the membrane pores for nf membranes the main cause of membrane fouling was the hs and the degradation products of biopolymers rather than the biopolymers themselves under the catalysis of the cfpn h2o2 can effectively change the tertiary and secondary structures of the protein like substance of biopolymers and degrade it which could effectively mitigate the uf membrane fouling meanwhile it can also improve the hydrophilicity of nom and increase its zeta potential to negative direction which could be responsible for mitigating the fouling of both uf and nf membranes 3 6 the analysis of the catalysis mechanism in general the hydroxyl radical reaction known as fenton like reaction can degrade most of the organic matters lei et al 2015 wu et al 2014 but in this work under the oxidation of hydroxyl radical the hydroxylation and carboxylation reaction was superior to the degradation reaction at neutral ph fig s11 the reason of this phenomenon might be related to the stability and oxidative capacity of hydroxyl radical under neutral condition which led the organic matters to be oxidized through the electrophilic addition reaction but not the degradation reaction he et al 2012 janzen and kotake 1992 li et al 2012 the possible reaction mechanism pathway was shown in scheme 1 firstly the cfpn could form an acidic microenvironment that allows the h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical by the catalysis of cfpn at neutral ph secondly in the acidic environment nom can be completely degraded into co2 and h2o by the hydroxyl radical in the neutral environment hydroxyl radical will undergo an electrophilic addition reaction with nom and transform it into hydroxylated nom or further generate the carboxylated nom thereby altering the hydrophilicity of nom for protein like matters in the surface water the dominating result of oxidation was the changes in protein structure and fragmentation of partial peptide chains 4 conclusions in this paper a carbon doped fe3o4 peroxidase like nanozyme cfpn was synthesized which could catalyze h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radical at neutral ph because of the acidic micro environment generated by the carboxyl on the cfpn then the cfpn was used to oxidize ha bsa and two kinds of surface water samples the results indicated that the hydrophobic matters in the samples were efficiently oxidized to the hydrophilic matters at neutral ph which obviously mitigated the fouling of the uf nf membranes in the subsequent filtration experiments in further research it was found that the nom prefers to be hydroxylated and carboxylated rather than be degraded by the hydroxyl radical at neutral ph mitigating membrane fouling by increasing the hydrophilicity of nom furthermore the hydroxyl radical could also degrade the secondary structure and tertiary structure of the protein like substance which can mitigate the uf membrane fouling this work showed that the cfpn is a promising nanozyme catalyst which can be applied

18061,this study combined at pilot scale the recovery of cellulosic primary sludge from the sieving of municipal wastewater followed by the production of bio based vfas through acidogenic fermentation the sieving of municipal wastewater was accomplished by a rotating belt filter which allowed the removal of around 50 of suspended solids when operated at solids loading rates higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h the solids recovered by sieving contained around 40 of cellulose which is a suitable raw material for the production of bio based vfas initially fermentation batch tests of cellulosic primary sludge were carried out adjusting the initial ph of the sludge at values of 8 9 10 and 11 in order to evaluate the best production yields of bio based vfas and their composition the highest vfas yield achieved was 521 mgcodvfa gvs occurring when ph was adjusted at 9 while propionic acid reached 51 of the total vfas then the optimal conditions were applied at long term in a sequencing batch fermentation reactor where the highest potential productivity of bio based vfas 2 57 kg cod m3 d was obtained by adjusting the ph feeding at 9 and operating with an hydraulic retention time of 6 days under mesophilic conditions the cost benefit analyses for the implementation of cellulosic primary sludge recovery was carried out consideringthe anaerobic digestion as reference scenario the economical assessment showed that the production of bio based vfas from cellulosic primary sludge as carbon source and or as chemical precursors give higher net benefits instead of the only biogas

consumption and generation of greenhouse gas emissions ghgs which contribute to the climate change maktabifard et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 currently the role of wastewater treatment plants wwpts is no longer merely evaluated based on the effluent quality materials to recover energy and resources embedded in wastewater to improve the sustainability of the water sector towards circular economy van der hoek et al 2016 wang et al 2015 water is the first type of resource to recover for multiple uses while the wastewater organics can be upgraded to reusable materials such as cellulose methane or biopolymers resource recovery cluster 2015 the spreading of this approach contributes to rebrand wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs and to develop new processes combining existing systems with innovative technologies nevertheless the use of concentrated streams has been reported as a successful strategy for resource recovery by verstraete et al 2009 thus making raw wastewater not suitable for this purpose due to its dilution rate the rotating belt filter rbf is a primary treatment aiming the mechanical removal and concentration of larger suspended solid by cake filtration and sieving of the wastewater several studies demonstrated the benefits of this system compared with conventional primary clarifiers like lower footprint reduction of the overall organic loading rate in the biological reactor mainly due to slowly biodegradable cod which contributes to the mitigation of co2 eq emission by 36 paulsrud et al 2014 franchi and santoro 2015 in addition the sludge produced using the rbf is enriched in toilet paper fibers which enables the recovery of marketable cellulosic fiber from cellulosic primary sludge cps as demonstrated by cirtec which implemented cellvation technology in geestmerambacht wwtp akyol et al 2019 the final product called recell is a valuable raw material suitable for different industrial sectors like construction paper and board coatings and sustainable chemicals the recovered cellulose is already used as asphalt additive or could replaces pure cellulose in hydraulic lime based mortars palmieri et al 2019 moreover zhou et al 2019 developed a compatible sludge cellulose plastic composite including recovered cps and demonstrated that the produced biocomposite had 15 lower manufacturing costs than conventional one and it was

lee et al 2014 longo et al 2017 bhatia and yang 2017 the great number of studies dealing with acidogenic fermentation of sewage sludge during the last decade atasoy et al 2018 showed the increase of interest for bio based vfas production within wrrf and the feasibility to valorize the organic matter through this bioprocess crutchik et al 2018 investigated the effect of ph and temperature on vfas

fermentation of cps for the conversion of slowly biodegradable cod into bio based vfas as chemical precursors for this purpose the vfas productivities were evaluated in a pilot sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr under different retention times and ph according with preliminary batch test finally the observed performances were employed to analyze and compare three pathways of cps i production of methane through anaerobic digestion ii production of bio based vfas as supplementary carbon source for bnr process iii production of bio based vfas as chemical precursors for

total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod total kijendhal and ammonium nitrogen total phosphorus and phosphate according to of standard methods american public health association et al 1999 granulometric distribution was evaluated on 24 hours composite samples using sieving on meshes with porosity of 350 210 158 90 and 54 μm as described by rusten and lundar 2006 2 2 wastewater sieving by pilot rotating belt filter the cellulosic primary sludge was produced by the sieving of around 400 m3 day of municipal wastewater from carbonera wwtp treviso north of italy collected after a coarse bar screening 3 mm and grit removal of the main wwtp line the wastewater sieving was accomplished through a rotating belt filter type sf1000 salsnes filter sa norway with a flow capacity up to 15 l s and a submerged sieve cloth area of 0 24 m2 the experiments have been carried out using two mesh sizes 350 and 210 μm in order to evaluate how this parameter affects the suspended solids removal efficiency different flow rates were applied in the range between 8 and 11 l s while higher values determined overflows of the wastewater not providing reliable performances the belt rotation speed was controlled by a pid model control in order to maintain a constant liquid level 210 mm while the inclination of the belt was kept constant at 30 a sludge layer formed on the mesh surface which consequently retained smaller particles than the mesh pore size of the belt improving the tss removal efficiency the rbf was embedded with a cleaning system made up of an air knife and compressed hot water to remove the residual sludge cake from the belt the cps produced was discontinuously fed in a sequencing batch fermentation reactor through a volumetric pump described in section 2 4 while the sieved wastewater was discharged and recirculated in the headworks of the wwtp two autosamplers collected the influent and effluent at regular intervals every 5 min to obtain representative samples for their characterization and calculation of the mass balances 2 3 batch fermentation tests around 10 l of cps was collected from rbf and investigated through batch fermentation tests in duplicate glass bottles with working and total volume of 0 7 and 1 2 l respectively the bottles were placed in a temperature controlled air chamber at 37 c mesophilic condition was chosen due to the positive results reported by crutchik et al 2018 indeed thermophilic or hyper thermophilic temperature had a detrimental effect on total bio based vfas production however differently from the authors in this work real cps was evaluated under batch conditions the role of initial ph was investigated using raw cps ph around 6 6 and changing the ph of substrate by adding naoh 30 solution to obtain an initial ph of 8 9 10 and 11 the ph of the sludge was not controlled during the fermentation and mixing was operated manually twice per day the process was monitored for two weeks collecting around 50 ml of sludge per day then the samples were centrifuged and the liquid fraction was characterized in terms of ph soluble cod bio based vfas concentration and composition ammonium and phosphate content the performances at different ph were quantified as maximal bio based vfas yields yvfa that corresponds to ratio between produced bio based vfas and fed vs equation 1 1 vfa yield mgcod gvs cod vfa max cod vfa t 0 vs fed where codvfa t0 and codvfa max were respectively the initial vfas concentration and the concentration at the time where the highest value was observed while vsfed was the concentration of volatile solid of the cps 2 4 sequencing batch fermentation reactor the acidogenic fermentation of the cps was carried out in a pilot scale sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr of 2 6 m3 of working volume the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 37 c using an electrical heating system located on the internal wall of the reactor the reactor was initially filled with cps and the feeding of the reactor was accomplished during 5 days per week by discharging a volume of fermented cps from the reactor and replacing the same amount with cps directly pumped from the rbf the volumetric exchange ratio was fixed at 25 or 10 corresponding to an average hrt of 6 and 14 days respectively table 1 the organic loading rate was affected by the flow rate and average inlet ts concentration as reported in table 1 each operational condition was tested for at least 3 hrts and under steady state conditions the reactor was mixed using a grinder pump installed at the bottom of the tank aiming the reduction of the particle sizes and continuous recycling the treated sludge at the top of the reactor the effluent from the sbfr was collected and analyzed three times per week to evaluate the fermentation performances the raw samples were used to determine the total and volatile solids content while an amount of sample was centrifuged to characterize the liquid fraction soluble cod and bio based vfas were analyzed to calculate the bio based vfas yields and the composition of soluble organic matter the acidification degree was determined by dividing the concentration

operational conditions was analyzed using one way anova and tukey post hoc test with a significance threshold level of 5 p 0 05 the statistical analysis was conducted using microsofts excel xlstat pro version 7 2 2003 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics composite discrete samples were collected and analyzed in order to represents the average characteristics of wastewater over the experimental periods the average characteristics table s1 of the influent wastewater in carbonera wwtp during the experimental period were 197 mg tss l 391 mg cod l 38 mg tkn l with 82 due to ammonium 5 8 mgp l 67 phosphate the cod n ratio was 10 3 gcod gn while the content of cellulose accounted for 18 lower than the percentage reported by other studies 35 tss ruiken et al 2013 the particulate distribution had the typical profile showed by rusten and lundar 2006 where most of the particulate material was either larger than 350 μm or smaller than 54 μm fig 1 ravndal et al 2018 showed that the larger fraction is generally composed by carbohydrates and slowly biodegradable organic matter while the fraction with dimension 54 μm has a higher content of proteins and fat materials the effect of the mesh porosity on the tss and cod removal efficiency using static sieve was reported in supplementary material fig 1s council directive 91 271 eec defines that a primary treatment must be able to reduce 20 of bod5 and to remove 50 of suspended solids the preliminary results showed that the required tss removal efficiency can be met using a 54 μm opening mesh if a cake is not formed during filtration regarding the requirement for bod5 removal equivalent to 25 removal of cod rusten and lundar 2006 it could be easier achieved using a 210 μm mesh on the other hand rusten and lundar 2006 reported that if the percentage of tss with dimension larger than mesh porosity is higher than 20 the cake formation occurs and leads to an increasing efficiency corresponding to a mesh with smaller porosity basing on base of wastewater characteristics a mesh with opening dimension of 350 μm can be used and the cake formation is expected previous studies reported that particulate fraction 0 65 μm had higher cod n and cod p ratio than colloidal polymeric oligomeric and monomeric fraction because of the abundance of macromolecules without nitrogen or phosphorous atoms e g cellulose starch and lignin in the large particulate fractions ravndal et al 2018 in particular a former study demonstrated that fraction with size 100 μm had a content of carbohydrates ranging between 70 and 100 of total cod due to toilet paper residues ruiken et al 2013 the biodegradability of the larger solid fraction is limited by particle breakup dimock and morgenroth 2006 indeed the surface area to volume ratio of particles was lower than in smaller fraction hence substrate availability is proportionally inverse to the particle size this explanation was confirmed by ravndal et al 2018 that observed that the largest particle fractions of wastewater was characterized by slowly biodegradable cod 3 2 rbf performances the rbf operated with a belt mesh size of 350 and 210 μm under two different periods meshes while the flow rates varied between 8 and 11 l s the rbf removed approx 44 of suspended solids range 17 76 and 35 of cod range 10 61 the nutrients removal efficiencies were variable and mainly affected by the characteristics of the wastewater for instance a large variation of the organic nitrogen removal was observed between 4 and 36 while phosphorus removal ranged between 4 and 6 the cod n reduced to 7 8 gcod gn but the removed cod was constituted by slowly biodegradable fraction therefore the effect on biological treatment may be negligible as reported by razafimanantsoa et al 2014 that observed similar denitrification rates using raw and sieved wastewater the suspended solids removal efficiency increased of 5 by means of mesh size reduction from 350 to 210 μm fig 2 a although the observed difference is not significant if standard deviations are taken into account when the mesh with dimension of 350 μm was employed the solid removal efficiency was 37 15 while with the other mesh the value was 42 11 the high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range and the set of data obtained using different meshes cannot be distinguished the variation of the efficiencies values is correlated more with the suspended solid concentrations influent rather than the change of the mesh size which is the same conclusion reported by rusten and lundar 2006 from bench scale tests the same authors reported that tss removal efficiency is mainly affected by hydraulic flow although in this work the relation between tss removal efficiency and the solid loading rate was more informative due to the high fluctuation of the wastewater characteristics fig 2b the threshold of 50 tss removal efficiency can be achieved operating with a tss loading rate higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h which represent a footprint more the ten times lower compared with the conventional primary clarifier metcalf and eddy 2014 finally the results of this study fitted with the model developed by behera et al 2018 fig 2a which explained that higher suspended solids concentration fosters the rate of cake formation over the filter mesh and consequently the removal of suspended solid with lower size 3 3 production of cellulosic primary sludge the characteristics of the cellulosic primary sludge are summarized in table s2 supplementary material the suspended solids concentration was the most variable parameter ranging between 21 and 73 g kg generally it was observed that higher tss concentration in the wastewater affected positively the thickness of the recovered cps on the other hand frequent overflow due to high solid loading rate or mesh clogging could reduce the solid content because of the fast belt rotation speed which does not allow the thickening of the sludge cake the ts concentration of the cps resulted from the sieving was quite constant during the experimental period table s2 supplementary material with 92 as volatile fraction which was significantly higher compared with the typical range 62 82 of conventional primary sludge from primary settling and 59 88 in secondary sludge liu et al 2016 miron et al 2000 wu et al 2010 metcalf the total solids showed a relatively high content in terms of cod 1501 mgo2 gts and low content of tkn from 16 to 22 mgn gts and phosphorus 1 7 4 7 mgp gts which were in the same range of the results reported in ghasimi et al 2015 the low presence of nutrients reflected by the cod n and cod p 55 mgcod mgn and 266 mgcod mgp respectively which confirmed that the cps was constituted by largest particulates like cellulose hemicellulose and lignin more than protein based compounds a further investigation on cps confirmed the high content of cellulose 41 ts and lignin 18 ts while lipids and proteins accounted for 9 and 13 of ts respectively the cps had a protein content lower than primary conventional sludge 17 28 ts while the lipids content was comparable 2 9 ts miron et al 2000 thangamani et al 2010 wu et al 2010 3 4 evaluation of the potential bio based vfas production the fermentation batch tests were carried out adjusting the ph of the cps to values between 8 and 11 and evaluating the effect of initial alkaline ph the ph profiles during the batch fig s2 supplementary material followed the bio based production which affected the activity of different microorganism groups operating the degradation of the organic matter the fermentation without ph adjustment determined a quick drop of ph which stabilized to 4 9 from day 1 and until the end of the batch tests operated with initial ph of 8 9 were still characterized by acidic values after one day of operation finally when the batch was accomplished at initial ph 10 the highest alkalinity allowed to maintain neutral ph for a week which were sub optimal conditions for hydrolytic activities jain et al 2015 on the other hand methanogenic bacteria are favored by sub alkaline ph but a weak growth could occur under acidic conditions leading the consumption of bio based vfas production feng et al 2009 the profile of the vfas concentration reflected the ph trends and showed that ph mainly affected the fermentation efficiencies the bio based vfas concentrations were comparable until the second day in all the tests since the differences were not significant and the small variations in bio based vfas content could be due to the sludge heterogeneity during days 3 and 4 the concentration of vfas gradually increased until the maximum value with exception of the test accomplished at initial ph 11 that reached highest concentration after day 9 fig 3 a as soon as the highest concentrations were achieved a reduction of the vfas was observed which is associated with an increase of the methanogenic activity dahiya et al 2015 as aerobic oxidation and accumulation of storage polymers can be excluded under these conditions the maximal concentration without the adjustment of ph was 7 8 gcod l yvfa of 232 mgcodvfa gvs as the acidogenic fermentation was limited by acidic ph it is well known that low ph increases the concentration of undissociated bio based vfas atkins and de paula 1990 that act as uncoupling compounds thus the microorganisms consume more energy for maintaining neutral ph inside the cell and reduce their performances imai and ohno 1995 verduyn et al 1992 the highest performances were obtained with initial ph 9 17 7 g cod l that corresponded to a vfas production yield of 521 mgcodvfa gvs the best performances under weak alkaline conditions can be explained by several factors such as the lower toxicity of undissociated forms of bio based vfas due to highest ph during the first days of fermentation and the enhanced hydrolysis process due to the alkaline ph which decrease the particle size lin and li 2018 and reduces both the degree of polymerization and cellulose crystallinity kim et al 2015 the size reduction is beneficial to the biodegradability because smaller particle sizes increase the available specific surface and improve microbial attachment and enzyme activity vavilin et al 2008 test with initial ph 11 was characterized by slow increase of bio based vfas concentration until day 9 related with decrease of ph value the enhanced hydrolysis due to the initial alkaline conditions was not followed by high bio based vfas concentration because the ph allowed the activity of methanogens that converts part of the vfas into methane on the other hand the acidogenesis has higher kinetics than methanogenesis resulting in an increase of vfas concentration and subsequent ph reduction as soon as the ph dropped to acidic value the methane production decreased progressively until complete inhibition while the vfas content continued to increase in general the main type of vfas observed in the fermentation liquid at the end were acetic propionic and butyric acids although a significant variation in the composition were observed according with the different initial ph the tests carried out with initial ph 6 6 9 showed a quick increase of propionic acid percentage that rise from 28 to 38 after 1 day to value higher than 48 after 3 days of fermentation the batches with stronger alkaline conditions were characterized by slower shift in the vfas composition when the maximal vfas concentration was detected day 4 for ph 10 and day 9 for ph 11 the most abundant vfas was acetic acid 39 and 37 and percentage of propionic acid increased in the subsequent days however reaching reach a comparable vfas composition to other batches 47 48 these results demonstrate that hydrolysis rate varied as a function of initial ph on the other hand the acidogenic bacteria population or degradation pathway were not affected indeed as soon as the stable acidic condition were reached the same vfas composition was observed the fig 3b show the bio based vfas distribution when maximal concentration was achieved while fig s3 supplementary material reported the complete profile of vfas observed during the fermentation batches wang et al 2019 demonstrated that chemical pre treatment of lignocellulose using cao2 destroyed substancially benzene rings and the double bonds consequentely the cellulose become more bio available for microbial hydrolysis and many small molecular organics were produced including two alcohol like substances two aldehyde like substances one ketone like substance five acid like substances and two ester like substances one of these intermediates was the lactic acid called also 2 hydroxypropanoic acid an organic acid which is produced by lactic acid bacteria from hexoses and pentoses as an anaerobic product of glycolysis abdel rahman et al 2013 which could drive the production of propionic acid during the acidogenesis stage chen et al 2013 therefore the propionic acid is one of the main vfas expected as fermentation product but its amount depends on environmental conditions in particular the stronger alkaline conditions could determine the reversible inactivation of vitamin b12 that is an important factor in the conversion of pyruvate to propionate huang et al 2018 and could explain the lower percentage of propionic acid at the beginning of tests with alkaline condition all the tests showed that maximum bio based vfas concentration was followed by a gradual decrease due to partial consumption of organic acids caused probably by methanogenesis which took place also at unfavorable conditions the consumption of bio based vfas indicated that choice of hrt was also important to maximize the yield the release of nutrients like ammonium and phosphorus was affected by both ph and hydraulic retention time phosphate concentration reached the maximal release after 7 days for all the condition however the concentration increased proportionally with the initial ph from 41 to 64 mg po4 p l in batches with uncontrolled ph and adjusted at ph 11 table 2 respectively the ammonium concentration increased along the tests which negatively affected the cod nh4 n ratio concurrent with the reduction of the bio based vfas at longer time of fermentation table 2 report the best performances reached with different initial ph considering both the concentration and the ratio between bio based vfas and nutrients cod nh4 n and cod po4 p ratios underline the importance to meet the compromise between bio based vfas production and nutrients release in particular the initial ph 8 led to lower bio based vfas concentration than using initial ph 9 but nitrogen release was significant lower resulting in a codvfa nh4 n of 172 mgcod mgn vand 105 mgcod mgn respectively finally the cost of the alkaline source used to control the initial ph should be taken into account because around 0 5 ml of naoh 30 per liter of cps must be used to increase 1 ph unit 3 5 sequencing batch fermentation reactor the best conditions observed from the batch test were applied in the sbfr which aimed at the evaluation of the bio based vfas productivity under real environmental conditions the application of batch configuration is often not economic feasible because leads to construction of a higher number of reactors with smaller dimension than one single sequencing batch fermentation the sbfr started with run1 applying an hrt of 6 days and feeding cps with vs concentration as high as 71 gvs kg thus the olr resulted of 17 7 kgvs m3d under these conditions the bio based vfas concentration was 8 37 mgcod l comparable to the value observed in the batch test without any ph control but the vfas production yield was lower 154 mgcodvfa g vs if compared with other studies crutchik et al 2018 li et al 2011 the behavior could be explained by the constant acidic ph which negatively affected the activity of the acidogenic bacteria table 3 although alkalinity was available in the liquor background of the cps it was not enough to cope the acidification due to the vfas formation propionic acid was the dominant vfas in the mixture which constituted the 46 of total bio based vfas while acetic acid accounted for 30 the specific yield in term of propionic acid was 70 mgcod g vs in agreement with results reported by crutchik et al 2018 that have operated using same conditions regarding the nutrients released the ammonium concentration in the fermentation liquid was 370 mgn l and the phosphate was 101 mgp l corresponding to release of 24 of n and 35 of p the acidification degree was 88 meaning that most of solubilized cod was converted into vfas consequently most of organic carbon in the liquid fraction can be directly used for denitrification considering the low vfas yields observed in run1 around 70 of batch value run 2 was carried out with longer hrt 14 d to evaluate how this parameter effected hydrolysis and vfas concentration the hrt was increased while olr decreased to 5 7 kgvs m3d the bio based vfas yield was 137 mgcodvfa gvs and the average vfas concentration was 8 79 mgcod l thus performance related to vfas did not change significantly from run1 and the longer hrt did not improve the hydrolysis on the other hand the acidification degree increased up to 94 indicating that almost all hydrolyzed cod was converted into bio based vfas thus longer hrt promoted the step of conversion of dissolved compounds into vfas the latter were composed mainly by acetic and propionic acids 30 and 52 respectively thus the specific yield in terms of propionic acid was 71 mgcod gvs the ammonium and phosphate concentrations were 290 mgn l and 70 mgp l and these values were slightly lower than those detected in run1 because of lower nutrients volumetric loading rates compared with run1 nlr and plr table 1 the nutrients released in run 1 were around 25 and 31 of the nitrogen and phosphorus influent which did not statistically differ p 0 05 details reported in supplementary information with run 2 during the run3 the ph was adjusted at 9 0 just before feeding while the hrt was decreased at 6 days which corresponded to an olr of 7 5 kgcod m3d the liquid fraction of pre treated sludge showed that soluble cod was three times greater than raw cps while bio based vfas concentration did not change on the other hand the ph increase determined a partial precipitation of phosphate the bio based vfas and propionic acid yields increased significantly in the reactor 322 and 164 mgcodvfa gvs respectively during run 3 despite the maximum values 400 mgcodvfa gvs were often observed when feeding was interrupted during the week end which gave longer retention to convert soluble compounds into vfas the propionic and acetic acids constituted the 51 and 28 of total bio based vfas thus the profile of organic acids was not affected by initial ph of sludge confirming the batch insight with respect to cod mass balance initial alkaline ph allowed the solubilization of 24 of the particulate cod and the overall balance closed with an error lower than 10 that can be explained with the neglected methane production as compared with run 3 the run 1 and run 2 showed a solubilization of 9 and 8 of fed cod respectively while the balance closed with similar error indicating that the lose due to gas emission were not affected by hrt or initial ph the acidic ph determined the dissolution of precipitated nutrients and overall releases were quantified as 40 of n and 51 of p value higher than other operations p 0 05 however the lower loading rate values table 1 determined concentrations comparable to run2 232 mgn l and 68 mgp l although the yscfa were similar in run1 and run2 operating at hrt of 6 days allowed the achievement of a productivity of 1 23 kgcodvfa m3d the average characteristics of the cps fermentation liquid and process performances were resumed in table 2s supplementary material the concentrations of bio based vfas depended on initial ph and the consequent yield but also the cps solids concentration affected the final content thus the concentration in run 3 could have been further increased using higher olr considering the average vs content of cps during the overall experimentation 44 7 gvs kg and the operational conditions the potential vfas concentration could increase up to 14 4 gcod l resulting in a volumetric productivity of 2 57 kgcod m3 d of bio based vfas 3 6 economical assessment a cost benefit analysis of the cps biorefinery was performed by comparing the main revenues and related cost and potential savings due to valorization of recovered resources like methane and vfa three different scenarios were considered which differ by the type of valorization of cps and the recovery pathway of the vfas produced from the acidogenic fermentation table 4 specifically the scenario 1 s1 can be considered as reference as the cps is completely valorized to biogas methane through anaerobic digestion while the carbon source for biological nutrients removal is supplied from the market as acetic acid the scenario 2 s2 introduced the acidogenic fermentation of cps while vfas after solid liquid separation could replace the use of external carbon source e g acetic acid for the bnr process finally scenario3 s3 considered the utilization of vfas as carbon source for pha production through the process described by frison et al 2015a 2015b fig 4 resumes the economic evaluations splitted as revenues and main associated costs derived from the integration of the rbf and acidogenic fermentation in a wwtp in the s1 the amount of ch4 that can be obtained from 1 ton ts of cps is around 310 m3 corresponding to an electrical energy of around 1150 kwh through a combined heat and power chp unit considering 38 of electrical energy efficiency assuming a selling price of 0 16 kwh the electrical energy accounts for 185 ton of ts that could be considered as the unique saving of this configuration when the electricity is used for internal consumption to partially fulfill the needs of the wwtps on the other hand this scenario includes the utilization external carbon source for the biological removal of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus released in the anaerobic digester which increase the operational costs due to the supply of acetic acid market price around 450 ton icis intelligent commodity intelligent services and the related cost for disposal of surplus sludge production the latter accounts for 32 ton ts considering 100 ton of sludge disposed at 25 of dry matter the difference between the revenues for the utilization of the methane and operational costs was positive 53 ton ts according to the best operating conditions found in this work the production of vfas from cps for the s2 and s3 could achieve 311 kgcod ton ts that can replace the external acetic acid addition and avoid the production and disposal of surplus sludge the equivalent cod as vfas corresponds to 96 ton ts as cost avoided for the purchase of external carbon source in s1 the diversion of organic matter in the sludge line with vfas recovery leads the reduction of methane from the anaerobic digester by around 30 which affects the revenues due to the production of electricity the sfbr could be maintained under mesophilic condition using the surplus heat from methane combustion in chp without affect significantly in the electricity and heat consumption on the other hands the cps conditioning to ph 9 needs the addition of alkali while the solid liquid separation of the fermentation liquid fraction enriched of vfas requires polyelectrolite dosage therefore the cost for chemical consumption has been calculated based on naoh and polyelectrolite consumption 10 g naoh gts fermented and 35 g of polyelectrolite kgts separated which accounted for 48 ton ts almost 80 of the total cost in s2 however the replace of external carbon source with bio based vfas leads to positive benefits of 67 ton ts which is 20 higher than s1 the s3 considered the conversion of the bio based vfas into pha according with a production yield of 0 11 kgcodpha kgcodvfa found at lab scale by frison et al 2015a 2015b resulting in 25 kg of pha per ton of ts treated with nitrogen removal the valorization of the vfas to phas increased the potential revenue up to 90 ton ts treated due their selling price between 2 2 and 5 kgpha valentino et al 2017 although a real market is not established yet considering the potential value from the methane the potential revenue in s3 were 218 ton ss if the cost for the extraction and purification of pha is assumed to be 2 kg of pha recovered according with literature mudliar et al 2008 leong et al 2017 the net revenue would still be positive and it would reach 95 kg ts treated which is significantly higher than s1 also the latter represents the most cost effective pathway of valorization of vfas and agreed with the results reported in kleerebezem et al 2015 despite the most relevant costs associated with the bioprocess and downstream were considered in this work 4 conclusions the pilot scale rbf was applied for the sieving of municipal wastewater with a tss content of 197 mg tss l and the best performances were reached operating with a solid loading rate higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h without any influence by mesh porosity the tss removal efficiency was 44 while the cps had a ts content of 48 6 gts kg with 92 constituted by organic matter the batch fermentation showed a positive impact of sludge ph conditioning ph 9 on acidogenic fermentation with potential bio based vfa yield that increased from 232 to 521 mg bio based vfa gvs due to the faster hydrolysis of organic matter where propionic acid accounted for about 50 of total bio based vfa on the other hand ph higher than 9 determined a delay in vfas accumulation because of methanogenic activity and partial consumption of bio based vfa the effect of hrt and ph adjustment was evaluated by pilot scale sbfr operating with hrt of 6 and 14 days the longer hrt did not improve significantly the bio based vfa yield 134 154 mgcodvfa gvs but higher acidification degree was observed 94 while the adjustment of sludge ph to value of 9 improved the bio based vfa yield to 322 mgcodvfa gvs the nitrogen release increased from 24 to 40 when ph was adjusted and the resulted cod n ratio was 50 mgcod mgn which could be considered as a valid carbon source to support the biological nutrients removal process and pha production this operating condition allowed to obtain a vfas concentration up to 14 4 gcod l and a daily productivity of 2 57 kgcod m3 d the best average solid removal efficiency observed during the operation of the rbf and the optimized operational conditions in sbfr were considered for the evaluation of a preliminary economical assessment the integration of rbf and acidogenic fermentation for vfas production from cps combine both benefits due to the diversion of organic matter in the sidestream treatment line for methane and bio based vfas production specifically the utilization of vfas from cps as carbon source could be a good option to replace the dosage of external carbon source and enhance the bnr process in existing wwtp on the other hand the highest net benefits were found when vfas are valorized to phas although their current selling price extraction and purification costs are still under debate due to the lack of an actual market of pha bioplastics from wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18061,this study combined at pilot scale the recovery of cellulosic primary sludge from the sieving of municipal wastewater followed by the production of bio based vfas through acidogenic fermentation the sieving of municipal wastewater was accomplished by a rotating belt filter which allowed the removal of around 50 of suspended solids when operated at solids loading rates higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h the solids recovered by sieving contained around 40 of cellulose which is a suitable raw material for the production of bio based vfas initially fermentation batch tests of cellulosic primary sludge were carried out adjusting the initial ph of the sludge at values of 8 9 10 and 11 in order to evaluate the best production yields of bio based vfas and their composition the highest vfas yield achieved was 521 mgcodvfa gvs occurring when ph was adjusted at 9 while propionic acid reached 51 of the total vfas then the optimal conditions were applied at long term in a sequencing batch fermentation reactor where the highest potential productivity of bio based vfas 2 57 kg cod m3 d was obtained by adjusting the ph feeding at 9 and operating with an hydraulic retention time of 6 days under mesophilic conditions the cost benefit analyses for the implementation of cellulosic primary sludge recovery was carried out consideringthe anaerobic digestion as reference scenario the economical assessment showed that the production of bio based vfas from cellulosic primary sludge as carbon source and or as chemical precursors give higher net benefits instead of the only biogas production graphical abstract image 1 keywords cellulosic primary sludge rotating belt filter acidogenic fermentation volatile fatty acids water resource recovery facility 1 introduction since more than 100 years activated sludge process has been considered an effective technology to remove oxygen demanding compounds cod and nutrients n p from wastewater despite the high electrical energy consumption and generation of greenhouse gas emissions ghgs which contribute to the climate change maktabifard et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 currently the role of wastewater treatment plants wwpts is no longer merely evaluated based on the effluent quality materials to recover energy and resources embedded in wastewater to improve the sustainability of the water sector towards circular economy van der hoek et al 2016 wang et al 2015 water is the first type of resource to recover for multiple uses while the wastewater organics can be upgraded to reusable materials such as cellulose methane or biopolymers resource recovery cluster 2015 the spreading of this approach contributes to rebrand wwtps into water resource recovery facilities wrrfs and to develop new processes combining existing systems with innovative technologies nevertheless the use of concentrated streams has been reported as a successful strategy for resource recovery by verstraete et al 2009 thus making raw wastewater not suitable for this purpose due to its dilution rate the rotating belt filter rbf is a primary treatment aiming the mechanical removal and concentration of larger suspended solid by cake filtration and sieving of the wastewater several studies demonstrated the benefits of this system compared with conventional primary clarifiers like lower footprint reduction of the overall organic loading rate in the biological reactor mainly due to slowly biodegradable cod which contributes to the mitigation of co2 eq emission by 36 paulsrud et al 2014 franchi and santoro 2015 in addition the sludge produced using the rbf is enriched in toilet paper fibers which enables the recovery of marketable cellulosic fiber from cellulosic primary sludge cps as demonstrated by cirtec which implemented cellvation technology in geestmerambacht wwtp akyol et al 2019 the final product called recell is a valuable raw material suitable for different industrial sectors like construction paper and board coatings and sustainable chemicals the recovered cellulose is already used as asphalt additive or could replaces pure cellulose in hydraulic lime based mortars palmieri et al 2019 moreover zhou et al 2019 developed a compatible sludge cellulose plastic composite including recovered cps and demonstrated that the produced biocomposite had 15 lower manufacturing costs than conventional one and it was 5 more eco efficient than wood plastic composite despite the anaerobic digestion of cps gains 20 higher biogas production compared with conventional primary sludge ghasimi et al 2016 the overall revenues are limited by the low value of the methane in market the bio based volatile fatty acids vfas represent a higher added value product because of their economic price and wide range of application indeed the vfas are a suitable carbon source for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process or can be used as chemical precursors for a number of applications oehmen et al 2007 lee et al 2014 longo et al 2017 bhatia and yang 2017 the great number of studies dealing with acidogenic fermentation of sewage sludge during the last decade atasoy et al 2018 showed the increase of interest for bio based vfas production within wrrf and the feasibility to valorize the organic matter through this bioprocess crutchik et al 2018 investigated the effect of ph and temperature on vfas production from a simulated cps constituted by a mixture of primary sludge and toilet paper the highest bio based vfas yield was obtained with an initial ph of 8 under mesophilic conditions 254 mgcodvfa gvss the vfa concentration in the liquid fraction 14 18 gcod l and the dominant species were acetic and propionic acid consequently to these findings the examination of the combination of rbf and acidogenic fermentation to evaluate its potential exploitation this study investigated at pilot scale and under real environmental conditions the integration of rbf with the acidogenic fermentation of cps for the conversion of slowly biodegradable cod into bio based vfas as chemical precursors for this purpose the vfas productivities were evaluated in a pilot sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr under different retention times and ph according with preliminary batch test finally the observed performances were employed to analyze and compare three pathways of cps i production of methane through anaerobic digestion ii production of bio based vfas as supplementary carbon source for bnr process iii production of bio based vfas as chemical precursors for polyhydroxyalkanoates pha recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characterization municipal wastewater was characterized in terms of ph total alkalinity total and volatile suspended solid total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod total kijendhal and ammonium nitrogen total phosphorus and phosphate according to of standard methods american public health association et al 1999 granulometric distribution was evaluated on 24 hours composite samples using sieving on meshes with porosity of 350 210 158 90 and 54 μm as described by rusten and lundar 2006 2 2 wastewater sieving by pilot rotating belt filter the cellulosic primary sludge was produced by the sieving of around 400 m3 day of municipal wastewater from carbonera wwtp treviso north of italy collected after a coarse bar screening 3 mm and grit removal of the main wwtp line the wastewater sieving was accomplished through a rotating belt filter type sf1000 salsnes filter sa norway with a flow capacity up to 15 l s and a submerged sieve cloth area of 0 24 m2 the experiments have been carried out using two mesh sizes 350 and 210 μm in order to evaluate how this parameter affects the suspended solids removal efficiency different flow rates were applied in the range between 8 and 11 l s while higher values determined overflows of the wastewater not providing reliable performances the belt rotation speed was controlled by a pid model control in order to maintain a constant liquid level 210 mm while the inclination of the belt was kept constant at 30 a sludge layer formed on the mesh surface which consequently retained smaller particles than the mesh pore size of the belt improving the tss removal efficiency the rbf was embedded with a cleaning system made up of an air knife and compressed hot water to remove the residual sludge cake from the belt the cps produced was discontinuously fed in a sequencing batch fermentation reactor through a volumetric pump described in section 2 4 while the sieved wastewater was discharged and recirculated in the headworks of the wwtp two autosamplers collected the influent and effluent at regular intervals every 5 min to obtain representative samples for their characterization and calculation of the mass balances 2 3 batch fermentation tests around 10 l of cps was collected from rbf and investigated through batch fermentation tests in duplicate glass bottles with working and total volume of 0 7 and 1 2 l respectively the bottles were placed in a temperature controlled air chamber at 37 c mesophilic condition was chosen due to the positive results reported by crutchik et al 2018 indeed thermophilic or hyper thermophilic temperature had a detrimental effect on total bio based vfas production however differently from the authors in this work real cps was evaluated under batch conditions the role of initial ph was investigated using raw cps ph around 6 6 and changing the ph of substrate by adding naoh 30 solution to obtain an initial ph of 8 9 10 and 11 the ph of the sludge was not controlled during the fermentation and mixing was operated manually twice per day the process was monitored for two weeks collecting around 50 ml of sludge per day then the samples were centrifuged and the liquid fraction was characterized in terms of ph soluble cod bio based vfas concentration and composition ammonium and phosphate content the performances at different ph were quantified as maximal bio based vfas yields yvfa that corresponds to ratio between produced bio based vfas and fed vs equation 1 1 vfa yield mgcod gvs cod vfa max cod vfa t 0 vs fed where codvfa t0 and codvfa max were respectively the initial vfas concentration and the concentration at the time where the highest value was observed while vsfed was the concentration of volatile solid of the cps 2 4 sequencing batch fermentation reactor the acidogenic fermentation of the cps was carried out in a pilot scale sequencing batch fermentation reactor sbfr of 2 6 m3 of working volume the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 37 c using an electrical heating system located on the internal wall of the reactor the reactor was initially filled with cps and the feeding of the reactor was accomplished during 5 days per week by discharging a volume of fermented cps from the reactor and replacing the same amount with cps directly pumped from the rbf the volumetric exchange ratio was fixed at 25 or 10 corresponding to an average hrt of 6 and 14 days respectively table 1 the organic loading rate was affected by the flow rate and average inlet ts concentration as reported in table 1 each operational condition was tested for at least 3 hrts and under steady state conditions the reactor was mixed using a grinder pump installed at the bottom of the tank aiming the reduction of the particle sizes and continuous recycling the treated sludge at the top of the reactor the effluent from the sbfr was collected and analyzed three times per week to evaluate the fermentation performances the raw samples were used to determine the total and volatile solids content while an amount of sample was centrifuged to characterize the liquid fraction soluble cod and bio based vfas were analyzed to calculate the bio based vfas yields and the composition of soluble organic matter the acidification degree was determined by dividing the concentration of bio based vfas huang et al 2018 by the concentration of soluble cod at the same retention time equation 2 2 acidification degree cod vfa soluble cod ammonium and phosphate concentration in the liquid fraction nh4 nlf and po4 p lf were measured to estimate the nutrient release and their potential recovery phosphorus and ammonium releases was calculated according to equations 3 and 4 where tkncps and tpcps represents the total content in the fed sludge 3 nh 4 n release nh 4 n lf tkn cps 4 po 4 p release po 4 p lf tp cps the significance of average performances reached under different operational conditions was analyzed using one way anova and tukey post hoc test with a significance threshold level of 5 p 0 05 the statistical analysis was conducted using microsofts excel xlstat pro version 7 2 2003 usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics composite discrete samples were collected and analyzed in order to represents the average characteristics of wastewater over the experimental periods the average characteristics table s1 of the influent wastewater in carbonera wwtp during the experimental period were 197 mg tss l 391 mg cod l 38 mg tkn l with 82 due to ammonium 5 8 mgp l 67 phosphate the cod n ratio was 10 3 gcod gn while the content of cellulose accounted for 18 lower than the percentage reported by other studies 35 tss ruiken et al 2013 the particulate distribution had the typical profile showed by rusten and lundar 2006 where most of the particulate material was either larger than 350 μm or smaller than 54 μm fig 1 ravndal et al 2018 showed that the larger fraction is generally composed by carbohydrates and slowly biodegradable organic matter while the fraction with dimension 54 μm has a higher content of proteins and fat materials the effect of the mesh porosity on the tss and cod removal efficiency using static sieve was reported in supplementary material fig 1s council directive 91 271 eec defines that a primary treatment must be able to reduce 20 of bod5 and to remove 50 of suspended solids the preliminary results showed that the required tss removal efficiency can be met using a 54 μm opening mesh if a cake is not formed during filtration regarding the requirement for bod5 removal equivalent to 25 removal of cod rusten and lundar 2006 it could be easier achieved using a 210 μm mesh on the other hand rusten and lundar 2006 reported that if the percentage of tss with dimension larger than mesh porosity is higher than 20 the cake formation occurs and leads to an increasing efficiency corresponding to a mesh with smaller porosity basing on base of wastewater characteristics a mesh with opening dimension of 350 μm can be used and the cake formation is expected previous studies reported that particulate fraction 0 65 μm had higher cod n and cod p ratio than colloidal polymeric oligomeric and monomeric fraction because of the abundance of macromolecules without nitrogen or phosphorous atoms e g cellulose starch and lignin in the large particulate fractions ravndal et al 2018 in particular a former study demonstrated that fraction with size 100 μm had a content of carbohydrates ranging between 70 and 100 of total cod due to toilet paper residues ruiken et al 2013 the biodegradability of the larger solid fraction is limited by particle breakup dimock and morgenroth 2006 indeed the surface area to volume ratio of particles was lower than in smaller fraction hence substrate availability is proportionally inverse to the particle size this explanation was confirmed by ravndal et al 2018 that observed that the largest particle fractions of wastewater was characterized by slowly biodegradable cod 3 2 rbf performances the rbf operated with a belt mesh size of 350 and 210 μm under two different periods meshes while the flow rates varied between 8 and 11 l s the rbf removed approx 44 of suspended solids range 17 76 and 35 of cod range 10 61 the nutrients removal efficiencies were variable and mainly affected by the characteristics of the wastewater for instance a large variation of the organic nitrogen removal was observed between 4 and 36 while phosphorus removal ranged between 4 and 6 the cod n reduced to 7 8 gcod gn but the removed cod was constituted by slowly biodegradable fraction therefore the effect on biological treatment may be negligible as reported by razafimanantsoa et al 2014 that observed similar denitrification rates using raw and sieved wastewater the suspended solids removal efficiency increased of 5 by means of mesh size reduction from 350 to 210 μm fig 2 a although the observed difference is not significant if standard deviations are taken into account when the mesh with dimension of 350 μm was employed the solid removal efficiency was 37 15 while with the other mesh the value was 42 11 the high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range and the set of data obtained using different meshes cannot be distinguished the variation of the efficiencies values is correlated more with the suspended solid concentrations influent rather than the change of the mesh size which is the same conclusion reported by rusten and lundar 2006 from bench scale tests the same authors reported that tss removal efficiency is mainly affected by hydraulic flow although in this work the relation between tss removal efficiency and the solid loading rate was more informative due to the high fluctuation of the wastewater characteristics fig 2b the threshold of 50 tss removal efficiency can be achieved operating with a tss loading rate higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h which represent a footprint more the ten times lower compared with the conventional primary clarifier metcalf and eddy 2014 finally the results of this study fitted with the model developed by behera et al 2018 fig 2a which explained that higher suspended solids concentration fosters the rate of cake formation over the filter mesh and consequently the removal of suspended solid with lower size 3 3 production of cellulosic primary sludge the characteristics of the cellulosic primary sludge are summarized in table s2 supplementary material the suspended solids concentration was the most variable parameter ranging between 21 and 73 g kg generally it was observed that higher tss concentration in the wastewater affected positively the thickness of the recovered cps on the other hand frequent overflow due to high solid loading rate or mesh clogging could reduce the solid content because of the fast belt rotation speed which does not allow the thickening of the sludge cake the ts concentration of the cps resulted from the sieving was quite constant during the experimental period table s2 supplementary material with 92 as volatile fraction which was significantly higher compared with the typical range 62 82 of conventional primary sludge from primary settling and 59 88 in secondary sludge liu et al 2016 miron et al 2000 wu et al 2010 metcalf the total solids showed a relatively high content in terms of cod 1501 mgo2 gts and low content of tkn from 16 to 22 mgn gts and phosphorus 1 7 4 7 mgp gts which were in the same range of the results reported in ghasimi et al 2015 the low presence of nutrients reflected by the cod n and cod p 55 mgcod mgn and 266 mgcod mgp respectively which confirmed that the cps was constituted by largest particulates like cellulose hemicellulose and lignin more than protein based compounds a further investigation on cps confirmed the high content of cellulose 41 ts and lignin 18 ts while lipids and proteins accounted for 9 and 13 of ts respectively the cps had a protein content lower than primary conventional sludge 17 28 ts while the lipids content was comparable 2 9 ts miron et al 2000 thangamani et al 2010 wu et al 2010 3 4 evaluation of the potential bio based vfas production the fermentation batch tests were carried out adjusting the ph of the cps to values between 8 and 11 and evaluating the effect of initial alkaline ph the ph profiles during the batch fig s2 supplementary material followed the bio based production which affected the activity of different microorganism groups operating the degradation of the organic matter the fermentation without ph adjustment determined a quick drop of ph which stabilized to 4 9 from day 1 and until the end of the batch tests operated with initial ph of 8 9 were still characterized by acidic values after one day of operation finally when the batch was accomplished at initial ph 10 the highest alkalinity allowed to maintain neutral ph for a week which were sub optimal conditions for hydrolytic activities jain et al 2015 on the other hand methanogenic bacteria are favored by sub alkaline ph but a weak growth could occur under acidic conditions leading the consumption of bio based vfas production feng et al 2009 the profile of the vfas concentration reflected the ph trends and showed that ph mainly affected the fermentation efficiencies the bio based vfas concentrations were comparable until the second day in all the tests since the differences were not significant and the small variations in bio based vfas content could be due to the sludge heterogeneity during days 3 and 4 the concentration of vfas gradually increased until the maximum value with exception of the test accomplished at initial ph 11 that reached highest concentration after day 9 fig 3 a as soon as the highest concentrations were achieved a reduction of the vfas was observed which is associated with an increase of the methanogenic activity dahiya et al 2015 as aerobic oxidation and accumulation of storage polymers can be excluded under these conditions the maximal concentration without the adjustment of ph was 7 8 gcod l yvfa of 232 mgcodvfa gvs as the acidogenic fermentation was limited by acidic ph it is well known that low ph increases the concentration of undissociated bio based vfas atkins and de paula 1990 that act as uncoupling compounds thus the microorganisms consume more energy for maintaining neutral ph inside the cell and reduce their performances imai and ohno 1995 verduyn et al 1992 the highest performances were obtained with initial ph 9 17 7 g cod l that corresponded to a vfas production yield of 521 mgcodvfa gvs the best performances under weak alkaline conditions can be explained by several factors such as the lower toxicity of undissociated forms of bio based vfas due to highest ph during the first days of fermentation and the enhanced hydrolysis process due to the alkaline ph which decrease the particle size lin and li 2018 and reduces both the degree of polymerization and cellulose crystallinity kim et al 2015 the size reduction is beneficial to the biodegradability because smaller particle sizes increase the available specific surface and improve microbial attachment and enzyme activity vavilin et al 2008 test with initial ph 11 was characterized by slow increase of bio based vfas concentration until day 9 related with decrease of ph value the enhanced hydrolysis due to the initial alkaline conditions was not followed by high bio based vfas concentration because the ph allowed the activity of methanogens that converts part of the vfas into methane on the other hand the acidogenesis has higher kinetics than methanogenesis resulting in an increase of vfas concentration and subsequent ph reduction as soon as the ph dropped to acidic value the methane production decreased progressively until complete inhibition while the vfas content continued to increase in general the main type of vfas observed in the fermentation liquid at the end were acetic propionic and butyric acids although a significant variation in the composition were observed according with the different initial ph the tests carried out with initial ph 6 6 9 showed a quick increase of propionic acid percentage that rise from 28 to 38 after 1 day to value higher than 48 after 3 days of fermentation the batches with stronger alkaline conditions were characterized by slower shift in the vfas composition when the maximal vfas concentration was detected day 4 for ph 10 and day 9 for ph 11 the most abundant vfas was acetic acid 39 and 37 and percentage of propionic acid increased in the subsequent days however reaching reach a comparable vfas composition to other batches 47 48 these results demonstrate that hydrolysis rate varied as a function of initial ph on the other hand the acidogenic bacteria population or degradation pathway were not affected indeed as soon as the stable acidic condition were reached the same vfas composition was observed the fig 3b show the bio based vfas distribution when maximal concentration was achieved while fig s3 supplementary material reported the complete profile of vfas observed during the fermentation batches wang et al 2019 demonstrated that chemical pre treatment of lignocellulose using cao2 destroyed substancially benzene rings and the double bonds consequentely the cellulose become more bio available for microbial hydrolysis and many small molecular organics were produced including two alcohol like substances two aldehyde like substances one ketone like substance five acid like substances and two ester like substances one of these intermediates was the lactic acid called also 2 hydroxypropanoic acid an organic acid which is produced by lactic acid bacteria from hexoses and pentoses as an anaerobic product of glycolysis abdel rahman et al 2013 which could drive the production of propionic acid during the acidogenesis stage chen et al 2013 therefore the propionic acid is one of the main vfas expected as fermentation product but its amount depends on environmental conditions in particular the stronger alkaline conditions could determine the reversible inactivation of vitamin b12 that is an important factor in the conversion of pyruvate to propionate huang et al 2018 and could explain the lower percentage of propionic acid at the beginning of tests with alkaline condition all the tests showed that maximum bio based vfas concentration was followed by a gradual decrease due to partial consumption of organic acids caused probably by methanogenesis which took place also at unfavorable conditions the consumption of bio based vfas indicated that choice of hrt was also important to maximize the yield the release of nutrients like ammonium and phosphorus was affected by both ph and hydraulic retention time phosphate concentration reached the maximal release after 7 days for all the condition however the concentration increased proportionally with the initial ph from 41 to 64 mg po4 p l in batches with uncontrolled ph and adjusted at ph 11 table 2 respectively the ammonium concentration increased along the tests which negatively affected the cod nh4 n ratio concurrent with the reduction of the bio based vfas at longer time of fermentation table 2 report the best performances reached with different initial ph considering both the concentration and the ratio between bio based vfas and nutrients cod nh4 n and cod po4 p ratios underline the importance to meet the compromise between bio based vfas production and nutrients release in particular the initial ph 8 led to lower bio based vfas concentration than using initial ph 9 but nitrogen release was significant lower resulting in a codvfa nh4 n of 172 mgcod mgn vand 105 mgcod mgn respectively finally the cost of the alkaline source used to control the initial ph should be taken into account because around 0 5 ml of naoh 30 per liter of cps must be used to increase 1 ph unit 3 5 sequencing batch fermentation reactor the best conditions observed from the batch test were applied in the sbfr which aimed at the evaluation of the bio based vfas productivity under real environmental conditions the application of batch configuration is often not economic feasible because leads to construction of a higher number of reactors with smaller dimension than one single sequencing batch fermentation the sbfr started with run1 applying an hrt of 6 days and feeding cps with vs concentration as high as 71 gvs kg thus the olr resulted of 17 7 kgvs m3d under these conditions the bio based vfas concentration was 8 37 mgcod l comparable to the value observed in the batch test without any ph control but the vfas production yield was lower 154 mgcodvfa g vs if compared with other studies crutchik et al 2018 li et al 2011 the behavior could be explained by the constant acidic ph which negatively affected the activity of the acidogenic bacteria table 3 although alkalinity was available in the liquor background of the cps it was not enough to cope the acidification due to the vfas formation propionic acid was the dominant vfas in the mixture which constituted the 46 of total bio based vfas while acetic acid accounted for 30 the specific yield in term of propionic acid was 70 mgcod g vs in agreement with results reported by crutchik et al 2018 that have operated using same conditions regarding the nutrients released the ammonium concentration in the fermentation liquid was 370 mgn l and the phosphate was 101 mgp l corresponding to release of 24 of n and 35 of p the acidification degree was 88 meaning that most of solubilized cod was converted into vfas consequently most of organic carbon in the liquid fraction can be directly used for denitrification considering the low vfas yields observed in run1 around 70 of batch value run 2 was carried out with longer hrt 14 d to evaluate how this parameter effected hydrolysis and vfas concentration the hrt was increased while olr decreased to 5 7 kgvs m3d the bio based vfas yield was 137 mgcodvfa gvs and the average vfas concentration was 8 79 mgcod l thus performance related to vfas did not change significantly from run1 and the longer hrt did not improve the hydrolysis on the other hand the acidification degree increased up to 94 indicating that almost all hydrolyzed cod was converted into bio based vfas thus longer hrt promoted the step of conversion of dissolved compounds into vfas the latter were composed mainly by acetic and propionic acids 30 and 52 respectively thus the specific yield in terms of propionic acid was 71 mgcod gvs the ammonium and phosphate concentrations were 290 mgn l and 70 mgp l and these values were slightly lower than those detected in run1 because of lower nutrients volumetric loading rates compared with run1 nlr and plr table 1 the nutrients released in run 1 were around 25 and 31 of the nitrogen and phosphorus influent which did not statistically differ p 0 05 details reported in supplementary information with run 2 during the run3 the ph was adjusted at 9 0 just before feeding while the hrt was decreased at 6 days which corresponded to an olr of 7 5 kgcod m3d the liquid fraction of pre treated sludge showed that soluble cod was three times greater than raw cps while bio based vfas concentration did not change on the other hand the ph increase determined a partial precipitation of phosphate the bio based vfas and propionic acid yields increased significantly in the reactor 322 and 164 mgcodvfa gvs respectively during run 3 despite the maximum values 400 mgcodvfa gvs were often observed when feeding was interrupted during the week end which gave longer retention to convert soluble compounds into vfas the propionic and acetic acids constituted the 51 and 28 of total bio based vfas thus the profile of organic acids was not affected by initial ph of sludge confirming the batch insight with respect to cod mass balance initial alkaline ph allowed the solubilization of 24 of the particulate cod and the overall balance closed with an error lower than 10 that can be explained with the neglected methane production as compared with run 3 the run 1 and run 2 showed a solubilization of 9 and 8 of fed cod respectively while the balance closed with similar error indicating that the lose due to gas emission were not affected by hrt or initial ph the acidic ph determined the dissolution of precipitated nutrients and overall releases were quantified as 40 of n and 51 of p value higher than other operations p 0 05 however the lower loading rate values table 1 determined concentrations comparable to run2 232 mgn l and 68 mgp l although the yscfa were similar in run1 and run2 operating at hrt of 6 days allowed the achievement of a productivity of 1 23 kgcodvfa m3d the average characteristics of the cps fermentation liquid and process performances were resumed in table 2s supplementary material the concentrations of bio based vfas depended on initial ph and the consequent yield but also the cps solids concentration affected the final content thus the concentration in run 3 could have been further increased using higher olr considering the average vs content of cps during the overall experimentation 44 7 gvs kg and the operational conditions the potential vfas concentration could increase up to 14 4 gcod l resulting in a volumetric productivity of 2 57 kgcod m3 d of bio based vfas 3 6 economical assessment a cost benefit analysis of the cps biorefinery was performed by comparing the main revenues and related cost and potential savings due to valorization of recovered resources like methane and vfa three different scenarios were considered which differ by the type of valorization of cps and the recovery pathway of the vfas produced from the acidogenic fermentation table 4 specifically the scenario 1 s1 can be considered as reference as the cps is completely valorized to biogas methane through anaerobic digestion while the carbon source for biological nutrients removal is supplied from the market as acetic acid the scenario 2 s2 introduced the acidogenic fermentation of cps while vfas after solid liquid separation could replace the use of external carbon source e g acetic acid for the bnr process finally scenario3 s3 considered the utilization of vfas as carbon source for pha production through the process described by frison et al 2015a 2015b fig 4 resumes the economic evaluations splitted as revenues and main associated costs derived from the integration of the rbf and acidogenic fermentation in a wwtp in the s1 the amount of ch4 that can be obtained from 1 ton ts of cps is around 310 m3 corresponding to an electrical energy of around 1150 kwh through a combined heat and power chp unit considering 38 of electrical energy efficiency assuming a selling price of 0 16 kwh the electrical energy accounts for 185 ton of ts that could be considered as the unique saving of this configuration when the electricity is used for internal consumption to partially fulfill the needs of the wwtps on the other hand this scenario includes the utilization external carbon source for the biological removal of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus released in the anaerobic digester which increase the operational costs due to the supply of acetic acid market price around 450 ton icis intelligent commodity intelligent services and the related cost for disposal of surplus sludge production the latter accounts for 32 ton ts considering 100 ton of sludge disposed at 25 of dry matter the difference between the revenues for the utilization of the methane and operational costs was positive 53 ton ts according to the best operating conditions found in this work the production of vfas from cps for the s2 and s3 could achieve 311 kgcod ton ts that can replace the external acetic acid addition and avoid the production and disposal of surplus sludge the equivalent cod as vfas corresponds to 96 ton ts as cost avoided for the purchase of external carbon source in s1 the diversion of organic matter in the sludge line with vfas recovery leads the reduction of methane from the anaerobic digester by around 30 which affects the revenues due to the production of electricity the sfbr could be maintained under mesophilic condition using the surplus heat from methane combustion in chp without affect significantly in the electricity and heat consumption on the other hands the cps conditioning to ph 9 needs the addition of alkali while the solid liquid separation of the fermentation liquid fraction enriched of vfas requires polyelectrolite dosage therefore the cost for chemical consumption has been calculated based on naoh and polyelectrolite consumption 10 g naoh gts fermented and 35 g of polyelectrolite kgts separated which accounted for 48 ton ts almost 80 of the total cost in s2 however the replace of external carbon source with bio based vfas leads to positive benefits of 67 ton ts which is 20 higher than s1 the s3 considered the conversion of the bio based vfas into pha according with a production yield of 0 11 kgcodpha kgcodvfa found at lab scale by frison et al 2015a 2015b resulting in 25 kg of pha per ton of ts treated with nitrogen removal the valorization of the vfas to phas increased the potential revenue up to 90 ton ts treated due their selling price between 2 2 and 5 kgpha valentino et al 2017 although a real market is not established yet considering the potential value from the methane the potential revenue in s3 were 218 ton ss if the cost for the extraction and purification of pha is assumed to be 2 kg of pha recovered according with literature mudliar et al 2008 leong et al 2017 the net revenue would still be positive and it would reach 95 kg ts treated which is significantly higher than s1 also the latter represents the most cost effective pathway of valorization of vfas and agreed with the results reported in kleerebezem et al 2015 despite the most relevant costs associated with the bioprocess and downstream were considered in this work 4 conclusions the pilot scale rbf was applied for the sieving of municipal wastewater with a tss content of 197 mg tss l and the best performances were reached operating with a solid loading rate higher than 30 35 kgtss m2 h without any influence by mesh porosity the tss removal efficiency was 44 while the cps had a ts content of 48 6 gts kg with 92 constituted by organic matter the batch fermentation showed a positive impact of sludge ph conditioning ph 9 on acidogenic fermentation with potential bio based vfa yield that increased from 232 to 521 mg bio based vfa gvs due to the faster hydrolysis of organic matter where propionic acid accounted for about 50 of total bio based vfa on the other hand ph higher than 9 determined a delay in vfas accumulation because of methanogenic activity and partial consumption of bio based vfa the effect of hrt and ph adjustment was evaluated by pilot scale sbfr operating with hrt of 6 and 14 days the longer hrt did not improve significantly the bio based vfa yield 134 154 mgcodvfa gvs but higher acidification degree was observed 94 while the adjustment of sludge ph to value of 9 improved the bio based vfa yield to 322 mgcodvfa gvs the nitrogen release increased from 24 to 40 when ph was adjusted and the resulted cod n ratio was 50 mgcod mgn which could be considered as a valid carbon source to support the biological nutrients removal process and pha production this operating condition allowed to obtain a vfas concentration up to 14 4 gcod l and a daily productivity of 2 57 kgcod m3 d the best average solid removal efficiency observed during the operation of the rbf and the optimized operational conditions in sbfr were considered for the evaluation of a preliminary economical assessment the integration of rbf and acidogenic fermentation for vfas production from cps combine both benefits due to the diversion of organic matter in the sidestream treatment line for methane and bio based vfas production specifically the utilization of vfas from cps as carbon source could be a good option to replace the dosage of external carbon source and enhance the bnr process in existing wwtp on the other hand the highest net benefits were found when vfas are valorized to phas although their current selling price extraction and purification costs are still under debate due to the lack of an actual market of pha bioplastics from wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

amongst others contaminants and transient microorganisms from different sources such as hospital domestic and animal breeding effluents grenni et al 2018 karkman et al 2018 in addition to antibiotics use other human activities may inadvertently promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb including chlorination performed during drinking water treatment although it is still controversial lin et al 2016 shi et al 2013 some studies indicate that selective pressure imposed on bacterial populations by these substances can favor the proliferation of arb and args in these conditions the expression and horizontal gene transfer hgt of args can be triggered with potentially undesirable effects for human health and the environment stressing the importance of tracking the environmental resistance previous studies have demonstrated an increase in args shi et al 2013 allen et al 2010 grenni et al 2018 xu et al 2016 and in some pathogens frequencies such as pseudomonas and sphingomonas jia et al 2015 after water disinfection and distribution moreover studies based on shotgun metagenomics and 16s rrna gene deep sequencing have also revealed that even high quality drinking water can contain clinically relevant taxa which have been associated with multidrug resistance such as acinetobacter and staphylococcus dias et al 2018 for example in a study comprising 12 cities in china and singapore ma et al 2019 265 args were observed mainly related to multidrug bacitracin beta lactams and aminoglycosides resistance as well as pathogens of pseudomonas legionella and acinetobacter genera among others an important phenomenon related to arb in drinking water is their persistence and increase in the distribution system in which disinfectant agents can be at sublethal concentrations proliferation of resistant pathogens in the pipelines can pose a risk to health principally in clinical settings indeed kinsey et al 2017 reported an outbreak of pseudomonas aeruginosa in a neonatal intensive care unit associated with contaminated tap water and many similar reports can be found in the literature as reviewed by gordon et al 2017 given the extensive impacts that antibiotic resistance has on the environment and human health monitoring the resistome in different environments including drinking water becomes a need despite the intense efforts of the scientific community there are still considerable uncertainties associated with the connection between resistance in environmental and clinical settings and also with the effects of water treatment on bacterial community and resistance determinants thus this research intends to contribute to the understanding of args diversity by exploring through shotgun

plant dwtp with a mean flow rate of 7 000l s at minas gerais state brazil to explore the effects of water passage through the distribution system on the resistome and bacterial community a tap water tw sample was collected at the dependencies of the universidade federal de minas gerais minas gerais brazil 20 l of each type of water were sampled and 4 20 l filtrated separately through sterilized 0 22 μm membranes millipore usa at the point of sampling the river is classified as class 2 according to the instituto mineiro de gestão das águas igam 2013 which means its waters are suitable for human consumption after conventional treatment conama 357 2005 in order to investigate the resistome in a clinical setting dialysate ultrafiltration membranes um from a hospital dialysis unit minas gerais brazil were collected for that three sealed tubes containing the membranes were opened aseptically and 1g of each was retrieved for dna extraction pooled together prior to library construction all samples were stored at 20 c until further analysis the ultrafiltration membranes filter the dialysate which is a mixture of purified water and commercial sterile electrolytes solutions being the last barrier against contamination in patients undergoing dialysis the water used in this solution is previously submitted to filtration in 5 μm and charcoal filters and a final step of reverse osmosis due to its high purity the volume necessary to obtain sufficient biological material for analysis would be very large the dialysate filtration membranes in its turn filter on average 28 000 l of solution during the period of three months 500 ml min in three cycles of 4 h day throughout 78 days sundays are not included being discarded after that despite the differences in um compared to the other samples this strategy allowed a deeper investigation of the occurrence and the risks posed by args and arb in the studied clinical environment 2 2 dna extraction library construction and sequencing total dna of each sample was extracted with zymobiomics dna miniprep kit zymo research usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and its concentration and quality assessed with qubit fluorometer and nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa respectively libraries construction was performed with illumina nextera dna flex library prep kit generating 500 bp

wood et al 2019 wood and salzberg 2014 and visualized with pavian breitwieser and salzberg 2016 venn diagram was created with venny oliveiros 2007 to explore the putative associations of resistance determinants with mobile genetic elements mges args carrying contigs were blasted against sequences of plasmids refseq ncbi integron cassettes integrall moura et al 2009 and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements ices iceberg database bi et al 2012 only alignments with an e value 1e 5 coverage 60 and 85 nucleotide identity were included an arg was considered associated with mges if embedded in a contig that aligned significantly with any of these databases additionally taxonomic assignment of these contigs was performed against 1148 annotated prokaryote genomes of refseq ncbi database using raiphy with default parameters nalbantoglu et al 2011 considering that the metagenomic dataset obtained from um indicated halomonas as the dominant genus a draft genome was assembled in order to further explore its resistome and virulome for that all um reads were aligned to halomonas reference sequences in refseq ncbi the aligned reads went through a de novo assembly with spades bankevich et al 2012 gene prediction was performed with prodigal hyatt et al 2010 gc content n50 and other sequence statistics were assessed with bbmap sourceforge net projects bbmap trnas and rrnas were annotated with the online tool trnascan se v 2 0 lowe and chan 2016 http lowelab ucsc edu trnascan se and barrnap http www vicbioinformatics com software barrnap shtml respectively predicted coding sequences cdss were aligned to card and vfdb and alignments with an e value 1e 5 and both amino acid identity and coverage 60 were considered digital dna dna hybridization dddh was performed against 46 genomes of halomonas strains from refseq ncbi with genome to genome distance calculator ggdc meier kolthoff et al 2013 using the recommended distance formula 2 for interpretation strain information was downloaded from bacdive reimer et al 2019 and the halomonas genomes ids used in ggdc are shown in table s1 a circular genome map was generated with blast ring image generator brig alikhan et al 2011 with lower and upper identity thresholds of 70 and 90 with h stevensii type strain s18214 accession nz ajts01000001 nz ajts01000053 as reference 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with stamp software version 2 parks et al 2014 the counts of args hits related to each antibiotic class and the main pathogens 32 bacterial genera listed in vfdb with full information and relative frequency 0 5 plus halomonas for each microbiome were analyzed through pairwise comparisons using two sided fisher s exact test with newcombe wilson for estimating confidence intervals and benjamini hocherberg correction for multiple tests the effect size filters 1 and 2 were set to 1 and 2 respectively only q values 0 05 were considered differences in the ratio of args and vfs cdss were tested using differences between proportions additionally a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to explore the distribution patterns of the top 10 args and bacterial genera 2 5 sequences submission the shotgun metagenome and halomonas draft genome sequences were submitted to ncbi under the bioproject accession number prjna565011 3 results 3 1 sequencing data a total of 26 5 gb corresponding to 39 757 003 reads was generated for rw 9 1 gb dw 7 gb tw 3 8 gb and um 6 6 gb after quality trimming and filtering 34 684 433 high quality reads were used for downstream analysis prodigal predicted 1 480 164 rw 424 452 dw 330 417 tw and 265 472 um cdss per sample 3 2 antibiotic resistance profile blastp of predicted proteins against card detected a total of 52 387 significant alignments related with 852 different args representing most antibiotic classes 38 49 considering different beta lactams separately and all classical mechanisms of antibiotic resistance a large repertoire of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics was observed the ratio of args cdss fig 1 a suggests that args and vfs like sequences were most abundant in um 2 9 and 6 2 respectively although significant differences were not observed between the samples the most abundant args fig 1b were similar between samples acting mainly through antibiotic efflux fig s1 indeed macb and teta 48 genes associated with this resistance mechanism represented 12 4 of all alignments the observed efflux pumps belonged to different superfamilies including atp binding cassette abc major facilitator superfamily mfs resistance nodulation cell division rnd multidrug and toxin extrusion mate and small multidrug resistance smr other observed resistance mechanisms were target alteration protection and replacement and antibiotic inactivation observed in all samples fig s1 2 6 of the args were associated with more than one resistance mechanism e g rama involved with overexpression of both mar operon and acrab thus connected to efflux and reduced antibiotic permeability in general the microbiomes were similar in regard to target antibiotic classes fig s1 statistical analysis conducted for drug class showed that 11 classes varied significantly between the samples fig s2 most differences were related to classes with minor clinical relevance such as bicyclomycin and rhodamine however significant differential abundance in peptide and penam classes which include important drugs such as bacitracin and penicillin were observed throughout the treatment line figs s2a and c it is noteworthy that many args 36 8 of the total can confer cross resistance for example oqxab quinolone tigecycline nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol resistance besides benzalkonium chloride and triclosan li et al 2019 resistance to critically important antibiotic classes for human medicine according to the world health organization who collignon et al 2016 were considerably represented e g beta lactams 19 6 of all classes macrolides 13 8 fluoroquinolones 9 6 and glycopeptides 3 8 less frequent but also relevant were alignments with genes conferring resistance to rifamycin 2 9 oxazolidinone 1 1 glycylcycline 1 and fosfomycin 0 5 classes fig 1c it is worth mentioning that sequences classified as bla spm bla kpc or bla ndm carbapenems resistance mura fosfomycin resistance and poxta oxazolidinone resistance among others were found in all samples concerning beta lactams resistance sequences related to all ambler classes of beta lactamases were observed including oxa enzymes which are extended spectrum beta lactamases esbl and the most frequent in this study resistance to macrolides was commonly associated with genes involved in efflux and ribosomal protection many of which confer cross resistance e g erm lincosamides and streptogramins resistance and evg fluoroquinolone penam and tetracycline resistance regarding fluoroquinolones all plasmid mediated quinolone resistance pmqr genes qnra qnrb qnrs qnrd qnre qnrvc aac 6 ib cr oqxab and qepa were found being oqxab the most frequent genes associated with glycopeptide resistance were detected in all samples spanning all types of vancomycin resistance described in enterococci ahmed and baptiste 2018 vana b c d e g l m and n sequences similar to mcr mcr1 to 8 related to polymyxin peptide class were also identified in order to thoroughly comprehend the resistance determinants distribution between the microbiomes a venn diagram with the observed args was constructed fig 1d core args comprised 39 4 of the different card hits while exclusive ones 32 9 however the latter was observed in low relative frequency representing a minor fraction of each microbiome 0 5 1 rw contributed with the highest representation of exclusive args 21 8 suggesting that many genes could not be detected after treatment in rw mepr multidrug transporter and mcr 7 1 peptide resistance were the most frequent exclusive args in dw and tw aac 6 iic and aac 3 ic aminoglycosides respectively and in um bla oxa129 in this way although a considerable fraction of the args pool was shared between samples each resistome showed particular features with higher diversity in the riverine environment to explore the resistance determinants dissemination potential a blastn of args carrying contigs against plasmids integrons and ices sequences was performed fig 2 217 args spanning 29 antibiotic classes considering all beta lactams as one class were potentially associated with mges table s2 fig 2 most of them fig 2a were observed in um 3 6 of all args carrying contigs followed by tw dw and rw 3 0 9 and 0 9 respectively plasmids were the most frequent mges followed by ices and integrons fig 2b it is noteworthy that among the args potentially embedded in mges there were some associated with resistance to critically important antibiotics collignon et al 2016 for example in um mcr4 and 5 like sequences were related to acinetobacter baumannii plasmids and in rw quinolone resistance qnrb19 qnrb68 qnrvc4 and qnrvc5 to plasmids of e coli and aeromonas salmonicida in regard to integrons alignments with gene cassettes qnrvc4 bla oxa 10 bla oxa 2 qacg rw and qace um associated with class1 and 2 integrons were observed although integrons are not considered mobile elements once they are not able to transfer themselves they can be embedded in mges like transposons and plasmids being of great importance for resistance dissemination taxonomic assignment of all args carrying contigs showed an association with proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes phyla in all microbiomes in rw args were most frequently associated with rhodoferax acidovorax and polaromonas in dw and tw with sorangium mycobacterium and methylobacterium and in um with bradhyrhizobium and pseudomonas in summary each microbiome showed a specific resistance profile which was affected by water treatment and distribution args acting by efflux predominated in all environments particularly related with beta lactams resistance in the clinical setting a larger proportion of mge associated args carrying contigs was observed specially plasmids 3 3 virulome metagenomic datasets were screened against the vfdb to investigate the occurrence of virulence factors the communities harbored a great diversity of vfs totaling 1929 different types out of 3294 in the reference file rw had a higher frequency of different hits in an exploratory way regarding the dynamics of virulence genes from rw to tw the results suggest that the ratio of vfs cdss decreased after water treatment dw and augmented after distribution tw um presented the lowest number of cdss although this sample corresponds to a higher volume of filtered pure water and the highest proportion of vfs however no significant difference was found fig 3 presents the top 10 most abundant vfs which accounted for 16 5 of all factors on average functional classification of these factors showed that those involved in iron uptake virulence regulation toxins flagella and stress response predominated however they varied between the communities which can be explained by the differential microbiome composition for example secretion system vi was among the most abundant vfs only in dw and tw these findings show the importance of water environments as reservoirs of vfs of clinically relevant pathogens 3 4 bacterial community and its pathogens taxonomic annotation performed with kraken2 revealed that amongst prokaryotes bacteria domain predominated 99 7 on average spanning 36 phyla whereas archaea had a minor representation 0 3 on average at phylum level proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes planctomycetes and deinococcus thermus constituted the majority of the communities fig 4 a with varying proportions for example the relative frequencies of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominant phyla in rw were considerably reduced in dw but the former increased after distribution tw on the other hand actinobacteria progressively augmented throughout the treatment and distribution line in the clinical setting proteobacteria and actinobacteria predominated at the class level a pronounced variation in taxonomic profile was detected fig 4b in rw betaproteobacteria highly common in freshwater was the most frequent 55 9 in dw and tw actinobacteria 29 2 and 35 4 respectively and alphaproteobacteria 12 6 and 43 predominated in um gammaproteobacteria which harbors clinically relevant pathogens prevailed 64 7 other classes well represented in um were actinobacteria 19 9 and alphaproteobacteria 9 3 at the genus level fig 4c there were common taxa between rw dw and tw although their proportions differed rw was composed largely of limnohabitans 14 9 a typical freshwater genus which was at low relative frequency in dw 0 03 in dw there was not a clearly dominant taxon and those with the highest relative frequencies were streptomyces 4 5 mostly streptomyces radiotolerans and mycobacterium 3 4 which were minor in rw 0 5 and 0 2 respectively in tw methylobacterium 17 7 and mycobacterium 15 1 prevailed in um halomonas mainly classified as h hydrothermalis a pathogen resistant to many extreme conditions was notably abundant 59 2 other well represented genera in this community were cutibacterium 19 actinobacteria and bradyrhizobium 6 5 alphaproteobacteria totalizing 85 of all reads a nmds with the main args and bacterial genera illustrates their differential distribution between the microbiomes fig s3 thereby each community exhibited a singular molecular taxonomic signature to explore the occurrence and relative frequency of pathogens 32 bacterial genera listed in vfdb plus halomonas spp were investigated fig 4d some taxa such as pseudomonas and halomonas were detected in all microbiomes although with highly variable relative frequency in rw pathogens comprised 5 6 of the total represented mainly by acinetobacter bordetella burkholderia and pseudomonas fig 4d s4a c in dw and tw in which pathogens corresponded to 14 7 and 18 5 of the total respectively these genera decreased significantly figs s4a and b on the other hand mycobacterium was significantly enriched figs s4b and d in um pathogens composed 62 0 of the total in majority related to one potentially pathogenic genus halomonas spp 59 2 um also exhibited a characteristic pathogens profile compared to the other samples fig 4 s4c e f overall these results may be consequence of the selective pressure exerted on the bacterial communities e g by chlorination as well as the occurrence of ideal conditions for biofilm formation in the distribution pipes 3 5 halomonas um metagenome assembled genome features in the present study a draft genome of halomonas named halomonas um was reconstructed with 3 577 465 bp long 948 contigs gc content of 60 15 and n50 of 26 203 kb predicted functional annotation revealed a total of 3827 cdss besides 44 trnas and seven rrnas seven cdss with potential roles in antibiotic resistance were identified mainly encoding multidrug efflux pumps of mfs abc and rnd superfamilies sequences related to colistin pmre and rifamycin rpob2 resistance were also observed fifty two predicted cdss were associated with virulence including stress response acid resistance motility adherence invasion and colonization which may contribute to its pathogenicity table s3 the most representative were flagella associated functions 38 5 of all hits and stress response 26 9 taxonomic assignment of halomonas um was based on 16s rrna gene dddh and gc content in comparison to 46 halomonas species table s1 the largest 16s rrna gene sequence recovered from halomonas um genome 1528 bp exhibited 99 86 identity to h stevensii type strain s18214 16s rrna partial sequence nr 115088 1 according to phylogenomic analysis halomonas um exhibited a dddh value of 79 6 towards h stevensii type strain s18214 nz ajts01000001 nz ajts01000053 whose gc content is 60 25 and 65 2 towards h hydrothermalis strain y2 nz cp023656 1 and gc content of 60 24 fig 5 while the other reference genomes had dddh values from 17 6 to 26 3 4 discussion antibiotic resistance is considered a global challenge of growing proportions for public health who 2015 besides antibiotics misuse chlorination performed during drinking water conventional treatment has been pointed as a possible cause for multidrug resistant bacteria selection karumathil et al 2014 liu et al 2018 bacteria capable of surviving stressful conditions which often harbor mobile args might proliferate adhered to biofilms in the distribution pipelines and then reach health facilities liu et al 2016 to better understand this process it is important to track and investigate args in different environments in this work we explored through metagenomics the diversity and dynamics of args and vfs and the associated bacterial communities in environmental household and clinical settings the minor args and vfs cdss ratios observed in dw suggest that water treatment diminished the number and diversity of resistance and virulence determinants although without statistical significance in addition an increase tendency in args proportion was observed in tw as in other studies xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in a previous research using high throughput quantitative pcr xu et al 2016 the authors reported an enrichment of args up to 109 fold in tap water compared to finished water mainly targeting beta lactams one possible explanation for this is that residual chlorine could select bacteria resistant to this compound and also to antibiotics jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 the conditions of the distribution systems such as fluctuating temperatures residence time pipe materials and diameters can also be propitious for bacterial growth and enrichment of pathogens lautenschlager et al 2010 which was corroborated by the taxonomical analysis rw was dominated by freshwater typical bacteria and had the lowest proportion of pathogens whereas in dw and tw there was a raise in relative frequency of pathogens and a significant enrichment of some taxa such as streptococcus dw and mycobacterium dw and tw in um pathogenic genera predominated a 16s rrna gene deep sequencing work bertelli et al 2018 reported that pseudomonas predominated in waters with higher chlorine concentrations in the present study however pseudomonas frequency was higher in rw um was dominated by cutibacterium acnes bradyrhizobium and principally halomonas cutibacterium is a recognized biofilm producer generally linked with skin microbiome and has been associated with implantable devices infections gharamti and kanafani 2017 bradyrhizobium has been detected in ultrapure water mcalister et al 2002 and hospital shower hose biolfilms soto giron et al 2016 halomonas in its turn has been reported to cause contamination in dialysis centers stevens et al 2009 due to its ability to produce biofilms and survive stressful osmotic conditions kim et al 2013 in a previous study on dialysis infections the authors hypothesized that the halomonas source could be the bicarbonate used to prepare the dialysis fluid stevens and johnson 2017 however in the present work the hospital in which ultrafiltration membranes were collected uses commercial sealed electrolytes solutions instead thus making this hypothesis unlikely water used in the dialysate solution is also highly pure due to the reverse osmosis step therefore the dna found in this sample might have come from contamination during water storage and distribution after purification or due to biofilm formation in dialysis equipment which has been suggested formerly stevens and johnson 2017 it is important to highlight that a possible contamination of the dialysate pure water plus electrolytes is not followed by contamination of the patient s blood due to the barrier of the ultrafiltration membranes in the dialysis equipment however the membrane autopsy might shed light on the bacterial contaminants in these environments and direct prophylactic measures importantly the metagenome assembled halomonas um genome was phylogenetically close to h stevensii which has been related to renal care infections kim et al 2012 multidrug efflux pumps of abc mfs and rnd superfamilies among others were identified in this draft genome besides a number of pili and flagella related vfs likely implicated in adhesion and biofilm formation such characteristics may contribute to potentiate bacterial antibiotic resistance making treatment difficult concerning the resistance profile efflux pumps dominated the core resistome although they might have effect on antibiotics these pumps may also play physiological roles in bacteria including signal trafficking detoxification pathogenicity and biofilm formation alav et al 2018 what might explain their high relative frequency in all samples genes encoding efflux pumps were more frequent in tw and um which likely present favorable conditions for biofilm formation interestingly a recent study reported overexpression of the mexef oprn efflux pump in p aeruginosa exposed to chlorine hou et al 2019 some args were related to drugs included in who s list of the most critical antibiotic resistances collignon et al 2016 genes encoding the two carbapenem hydrolyzing beta lactamase groups such as blakpc serine beta lactamase and bla ges bla imp bla vim bla spm and bla ndm metallo beta lactamases represented 0 05 of the total of args considering all samples it should be noted that these genes have been identified in clinical and environmental isolates worldwide in brazil however reports of bla kpc bla ndm bla ges and bla vim in aquatic environments are scarce bartley et al 2019 de araujo et al 2016 furlan and stehling 2018 sanchez et al 2018 importantly this is the first description to the best of our knowledge of sequences related to bla imp variants and bla spm 1 outside clinical settings in brazil the variant bla imp 35 found in class 1 integrons which also contains bla oxa 35 aaca6 qaced1 and sul1 genes pournaras et al 2013 was identified in rw tw and um indicating it is widespread what is particularly concerning in addition vibrio cholerae related varg gene which encodes a metallo beta lactamase that enhances meropenem resistance lin et al 2017 was identified in rw and dw the occurrence of cdss similar to these genes is important because it suggests a potential dissemination of carbapenem resistance determinants a last resort antibiotic recommended for severe multidrug resistant bacterial infections potentially transferable tigecycline also a last generation antibiotic resistance genes tetx and teta were identified in all microbiomes tetx has been associated with class 1 and 2 integrons dong et al 2019 he et al 2014 and teta with plasmid and ices as observed here indicating a high interspecies dissemination potential importantly optra and poxta were also associated with plasmids wang et al 2015 antonelli et al 2018 and detected in all samples both encode resistance to oxazolidinone an antibiotic active against methicillin and vancomycin resistant gram positive bacteria the presence of optra particularly alerts for the need for monitoring of this gene as it is plasmid borne and confers cross resistance to phenicols wang et al 2015 concerning phosphomycin resistance an important therapeutic option for the treatment of urinary tract infections hooton 2012 sequences similar to mura and fos were detected in all samples while mura is related to mutational events in the bacterial chromosome fos is embedded in plasmids and confers cross resistance to cephalosporin penicillins and aminoglycosides castañeda garcía et al 2013 sequences that aligned with rifamycin resistance genes including rpob arr and rphb associated with plasmids and integrons spanogiannopoulos et al 2014 occurred in all microbiomes rifamycins are broad spectrum antibiotics with relevant clinical application being the first line treatment for mycobacterium infections stogios et al 2016 nine vancomycin resistance types have been characterized based on both phenotypic and genotypic features of enterococci ahmed and baptiste 2018 eight vana b d e g l m and n correspond to acquired resistance and only one vanc is intrinsic here vana and vanb types which are epidemiologically relevant in clinical isolates were present in all samples except for vana in tw it is worth mentioning that besides the mobility reported in the literature for vana b g m n vanh and vant components of the vand and vanc operons were associated with plasmids in dw and tw respectively a set of conjugative transposon and integron associated genes erm msr mef mph and ere pazda et al 2019 roberts 2008 involved in resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin ketolide and oxazolidinone were detected in all samples importantly a total of 30 variants of erm were observed of which 17 in um as well as variants of mef msr and ere indicating that these genes circulate in clinical settings which represent a potential risk to patients health and compromise the therapeutic use of drugs relevant for the treatment of beta hemolytic streptococcus infections especially in penicillin allergic patients hawkins et al 2017 verani et al 2010 pmqr genes qnra b c d vc qepa oqxab and aac6 ib cr occurred in rw dw and tw in um they were restricted to qnra qnrc qepa and oqxab like sequences however considering that pmqr genes carrying bacteria are involved in infections in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis in brazil dias et al 2019 their occurrence in um warns of the need of continuous monitoring of this environment to minimize risks of infections it is important to emphasize that other compounds besides antibiotics can exert selective pressure on the bacterial community triclosan for example can bioaccumulate and persist in the aquatic environment dhillon et al 2015 and although forbidden in europe and usa it is widely used in hygiene products in brazil triabc and omph like sequences observed in all microbiomes confer intrinsic and acquired resistance to triclosan in p aeruginosa mima et al 2007 this finding is noteworthy once some studies point to cross or co resistance of triclosan towards clinically relevant antibiotics such as beta lactams aminoglycosides chloramphenicol fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines aiello and larson 2003 coetzee et al 2017 overall these results provide new information on the global resistome and alerts for the need for monitoring of resistance determinants to clinically important antibiotics additionally it indicates that water treatment can affect the frequency of some pathogens and args classes further studies based on absolute quantification of genes and bacterial taxa in different stages of water treatment are important to enlarge our understanding of its influence on resistance dissemination 5 conclusions we reported the first thoroughly resistance virulence and taxonomic profiles in drinking water associated microbiomes in brazil as well as in dialysate ultrafiltration membranes which has not been performed so far to the best of our knowledge the main conclusions obtained from the present work are as follows water treatment affected the frequency of args conferring resistance towards relevant antibiotic classes and influenced the frequency of some pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacterium dialysate ultrafiltration membranes showed potential value for the identification of resistance determinants in dialysis centers as demonstrated by the detection of putative multiresistant h stevensii this strategy could be used to track and prevent contamination events in these facilities sequences similar to resistance determinants for the world s few last resort antibiotics such as mcr optra and poxta were detected showing their worldwide dissemination the similar args profilebetween samples suggests a possible link between nature and clinic which is although difficult to track not unlikely specially considering that many of these genes are potentially embedded in mges these results broaden our understanding of the global args diversity and stress

18062,aquatic ecosystems harbor a vast pool of antibiotic resistance genes args which can suffer mutation recombination and selection events here we explored the diversity of args virulence factors and the bacterial community composition in water samples before surface raw water rw and after disinfected water dw drinking water conventional treatment as well as in tap water tw and ultrafiltration membranes um recovered from hemodialysis equipment through metagenomics a total of 852 different args were identified 21 8 of them only in rw which might reflect the impact of human activities on the river at the sampling point although a similar resistance profile has been observed between the samples significant differences in the frequency of clinically relevant antibiotic classes penam and peptide were identified resistance determinants to last resort antibiotics including sequences related to mcr optra and poxta and clinically relevant beta lactamase genes i e bla kpc bla ges bla imp bla vim bla spm and bla ndm were detected 830 coding sequences cdss related to 217 different args were embedded in contigs associated with mobile genetic elements specially plasmids of which 68 in rw dw and tw suggesting the importance of water environments in resistance dissemination shifts in bacterial pathogens genera were observed such as a significant increase in mycobacterium after treatment and distribution in um the potentially pathogenic genus halomonas predominated its draft genome was closely related to h stevensii hosting mainly multidrug efflux pumps these results broaden our

amongst others contaminants and transient microorganisms from different sources such as hospital domestic and animal breeding effluents grenni et al 2018 karkman et al 2018 in addition to antibiotics use other human activities may inadvertently promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb including chlorination performed during drinking water treatment although it is still controversial lin et al 2016 shi et al 2013 some studies indicate that selective pressure imposed on bacterial populations by these substances can favor the proliferation of arb and args in these conditions the expression and horizontal gene transfer hgt of args can be triggered with potentially undesirable effects for human health and the environment stressing the importance of tracking the environmental resistance previous studies have demonstrated an increase in args shi et al 2013 allen et al 2010 grenni et al 2018 xu et al 2016 and in some pathogens frequencies such as pseudomonas and sphingomonas jia et al 2015 after water disinfection and distribution moreover studies based on shotgun metagenomics and 16s rrna gene deep sequencing have also revealed that even high quality drinking water can contain clinically relevant taxa which have been associated with multidrug resistance such as acinetobacter and staphylococcus dias et al 2018 for example in a study comprising 12 cities in china and singapore ma et al 2019 265 args were observed mainly related to multidrug bacitracin beta lactams and aminoglycosides resistance as well as pathogens of pseudomonas legionella and acinetobacter genera among others an important phenomenon related to arb in drinking water is their persistence and increase in the distribution system in which disinfectant agents can be at sublethal concentrations proliferation of resistant pathogens in the pipelines can pose a risk to health principally in clinical settings indeed kinsey et al 2017 reported an outbreak of pseudomonas aeruginosa in a neonatal intensive care unit associated with contaminated tap water and many similar reports can be found in the literature as reviewed by gordon et al 2017 given the extensive impacts that antibiotic resistance has on the environment and human health monitoring the resistome in different environments including drinking water becomes a need despite the intense efforts of the scientific community there are still considerable uncertainties associated with the connection between resistance in environmental and clinical settings and also with the effects of water treatment on bacterial community and resistance determinants thus this research intends to contribute to the understanding of args diversity by exploring through shotgun metagenomics the resistome virulome and bacterial community composition in water before and after conventional treatment and distribution tap water additionally a composite sample from a clinical setting collected from dialysis facilities was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection sampling was performed prior surface raw water rw and after disinfected water dw conventional treatment which includes oxidation coagulation flocculation decantation filtration disinfection with gaseous chlorine ph correction and fluoridation steps at a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp with a mean flow rate of 7 000l s at minas gerais state brazil to explore the effects of water passage through the distribution system on the resistome and bacterial community a tap water tw sample was collected at the dependencies of the universidade federal de minas gerais minas gerais brazil 20 l of each type of water were sampled and 4 20 l filtrated separately through sterilized 0 22 μm membranes millipore usa at the point of sampling the river is classified as class 2 according to the instituto mineiro de gestão das águas igam 2013 which means its waters are suitable for human consumption after conventional treatment conama 357 2005 in order to investigate the resistome in a clinical setting dialysate ultrafiltration membranes um from a hospital dialysis unit minas gerais brazil were collected for that three sealed tubes containing the membranes were opened aseptically and 1g of each was retrieved for dna extraction pooled together prior to library construction all samples were stored at 20 c until further analysis the ultrafiltration membranes filter the dialysate which is a mixture of purified water and commercial sterile electrolytes solutions being the last barrier against contamination in patients undergoing dialysis the water used in this solution is previously submitted to filtration in 5 μm and charcoal filters and a final step of reverse osmosis due to its high purity the volume necessary to obtain sufficient biological material for analysis would be very large the dialysate filtration membranes in its turn filter on average 28 000 l of solution during the period of three months 500 ml min in three cycles of 4 h day throughout 78 days sundays are not included being discarded after that despite the differences in um compared to the other samples this strategy allowed a deeper investigation of the occurrence and the risks posed by args and arb in the studied clinical environment 2 2 dna extraction library construction and sequencing total dna of each sample was extracted with zymobiomics dna miniprep kit zymo research usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and its concentration and quality assessed with qubit fluorometer and nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa respectively libraries construction was performed with illumina nextera dna flex library prep kit generating 500 bp libraries on average and concentration and quality assessed with qubit fluorometer and bioanalyzer agilent technologies usa the libraries were sequenced by nextseq 500 using nextseq 500 550 mid output kit 300 cycles 2 3 bioinformatics raw reads were filtered and trimmed with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 to remove human sequences from the dataset the high quality reads were mapped to human reference genome grch38 p12 downloaded from ensembl with star dobin et al 2013 filtered reads were assembled with metaspades nurk et al 2017 and gene prediction was performed with prodigal hyatt et al 2010 predicted protein sequences were compared against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card jia et al 2017 and the core dataset of virulence factors database vfdb liu et al 2019 with blastp altschul et al 1990 only alignments with an e value 1e 5 coverage 60 galagan et al 2003 and amino acid identity 30 rost 1999 were considered taxonomic classification was performed with kraken2 wood et al 2019 wood and salzberg 2014 and visualized with pavian breitwieser and salzberg 2016 venn diagram was created with venny oliveiros 2007 to explore the putative associations of resistance determinants with mobile genetic elements mges args carrying contigs were blasted against sequences of plasmids refseq ncbi integron cassettes integrall moura et al 2009 and bacterial integrative and conjugative elements ices iceberg database bi et al 2012 only alignments with an e value 1e 5 coverage 60 and 85 nucleotide identity were included an arg was considered associated with mges if embedded in a contig that aligned significantly with any of these databases additionally taxonomic assignment of these contigs was performed against 1148 annotated prokaryote genomes of refseq ncbi database using raiphy with default parameters nalbantoglu et al 2011 considering that the metagenomic dataset obtained from um indicated halomonas as the dominant genus a draft genome was assembled in order to further explore its resistome and virulome for that all um reads were aligned to halomonas reference sequences in refseq ncbi the aligned reads went through a de novo assembly with spades bankevich et al 2012 gene prediction was performed with prodigal hyatt et al 2010 gc content n50 and other sequence statistics were assessed with bbmap sourceforge net projects bbmap trnas and rrnas were annotated with the online tool trnascan se v 2 0 lowe and chan 2016 http lowelab ucsc edu trnascan se and barrnap http www vicbioinformatics com software barrnap shtml respectively predicted coding sequences cdss were aligned to card and vfdb and alignments with an e value 1e 5 and both amino acid identity and coverage 60 were considered digital dna dna hybridization dddh was performed against 46 genomes of halomonas strains from refseq ncbi with genome to genome distance calculator ggdc meier kolthoff et al 2013 using the recommended distance formula 2 for interpretation strain information was downloaded from bacdive reimer et al 2019 and the halomonas genomes ids used in ggdc are shown in table s1 a circular genome map was generated with blast ring image generator brig alikhan et al 2011 with lower and upper identity thresholds of 70 and 90 with h stevensii type strain s18214 accession nz ajts01000001 nz ajts01000053 as reference 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with stamp software version 2 parks et al 2014 the counts of args hits related to each antibiotic class and the main pathogens 32 bacterial genera listed in vfdb with full information and relative frequency 0 5 plus halomonas for each microbiome were analyzed through pairwise comparisons using two sided fisher s exact test with newcombe wilson for estimating confidence intervals and benjamini hocherberg correction for multiple tests the effect size filters 1 and 2 were set to 1 and 2 respectively only q values 0 05 were considered differences in the ratio of args and vfs cdss were tested using differences between proportions additionally a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to explore the distribution patterns of the top 10 args and bacterial genera 2 5 sequences submission the shotgun metagenome and halomonas draft genome sequences were submitted to ncbi under the bioproject accession number prjna565011 3 results 3 1 sequencing data a total of 26 5 gb corresponding to 39 757 003 reads was generated for rw 9 1 gb dw 7 gb tw 3 8 gb and um 6 6 gb after quality trimming and filtering 34 684 433 high quality reads were used for downstream analysis prodigal predicted 1 480 164 rw 424 452 dw 330 417 tw and 265 472 um cdss per sample 3 2 antibiotic resistance profile blastp of predicted proteins against card detected a total of 52 387 significant alignments related with 852 different args representing most antibiotic classes 38 49 considering different beta lactams separately and all classical mechanisms of antibiotic resistance a large repertoire of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics was observed the ratio of args cdss fig 1 a suggests that args and vfs like sequences were most abundant in um 2 9 and 6 2 respectively although significant differences were not observed between the samples the most abundant args fig 1b were similar between samples acting mainly through antibiotic efflux fig s1 indeed macb and teta 48 genes associated with this resistance mechanism represented 12 4 of all alignments the observed efflux pumps belonged to different superfamilies including atp binding cassette abc major facilitator superfamily mfs resistance nodulation cell division rnd multidrug and toxin extrusion mate and small multidrug resistance smr other observed resistance mechanisms were target alteration protection and replacement and antibiotic inactivation observed in all samples fig s1 2 6 of the args were associated with more than one resistance mechanism e g rama involved with overexpression of both mar operon and acrab thus connected to efflux and reduced antibiotic permeability in general the microbiomes were similar in regard to target antibiotic classes fig s1 statistical analysis conducted for drug class showed that 11 classes varied significantly between the samples fig s2 most differences were related to classes with minor clinical relevance such as bicyclomycin and rhodamine however significant differential abundance in peptide and penam classes which include important drugs such as bacitracin and penicillin were observed throughout the treatment line figs s2a and c it is noteworthy that many args 36 8 of the total can confer cross resistance for example oqxab quinolone tigecycline nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol resistance besides benzalkonium chloride and triclosan li et al 2019 resistance to critically important antibiotic classes for human medicine according to the world health organization who collignon et al 2016 were considerably represented e g beta lactams 19 6 of all classes macrolides 13 8 fluoroquinolones 9 6 and glycopeptides 3 8 less frequent but also relevant were alignments with genes conferring resistance to rifamycin 2 9 oxazolidinone 1 1 glycylcycline 1 and fosfomycin 0 5 classes fig 1c it is worth mentioning that sequences classified as bla spm bla kpc or bla ndm carbapenems resistance mura fosfomycin resistance and poxta oxazolidinone resistance among others were found in all samples concerning beta lactams resistance sequences related to all ambler classes of beta lactamases were observed including oxa enzymes which are extended spectrum beta lactamases esbl and the most frequent in this study resistance to macrolides was commonly associated with genes involved in efflux and ribosomal protection many of which confer cross resistance e g erm lincosamides and streptogramins resistance and evg fluoroquinolone penam and tetracycline resistance regarding fluoroquinolones all plasmid mediated quinolone resistance pmqr genes qnra qnrb qnrs qnrd qnre qnrvc aac 6 ib cr oqxab and qepa were found being oqxab the most frequent genes associated with glycopeptide resistance were detected in all samples spanning all types of vancomycin resistance described in enterococci ahmed and baptiste 2018 vana b c d e g l m and n sequences similar to mcr mcr1 to 8 related to polymyxin peptide class were also identified in order to thoroughly comprehend the resistance determinants distribution between the microbiomes a venn diagram with the observed args was constructed fig 1d core args comprised 39 4 of the different card hits while exclusive ones 32 9 however the latter was observed in low relative frequency representing a minor fraction of each microbiome 0 5 1 rw contributed with the highest representation of exclusive args 21 8 suggesting that many genes could not be detected after treatment in rw mepr multidrug transporter and mcr 7 1 peptide resistance were the most frequent exclusive args in dw and tw aac 6 iic and aac 3 ic aminoglycosides respectively and in um bla oxa129 in this way although a considerable fraction of the args pool was shared between samples each resistome showed particular features with higher diversity in the riverine environment to explore the resistance determinants dissemination potential a blastn of args carrying contigs against plasmids integrons and ices sequences was performed fig 2 217 args spanning 29 antibiotic classes considering all beta lactams as one class were potentially associated with mges table s2 fig 2 most of them fig 2a were observed in um 3 6 of all args carrying contigs followed by tw dw and rw 3 0 9 and 0 9 respectively plasmids were the most frequent mges followed by ices and integrons fig 2b it is noteworthy that among the args potentially embedded in mges there were some associated with resistance to critically important antibiotics collignon et al 2016 for example in um mcr4 and 5 like sequences were related to acinetobacter baumannii plasmids and in rw quinolone resistance qnrb19 qnrb68 qnrvc4 and qnrvc5 to plasmids of e coli and aeromonas salmonicida in regard to integrons alignments with gene cassettes qnrvc4 bla oxa 10 bla oxa 2 qacg rw and qace um associated with class1 and 2 integrons were observed although integrons are not considered mobile elements once they are not able to transfer themselves they can be embedded in mges like transposons and plasmids being of great importance for resistance dissemination taxonomic assignment of all args carrying contigs showed an association with proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes phyla in all microbiomes in rw args were most frequently associated with rhodoferax acidovorax and polaromonas in dw and tw with sorangium mycobacterium and methylobacterium and in um with bradhyrhizobium and pseudomonas in summary each microbiome showed a specific resistance profile which was affected by water treatment and distribution args acting by efflux predominated in all environments particularly related with beta lactams resistance in the clinical setting a larger proportion of mge associated args carrying contigs was observed specially plasmids 3 3 virulome metagenomic datasets were screened against the vfdb to investigate the occurrence of virulence factors the communities harbored a great diversity of vfs totaling 1929 different types out of 3294 in the reference file rw had a higher frequency of different hits in an exploratory way regarding the dynamics of virulence genes from rw to tw the results suggest that the ratio of vfs cdss decreased after water treatment dw and augmented after distribution tw um presented the lowest number of cdss although this sample corresponds to a higher volume of filtered pure water and the highest proportion of vfs however no significant difference was found fig 3 presents the top 10 most abundant vfs which accounted for 16 5 of all factors on average functional classification of these factors showed that those involved in iron uptake virulence regulation toxins flagella and stress response predominated however they varied between the communities which can be explained by the differential microbiome composition for example secretion system vi was among the most abundant vfs only in dw and tw these findings show the importance of water environments as reservoirs of vfs of clinically relevant pathogens 3 4 bacterial community and its pathogens taxonomic annotation performed with kraken2 revealed that amongst prokaryotes bacteria domain predominated 99 7 on average spanning 36 phyla whereas archaea had a minor representation 0 3 on average at phylum level proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes planctomycetes and deinococcus thermus constituted the majority of the communities fig 4 a with varying proportions for example the relative frequencies of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominant phyla in rw were considerably reduced in dw but the former increased after distribution tw on the other hand actinobacteria progressively augmented throughout the treatment and distribution line in the clinical setting proteobacteria and actinobacteria predominated at the class level a pronounced variation in taxonomic profile was detected fig 4b in rw betaproteobacteria highly common in freshwater was the most frequent 55 9 in dw and tw actinobacteria 29 2 and 35 4 respectively and alphaproteobacteria 12 6 and 43 predominated in um gammaproteobacteria which harbors clinically relevant pathogens prevailed 64 7 other classes well represented in um were actinobacteria 19 9 and alphaproteobacteria 9 3 at the genus level fig 4c there were common taxa between rw dw and tw although their proportions differed rw was composed largely of limnohabitans 14 9 a typical freshwater genus which was at low relative frequency in dw 0 03 in dw there was not a clearly dominant taxon and those with the highest relative frequencies were streptomyces 4 5 mostly streptomyces radiotolerans and mycobacterium 3 4 which were minor in rw 0 5 and 0 2 respectively in tw methylobacterium 17 7 and mycobacterium 15 1 prevailed in um halomonas mainly classified as h hydrothermalis a pathogen resistant to many extreme conditions was notably abundant 59 2 other well represented genera in this community were cutibacterium 19 actinobacteria and bradyrhizobium 6 5 alphaproteobacteria totalizing 85 of all reads a nmds with the main args and bacterial genera illustrates their differential distribution between the microbiomes fig s3 thereby each community exhibited a singular molecular taxonomic signature to explore the occurrence and relative frequency of pathogens 32 bacterial genera listed in vfdb plus halomonas spp were investigated fig 4d some taxa such as pseudomonas and halomonas were detected in all microbiomes although with highly variable relative frequency in rw pathogens comprised 5 6 of the total represented mainly by acinetobacter bordetella burkholderia and pseudomonas fig 4d s4a c in dw and tw in which pathogens corresponded to 14 7 and 18 5 of the total respectively these genera decreased significantly figs s4a and b on the other hand mycobacterium was significantly enriched figs s4b and d in um pathogens composed 62 0 of the total in majority related to one potentially pathogenic genus halomonas spp 59 2 um also exhibited a characteristic pathogens profile compared to the other samples fig 4 s4c e f overall these results may be consequence of the selective pressure exerted on the bacterial communities e g by chlorination as well as the occurrence of ideal conditions for biofilm formation in the distribution pipes 3 5 halomonas um metagenome assembled genome features in the present study a draft genome of halomonas named halomonas um was reconstructed with 3 577 465 bp long 948 contigs gc content of 60 15 and n50 of 26 203 kb predicted functional annotation revealed a total of 3827 cdss besides 44 trnas and seven rrnas seven cdss with potential roles in antibiotic resistance were identified mainly encoding multidrug efflux pumps of mfs abc and rnd superfamilies sequences related to colistin pmre and rifamycin rpob2 resistance were also observed fifty two predicted cdss were associated with virulence including stress response acid resistance motility adherence invasion and colonization which may contribute to its pathogenicity table s3 the most representative were flagella associated functions 38 5 of all hits and stress response 26 9 taxonomic assignment of halomonas um was based on 16s rrna gene dddh and gc content in comparison to 46 halomonas species table s1 the largest 16s rrna gene sequence recovered from halomonas um genome 1528 bp exhibited 99 86 identity to h stevensii type strain s18214 16s rrna partial sequence nr 115088 1 according to phylogenomic analysis halomonas um exhibited a dddh value of 79 6 towards h stevensii type strain s18214 nz ajts01000001 nz ajts01000053 whose gc content is 60 25 and 65 2 towards h hydrothermalis strain y2 nz cp023656 1 and gc content of 60 24 fig 5 while the other reference genomes had dddh values from 17 6 to 26 3 4 discussion antibiotic resistance is considered a global challenge of growing proportions for public health who 2015 besides antibiotics misuse chlorination performed during drinking water conventional treatment has been pointed as a possible cause for multidrug resistant bacteria selection karumathil et al 2014 liu et al 2018 bacteria capable of surviving stressful conditions which often harbor mobile args might proliferate adhered to biofilms in the distribution pipelines and then reach health facilities liu et al 2016 to better understand this process it is important to track and investigate args in different environments in this work we explored through metagenomics the diversity and dynamics of args and vfs and the associated bacterial communities in environmental household and clinical settings the minor args and vfs cdss ratios observed in dw suggest that water treatment diminished the number and diversity of resistance and virulence determinants although without statistical significance in addition an increase tendency in args proportion was observed in tw as in other studies xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 in a previous research using high throughput quantitative pcr xu et al 2016 the authors reported an enrichment of args up to 109 fold in tap water compared to finished water mainly targeting beta lactams one possible explanation for this is that residual chlorine could select bacteria resistant to this compound and also to antibiotics jia et al 2015 shi et al 2013 the conditions of the distribution systems such as fluctuating temperatures residence time pipe materials and diameters can also be propitious for bacterial growth and enrichment of pathogens lautenschlager et al 2010 which was corroborated by the taxonomical analysis rw was dominated by freshwater typical bacteria and had the lowest proportion of pathogens whereas in dw and tw there was a raise in relative frequency of pathogens and a significant enrichment of some taxa such as streptococcus dw and mycobacterium dw and tw in um pathogenic genera predominated a 16s rrna gene deep sequencing work bertelli et al 2018 reported that pseudomonas predominated in waters with higher chlorine concentrations in the present study however pseudomonas frequency was higher in rw um was dominated by cutibacterium acnes bradyrhizobium and principally halomonas cutibacterium is a recognized biofilm producer generally linked with skin microbiome and has been associated with implantable devices infections gharamti and kanafani 2017 bradyrhizobium has been detected in ultrapure water mcalister et al 2002 and hospital shower hose biolfilms soto giron et al 2016 halomonas in its turn has been reported to cause contamination in dialysis centers stevens et al 2009 due to its ability to produce biofilms and survive stressful osmotic conditions kim et al 2013 in a previous study on dialysis infections the authors hypothesized that the halomonas source could be the bicarbonate used to prepare the dialysis fluid stevens and johnson 2017 however in the present work the hospital in which ultrafiltration membranes were collected uses commercial sealed electrolytes solutions instead thus making this hypothesis unlikely water used in the dialysate solution is also highly pure due to the reverse osmosis step therefore the dna found in this sample might have come from contamination during water storage and distribution after purification or due to biofilm formation in dialysis equipment which has been suggested formerly stevens and johnson 2017 it is important to highlight that a possible contamination of the dialysate pure water plus electrolytes is not followed by contamination of the patient s blood due to the barrier of the ultrafiltration membranes in the dialysis equipment however the membrane autopsy might shed light on the bacterial contaminants in these environments and direct prophylactic measures importantly the metagenome assembled halomonas um genome was phylogenetically close to h stevensii which has been related to renal care infections kim et al 2012 multidrug efflux pumps of abc mfs and rnd superfamilies among others were identified in this draft genome besides a number of pili and flagella related vfs likely implicated in adhesion and biofilm formation such characteristics may contribute to potentiate bacterial antibiotic resistance making treatment difficult concerning the resistance profile efflux pumps dominated the core resistome although they might have effect on antibiotics these pumps may also play physiological roles in bacteria including signal trafficking detoxification pathogenicity and biofilm formation alav et al 2018 what might explain their high relative frequency in all samples genes encoding efflux pumps were more frequent in tw and um which likely present favorable conditions for biofilm formation interestingly a recent study reported overexpression of the mexef oprn efflux pump in p aeruginosa exposed to chlorine hou et al 2019 some args were related to drugs included in who s list of the most critical antibiotic resistances collignon et al 2016 genes encoding the two carbapenem hydrolyzing beta lactamase groups such as blakpc serine beta lactamase and bla ges bla imp bla vim bla spm and bla ndm metallo beta lactamases represented 0 05 of the total of args considering all samples it should be noted that these genes have been identified in clinical and environmental isolates worldwide in brazil however reports of bla kpc bla ndm bla ges and bla vim in aquatic environments are scarce bartley et al 2019 de araujo et al 2016 furlan and stehling 2018 sanchez et al 2018 importantly this is the first description to the best of our knowledge of sequences related to bla imp variants and bla spm 1 outside clinical settings in brazil the variant bla imp 35 found in class 1 integrons which also contains bla oxa 35 aaca6 qaced1 and sul1 genes pournaras et al 2013 was identified in rw tw and um indicating it is widespread what is particularly concerning in addition vibrio cholerae related varg gene which encodes a metallo beta lactamase that enhances meropenem resistance lin et al 2017 was identified in rw and dw the occurrence of cdss similar to these genes is important because it suggests a potential dissemination of carbapenem resistance determinants a last resort antibiotic recommended for severe multidrug resistant bacterial infections potentially transferable tigecycline also a last generation antibiotic resistance genes tetx and teta were identified in all microbiomes tetx has been associated with class 1 and 2 integrons dong et al 2019 he et al 2014 and teta with plasmid and ices as observed here indicating a high interspecies dissemination potential importantly optra and poxta were also associated with plasmids wang et al 2015 antonelli et al 2018 and detected in all samples both encode resistance to oxazolidinone an antibiotic active against methicillin and vancomycin resistant gram positive bacteria the presence of optra particularly alerts for the need for monitoring of this gene as it is plasmid borne and confers cross resistance to phenicols wang et al 2015 concerning phosphomycin resistance an important therapeutic option for the treatment of urinary tract infections hooton 2012 sequences similar to mura and fos were detected in all samples while mura is related to mutational events in the bacterial chromosome fos is embedded in plasmids and confers cross resistance to cephalosporin penicillins and aminoglycosides castañeda garcía et al 2013 sequences that aligned with rifamycin resistance genes including rpob arr and rphb associated with plasmids and integrons spanogiannopoulos et al 2014 occurred in all microbiomes rifamycins are broad spectrum antibiotics with relevant clinical application being the first line treatment for mycobacterium infections stogios et al 2016 nine vancomycin resistance types have been characterized based on both phenotypic and genotypic features of enterococci ahmed and baptiste 2018 eight vana b d e g l m and n correspond to acquired resistance and only one vanc is intrinsic here vana and vanb types which are epidemiologically relevant in clinical isolates were present in all samples except for vana in tw it is worth mentioning that besides the mobility reported in the literature for vana b g m n vanh and vant components of the vand and vanc operons were associated with plasmids in dw and tw respectively a set of conjugative transposon and integron associated genes erm msr mef mph and ere pazda et al 2019 roberts 2008 involved in resistance to macrolide lincosamide streptogramin ketolide and oxazolidinone were detected in all samples importantly a total of 30 variants of erm were observed of which 17 in um as well as variants of mef msr and ere indicating that these genes circulate in clinical settings which represent a potential risk to patients health and compromise the therapeutic use of drugs relevant for the treatment of beta hemolytic streptococcus infections especially in penicillin allergic patients hawkins et al 2017 verani et al 2010 pmqr genes qnra b c d vc qepa oqxab and aac6 ib cr occurred in rw dw and tw in um they were restricted to qnra qnrc qepa and oqxab like sequences however considering that pmqr genes carrying bacteria are involved in infections in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis in brazil dias et al 2019 their occurrence in um warns of the need of continuous monitoring of this environment to minimize risks of infections it is important to emphasize that other compounds besides antibiotics can exert selective pressure on the bacterial community triclosan for example can bioaccumulate and persist in the aquatic environment dhillon et al 2015 and although forbidden in europe and usa it is widely used in hygiene products in brazil triabc and omph like sequences observed in all microbiomes confer intrinsic and acquired resistance to triclosan in p aeruginosa mima et al 2007 this finding is noteworthy once some studies point to cross or co resistance of triclosan towards clinically relevant antibiotics such as beta lactams aminoglycosides chloramphenicol fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines aiello and larson 2003 coetzee et al 2017 overall these results provide new information on the global resistome and alerts for the need for monitoring of resistance determinants to clinically important antibiotics additionally it indicates that water treatment can affect the frequency of some pathogens and args classes further studies based on absolute quantification of genes and bacterial taxa in different stages of water treatment are important to enlarge our understanding of its influence on resistance dissemination 5 conclusions we reported the first thoroughly resistance virulence and taxonomic profiles in drinking water associated microbiomes in brazil as well as in dialysate ultrafiltration membranes which has not been performed so far to the best of our knowledge the main conclusions obtained from the present work are as follows water treatment affected the frequency of args conferring resistance towards relevant antibiotic classes and influenced the frequency of some pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacterium dialysate ultrafiltration membranes showed potential value for the identification of resistance determinants in dialysis centers as demonstrated by the detection of putative multiresistant h stevensii this strategy could be used to track and prevent contamination events in these facilities sequences similar to resistance determinants for the world s few last resort antibiotics such as mcr optra and poxta were detected showing their worldwide dissemination the similar args profilebetween samples suggests a possible link between nature and clinic which is although difficult to track not unlikely specially considering that many of these genes are potentially embedded in mges these results broaden our understanding of the global args diversity and stress

18063,phytoremediation of reverse osmosis concentrate roc with microalgae can simultaneously achieve multi functions of roc treatment co2 mitigation and microalgae biolipid production but the performances are usually inhibited by high free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration and chromaticity of roc to offset these negative effects an integrated technique including electrooxidation pretreatment and chlorella vulgaris remediation was proposed in which the roc was first pretreated with electrooxidation to decrease fan and chromaticity and then the oxidized roc was remediated with microalgae to reclaim nutrients and produce biolipid results showed that fan was sharply reduced from 53 0 mg n l to 13 9 mg n l and chromaticity was decreased from 1600 to 100 pt co via electrooxidation possible reaction mechanism of nutrients removal was discussed via electron mass balance explanation on chromaticity decrease was revealed by analyzing humic acid conversion path with fluorescence characteristics during microalgae remediation process nutrients removal rate microalgae biomass concentration and lipid yield were effectively enhanced in electrooxidized roc energy balance analysis indicated that microalge lipid energy under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 basically compensated total input energy despite roc sterilization this work provided a promising strategy for large scale roc treatment and microalgae biolipid production graphical abstract image 10350 keywords reverse osmosis concentrate microalgae free ammonia nitrogen chromaticity electrooxidation 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro which is a pressure driven membrane separation technique for wastewater treatment is commonly employed for most wastewater treatment plants attributing to high efficiency pollutants separation and easy operation maeng et al 2018 woo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a however the large quantity of reverse osmosis concentrate roc generated during ro process is very difficult to dispose since the pollutants like ammonium and chromaticity are usually overwhelmingly higher than that in the influent stream woo et al 2019 directly discharge of roc can induce destruction of water system and threaten human health wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to explore a practical method to treat roc before discharge currently the commonly used methods for roc disposal include biological treatment membrane separation chemical methods and activated carbon adsorption attributing to relatively easy operation however there still exist a series of problems such as high cost on sugar feeding for biological treatment due to low c n ratio of roc membrane fouling and aging problems for membrane separation process high energy consumption on advanced oxidation process and active carbon regeneration which hindered the large scale application of these techniques anis et al 2019 ghyselbrecht et al 2012 joo et al 2014 besides it is noteworthy that previous methods mainly focused on the removal of pollutants from roc streams but ignored recovery of valuable compounds leading to severe waste of resources microalgae can uptake nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater as nutrient source and fix co2 in flue gas as carbon source for photosynthesis to produce biolipid carbohydrate and protein zhu et al 2018 meaning that culturing microalgae with wastewater can simultaneously reduce cost on wastewater disposal carbon mitigation and microalgae based bioenergy production fu et al 2019 although feasibility of wastewater phytoremediation with microalgae to reclaim nutrients has been convinced chang et al 2019 cheah et al 2016 el ouaer et al 2017 khanzada and ovez 2017 growth profiles of microalgae and wastewater treatment performance were still poor attributing to notorious properties of wastewater like high free ammonia nitrogen fan high chromaticity heavy metals toxic xenobiotic organics predators and osmotic pressure el ouaer et al 2017 khanzada and övez 2017 quan et al 2020 for example due to high chromaticity and free ammonia nitrogen in landfill leachate chang et al 2019 found that chlorella vulgaris could not survive in untreated landfill leachate el ouaer et al 2017 indicated that microalgae chlorella vulgaris could hardly grow in raw landfill leachate attributing to high heavy metals concentration with cell density of only 1 105 cells ml to enhance microalgae growth and nutrients removal when cultivated with wastewater many strategies were proposed like wastewater dilution adjustment of wastewater physical chemical properties and operating parameters optimization leng et al 2018 moreno garcia et al 2017 the commonly used dilution process by diluting wastewater with fresh water could effectively alleviate inhibiting effects on microalgae growth but large requirement of fresh water significantly intensified the fresh water scarcity quan et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 mixed landfill leachate with urban wastewater containing low ammonia concentration to mitigate the ammonia inhibiting on microalgae with minimum fresh water sacrifice as results a maximum ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was enhanced from 50 to 90 by decreasing the percentage of landfill leachate from 20 to 10 but the lipid productivity was still poor attributing to newly introduced inhibitory factors such as predator and turbidity in urban wastewater other method like isolation of ammonia tolerant microalgae strains was also developed to resolve the growth inhibition caused by wastewater toxicity khanzada and övez 2017 but isolated microalgae species were usually not widely applied to other wastewater streams therefore an effective approach to remediate wastewater with microalgae for biolipid production is lack as concentrated wastewater during ro process the roc contained much higher ammonium concentration than feeding wastewater which greatly elevated fan concentration and chromaticity of the waste stream and caused more serious effects on microalgae growth jiang et al 2018 uggetti et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore studies on microalgae cultivation with roc was scarce not to mentioning high efficiency nutrients reclamation from roc for microalgae biolipid production advanced oxidation processes aops mainly include ozone based aops o3 o3 h2o2 etc uv based aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 etc fenton based aops fenton photo fenton etc ultrasound plasma and electrooxidation miklos et al 2018 until now aops have been widely employed for wastewater treatment attributing to quick response controllable process and wide applicability bagastyo et al 2011 perez et al 2010 sarkka et al 2015 valero et al 2010 but the aops still have their inherent disadvantages like high energy consumption high economic input and by products contamination making the large scale application unsuitable miklos et al 2018 besides the aops could only remove inorganics and organics from wastewater but could hardly recover the possible valuable compounds like nitrogen phosphorus and organic matters as one type of the aops electrooxidation based roc treatment method coupling with microalgae remediation technique not only reduce the cost on roc disposal but also realize nutrients and organics reclamation herein an integrated technique containing electrooxidation and microalgae bioremediation was proposed for high efficiency roc remediation and microalgae biolipid production in detail during electrooxidation process high concentration of fan was partially removed to offset the inhibiting effect of fan on microalgae cells meanwhile chromaticity of roc was reduced since the structure of organic pollutants with chromophore group was destroyed which then enhanced light transmittance in culture medium then the oxidized roc was used as culture medium for microalgae chlorella vulgaris cultivation to produce biolipid the major objectives of present work were to assess performances of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation like nutrients removal microalgae growth and biolipid production discuss possible reaction mechanism during electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation via electron mass balance analysis and fluorescent characteristics investigate energy balance performance of the integrated technique and explore optimum operating condition for roc disposal and microalgae biolipid energy output 2 materials and methods 2 1 reverse osmosis concentrate sample the roc collected from fengsheng environmental protection co ltd chongqing china was used

were measured as 1600 100 pt co and 8 34 respectively 2 2 microalgae strain and pre cultivation the microalgae strain chlorella vulgaris fachb 31 adopted in this study was obtained from the institute

d07 7b beijing sevenstar flow co ltd china and bubbled into the culture medium at flow rate of 100 ml min all experiments were performed in an artificial climate chamber zgz 800c l china in which temperature and light intensity were kept constant at 25 c and 30 w m2 before microalgae cultivation the electrooxidized roc was exposed to sunlight for 5 h to dissipate the hypochlorite in the liquid phase to avoid influence of microbial in the roc on microalgae growth and metabolism all medium in the experiments were pre sterilized with autoclave sterilizer bxm 30r boxun shanghai china all experimental batches were conducted in duplicate and samples were detected day by day 2 4 analytical method 2 4 1 nutrients and cod concentration nutrients n o 3 and p o 4 3 concentration in the samples were detected with ion chromatography ics 600 thermofisher usa and all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm organic phase microporous membrane before determination cod was measured using fast digestion spectrophotometry method and n h 4 was determined according to nessler s reagent spectrophotometry huang et al 2018 2 4 2 free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration fan concentration mg l was calculated according to eq 1 as reported by chang et al 2019 1 f a n t a n 1 10 p h 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k where tan mg l denotes total ammonia nitrogen concentration t k denotes temperature kelvin ph of the roc was detected with ph meter 2 4 3 chromaticity of the roc chromaticity value of roc was measured according to the platinum cobalt standard colorimetric method american society for testing materials astm 2011 the chromaticity value of roc was calculated based on eq 2 2 chromaticity pt co p m where p in pt co denotes the chromaticity value of roc sample by comparing with pt co standard series solution and m denotes dilution rate of roc sample 2 4 4 dissolved organic matter in roc dissolved organic matter in roc were determined by uv254 and fluorescence spectrometry uv254 was measured with double beam ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu 1901 beijing china to depict the content of humic organics in roc sample like aromatic with cc double bonds and co double bonds three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem of untreated roc and electrooxidized roc was detected with a fluorescence spectrometer lumina thermofisher usa to illustrate changes of organics in the roc before detection all roc samples were vacuum filtered 0 22 μm 2 4 5 chlorella vulgaris growth and lipid content microalgae biomass concentration was determined by measuring sample optical density at 680 nm wavelength od 680 with the uv visible spectrophotometer the detected od 680 was converted to biomass concentration according to calibration curve eq 3 to acquire the calibration curve od 680 and dry weight of 50 ml microalgae suspension at different growth phase was measured then the calibration curve was acquired as eq 3 by fitting the biomass concentration with od 680 using linear formula 3 x g l 0 2103 o d 680 0 00642 r 2 0 997 where x g l and o d 680 are biomass concentration and optical density of microalgae suspension respectively lipid content and yield of chlorella vulgaris was detected with the method according to previous work chang et al 2018 the lipid yield ly g l of microalgae cultivation was calculated according to eq 4 4 l y g l x c where x g l and c w w denote the maximum biomass concentration and lipid content of chlorella vulgaris respectively 2 4 6 theoretical total electron amount and electron requirements for the removed cod n h 4 theoretical total electron amount tea in mm was calculated according to the current density loaded on the roc medium as following equ 5 5 t e a m m c e i e t e n v 1000 where c e is electron number for 1 a of current intensity which is 6 25 1018 i e a is current intensity that loaded on the roc which is 1a 5a 10a and 15a respectively in the experiment t e s is electrooxidation time n is atom number for 1 mol electrons which is 6 02 1023 and v l is volume of roc during electrooxidation process electron requirements for the removed cod or n h 4 were based on assumption that all the removed cod or n h 4 was degraded via electrooxidation besides it was also calculated assuming that o element in cod was oxidized to o2 and n element in n h 4 was oxidized to n2 this corresponds to 2 mol e for 1 mol cod degradation and 3 mol e for 1 mol n h 4 degradation the electron requirements for the removed cod or n h 4 were calculated according to following equ 6 6 r e q u i r e d e l e c t r o n s m m t e r m 1000 where t e is mol number of transfer electrons for 1 mol degradation matter which is 2 for cod and 3 for n h 4 r mg l is removed amount of cod or n h 4 and m is molar mass of cod or n h 4 which was 16 mg mmol for cod and 18 mg mmol for n h 4 2 4 7 energy balance analysis on the integrated technique to analyze energy balance of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae cultivation for nutrients reclamation and biolipid production microalgae lipid energy yield in kj l was calculated according to eq 7 zhang et al 2019a b 7 l i p i d e n e r g y y i e l d x c h v where hv kj g denotes the heat value of microalgae lipid which is 36 3 kj g according to ren et al 2014 input energy on electrooxidation was calculated according to eq 8 8 i n p u t e l e c t r i c e n e r g y k j 0 t p t d t 1000 where p t denotes the input electric power for the electrooxidation reactor and t min denotes electrolysis time the input energy on microalgae harvesting lipid extraction and lipid transesterification were calculated based on the data collected from the work by lardon et 2009 during calculation wet lipid extraction method was adopted due to low energy cost by avoiding the microalgae biomass drying process according to lardon et 2009 energy cost on microalgae harvesting via flocculation lipid extraction via hexane extraction and lipid transesterification via alcohol esterification were 10 6 30 8 and 0 9 kj g biodiesel in the work the input energy was converted into energy cost on per liter roc medium by considering lipid yield in roc under various current density input energy on roc autoclaving was calculated according to power density of the autoclave sterilizer in the experiment the power density of the sterilizer was 2 kw and could treat 30l of roc once during autoclaved sterilization 20 min of working time was adopted in the experiment thus the input energy on autoclaving was calculated as 80 kj l roc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of current density on roc physico chemical properties to investigate the effects of current density on roc properties during electrooxidation changes of inorganic salts n h 4 n o 3 p o 4 3 and fan concentration cod concentration uv254 and chromaticity of the roc after electrooxidation of 15 min were illustrated in fig 2 it can be observed that electrooxidation had significant influences on n h 4 p o 4 3 and cod removal but had little effect on n o 3 removal fig 2 a and b the fan concentration in the roc first sharply decreased from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 18 9 mg l in electrooxidized roc under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 but then the fan concentration changed little when current was further improved unlike fan concentration chromaticity of the roc monotonously decreased with the improving current density fig 2 c and d during electrooxidation process it was most probably that electrochemical degradation of n h 4 and organics occurred through two pathways i e direct electrooxidation at metal oxide electrodes mox and indirect electrooxidation by forming hypochlorite oxidant dominguez et al 2018 ukundimana et al 2018 for the direct electrooxidation of n h 4 and organics at anodes adsorbed hydroxyl radicals were first produced as following eq 9 since ph of the roc was alkaline ph 8 34 9 m o x o h m o x o h e then the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals degraded n h 4 eq 10 or organics eq 11 by the following reactions 10 n h 4 m o x o h n h 4 m o x 0 5 n 2 h 2 o 3 h 11 organics m o x o h o r g a n i c s m o x c o 2 h 2 o i n o r g a n i c i o n s besides the direct electrooxidation indirect electrooxidation occurred by first generating hypochlorite hclo as the following eqs 12 and 13 attributing to large amount of cl in the roc 12 2 c l c l 2 g a s 2 e 13 c l 2 g a s h 2 o h c l o h c l then the hclo which had strong oxidizing ability reacted with n h 4 eq 14 or organics eq 15 to degrade them into n2 co2 and h2o 14 n h 4 n h 4 1 5 h c l o 0 5 n 2 1 5 h 2 o 2 5 h 1 5 c l 15 organics h c l o o r g a n i c s c o 2 h 2 o h c l in the experiments organics and n h 4 that participated in electrooxidation reactions donated electrons and then the electrons participated in h2 evolution reaction at cathodes according to the following equ 16 isik et al 2020 ukundimana et al 2018 16 2 h 2 o 2 e o h h 2 as shown in fig 2 a n h 4 degradation rate was always higher than cod degradation rate under all current density which was probably because that the energy required for n h 4 degradation was lower than cod degradation and the results were consistent with the conclusion reported by feki et al 2009 and zhang et al 2011 as a result the n h 4 concentration was reduced from 473 0 mg l in untreated roc to 280 0 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 and 124 0 mg l under 48 75 ma cm2 high removal rate of n h 4 in the roc led to significant decrease of fan concentration from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 18 9 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 and 13 9 mg l under 48 75 ma cm2 it is worth mentioning that the increasing rate of n h 4 removal was fast when current density was improved from 0 to 3 25 and 16 25 ma cm2 but the increasing rate slowed down when current density was further improved while in contrast the increasing rate of cod removal was slow when current density was improved from 0 to 3 25 and 16 25 ma cm2 but the increasing rate of cod removal was accelerated when current density was improved from 16 25 to 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 the difference on n h 4 and cod removal efficiencies might be explained from perspectives of electron mass balance removed amount and efficiencies of inorganics and organics as well as electron mass balance under different current density during electrooxidation processes were shown in table 2 it can be seen that provided theoretical total electron amount was lower than sum of electron requirement for removed cod and n h 4 under all cases demonstrating that not all the removed cod and n h 4 were degraded via oxidation under low current density of 3 25 ma cm2 4 4 mm and 32 2 mm electrons were required if all cod or n h 4 were removed via oxidation but only 4 7 mm electrons were provided according to the eq 5 which was close to the electron requirement for the removed cod 4 4 mm this demonstrated that most of reduced n h 4 maybe not oxidized into n2 while its removal could be related to precipitation for example shu et al 2019 reported that ammonia nitrogen and phosphate were simultaneously removed from wastewater through struvite precipitation as seen in table 2 the electron saturability under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 was only 12 8 n h 4 competed for electrons with cod during electrooxidation at this time which limited cod degradation and led to low degradation rate of cod when current density was enhanced the electron saturability was improved meaning that the system contained more sufficient hydroxyl radicals and hclo for cod degradation it resulted in enhanced removal rate of cod in the roc during electrooxidation similar to change of n h 4 most p o 4 3 in the roc was removed during electrooxidation process but unlikely phosphorus removal mechanism was different from n h 4 and cod since phosphorus was hard to be degraded by electrooxidation or converted into gas it is possibly that phosphorus was removed via precipitation by reacting with metal ions like fe2 mg2 ji et al 2020 shu et al 2019 or other charged flocculation groups omwene et al 2018 generated during electrooxidation in contrast to n h 4 cod and phosphorus the electrooxidation had little effect on n o 3 degradation with n o 3 concentration of 247 260 mg l throughout the electrooxidation process it was probably because that the energy required for bond destruction of n o 3 was very high since valence state of n element in n o 3 was 5 which was very high and the electrons around n element were hard to be took away making the n o 3 hard to be electrooxidized aleem 1970 besides the inorganics in the roc effects of electrooxidation on chromaticity was also investigated it can be seen from fig 2 c and 2 d that chromaticity of the roc linearly decreased with the increase of current density with chromaticity value decreasing from 1600 pt co in untreated roc to 100 pt co under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 it was reported by huang et al 2018 that the chromaticity of wastewater was mainly caused by humic acids and unsaturated aromatic organics with chromophores like cc and co double bonds the variations of uv254 which was usually used to reflect content of aromatic organics and organics with unsaturated double bonds in liquid by researchers vakilabadi et al 2017 were quantitatively detected and presented in fig 2 d it is clearly observed that uv254 monotonously decreased along with the increasing current density in similar trend with the chromaticity it demonstrated that electrooxidation pretreatment effectively reduced chromaticity of the roc by destructing chromophores of the humic acids or unsaturated aromatic organics the transfer and conversion path of organics in the roc under various current density was investigated by detecting the fluorescent characteristics as shown in fig 3 and table 3 it can be seen that fluorescence peak of the raw roc totally located in zone v ex em of 380 469 9 nm with intensity of 25751 2 a u when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was provided to the electrooxidation reactor the fluorescence peak transferred to ex em of 370 450 9 nm moving toward zone iv in addition intensity of the fluorescence peak was reduced to 22591 1 a u table 2 it demonstrated that the humic acids was degraded into other compounds like family of soluble microbial by products when current density was further improved the fluorescence peak was mostly scattered and the intensity of fluorescence peak was greatly reduced at the same time fluorescence intensity in zone iv was greatly improved meaning that more soluble microbial by products were generated under current intensity of 48 75 ma cm2 the fluorescence intensity of roc was 5266 0 a u which was 79 6 lower than the untreated roc it can be concluded that electrooxidation degraded chromophores of the humic acids or unsaturated aromatic organics into other compounds which were non blooming like family of soluble microbial by products and thus reducing the chromaticity of roc 3 2 effects of electrooxidation on microalgae growth and lipid synthesis physico chemical parameters of the roc presented in table 1 demonstrated that the roc contained copious inorganics and organics that could be used as nutrients and carbon source for microalgae growth and lipid production such as n h 4 473 0 16 1 mg l n o 3 246 9 1 8 mg l p o 4 3 63 8 1 4 mg l and cod 540 0 2 6 mg l however high chromaticity and fan concentration in the roc might be severe problems for microalgae growth fortunately electrooxidation pretreatment effectively reduced the chromaticity and fan concentration in the roc which had great potential to enhance microalgae biomass and lipid accumulation when using the oxidized roc as culture medium to evaluate performances of the electrooxidation treatment technique effects of current density on microalge growth and lipid yield were investigated and results were shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that the maximum biomass concentration of 1 27 g l was acquired under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 which was 29 6 higher than the biomass concentration 0 98 g l in the untreated roc at the same time the maximum lipid yield of 491 5 mg l was obtained under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it can be seen from fig 2 that both inorganics and organics were available in untreated and oxidized roc thus it is reasonable to conclude that the microalgae grew under mixotrophic mode when microalgae was cultivated in the untreated roc the chromaticity of the roc 1600 pt co and fan concentration 53 0 mg l was very high according to previous works by kumar et al 2010 and markou 2015 ammonia nitrogen concentration of higher than 20 mg l in culture medium could cause inhibiting effects on chlorella vulgaris growth thus it is reasonable to conclude that the high fan concentration in the untreated roc resulted in severe negative effects on microalgae growth additionally the high chromaticity of the roc reduced light transfer in microalgae cultures and limited photosynthesis of microalgae cells resulting in low microalgae biomass concentration of 0 98 g l in untreated roc when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was loaded on the electrooxidation reactor the chromaticity and fan concentration were greatly reduced to 900 pt co and 18 9 mg l reducing by 43 8 and 64 3 respectively the reduced chromaticity and fan concentration under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 were conducive to microalgae growth at the same time it can be seen from table 2 that fluorescence intensity of macromolecular organics in the roc decreased from 25751 2 a u in untreated roc to 22591 1 a u under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 decreased by 12 3 while only 6 6 of cod in the roc was reduced from 540 0 mg l in untreated roc to 504 6 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it demonstrated that a part of macromolecular organics in the roc was degraded into small molecular organics by loading 3 25 ma cm2 of current which provided more bioabsorbable organics for microalgae cells this can be verified by the amount of utilized cod during microalgae cultivation under different current density as was presented in fig 4 c it can be seen that amount of utilized cod increased from 87 2 mg l in untreated roc to 146 7 mg l in oxidized roc under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 attributing to the lower chromaticity lower fan concentration and higher bioabsorbable cod amount under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 the maximum biomass concentration was improved to 1 27 g l however when higher current was provided especially when current density 32 5 ma cm2 the maximum biomass concentration was reduced than that under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it was reported that macromolecular organics in wastewater were first degraded into small molecular organics and then the small molecular organics were further degraded into carbon dioxide and water during electrooxidation process kuppusamy et al 2017 the higher current density when current density 32 5 ma cm2 in the work probably removed most of the bioabsorbable small molecular organics in the roc medium reducing the utilized cod amount from 146 7 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 to 124 3 80 3 and 34 6 mg l under current density of 16 25 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 as results the lower utilized cod amount contributed to reduction of the maximum biomass concentration to 1 21 1 15 and 0 67 g l under current density of 16 25 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 respectively the lipid content and lipid yield of microalgae under different current density were detected and illustrated in fig 4 b changes of microalgae lipid content under different current density showed similar trend with the maximum biomass concentration with the highest lipid content of 38 7 under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 since lipid yield was product of microalgae biomass concentration and lipid content the highest lipid yield of 491 5 mg l was obtained under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 when current density was higher than 3 25 ma cm2 the lipid content and lipid yield was reduced it was probably because that fan and chromaticity of the roc was further removed making the condition was more conducive to protein and carbon skeleton synthesis rather than lipid synthesis perez garcia et al 2011 3 3 effects of electrooxidation on inorganics and organics removal inorganic salts like n h 4 n o 3 and p o 4 3 are potential pollutants to water system which can cause water eutrophication and death of aquatic organisms effective removal of these inorganics from wastewater are primary targets for environmental scientists in the work effectiveness of roc disposal with the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation with microalgae phytoremediation was investigated and results are shown in fig 5 tables 2 and 4 it can be seen from tables 2 and 4 that sole electrooxidation process and sole microalgae phytoremediation process had poor effects on roc purification for example n o 3 could hardly be removed by sole electrooxidation when microalgae was cultivated in the roc without electrooxidation n h 4 and n o 3 removal efficiencies were only 36 2 and 66 5 respectively in contrast the n h 4 and n o 3 removal efficiencies were greatly enhanced to 88 4 and 90 3 under low current density of 3 25 ma cm2 for the integrated process of electrooxidation and microalgae remediation when current density was higher than 16 25 ma cm2 almost all n h 4 and more than 94 of n o 3 could be removed from the roc in the work inorganics were mainly removed through two ways i e electrooxidation and microalgae assimilation when microalgae was directly cultivated in the roc without electrooxidized high fan and chromaticity of the roc inhibited microalgae growth which then inhibited inorganics assimilation by microalgae attributing to low nutrients requirement as results only 36 2 of n h 4 and 66 5 of n o 3 were removed by microalgae cells table 4 resulting in high residual n h 4 301 9 mg l and n o 3 82 7 mg l concentration in the effluent medium fig 5 when the roc was electrooxidized under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 the n h 4 removal efficiency was improved to 88 4 in which 40 8 was contributed by electrooxidation process and 47 6 was contributed by microalgae cultivation process tables 2 and 4 it is worth mentioning that when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was provided to the system both n h 4 and n o 3 assimilation by microalgae cultivation were enhanced attributing to the higher growth rate of microalgae as results residual n h 4 and n o 3 concentrations in roc medium were reduced to 54 8 mg l and 23 9 mg l fig 5 when current density was further improved n h 4 removal was enhanced to 100 and n o 3 removal was enhanced to a value higher than 92 but it is interesting that the improved nitrogen removal was mainly ascribed to the electrooxidation process which removed more nutrients from the roc and led to nutrients limitation to microalgae cells this probably contributed to the reduction on microalgae growth and led to lower maximum biomass concentration fig 4 in addition it can also be observed from fig 5 tables 2 and 4 that phosphorus in the roc was totally removed under all cases which is probably because that the phosphorus nutrients was limitation for microalgae at initial in conclusion the n h 4 n o 3 and p o 4 3 in the effluent roc after electrooxidation and microalgae remediation processes were mostly removed making the roc could basically meet the wastewater rejection standard 25 mg l for n h 4 3 mg l for p o 4 3 gb16889 2008 from the perspective of inorganics 3 4 energy consumption analysis and microalgal lipid energy yield as discussed before electrooxidation had great positive effects on roc purification microalgae growth and lipid production to evaluate the energy balance performance of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae cultivation energy consumption analysis and microalgae lipid energy yield during electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation were shown in fig 6 and table 5 it is clearly seen that the energy consumed on electrooxidation microalgae harvesting lipid extraction and lipid transesterification were relatively low ranging from 0 2 to 27 7 kj l when comparing with input energy on the roc autoclaving 80 kj l the highest lipid energy yield of 17 9 kj l was reached under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 which could basically compensate the total input energy despite autoclaving 22 2 kj l when microalgae was cultivated in untreated roc or under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 input energy on electrooxidation was very low at this time roc autoclaving microalgae harvesting and lipid extraction were major energy intensive processes table 5 the microalgae lipid energy yield could basically compensate the total energy consumption despite autoclaving fig 6 when current density was improved to a value higher than 3 25 ma cm2 the input energy on electrooxidation was obviously enhanced while the lipid energy yield decreased attributing to reduced biomass concentration and lipid content in particular under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 the lipid energy yield was reduced to 7 2 kj l which was much lower than the energy cost on electrooxidation 27 7 kj l under this condition table 5 therefore lipid energy yield under current density higher than 3 25 ma cm2 was far from meeting the total input energy despite autoclaved sterilization though lipid energy yield was relatively low it is noteworthy that only lipid production was considered in the study and other profits brought by this integrated technique like roc treatment co2 mitigation as well as microalgae based proteins and carbohydrates generation were non ignorable in addition it can close environmental carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and realize nutrients conservation thus the technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae remediation for bioenergy production is a promising candidate for nutrients reclamation from roc to produce bioresources 4 conclusions electrooxidation significant reduced fan concentration from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 13 9 mg l under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 electron mass balance showed that provided theoretical total electron amount was lower than electron requirement for the removed n h 4 and cod under all cases indicating that part of reduced nitrogen and phosphorus were removed via precipitation chromaticity of the roc was reduced from 1600 to 100 pt co via electrooxidation fluorescence analysis demonstrated that decrease of the chromaticity was mainly caused by destruction of humic acids into other compounds like family of soluble microbial by products the maximum microalgae biomass concentration and lipid yield of 1 27 g l and 491 5 mg l were achieved under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 under this condition microalgae lipid energy yield 17 9 kj l could almost cover total input

18063,phytoremediation of reverse osmosis concentrate roc with microalgae can simultaneously achieve multi functions of roc treatment co2 mitigation and microalgae biolipid production but the performances are usually inhibited by high free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration and chromaticity of roc to offset these negative effects an integrated technique including electrooxidation pretreatment and chlorella vulgaris remediation was proposed in which the roc was first pretreated with electrooxidation to decrease fan and chromaticity and then the oxidized roc was remediated with microalgae to reclaim nutrients and produce biolipid results showed that fan was sharply reduced from 53 0 mg n l to 13 9 mg n l and chromaticity was decreased from 1600 to 100 pt co via electrooxidation possible reaction mechanism of nutrients removal was discussed via electron mass balance explanation on chromaticity decrease was revealed by analyzing humic acid conversion path with fluorescence characteristics during microalgae remediation process nutrients removal rate microalgae biomass concentration and lipid yield were effectively enhanced in electrooxidized roc energy balance analysis indicated that microalge lipid energy under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 basically compensated total input energy despite roc sterilization this work provided a promising strategy for large scale roc treatment and microalgae biolipid production graphical abstract image 10350 keywords reverse osmosis concentrate microalgae free ammonia nitrogen chromaticity electrooxidation 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro which is a pressure driven membrane separation technique for wastewater treatment is commonly employed for most wastewater treatment plants attributing to high efficiency pollutants separation and easy operation maeng et al 2018 woo et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a however the large quantity of reverse osmosis concentrate roc generated during ro process is very difficult to dispose since the pollutants like ammonium and chromaticity are usually overwhelmingly higher than that in the influent stream woo et al 2019 directly discharge of roc can induce destruction of water system and threaten human health wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to explore a practical method to treat roc before discharge currently the commonly used methods for roc disposal include biological treatment membrane separation chemical methods and activated carbon adsorption attributing to relatively easy operation however there still exist a series of problems such as high cost on sugar feeding for biological treatment due to low c n ratio of roc membrane fouling and aging problems for membrane separation process high energy consumption on advanced oxidation process and active carbon regeneration which hindered the large scale application of these techniques anis et al 2019 ghyselbrecht et al 2012 joo et al 2014 besides it is noteworthy that previous methods mainly focused on the removal of pollutants from roc streams but ignored recovery of valuable compounds leading to severe waste of resources microalgae can uptake nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater as nutrient source and fix co2 in flue gas as carbon source for photosynthesis to produce biolipid carbohydrate and protein zhu et al 2018 meaning that culturing microalgae with wastewater can simultaneously reduce cost on wastewater disposal carbon mitigation and microalgae based bioenergy production fu et al 2019 although feasibility of wastewater phytoremediation with microalgae to reclaim nutrients has been convinced chang et al 2019 cheah et al 2016 el ouaer et al 2017 khanzada and ovez 2017 growth profiles of microalgae and wastewater treatment performance were still poor attributing to notorious properties of wastewater like high free ammonia nitrogen fan high chromaticity heavy metals toxic xenobiotic organics predators and osmotic pressure el ouaer et al 2017 khanzada and övez 2017 quan et al 2020 for example due to high chromaticity and free ammonia nitrogen in landfill leachate chang et al 2019 found that chlorella vulgaris could not survive in untreated landfill leachate el ouaer et al 2017 indicated that microalgae chlorella vulgaris could hardly grow in raw landfill leachate attributing to high heavy metals concentration with cell density of only 1 105 cells ml to enhance microalgae growth and nutrients removal when cultivated with wastewater many strategies were proposed like wastewater dilution adjustment of wastewater physical chemical properties and operating parameters optimization leng et al 2018 moreno garcia et al 2017 the commonly used dilution process by diluting wastewater with fresh water could effectively alleviate inhibiting effects on microalgae growth but large requirement of fresh water significantly intensified the fresh water scarcity quan et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 mixed landfill leachate with urban wastewater containing low ammonia concentration to mitigate the ammonia inhibiting on microalgae with minimum fresh water sacrifice as results a maximum ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was enhanced from 50 to 90 by decreasing the percentage of landfill leachate from 20 to 10 but the lipid productivity was still poor attributing to newly introduced inhibitory factors such as predator and turbidity in urban wastewater other method like isolation of ammonia tolerant microalgae strains was also developed to resolve the growth inhibition caused by wastewater toxicity khanzada and övez 2017 but isolated microalgae species were usually not widely applied to other wastewater streams therefore an effective approach to remediate wastewater with microalgae for biolipid production is lack as concentrated wastewater during ro process the roc contained much higher ammonium concentration than feeding wastewater which greatly elevated fan concentration and chromaticity of the waste stream and caused more serious effects on microalgae growth jiang et al 2018 uggetti et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 therefore studies on microalgae cultivation with roc was scarce not to mentioning high efficiency nutrients reclamation from roc for microalgae biolipid production advanced oxidation processes aops mainly include ozone based aops o3 o3 h2o2 etc uv based aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 etc fenton based aops fenton photo fenton etc ultrasound plasma and electrooxidation miklos et al 2018 until now aops have been widely employed for wastewater treatment attributing to quick response controllable process and wide applicability bagastyo et al 2011 perez et al 2010 sarkka et al 2015 valero et al 2010 but the aops still have their inherent disadvantages like high energy consumption high economic input and by products contamination making the large scale application unsuitable miklos et al 2018 besides the aops could only remove inorganics and organics from wastewater but could hardly recover the possible valuable compounds like nitrogen phosphorus and organic matters as one type of the aops electrooxidation based roc treatment method coupling with microalgae remediation technique not only reduce the cost on roc disposal but also realize nutrients and organics reclamation herein an integrated technique containing electrooxidation and microalgae bioremediation was proposed for high efficiency roc remediation and microalgae biolipid production in detail during electrooxidation process high concentration of fan was partially removed to offset the inhibiting effect of fan on microalgae cells meanwhile chromaticity of roc was reduced since the structure of organic pollutants with chromophore group was destroyed which then enhanced light transmittance in culture medium then the oxidized roc was used as culture medium for microalgae chlorella vulgaris cultivation to produce biolipid the major objectives of present work were to assess performances of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation like nutrients removal microalgae growth and biolipid production discuss possible reaction mechanism during electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation via electron mass balance analysis and fluorescent characteristics investigate energy balance performance of the integrated technique and explore optimum operating condition for roc disposal and microalgae biolipid energy output 2 materials and methods 2 1 reverse osmosis concentrate sample the roc collected from fengsheng environmental protection co ltd chongqing china was used

temperature and light intensity were kept constant at 25 c and 30 w m2 before microalgae cultivation the electrooxidized roc was exposed to sunlight for 5 h to dissipate the hypochlorite in the liquid phase to avoid influence of microbial in the roc on microalgae growth and metabolism all medium in the experiments were pre sterilized with autoclave sterilizer bxm 30r boxun shanghai china all experimental batches were conducted in duplicate and samples were detected day by day 2 4 analytical method 2 4 1 nutrients and cod concentration nutrients n o 3 and p o 4 3 concentration in the

digestion spectrophotometry method and n h 4 was determined according to nessler s reagent spectrophotometry huang et al 2018 2 4 2 free ammonia nitrogen fan concentration fan concentration mg l was calculated according to eq 1 as reported by chang et al 2019 1 f a n t a n 1 10 p h 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k where tan mg l denotes total ammonia nitrogen concentration t k denotes temperature kelvin ph of the roc was detected with ph meter 2 4 3 chromaticity of the roc chromaticity value of roc was measured according to the platinum cobalt standard colorimetric method american society for testing materials astm 2011 the chromaticity value of roc was calculated based on eq 2 2 chromaticity pt co p m where p in pt co denotes the chromaticity value of roc sample by comparing with pt co standard series solution and m denotes dilution rate of roc sample 2 4 4 dissolved organic matter in roc dissolved organic matter in roc were determined by uv254 and fluorescence spectrometry uv254 was measured with double beam ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer tu 1901 beijing china to depict the content of humic organics in roc sample like aromatic with cc double bonds and co double bonds three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem of untreated roc and electrooxidized roc was detected with a fluorescence spectrometer lumina thermofisher usa to illustrate changes of organics in the roc before detection all roc samples were vacuum filtered 0 22 μm 2 4 5 chlorella vulgaris growth and lipid content microalgae biomass concentration was determined by measuring sample optical density at 680 nm wavelength od 680 with the uv visible spectrophotometer the detected od 680 was converted to biomass concentration according to calibration curve eq 3 to acquire the calibration curve od 680 and dry weight of 50 ml microalgae suspension at different growth phase was measured then the calibration curve was acquired as eq 3 by fitting the biomass concentration with od 680 using linear formula 3 x g l 0 2103 o d 680 0 00642 r 2 0 997 where x g l and o d 680 are biomass concentration and optical density of microalgae suspension respectively lipid content and yield of chlorella vulgaris was detected with the method according to previous work chang et al 2018 the lipid yield ly g l of microalgae cultivation was calculated according to eq 4 4 l y g l x c where x g l and c w w denote the maximum biomass concentration and lipid content of chlorella vulgaris respectively 2 4 6 theoretical total electron amount and electron requirements for the removed cod n h 4 theoretical total electron amount tea in mm was calculated according to the current density loaded on the roc medium as following equ 5 5 t e a m m c e i e t e n v 1000 where c e is electron number for 1 a of current intensity which is 6 25 1018 i e a is current intensity that loaded on the roc which is 1a 5a 10a and 15a respectively in the experiment t e s is electrooxidation time n is atom number for 1 mol electrons which is 6 02 1023 and v l is volume of roc during electrooxidation process electron requirements for the removed cod or n h 4 were based on assumption that all the removed cod or n h 4 was degraded via electrooxidation besides it was also calculated assuming that o element in cod was oxidized to o2 and n element in n h 4 was oxidized to n2 this corresponds to 2 mol e for 1 mol cod degradation and 3 mol e for 1 mol n h 4 degradation the electron requirements for the removed cod or n h 4 were calculated according to following equ 6 6 r e q u i r e d e l e c t r o n s m m t e r m 1000 where t e is mol number of transfer electrons for 1 mol degradation matter which is 2 for cod and 3 for n h 4 r mg l is removed amount of cod or n h 4 and m is molar mass of cod or n h 4 which was 16 mg mmol for cod and 18 mg mmol for n h 4 2 4 7 energy balance analysis on the integrated technique to analyze energy balance of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae cultivation for nutrients reclamation and biolipid production microalgae lipid energy yield in kj l was calculated according to eq 7 zhang et al 2019a b 7 l i p i d e n e r g y y i e l d x c h v where hv kj g denotes the heat value of microalgae lipid which is 36 3 kj g according to ren et al 2014 input energy on electrooxidation was calculated according to eq 8 8 i n p u t e l e c t r i c e n e r g y k j 0 t p t d t 1000 where p t denotes the input electric power for the electrooxidation reactor and t min denotes electrolysis time the input energy on microalgae harvesting lipid extraction and lipid transesterification were calculated based on the data collected from the work by lardon et 2009 during calculation wet lipid extraction method was adopted due to low energy cost by avoiding the microalgae biomass drying process according to lardon et 2009 energy cost on microalgae harvesting via flocculation lipid extraction via hexane extraction and lipid transesterification via alcohol esterification were 10 6 30 8 and 0 9 kj g biodiesel in the work the input energy was converted into energy cost on per liter roc medium by considering lipid yield in roc under various current density input energy on roc autoclaving was calculated according to power density of the autoclave sterilizer in the experiment the power density of the sterilizer was 2 kw and could treat 30l of roc once during autoclaved sterilization 20 min of working time was adopted in the experiment thus the input energy on autoclaving was calculated as 80 kj l roc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of current density on roc physico chemical properties to investigate the effects of current density on roc properties during electrooxidation changes of inorganic salts n h 4 n o 3 p o 4 3 and fan concentration cod concentration uv254 and chromaticity of the roc after electrooxidation of 15 min were illustrated in fig 2 it can be observed that electrooxidation had significant influences on n h 4 p o 4 3 and cod removal but had little effect on n o 3 removal fig 2 a and b the fan concentration in the roc first sharply decreased from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 18 9 mg l in electrooxidized roc under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 but then the fan concentration changed little when current was further improved unlike fan concentration chromaticity of the roc monotonously decreased with the improving current density fig 2 c and d during electrooxidation process it was most probably that electrochemical degradation of n h 4 and organics occurred through two pathways i e direct electrooxidation at metal oxide electrodes mox and indirect electrooxidation by forming hypochlorite oxidant dominguez et al 2018 ukundimana et al 2018 for the direct electrooxidation of n h 4 and organics at anodes adsorbed hydroxyl radicals were first produced as following eq 9 since ph of the roc was alkaline ph 8 34 9 m o x o h m o x o h e then the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals degraded n h 4 eq 10 or organics eq 11 by the following reactions 10 n h 4 m o x o h n h 4 m o x 0 5 n 2 h 2 o 3 h 11 organics m o x o h o r g a n i c s m o x c o 2 h 2 o i n o r g a n i c i o n s besides the direct electrooxidation indirect electrooxidation occurred by first generating hypochlorite hclo as the following eqs 12 and 13 attributing to large amount of cl in the roc 12 2 c l c l 2 g a s 2 e 13 c l 2 g a s h 2 o h c l o h c l then the hclo which had strong oxidizing ability reacted with n h 4 eq 14 or organics eq 15 to degrade them into n2 co2 and h2o 14 n h 4 n h 4 1 5 h c l o 0 5 n 2 1 5 h 2 o 2 5 h 1 5 c l 15 organics h c l o o r g a n i c s c o 2 h 2 o h c l in the experiments organics and n h 4 that participated in electrooxidation reactions donated electrons and then the electrons participated in h2 evolution reaction at cathodes according to the following equ 16 isik et al 2020 ukundimana et al 2018 16 2 h 2 o 2 e o h h 2 as shown in fig 2 a n h 4 degradation rate was always higher than cod degradation rate under all current density which was probably because that the energy required for n h 4 degradation was lower than cod degradation and the results were consistent with the conclusion reported by feki et al 2009 and zhang et al 2011 as a result the n h 4 concentration was reduced from 473 0 mg l in untreated roc to 280 0 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 and 124 0 mg l under 48 75 ma cm2 high removal rate of n h 4 in the roc led to significant decrease of fan concentration from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 18 9 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 and 13 9 mg l under 48 75 ma cm2 it is worth mentioning that the increasing rate of n h 4 removal was fast when current density was improved from 0 to 3 25 and 16 25 ma cm2 but the increasing rate slowed down when current density was further improved while in contrast the increasing rate of cod removal was slow when current density was improved from 0 to 3 25 and 16 25 ma cm2 but the increasing rate of cod removal was accelerated when current density was improved from 16 25 to 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 the difference on n h 4 and cod removal efficiencies might be explained from perspectives of electron mass balance removed amount and efficiencies of inorganics and organics as well as electron mass balance under different current density during electrooxidation processes were shown in table 2 it can be seen that provided theoretical total electron amount was lower than sum of electron requirement for removed cod and n h 4 under all cases demonstrating that not all the removed cod and n h 4 were degraded via oxidation under low current density of 3 25 ma cm2 4 4 mm and 32 2 mm electrons were required if all cod or n h 4 were removed via oxidation but only 4 7 mm electrons were provided according to the eq 5 which was close to the electron requirement for the removed cod 4 4 mm this demonstrated that most of reduced n h 4 maybe not oxidized into n2 while its removal could be related to precipitation for example shu et al 2019 reported that ammonia nitrogen and phosphate were simultaneously removed from wastewater through struvite precipitation as seen in table 2 the electron saturability under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 was only 12 8 n h 4 competed for electrons with cod during electrooxidation at this time which limited cod degradation and led to low degradation rate of cod when current density was enhanced the electron saturability was improved meaning that the system contained more sufficient hydroxyl radicals and hclo for cod degradation it resulted in enhanced removal rate of cod in the roc during electrooxidation similar to change of n h 4 most p o 4 3 in the roc was removed during electrooxidation process but unlikely phosphorus removal mechanism was different from n h 4 and cod since phosphorus was hard to be degraded by electrooxidation or converted into gas it is possibly that phosphorus was removed via precipitation by reacting with metal ions like fe2 mg2 ji et al 2020 shu et al 2019 or other charged flocculation groups omwene et al 2018 generated during electrooxidation in contrast to n h 4 cod and phosphorus the electrooxidation had little effect on n o 3 degradation with n o 3 concentration of 247 260 mg l throughout the electrooxidation process it was probably because that the energy required for bond destruction of n o 3 was very high since valence state of n element in n o 3 was 5 which was very high and the electrons around n element were hard to be took away making the n o 3 hard to be electrooxidized aleem 1970 besides the inorganics in the roc effects of electrooxidation on chromaticity was also investigated it can be seen from fig 2 c and 2 d that chromaticity of the roc linearly decreased with the increase of current density with chromaticity value decreasing from 1600 pt co in untreated roc to 100 pt co under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 it was reported by huang et al 2018 that the chromaticity of wastewater was mainly caused by humic acids and unsaturated aromatic organics with chromophores like cc and co double bonds the variations of uv254 which was usually used to reflect content of aromatic organics and organics with unsaturated double bonds in liquid by researchers vakilabadi et al 2017 were quantitatively detected and presented in fig 2 d it is clearly observed that uv254 monotonously decreased along with the increasing current density in similar trend with the chromaticity it demonstrated that electrooxidation pretreatment effectively reduced chromaticity of the roc by destructing chromophores of the humic acids or unsaturated aromatic organics the transfer and conversion path of organics in the roc under various current density was investigated by detecting the fluorescent characteristics as shown in fig 3 and table 3 it can be seen that fluorescence peak of the raw roc totally located in zone v ex em of 380 469 9 nm with intensity of 25751 2 a u when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was provided to the electrooxidation reactor the fluorescence peak transferred to ex em of 370 450 9 nm moving toward zone iv in addition intensity of the fluorescence peak was reduced to 22591 1 a u table 2 it demonstrated that the humic acids was degraded into other compounds like family of soluble microbial by products when current density was further improved the fluorescence peak was mostly scattered and the intensity of fluorescence peak was greatly reduced at the same time fluorescence intensity in zone iv was greatly improved meaning that more soluble microbial by products were generated under current intensity of 48 75 ma cm2 the fluorescence intensity of roc was 5266 0 a u which was 79 6 lower than the untreated roc it can be concluded that electrooxidation degraded chromophores of the humic acids or unsaturated aromatic organics into other compounds which were non blooming like family of soluble microbial by products and thus reducing the chromaticity of roc 3 2 effects of electrooxidation on microalgae growth and lipid synthesis physico chemical parameters of the roc presented in table 1 demonstrated that the roc contained copious inorganics and organics that could be used as nutrients and carbon source for microalgae growth and lipid production such as n h 4 473 0 16 1 mg l n o 3 246 9 1 8 mg l p o 4 3 63 8 1 4 mg l and cod 540 0 2 6 mg l however high chromaticity and fan concentration in the roc might be severe problems for microalgae growth fortunately electrooxidation pretreatment effectively reduced the chromaticity and fan concentration in the roc which had great potential to enhance microalgae biomass and lipid accumulation when using the oxidized roc as culture medium to evaluate performances of the electrooxidation treatment technique effects of current density on microalge growth and lipid yield were investigated and results were shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the figure that the maximum biomass concentration of 1 27 g l was acquired under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 which was 29 6 higher than the biomass concentration 0 98 g l in the untreated roc at the same time the maximum lipid yield of 491 5 mg l was obtained under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it can be seen from fig 2 that both inorganics and organics were available in untreated and oxidized roc thus it is reasonable to conclude that the microalgae grew under mixotrophic mode when microalgae was cultivated in the untreated roc the chromaticity of the roc 1600 pt co and fan concentration 53 0 mg l was very high according to previous works by kumar et al 2010 and markou 2015 ammonia nitrogen concentration of higher than 20 mg l in culture medium could cause inhibiting effects on chlorella vulgaris growth thus it is reasonable to conclude that the high fan concentration in the untreated roc resulted in severe negative effects on microalgae growth additionally the high chromaticity of the roc reduced light transfer in microalgae cultures and limited photosynthesis of microalgae cells resulting in low microalgae biomass concentration of 0 98 g l in untreated roc when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was loaded on the electrooxidation reactor the chromaticity and fan concentration were greatly reduced to 900 pt co and 18 9 mg l reducing by 43 8 and 64 3 respectively the reduced chromaticity and fan concentration under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 were conducive to microalgae growth at the same time it can be seen from table 2 that fluorescence intensity of macromolecular organics in the roc decreased from 25751 2 a u in untreated roc to 22591 1 a u under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 decreased by 12 3 while only 6 6 of cod in the roc was reduced from 540 0 mg l in untreated roc to 504 6 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it demonstrated that a part of macromolecular organics in the roc was degraded into small molecular organics by loading 3 25 ma cm2 of current which provided more bioabsorbable organics for microalgae cells this can be verified by the amount of utilized cod during microalgae cultivation under different current density as was presented in fig 4 c it can be seen that amount of utilized cod increased from 87 2 mg l in untreated roc to 146 7 mg l in oxidized roc under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 attributing to the lower chromaticity lower fan concentration and higher bioabsorbable cod amount under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 the maximum biomass concentration was improved to 1 27 g l however when higher current was provided especially when current density 32 5 ma cm2 the maximum biomass concentration was reduced than that under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 it was reported that macromolecular organics in wastewater were first degraded into small molecular organics and then the small molecular organics were further degraded into carbon dioxide and water during electrooxidation process kuppusamy et al 2017 the higher current density when current density 32 5 ma cm2 in the work probably removed most of the bioabsorbable small molecular organics in the roc medium reducing the utilized cod amount from 146 7 mg l under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 to 124 3 80 3 and 34 6 mg l under current density of 16 25 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 as results the lower utilized cod amount contributed to reduction of the maximum biomass concentration to 1 21 1 15 and 0 67 g l under current density of 16 25 32 5 and 48 75 ma cm2 respectively the lipid content and lipid yield of microalgae under different current density were detected and illustrated in fig 4 b changes of microalgae lipid content under different current density showed similar trend with the maximum biomass concentration with the highest lipid content of 38 7 under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 since lipid yield was product of microalgae biomass concentration and lipid content the highest lipid yield of 491 5 mg l was obtained under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 when current density was higher than 3 25 ma cm2 the lipid content and lipid yield was reduced it was probably because that fan and chromaticity of the roc was further removed making the condition was more conducive to protein and carbon skeleton synthesis rather than lipid synthesis perez garcia et al 2011 3 3 effects of electrooxidation on inorganics and organics removal inorganic salts like n h 4 n o 3 and p o 4 3 are potential pollutants to water system which can cause water eutrophication and death of aquatic organisms effective removal of these inorganics from wastewater are primary targets for environmental scientists in the work effectiveness of roc disposal with the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation with microalgae phytoremediation was investigated and results are shown in fig 5 tables 2 and 4 it can be seen from tables 2 and 4 that sole electrooxidation process and sole microalgae phytoremediation process had poor effects on roc purification for example n o 3 could hardly be removed by sole electrooxidation when microalgae was cultivated in the roc without electrooxidation n h 4 and n o 3 removal efficiencies were only 36 2 and 66 5 respectively in contrast the n h 4 and n o 3 removal efficiencies were greatly enhanced to 88 4 and 90 3 under low current density of 3 25 ma cm2 for the integrated process of electrooxidation and microalgae remediation when current density was higher than 16 25 ma cm2 almost all n h 4 and more than 94 of n o 3 could be removed from the roc in the work inorganics were mainly removed through two ways i e electrooxidation and microalgae assimilation when microalgae was directly cultivated in the roc without electrooxidized high fan and chromaticity of the roc inhibited microalgae growth which then inhibited inorganics assimilation by microalgae attributing to low nutrients requirement as results only 36 2 of n h 4 and 66 5 of n o 3 were removed by microalgae cells table 4 resulting in high residual n h 4 301 9 mg l and n o 3 82 7 mg l concentration in the effluent medium fig 5 when the roc was electrooxidized under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 the n h 4 removal efficiency was improved to 88 4 in which 40 8 was contributed by electrooxidation process and 47 6 was contributed by microalgae cultivation process tables 2 and 4 it is worth mentioning that when 3 25 ma cm2 of current was provided to the system both n h 4 and n o 3 assimilation by microalgae cultivation were enhanced attributing to the higher growth rate of microalgae as results residual n h 4 and n o 3 concentrations in roc medium were reduced to 54 8 mg l and 23 9 mg l fig 5 when current density was further improved n h 4 removal was enhanced to 100 and n o 3 removal was enhanced to a value higher than 92 but it is interesting that the improved nitrogen removal was mainly ascribed to the electrooxidation process which removed more nutrients from the roc and led to nutrients limitation to microalgae cells this probably contributed to the reduction on microalgae growth and led to lower maximum biomass concentration fig 4 in addition it can also be observed from fig 5 tables 2 and 4 that phosphorus in the roc was totally removed under all cases which is probably because that the phosphorus nutrients was limitation for microalgae at initial in conclusion the n h 4 n o 3 and p o 4 3 in the effluent roc after electrooxidation and microalgae remediation processes were mostly removed making the roc could basically meet the wastewater rejection standard 25 mg l for n h 4 3 mg l for p o 4 3 gb16889 2008 from the perspective of inorganics 3 4 energy consumption analysis and microalgal lipid energy yield as discussed before electrooxidation had great positive effects on roc purification microalgae growth and lipid production to evaluate the energy balance performance of the proposed technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae cultivation energy consumption analysis and microalgae lipid energy yield during electrooxidation and microalgae phytoremediation were shown in fig 6 and table 5 it is clearly seen that the energy consumed on electrooxidation microalgae harvesting lipid extraction and lipid transesterification were relatively low ranging from 0 2 to 27 7 kj l when comparing with input energy on the roc autoclaving 80 kj l the highest lipid energy yield of 17 9 kj l was reached under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 which could basically compensate the total input energy despite autoclaving 22 2 kj l when microalgae was cultivated in untreated roc or under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 input energy on electrooxidation was very low at this time roc autoclaving microalgae harvesting and lipid extraction were major energy intensive processes table 5 the microalgae lipid energy yield could basically compensate the total energy consumption despite autoclaving fig 6 when current density was improved to a value higher than 3 25 ma cm2 the input energy on electrooxidation was obviously enhanced while the lipid energy yield decreased attributing to reduced biomass concentration and lipid content in particular under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 the lipid energy yield was reduced to 7 2 kj l which was much lower than the energy cost on electrooxidation 27 7 kj l under this condition table 5 therefore lipid energy yield under current density higher than 3 25 ma cm2 was far from meeting the total input energy despite autoclaved sterilization though lipid energy yield was relatively low it is noteworthy that only lipid production was considered in the study and other profits brought by this integrated technique like roc treatment co2 mitigation as well as microalgae based proteins and carbohydrates generation were non ignorable in addition it can close environmental carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and realize nutrients conservation thus the technique integrating electrooxidation and microalgae remediation for bioenergy production is a promising candidate for nutrients reclamation from roc to produce bioresources 4 conclusions electrooxidation significant reduced fan concentration from 53 0 mg l in untreated roc to 13 9 mg l under current density of 48 75 ma cm2 electron mass balance showed that provided theoretical total electron amount was lower than electron requirement for the removed n h 4 and cod under all cases indicating that part of reduced nitrogen and phosphorus were removed via precipitation chromaticity of the roc was reduced from 1600 to 100 pt co via electrooxidation fluorescence analysis demonstrated that decrease of the chromaticity was mainly caused by destruction of humic acids into other compounds like family of soluble microbial by products the maximum microalgae biomass concentration and lipid yield of 1 27 g l and 491 5 mg l were achieved under current density of 3 25 ma cm2 under this condition microalgae lipid energy yield 17 9 kj l could almost cover total input energy consumption despite autoclaving sterilization process 22 2 kj l declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18064,in this study we investigated how the desorption and degradation processes of radiolabeled benzo a pyrene bap that was aged in various marine sediments were influenced by sedimentary organic matter properties the stable oc fraction stoc and the demineralized fraction dm were isolated and characterized via advanced solid state 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and a co2 gas adsorption technique respectively sodium persulfate preferentially removed the unstable oc fractions usoc and the aromatic c groups and the residual stoc fractions were enriched with aliphatic c groups the aliphatic c showed stronger resistance to degradation by persulfate than that of the aromatic c a first order kinetic model described the degradation process by sodium persulfate solutions very well r 2 0 997 the desorption percentages degradation percentages and rates k h 1 of bap gradually decreased from the estuarine sediments to the offshore marine sediments and were highly significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk faliph bulk and vo bulk r 2 0 903 p 0 01 it was demonstrated that sodium persulfate degraded not only desorbed bap but also a portion of the bound bap fraction that was difficult to desorb the bap fractions that sorbed on usoc were degraded initially then the fractions of bap that were released from stoc were degraded this study demonstrated the important roles of stoc aliphatic moieties and micropores in the degradation process of bap during the na2s2o8 treatment of the sediments graphical abstract image 1 keywords 7 14c benzo a pyrene na2s2o8 stable oc aliphatic carbon sediment 1 introduction benzo a pyrene bap which is a five ringed compound has been listed by the us environmental protection agency usepa as a priority pollutant due to its known or suspected carcinogenicity teratogenicity or acute toxicity juhasz and naidu 2000 bap occurs in natural media such as soils and sediments as a result of both natural and anthropogenic processes flotron et al 2005 henner et al 1997 its presence in sediment or soil matrices is of substantial concern sedimentary organic matter som includes highly amorphous soft rubbery and relatively condensed hard glassy domains xing and pignatello 1997 the chemical structure and microporosity of som have been demonstrated to strongly influence the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of pahs hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 zhuo et al 2019 the sorption of pahs in amorphous rubbery domains of som is low fast and linear whereas the sorption of pahs in condensed glassy domains of som is high slow and nonlinear however the effects of the som chemical structures and microporosity on the persulfate oxidation kinetics of bap have not been investigated due to the very low biodegradability of bap chemical oxidation is preferred flotron et al 2005 watts et al 2002 persulfate is an emerging oxidant for in situ chemical oxidation and has attracted increasing attention as an alternative oxidant in the abatement of organic contaminants liang and guo 2010 luo et al 2017 mora et al 2014 due to several advantages that it provides peluffo

yen et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 iii high oxidative potential which is due to the formation of the sulfate radical so 4 dan et al 2013 and iv benign end products such as co2 and h2o persulfate oxidation has also been proposed as a method for predicting the pah bioavailability in soils and sediments persulfate oxidation has proven to be a relatively mild oxidation process and typically oxidizes a portion of the som martin and gonzalezvila 1984 martin et al 1981 the organic matter that remains after the oxidation is more condensed than the bulk som cuypers et al 2002 condensed domains in the residual som are enriched in aliphatic c cuypers et al 2002 in addition the refractory residue showed a high affinity for hydrophobic organic pollutants weber et al 1992 young and weber 1995 persulfate oxidation predominantly removed expanded organic matter and the readily available pahs condensed organic matter and poorly bioavailable pahs that sorbed to condensed organic matter were found not to be severely affected cuypers et al 2000 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy is a promising technique for elucidating the structures of natural organic matter nom such as marine dom dissolve organic matter mao et al 2012 its sensitivity is satisfactory due to the high sample concentration and it is the most widely used method for soil analysis however it is underutilized in studies of marine som hedges et al 2001 2002 in addition an updated co2 gas adsorption technique has been used to examine the micropore volume vo and specific surface area ssa in the present study we investigate the oxidation process of 7 14c bap in marine sediments that have been treated with na2s2o8 and we quantify the distribution and desorption process of bap radioactivity in the batch system along with the relationship of bap with the som structure and microporosity such information could impact policy decisions regarding the stipulation of sediment quality criteria the development of cleanup objectives the selection of suitable treatment technologies and the establishment of the remediation priorities of the contaminated marine sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples and chemicals the a1 13 52 909 e 22 25 220 n and a4 a4 113 49 53 e 22 00 408 n samples were obtained from the pearl river estuary the e2 113 59 946 e 21 0 035 n e3 114 13 563 e 20 38 333 n and e5 114 53 798 e 19 30 000 n samples were obtained from the continental shelves in the northern south china sea all the samples were collected in 2012 from the 0 10 cm layer by using a box sampler the sampling sites are presented in fig s1 all samples were frozen and returned to the laboratory for storage prior to their use the samples were freeze dried ground and passed through an 80 mesh 0 178 mm sieve there were no detachable bap residues in the sediments both 7 14c benzo a pyrene and non labeled bap were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the 7 14c benzo a pyrene had a specific radioactivity of 26 6 mci mmol a chemical purity of 97 and a radiochemical purity of 95 the chemical purity of non labeled bap was 98 2 2 sediment spiking with bap and aging the sediments were spiked with bap and aged based on a method by huang et al 2017 the spiked bap concentration in a sediment was 500 ng g which included 50 ng g of 14c bap and 450 ng g of nonradioactively labeled bap 2 3 isolation of the sediment organic fractions the residual som after treatment by sodium persulfate young and weber 1995 was more condensed than the bulk som the na2s2o8 procedure was used to isolate stable organic matter from soils eusterhues et al 2003 kiem and kogel knabner 2002 cuypers et al 2002 and helfrich et al 2007 reported that na2s2o8 was the most efficient method for isolating stable som preferentially removing labile and more amorphous organic matter and isolating older and more stable oc fractions in this study 40 g of each air dried sediment was oxidized by 0 5 m na2s2o8 the residual oc organic carbon after the treatment with na2s2o8 was defined as stable oc stoc the oc content of unstable oc usoc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of stoc from the toc total organic carbon content in the original sediment os the demineralized fractions dms of the samples before and after the sodium persulfate oxidation were also isolated a detailed description of the demineralization process is presented in the supplemental section 2 4 estimation of na2s2o8 and ferrous ions this work conducted a spectrophotometric determination of persulfate based on a method by liang et al 2008b an analysis of absorption spectra of a yellow solution that resulted from the reaction of persulfate and iodide in the presence of sodium bicarbonate reveals an absorbance at 352 nm without significant interferences from the reagent matrix the contents of divalent iron ions in the sediments that were reported in a previous study zhuo et al 2019 are presented in fig s2 2 5 chemical structures and microporosities of som before and after oxidation the oc content of the original sediment os was too low to satisfy the requirement for 13c solid state nmr analysis therefore to increase the oc content the dms of the samples before and after the oxidation were isolated and characterized by 13c solid state nmr via the same procedure as was previously reported cao et al 2013 mao et al 2002 a flow chart of this process is shown in fig s3 and detailed information is presented in the supplemental section the co2 sorption isotherms of the samples before and after oxidation were modeled by using the dubinin radushkavich dr equation and used to estimate specific surface area ssa the micropore volume vo and the pore size distribution 2 6 degradation experiments and desorption experiment peroxydisulfate s2o8 2 which is often referred to as persulfate is the newest isco in situ chemical oxidation oxidant to be widely used johnson et al 2008 and it has yielded promising results huling et al 2011 hutson et al 2012 liang et al 2008a waldemer et al 2007 the persulfate anion can be activated in two ways via thermal and photoactivation eq 1 or by reduced metal ions eq 2 the sulfate radical so 4 which is a strong oxidant e 2 6 v can be generated via activation peluffo et al 2016 fe2 is most commonly used as the reduced metal ion osgerby 2006 1 s 2 o 8 2 heat or h v 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 fe 3 so 4 so 4 2 in this study the fe2 concentration in the sediments was maintained 35 μmol g by adding feso4 7h2o prior to the experiments degradation incubation experiments were conducted in 25 ml glass incubation vials with butyl rubber stoppers 14c bap 0 5 g spiked sediments were weighed into vials and submerged in 5 ml of 0 5 m na2s2o8 solution mercury chloride solution 50 g l was added to inhibit microbial activity controls without na2s2o8 were identically prepared using spiked soil water mixtures for all the above experiments three parallel treatments were used all the samples were incubated in the dark at 25 c at defined sampling times 0 h 6 h 24 h 48 h 96 h 192 h 384 h and 744 h the radioactivity of each fraction degradation to 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residue fractions of the reaction system was measured the 14co2 that was released from the sediments during the oxidation process was trapped by 1 0 ml of naoh 1 m that was contained in a 2 5 ml bottle vial which was suspended from the bottom of the stopper liu et al 2013 shan et al 2011 the incubation vials were gently centrifuged 2500 g 5 min the supernatant was decanted from the sediment and analyzed for radioactivity by a liquid scintillation counter lsc the radioactivity in the supernatant was regarded as representing water soluble residues the remaining sediment was freeze dried and extracted with 10 ml ethyl acetate thrice by using a sonicator hechuang china 20 khz 1 h and centrifugation 2500 g 5 min the extracts were combined and the radioactivity was measured via lsc the radioactivity in the extracts was regarded as representing extractable residues the radioactivity that remained in the sediment after the exhaustive extraction with organic solvents was defined as represented bound residues of 14c bap or its metabolites the organic solvent extracts were concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 1 ml for further analyses using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc lc 20a shimadzu japan and the analyses were conducted on an inertsil ods sp reverse phase column 150 cm 4 6 mm x 5 mm approximately 10 μl of the sample in methanol was injected water 25 and methanol 75 were used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the determination of the radioactivity is described in detail in the supplemental section the maximum desorption percentages were investigated by using a tenax extraction technique on each of the sediments that were spiked with radiocarbon labeled bap which is based on the method of huang et al 2017 2 7 data analysis the mineralization kinetic curves of 7 14c bap conversion of 14c labeled 7 carbon to 14co2 in various sediments were plotted to reflect the efficiency of bap degradation the percentages of mineralization to 14co2 in the sediments during oxidation by na2s2o8 were fitted by the first order kinetic equation namely ct c0 1 e kt where ct is the radioactivity of 14co2 in the sediments at time t h c0 is the initial radioactivity of 14c bap and k h 1 is the degradation rate constant the percentage of mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h was defined as the maximum mineralization percentages of bap 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of som fractions the elemental compositions of the bulk sediments and dms before and after the persulfate oxidation are presented in table s1 the c n ratios 9 12 9 45 of samples a1 and a4 before oxidation indicate that som in the pearl river is partially derived from terrestrial om 8 0 zhang et al 2016 the c n ratios of os and dm before oxidation decreased from the pearl river estuary to the ocean table s1 fig s4 hence the contribution of terrestrial organic matter decreased gradually in the transport process hu et al 2006 the oc contents and percentages of stoc and usoc in the bulk sediments are presented in table s2 and fig 1 a the amount of the bulk oc ranged from 2 55 to 8 91 g kg 1 the oc contents of stoc which ranged from 0 17 to 3 10 g kg 1 represented 1 96 45 05 of the bulk oc the oc contents of usoc ranged from 1 54 to 8 74 g kg 1 and accounted for 54 95 98 04 of the bulk oc the usoc content was larger than the usoc content that was observed in soil sediment 20 40 martin et al 1981 powell et al 1989 which may be caused by the substantial variations of the species and relative quantities of the oxidation products with the source of the organic matter martin and gonzalezvila 1984 the oc contents of stoc gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 however the oc contents of usoc in the estuary samples a1 a4 were higher than the oc contents of usoc in the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 these results are consistent with the previous investigation by zhuo et al 2019 who found that the estuary sediments contained more degradable soc sediment organic carbon while the offshore ocean sediments contained more resistant soc 3 2 structure and micropores of som the results of the nmr analysis are presented in fig 2 and table s3 the thick lines and the thin lines in the corresponding 13c cp toss dd spectra fig 2 represent the signals of non protonated carbon mobile groups and the 13c cp toss nmr spectra of all c respectively before the oxidation farom ranged from 24 47 to 42 34 and faliph ranged from 48 98 to 68 71 table s3 and fig 3 the spectra of marine samples e2 e3 and e5 were dominated by signals that were derived from aliphatic c alkyl c and o alkyl with a low content of aromatic c while the relatively high contents of aromatic c especially aromatic c c in the estuary samples a1 and a4 were associated with a low portion of aliphatic c figs 2 and 3 after the persulfate oxidation the nmr spectra exhibited significant changes in the estuary samples a1 and a4 the contents of aromatic c and aromatic c c decreased substantially from 40 24 42 34 to 27 44 29 44 and from 30 27 35 06 to 19 7 21 00 respectively whereas the contents of aliphatic c and alkyl c increased sharply from 48 98 51 93 to 66 27 67 13 and from 25 47 29 27 to 46 12 46 67 respectively fig 3 and table s3 for the marine samples especially for the e5 sample the changes were minimal in this study the spectra of the marine samples and the estuary samples were dominated by signals that were derived from aliphatic c and alkyl c after the persulfate oxidation figs 2 and 3 thus persulfate preferentially removed labile and more amorphous organic matter while the residual fractions were enriched with long chain aliphatic groups similar to previous investigations in which it was observed that condensed domains in relatively undecomposed som were enriched in aliphatic c cuypers et al 2002 mikutta et al 2005 the som fractions that were resistant to the na2s2o8 oxidation were enriched with alkyl c groups which were the important recalcitrant macromolecules jagadamma et al 2010 aliphatic structures are relatively resistant to chemical treatments such as the chemical oxidation or hydrolysis mikutta et al 2006 westerhoff et al 1999 2004 the general sequence of reactivity of the organic compounds was aromatic ch2 co cooh peyton 1993 xie and barcelona 2003 the so4 radicals exhibited a similar reactivity toward organic structures to the oh radicals peyton 1993 the aliphatic structures of som reacted more slowly with oh radicals than the aromatic moieties did and the oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds mikutta et al 2005 westerhoff et al 1999 in summary the estuary samples contained more aromatic c which was easily degraded while the offshore marine samples contained more aliphatic c which was not easily degraded the co2 adsorption isotherms r 2 0 99 are plotted in fig s6 the calculated micropore volumes vo and specific surface areas ssas for the bulk sediments before and after the oxidation are presented in table s4 before the oxidation the ssa and vo values of the samples ranged from 11 60 34 70 m2 g to 4 65 13 90 μl g respectively after the oxidation the ssa and vo values of samples ranged from 20 11 37 68 m2 g to 8 01 15 52 μl g respectively for the estuary sediments a1 and a4 the values of ssa and vo dramatically decreased from 23 80 27 83 m2 g to 20 11 20 30 m2 g and from 9 54 11 20 μl g to 8 01 8 13 μl g respectively after the oxidation table s4 however for the offshore ocean sediments e2 e3 and e5 the values of ssa and vo increased significantly from 11 60 34 70 m2 g to 26 82 37 68 m2 g and from 4 65 13 90 μl g to 10 98 15 52 μl g respectively after the oxidation table s4 in addition the micropore distributions in the sediments were dominated by micropore sizes of less than 0 70 nm fig s7 which accounted for 76 80 91 70 of the accumulative pore volumes that ranged from 0 to 1 10 nm after oxidation moreover the vo values of the bulk sediments after the oxidation were found to be positively and highly significantly related to the stoc contents fig s9a which suggests that the stoc content contributed significantly to the micropore volumes 3 3 correlation of the consumption of persulfate with the degradation of organic matter and its structure fig 1b presents the kinetic curves for the amounts of persulfate that were consumed under the same conditions as in the bap degradation experiment the persulfate consumption did not differ significantly among the sediments after 744 h the consumption of persulfate in the a1 and a4 samples was slightly higher than that in the e2 e3 and e5 samples to study the resistance of the organic matter to persulfate oxidation and to analyze its structure the consumption of sodium persulfate in each sediment divided by the removed contents of organic matter aliphatic c or aromatic c after the persulfate oxidation at 744 h according to fig 1c and table s5 the contents of persulfate that were required for the oxidation of per milligram organic carbon aliphatic or aromatic c in the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 exceed those of the estuary samples a1 and a4 moreover the consumption content of persulfate was larger for the aliphatic c than that for the organic c and the aromatic c in each sediment hence the organic matter of the marine samples had stronger resistance to persulfate than that of the organic matter of the estuarine samples compared with aromatic c aliphatic c was less easily degraded by persulfate in the sediments that were investigated 3 4 mineralization to 14co2 from 7 14c bap by persulfate in the preliminary experiment 0 5 m na2s2o8 was the best concentration for the mineralization of 7 14c bap that was adsorbed on the sediments fig s8 this concentration was used in the following investigation the mineralization kinetics data of 7 14c bap are presented in fig 1d and table s6 and were well fitted by the first order kinetics model r 2 0 99 the rate constants are listed in table s6 the maximum percentage of the mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h decreased gradually from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 and ranged from 88 55 to 38 48 these values exceed the values that were obtained from the same samples after degradation by h2o2 in the previous study which ranged from 48 00 to 0 22 zhuo et al 2019 the rate constants also gradually decreased from the estuarine to the marine sediments and ranged from 0 0023 to 0 0008 h 1 table s6 and the rates were faster than the slow fraction rates that were observed for the h2o2 treatment which ranged from 0 0001 to 0 0002 h 1 zhuo et al 2019 thus sodium persulfate degraded more adsorbed bap than h2o2 did which is related to the following factors yen et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 sulfate radicals generated from sodium persulfate and hydroxyl radicals generated from h2o2 exhibit similar redox potentials under acidic conditions but the sulfate radicals exhibit a higher standard redox potential than that of the hydroxyl radicals at neutral ph hence sodium persulfate is superior in mineralizing numerous organic compounds persulfate has high aqueous solubility stability and persistence in subsurface systems for longer than ozone and hydrogen peroxide hence sodium persulfate is more efficient than hydrogen peroxide for the degradation of bap in the investigated sediments 3 5 correlation of kinetics parameters with properties of sediment organic fractions a regression analysis was conducted among the maximum mineralization percentages k h 1 stoc bulk faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk where faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk represent the contents of aliphatic c and alkyl c respectively in the bulk after the oxidation the maximum mineralization percentages were significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk r 2 0 926 p 0 01 with faliph bulk r 2 0 920 p 0 01 and with alkyl c bulk r 2 0 924 p 0 01 fig 4 a c k h 1 was significantly and negatively with stoc bulk r 2 0 967 p 0 01 with faliph bulk r 2 0 959 p 0 01 and with alkyl c bulk r 2 0 903 p 0 01 fig 4b d the bap maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 decreased as stoc bulk faliph bulk and alky c bulk increased in addition according to the above observations figs 1c and 2 aliphatic c exhibited stronger resistance to degradation by persulfate than that of aromatic c in conclusion the stoc fractions and aliphatic c groups especially alkyl c that was derived from stoc were found to play crucial roles in protecting bap from being degraded by na2s2o8 this conclusion is consistent with other relevant investigations one investigation found that the resistant organic matter showed a more condensed structure higher affinity for hydrophobic compounds and higher stability than the amorphous organic matter mikutta et al 2005 poorly bioavailable pahs were desorbed slowly and were primarily adsorbed on condensed organic matter cuypers et al 2000 another experiment showed that sodium persulfate oxidation selectively removed soft and presumably expanded organic matter and the residual organic matter exhibited a substantially larger organic carbon partitioning coefficient koc for phenanthrene than that of the bulk som weber et al 1992 during the degradation process the aromatic c especially aromatic c c in som was degraded in large quantities therefore a linear regression analysis was also conducted between the maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 with usoc bulk farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation where farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation refer to the oxidized aromatic c and aromatic c c percentages respectively in the bulk samples after the oxidation interestingly the point that is circled in fig 4 e h corresponds to the outermost marine sediment namely e5 that was collected which had the lowest mineralization percentage and k h 1 and was an outlier this observation could be related to its low aromatic c content derived from lignin except for the farthest point highly significant and positive relationships of the maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 with usoc bulk farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation fig 4e h were observed k h 1 was significantly and positively correlated with usoc bulk r 2 0 870 p 0 01 with farom oxidation r 2 0 859 p 0 01 and with aromatic c c oxidation r 2 0 814 p 0 01 fig 4f h overall it was concluded that the bap maximum mineralization to 14co2 percentages and k h 1 increased as the amounts of usoc and aromatic c especially aromatic c c increased the bap fractions that were adsorbed in usoc and aromatic c were readily degraded 3 6 effect of the som structure on the bap desorption fig 5 a shows that the maximum percentages of the desorption are smaller than the maximum degradation percentages mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h on each of the sediments that were spiked with radiocarbon labeled bap which suggests that sodium persulfate can degrade not only bap that has been desorbed but also a portion of the bound bap fraction which is difficult to desorb the maximum desorption percentages of bap ranged from 28 47 to 49 88 which could be regarded as the degradation fractions of bap that are easily desorbed into the solution the percentages ranging from 10 00 to 38 67 that are obtained by subtracting the maximum desorption percentages from the maximum degradation percentages could be regarded as the bap degradation fractions that are adsorbed into the micropores in the stable oc and are difficult to desorb moreover a linear regression analysis was conducted among the bap maximum desorption percentages stoc faliph bulk and alkyc bulk where faliph bulk and alkyc bulk represent the contents of aliphatic c and alkyc that were recalculated in the bulk after the persulfate oxidation fig 5b c d the maximum desorption percentages were significantly and negatively correlated with correlation coefficient for stoc bulk r 2 0 864 p 0 01 for faliph bulk r 2 0 868 p 0 01 and for alkyl c bulk r 2 0 860 p 0 01 fig 5b c d which is consistent with the result of huang et al 2017 however no satisfactory correlation between the desorption percentages and the aromatic carbon content had been identified in this study but the study of huang et al 2017 identified a significant correlation they used an acid hydrolysis fraction method of som in the sediments however the persulfate oxidation method that was used in this investigation effectively removed the aromatic carbon of som in the sediments thus it is concluded that the aliphatic carbon significantly retards the desorption behavior of bap in this investigation 3 7 effect of micropores on the bap degradation it was demonstrated that the surface areas and micropore volumes in the sediments and soils were significantly positively correlated with the nhc nonhydrolyzed organic carbon fractions which predominantly originated from structural aliphatic carbon huang et al 2017 it was suggested that a nanopore filling significantly contributed to the sorption and desorption kinetics of hocs in the sediments han et al 2014 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 however the effects of the som chemical structures microporosity and pah sorption desorption on the persulfate oxidation kinetics of bap have not been investigated in the investigation a linear regression analysis was conducted between the mineralization percentages and vo bulk according to fig s9b the vo bulk values are highly significantly negatively related to the percentages of mineralization to 14co2 r 2 0 948 p 0 01 in addition vo bulk is highly significantly positively related to stoc bulk as shown in fig s9a this result is consistent with the results of other investigations a biphasic behavior often occurs during the oxidation degradation process of pahs in the initial phase the desorption of pahs is fast and the removal rate of pahs is primarily limited by the oxidation rate in the second phase the desorption is slow and the removal rate of pahs is limited by the desorption rate brusseau et al 1991 the slow desorption led to the decreasing degradation rate and extent of pahs erickson et al 1993 the enhanced solubility of pahs in the aqueous phase could elevate their oxidation rate because the strong oxidant sulfate radical that was generated from sodium persulfate was typically produced in the aqueous phase peluffo et al 2016 the application of surfactants to soil sediment systems could improve the desorption rate of bap by enhancing the rate of mass transfer from the solid sorbed phases juhasz and naidu 2000 therefore we concluded that the micropores in the stoc fraction had a satisfactory protective effect on bap from degradation by na2s2o8 3 8 bap fractions in the sediments during the na2s2o8 treatment the radioactivities of 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues in the a1 sediment during 744 h of oxidation treatment with and without na2s2o8 control were measured and are presented in fig 6 a and 6b it was found that 88 55 of the initial bap 14c was mineralized after 744 h with the na2s2o8 treatment the water soluble radioactivity increased rapidly to approximately 9 0 within the first 6 h which was followed by a gradual decrease to less than 1 90 at 744 h the water soluble radioactivity remained at a low level throughout the process which demonstrated that sodium persulfate had a strong ability to degrade bap in the water phase the extractable radioactivity was approximately 70 29 at 24 h and it gradually decreased to 5 20 at the end of the treatment during this process the bound residue was 31 84 at 24 h then it gradually decreased to 6 30 of the 14c bap radioactivity at the end of treatment these data suggest that the bap bound residues were also gradually released partly during the oxidation treatment in the sediment control the mineralization activity and the water soluble activity of 14c bap were negligible fig 6b the contents of the bound residues and the extractable residues remained almost constant during the oxidation process the content of the bound residues was related to the strong adsorption of 14c bap in the stoc fractions and their micropores all the above findings demonstrate that the structure and microporosity of the stoc fractions are highly important for the sequestration and the oxidative degradation of 14c bap in the investigated sediments 3 9 metabolization of bap in the sediments by na2s2o8 the contents of the parent compound bap in the water soluble fractions and the extractable fractions during the oxidation process for the a1 sample were determined via hplc fig s10 it was found that almost no parent compound was present in the water soluble fractions fig s10a which was consistent with the very low radioactivity that was detected in this fraction fig 6a during the oxidation process 5 10 69 59 of the parent compound was present in the extractable fractions fig s10b the radioactive products in the extractable the water soluble and the bound fractions included either oxidized intermediates or parent bap thus the radioactivities of intermediates in the extractable fractions were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity of the parent compound from the radioactive products in the extractable fractions fig 6c the percentages of the parent bap in the extractable fractions decreased rapidly from 69 59 to 12 06 in the first 6 h gradually increased to 28 41 at 96 h and subsequently decreased to 5 10 at 744 h in contrast the intermediates in the extractable fractions increased rapidly to 51 19 in the first 6 h and decreased gradually to 1 2 at the end of the incubation fig 6c in view of this phenomenon another kinetic model a first order two compartment model was used to fit the data of the bap mineralization to 14co2 in sediment a1 fig 6a detailed information is presented in the supplemental section it was found that a first order two compartment kinetic model described the degradation process very well r 2 0 998 k rap h 1 and k slow h 1 were 0 0087 h 1 and 0 0001 h 1 respectively thereby suggesting that the degradation process of bap in sediment a1 was characterized by a rapid process that was followed by a slow process thus it is assumed that the extractable bap that was adsorbed on usoc was rapidly degraded in the first 6 h thereby leading to an increase of the metabolites in the extractable fractions subsequently due to the strong oxidation the bound bap fractions that were sorbed on stoc began to transfer gradually into the extractable bap fractions thereby resulting in an increase of the extractable bap with the continuous oxidation both the parent bap and the intermediates in the extractable fractions were degraded to less than 5 by the end of the incubation 4 conclusions the effect of the structures and micropores of som on the degradation of benzo a pyrene by na2s2o8 were investigated the results demonstrated that the degradation percentages of bap and k h 1 decreased from the estuarine sediments a1 and a4 to the offshore marine sediments e2 e3 and e5 sodium persulfate is more efficient than hydrogen peroxide in the degradation of bap in the investigated sediments the marine samples e2 e3 and e5 were dominated by aliphatic c while the estuary samples a1 and a4 were dominated by aromatic c the aliphatic c exhibited stronger resistance to the persulfate than that of the aromatic c the desorption percentages degradation percentages and k h 1 were significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk faliph bulk and vo bulk hence the micropore volumes and the aliphatic c contents in stoc played crucial roles in protecting adsorbed bap from degradation by na2s2o8 according to the fractionation of bap in sediment a1 during the na2s2o8 treatment a portion of bap that was adsorbed on usoc was degraded initially then a portion of bap that was desorbed on stoc was degraded the bap parent compound in the aqueous phase was almost completely degraded various intermediates were present in the extractable residues and the bound residues which will be identified in future work this detailed investigation is essential for the

18064,in this study we investigated how the desorption and degradation processes of radiolabeled benzo a pyrene bap that was aged in various marine sediments were influenced by sedimentary organic matter properties the stable oc fraction stoc and the demineralized fraction dm were isolated and characterized via advanced solid state 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and a co2 gas adsorption technique respectively sodium persulfate preferentially removed the unstable oc fractions usoc and the aromatic c groups and the residual stoc fractions were enriched with aliphatic c groups the aliphatic c showed stronger resistance to degradation by persulfate than that of the aromatic c a first order kinetic model described the degradation process by sodium persulfate solutions very well r 2 0 997 the desorption percentages degradation percentages and rates k h 1 of bap gradually decreased from the estuarine sediments to the offshore marine sediments and were highly significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk faliph bulk and vo bulk r 2 0 903 p 0 01 it was demonstrated that sodium persulfate degraded not only desorbed bap but also a portion of the bound bap fraction that was difficult to desorb the bap fractions that sorbed on usoc were degraded initially then the fractions of bap that were released from stoc were degraded this study demonstrated the important roles of stoc aliphatic moieties and micropores in the degradation process of bap during the na2s2o8 treatment of the sediments graphical abstract image 1 keywords 7 14c benzo a pyrene na2s2o8 stable oc aliphatic carbon sediment 1 introduction benzo a pyrene bap which is a five ringed compound has been listed by the us environmental protection agency usepa as a priority pollutant due to its known or suspected carcinogenicity teratogenicity or acute toxicity juhasz and naidu 2000 bap occurs in natural media such as soils and sediments as a result of both natural and anthropogenic processes flotron et al 2005 henner et al 1997 its presence in sediment or soil matrices is of substantial concern sedimentary organic matter som includes highly amorphous soft rubbery and relatively condensed hard glassy domains xing and pignatello 1997 the chemical structure and microporosity of som have been demonstrated to strongly influence the sorption desorption and chemical degradation of pahs hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 sun et al 2013 zhuo et al 2019 the sorption of pahs in amorphous rubbery domains of som is low fast and linear whereas the sorption of pahs in condensed glassy domains of som is high slow and nonlinear however the effects of the som chemical structures and microporosity on the persulfate oxidation kinetics of bap have not been investigated due to the very low biodegradability of bap chemical oxidation is preferred flotron et al 2005 watts et al 2002 persulfate is an emerging oxidant for in situ chemical oxidation and has attracted increasing attention as an alternative oxidant in the abatement of organic contaminants liang and guo 2010 luo et al 2017 mora et al 2014 due to several advantages that it provides peluffo

yen et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 iii high oxidative potential which is due to the formation of the sulfate radical so 4 dan et al 2013 and iv benign end products such as co2 and h2o persulfate oxidation has also been proposed as a method for predicting the pah bioavailability in soils and sediments persulfate oxidation has proven to be a relatively mild oxidation process and typically oxidizes a portion of the som martin and gonzalezvila 1984 martin et al 1981 the organic matter that remains after the oxidation is more condensed than the bulk som cuypers et al 2002 condensed domains in the residual som are enriched in aliphatic c cuypers et al 2002 in addition the refractory residue showed a high affinity for hydrophobic organic pollutants weber et al 1992 young and weber 1995 persulfate oxidation predominantly removed expanded organic matter and the readily available pahs condensed organic matter and poorly bioavailable pahs that sorbed to condensed organic matter were found not to be severely affected cuypers et al 2000 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy is a promising technique for elucidating the structures of natural organic matter nom such as marine dom dissolve organic matter mao et al 2012 its sensitivity is satisfactory due to the high sample concentration and it is the most widely used method for soil analysis however it is underutilized in studies of marine som hedges et al 2001 2002 in addition an updated co2 gas adsorption technique has been used to examine the micropore volume vo and specific surface area ssa in the present study we investigate the oxidation process of 7 14c bap in marine sediments that have been treated with na2s2o8 and we quantify the distribution and desorption process of bap radioactivity in the batch system along with the relationship of bap with the som structure and microporosity such information could impact policy decisions regarding the stipulation of sediment quality criteria the development of cleanup objectives the selection of suitable treatment technologies and the establishment of the remediation priorities of the contaminated marine sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment samples and chemicals the a1 13 52 909 e 22 25 220 n and a4 a4 113 49 53 e 22 00 408 n samples were obtained from the pearl river estuary the e2 113 59 946 e 21 0 035 n e3 114 13 563 e 20 38 333 n and e5 114 53 798 e 19 30 000 n samples were obtained from the continental shelves in the northern south china sea all the samples were collected in 2012 from the 0 10 cm layer by using a box sampler the sampling sites are presented in fig s1 all samples were frozen and returned to the laboratory for storage prior to their use the samples were freeze dried ground and passed through an 80 mesh 0 178 mm sieve there were no detachable bap residues in the sediments both 7 14c benzo a pyrene and non labeled bap were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the 7 14c benzo a pyrene had a specific radioactivity of 26 6 mci mmol a chemical purity of 97 and a radiochemical purity of 95 the chemical purity of non labeled bap was 98 2 2 sediment spiking with bap and aging the sediments were spiked with bap and aged based on a method by huang et al 2017 the spiked bap concentration in a sediment was 500 ng g which included 50 ng g of 14c bap and 450 ng g of nonradioactively labeled bap 2 3 isolation of the sediment organic fractions the residual som after treatment by sodium persulfate young and weber 1995 was more condensed than the bulk som the na2s2o8 procedure was used to isolate stable organic matter from soils eusterhues et al 2003 kiem and kogel knabner 2002 cuypers et al 2002 and helfrich et al 2007 reported that na2s2o8 was the most efficient method for isolating stable som preferentially removing labile and more amorphous organic matter and isolating older and more stable oc fractions in this study 40 g of each air dried sediment was oxidized by 0 5 m na2s2o8 the residual oc organic carbon after the treatment with na2s2o8 was defined as stable oc stoc the oc content of unstable oc usoc was calculated by subtracting the oc content of stoc from the toc total organic carbon content in the original sediment os the demineralized fractions dms of the samples before and after the sodium persulfate oxidation were also isolated a detailed description of the demineralization process is presented in the supplemental section 2 4 estimation of na2s2o8 and ferrous ions this work conducted a spectrophotometric determination of persulfate based on a method by liang et al 2008b an analysis of absorption spectra of a yellow solution that resulted from the reaction of persulfate and iodide in the presence of sodium bicarbonate reveals an absorbance at 352 nm without significant interferences from the reagent matrix the contents of divalent iron ions in the sediments that were reported in a previous study zhuo et al 2019 are presented in fig s2 2 5 chemical structures and microporosities of som before and after oxidation the oc content of the original sediment os was too low to satisfy the requirement for 13c solid state nmr analysis therefore to increase the oc content the dms of the samples before and after the oxidation were isolated and characterized by 13c solid state nmr via the same procedure as was previously reported cao et al 2013 mao et al 2002 a flow chart of this process is shown in fig s3 and detailed information is presented in the supplemental section the co2 sorption isotherms of the samples before and after oxidation were modeled by using the dubinin radushkavich dr equation and used to estimate specific surface area ssa the micropore volume vo and the pore size distribution 2 6 degradation experiments and desorption experiment peroxydisulfate s2o8 2 which is often referred to as persulfate is the newest isco in situ chemical oxidation oxidant to be widely used johnson et al 2008 and it has yielded promising results huling et al 2011 hutson et al 2012 liang et al 2008a waldemer et al 2007 the persulfate anion can be activated in two ways via thermal and photoactivation eq 1 or by reduced metal ions eq 2 the sulfate radical so 4 which is a strong oxidant e 2 6 v can be generated via activation peluffo et al 2016 fe2 is most commonly used as the reduced metal ion osgerby 2006 1 s 2 o 8 2 heat or h v 2 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 2 fe 3 so 4 so 4 2 in this study the fe2 concentration in the sediments was maintained 35 μmol g by adding feso4 7h2o prior to the experiments degradation incubation experiments were conducted in 25 ml glass incubation vials with butyl rubber stoppers 14c bap 0 5 g spiked sediments were weighed into vials and submerged in 5 ml of 0 5 m na2s2o8 solution mercury chloride solution 50 g l was added to inhibit microbial activity controls without na2s2o8 were identically prepared using spiked soil water mixtures for all the above experiments three parallel treatments were used all the samples were incubated in the dark at 25 c at defined sampling times 0 h 6 h 24 h 48 h 96 h 192 h 384 h and 744 h the radioactivity of each fraction degradation to 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residue fractions of the reaction system was measured the 14co2 that was released from the sediments during the oxidation process was trapped by 1 0 ml of naoh 1 m that was contained in a 2 5 ml bottle vial which was suspended from the bottom of the stopper liu et al 2013 shan et al 2011 the incubation vials were gently centrifuged 2500 g 5 min the supernatant was decanted from the sediment and analyzed for radioactivity by a liquid scintillation counter lsc the radioactivity in the supernatant was regarded as representing water soluble residues the remaining sediment was freeze dried and extracted with 10 ml ethyl acetate thrice by using a sonicator hechuang china 20 khz 1 h and centrifugation 2500 g 5 min the extracts were combined and the radioactivity was measured via lsc the radioactivity in the extracts was regarded as representing extractable residues the radioactivity that remained in the sediment after the exhaustive extraction with organic solvents was defined as represented bound residues of 14c bap or its metabolites the organic solvent extracts were concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 1 ml for further analyses using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc lc 20a shimadzu japan and the analyses were conducted on an inertsil ods sp reverse phase column 150 cm 4 6 mm x 5 mm approximately 10 μl of the sample in methanol was injected water 25 and methanol 75 were used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the determination of the radioactivity is described in detail in the supplemental section the maximum desorption percentages were investigated by using a tenax extraction technique on each of the sediments that were spiked with radiocarbon labeled bap which is based on the method of huang et al 2017 2 7 data analysis the mineralization kinetic curves of 7 14c bap conversion of 14c labeled 7 carbon to 14co2 in various sediments were plotted to reflect the efficiency of bap degradation the percentages of mineralization to 14co2 in the sediments during oxidation by na2s2o8 were fitted by the first order kinetic equation namely ct c0 1 e kt where ct is the radioactivity of 14co2 in the sediments at time t h c0 is the initial radioactivity of 14c bap and k h 1 is the degradation rate constant the percentage of mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h was defined as the maximum mineralization percentages of bap 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation of som fractions the elemental compositions of the bulk sediments and dms before and after the persulfate oxidation are presented in table s1 the c n ratios 9 12 9 45 of samples a1 and a4 before oxidation indicate that som in the pearl river is partially derived from terrestrial om 8 0 zhang et al 2016 the c n ratios of os and dm before oxidation decreased from the pearl river estuary to the ocean table s1 fig s4 hence the contribution of terrestrial organic matter decreased gradually in the transport process hu et al 2006 the oc contents and percentages of stoc and usoc in the bulk sediments are presented in table s2 and fig 1 a the amount of the bulk oc ranged from 2 55 to 8 91 g kg 1 the oc contents of stoc which ranged from 0 17 to 3 10 g kg 1 represented 1 96 45 05 of the bulk oc the oc contents of usoc ranged from 1 54 to 8 74 g kg 1 and accounted for 54 95 98 04 of the bulk oc the usoc content was larger than the usoc content that was observed in soil sediment 20 40 martin et al 1981 powell et al 1989 which may be caused by the substantial variations of the species and relative quantities of the oxidation products with the source of the organic matter martin and gonzalezvila 1984 the oc contents of stoc gradually increased from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 however the oc contents of usoc in the estuary samples a1 a4 were higher than the oc contents of usoc in the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 these results are consistent with the previous investigation by zhuo et al 2019 who found that the estuary sediments contained more degradable soc sediment organic carbon while the offshore ocean sediments contained more resistant soc 3 2 structure and micropores of som the results of the nmr analysis are presented in fig 2 and table s3 the thick lines and the thin lines in the corresponding 13c cp toss dd spectra fig 2 represent the signals of non protonated carbon mobile groups and the 13c cp toss nmr spectra of all c respectively before the oxidation farom ranged from 24 47 to 42 34 and faliph ranged from 48 98 to 68 71 table s3 and fig 3 the spectra of marine samples e2 e3 and e5 were dominated by signals that were derived from aliphatic c alkyl c and o alkyl with a low content of aromatic c while the relatively high contents of aromatic c especially aromatic c c in the estuary samples a1 and a4 were associated with a low portion of aliphatic c figs 2 and 3 after the persulfate oxidation the nmr spectra exhibited significant changes in the estuary samples a1 and a4 the contents of aromatic c and aromatic c c decreased substantially from 40 24 42 34 to 27 44 29 44 and from 30 27 35 06 to 19 7 21 00 respectively whereas the contents of aliphatic c and alkyl c increased sharply from 48 98 51 93 to 66 27 67 13 and from 25 47 29 27 to 46 12 46 67 respectively fig 3 and table s3 for the marine samples especially for the e5 sample the changes were minimal in this study the spectra of the marine samples and the estuary samples were dominated by signals that were derived from aliphatic c and alkyl c after the persulfate oxidation figs 2 and 3 thus persulfate preferentially removed labile and more amorphous organic matter while the residual fractions were enriched with long chain aliphatic groups similar to previous investigations in which it was observed that condensed domains in relatively undecomposed som were enriched in aliphatic c cuypers et al 2002 mikutta et al 2005 the som fractions that were resistant to the na2s2o8 oxidation were enriched with alkyl c groups which were the important recalcitrant macromolecules jagadamma et al 2010 aliphatic structures are relatively resistant to chemical treatments such as the chemical oxidation or hydrolysis mikutta et al 2006 westerhoff et al 1999 2004 the general sequence of reactivity of the organic compounds was aromatic ch2 co cooh peyton 1993 xie and barcelona 2003 the so4 radicals exhibited a similar reactivity toward organic structures to the oh radicals peyton 1993 the aliphatic structures of som reacted more slowly with oh radicals than the aromatic moieties did and the oh radicals preferentially attacked aromatic compounds mikutta et al 2005 westerhoff et al 1999 in summary the estuary samples contained more aromatic c which was easily degraded while the offshore marine samples contained more aliphatic c which was not easily degraded the co2 adsorption isotherms r 2 0 99 are plotted in fig s6 the calculated micropore volumes vo and specific surface areas ssas for the bulk sediments before and after the oxidation are presented in table s4 before the oxidation the ssa and vo values of the samples ranged from 11 60 34 70 m2 g to 4 65 13 90 μl g respectively after the oxidation the ssa and vo values of samples ranged from 20 11 37 68 m2 g to 8 01 15 52 μl g respectively for the estuary sediments a1 and a4 the values of ssa and vo dramatically decreased from 23 80 27 83 m2 g to 20 11 20 30 m2 g and from 9 54 11 20 μl g to 8 01 8 13 μl g respectively after the oxidation table s4 however for the offshore ocean sediments e2 e3 and e5 the values of ssa and vo increased significantly from 11 60 34 70 m2 g to 26 82 37 68 m2 g and from 4 65 13 90 μl g to 10 98 15 52 μl g respectively after the oxidation table s4 in addition the micropore distributions in the sediments were dominated by micropore sizes of less than 0 70 nm fig s7 which accounted for 76 80 91 70 of the accumulative pore volumes that ranged from 0 to 1 10 nm after oxidation moreover the vo values of the bulk sediments after the oxidation were found to be positively and highly significantly related to the stoc contents fig s9a which suggests that the stoc content contributed significantly to the micropore volumes 3 3 correlation of the consumption of persulfate with the degradation of organic matter and its structure fig 1b presents the kinetic curves for the amounts of persulfate that were consumed under the same conditions as in the bap degradation experiment the persulfate consumption did not differ significantly among the sediments after 744 h the consumption of persulfate in the a1 and a4 samples was slightly higher than that in the e2 e3 and e5 samples to study the resistance of the organic matter to persulfate oxidation and to analyze its structure the consumption of sodium persulfate in each sediment divided by the removed contents of organic matter aliphatic c or aromatic c after the persulfate oxidation at 744 h according to fig 1c and table s5 the contents of persulfate that were required for the oxidation of per milligram organic carbon aliphatic or aromatic c in the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 exceed those of the estuary samples a1 and a4 moreover the consumption content of persulfate was larger for the aliphatic c than that for the organic c and the aromatic c in each sediment hence the organic matter of the marine samples had stronger resistance to persulfate than that of the organic matter of the estuarine samples compared with aromatic c aliphatic c was less easily degraded by persulfate in the sediments that were investigated 3 4 mineralization to 14co2 from 7 14c bap by persulfate in the preliminary experiment 0 5 m na2s2o8 was the best concentration for the mineralization of 7 14c bap that was adsorbed on the sediments fig s8 this concentration was used in the following investigation the mineralization kinetics data of 7 14c bap are presented in fig 1d and table s6 and were well fitted by the first order kinetics model r 2 0 99 the rate constants are listed in table s6 the maximum percentage of the mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h decreased gradually from the estuary samples a1 and a4 to the offshore marine samples e2 e3 and e5 and ranged from 88 55 to 38 48 these values exceed the values that were obtained from the same samples after degradation by h2o2 in the previous study which ranged from 48 00 to 0 22 zhuo et al 2019 the rate constants also gradually decreased from the estuarine to the marine sediments and ranged from 0 0023 to 0 0008 h 1 table s6 and the rates were faster than the slow fraction rates that were observed for the h2o2 treatment which ranged from 0 0001 to 0 0002 h 1 zhuo et al 2019 thus sodium persulfate degraded more adsorbed bap than h2o2 did which is related to the following factors yen et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 sulfate radicals generated from sodium persulfate and hydroxyl radicals generated from h2o2 exhibit similar redox potentials under acidic conditions but the sulfate radicals exhibit a higher standard redox potential than that of the hydroxyl radicals at neutral ph hence sodium persulfate is superior in mineralizing numerous organic compounds persulfate has high aqueous solubility stability and persistence in subsurface systems for longer than ozone and hydrogen peroxide hence sodium persulfate is more efficient than hydrogen peroxide for the degradation of bap in the investigated sediments 3 5 correlation of kinetics parameters with properties of sediment organic fractions a regression analysis was conducted among the maximum mineralization percentages k h 1 stoc bulk faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk where faliph bulk and alkyl c bulk represent the contents of aliphatic c and alkyl c respectively in the bulk after the oxidation the maximum mineralization percentages were significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk r 2 0 926 p 0 01 with faliph bulk r 2 0 920 p 0 01 and with alkyl c bulk r 2 0 924 p 0 01 fig 4 a c k h 1 was significantly and negatively with stoc bulk r 2 0 967 p 0 01 with faliph bulk r 2 0 959 p 0 01 and with alkyl c bulk r 2 0 903 p 0 01 fig 4b d the bap maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 decreased as stoc bulk faliph bulk and alky c bulk increased in addition according to the above observations figs 1c and 2 aliphatic c exhibited stronger resistance to degradation by persulfate than that of aromatic c in conclusion the stoc fractions and aliphatic c groups especially alkyl c that was derived from stoc were found to play crucial roles in protecting bap from being degraded by na2s2o8 this conclusion is consistent with other relevant investigations one investigation found that the resistant organic matter showed a more condensed structure higher affinity for hydrophobic compounds and higher stability than the amorphous organic matter mikutta et al 2005 poorly bioavailable pahs were desorbed slowly and were primarily adsorbed on condensed organic matter cuypers et al 2000 another experiment showed that sodium persulfate oxidation selectively removed soft and presumably expanded organic matter and the residual organic matter exhibited a substantially larger organic carbon partitioning coefficient koc for phenanthrene than that of the bulk som weber et al 1992 during the degradation process the aromatic c especially aromatic c c in som was degraded in large quantities therefore a linear regression analysis was also conducted between the maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 with usoc bulk farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation where farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation refer to the oxidized aromatic c and aromatic c c percentages respectively in the bulk samples after the oxidation interestingly the point that is circled in fig 4 e h corresponds to the outermost marine sediment namely e5 that was collected which had the lowest mineralization percentage and k h 1 and was an outlier this observation could be related to its low aromatic c content derived from lignin except for the farthest point highly significant and positive relationships of the maximum mineralization percentages and k h 1 with usoc bulk farom oxidation and aromatic c c oxidation fig 4e h were observed k h 1 was significantly and positively correlated with usoc bulk r 2 0 870 p 0 01 with farom oxidation r 2 0 859 p 0 01 and with aromatic c c oxidation r 2 0 814 p 0 01 fig 4f h overall it was concluded that the bap maximum mineralization to 14co2 percentages and k h 1 increased as the amounts of usoc and aromatic c especially aromatic c c increased the bap fractions that were adsorbed in usoc and aromatic c were readily degraded 3 6 effect of the som structure on the bap desorption fig 5 a shows that the maximum percentages of the desorption are smaller than the maximum degradation percentages mineralization to 14co2 at 744 h on each of the sediments that were spiked with radiocarbon labeled bap which suggests that sodium persulfate can degrade not only bap that has been desorbed but also a portion of the bound bap fraction which is difficult to desorb the maximum desorption percentages of bap ranged from 28 47 to 49 88 which could be regarded as the degradation fractions of bap that are easily desorbed into the solution the percentages ranging from 10 00 to 38 67 that are obtained by subtracting the maximum desorption percentages from the maximum degradation percentages could be regarded as the bap degradation fractions that are adsorbed into the micropores in the stable oc and are difficult to desorb moreover a linear regression analysis was conducted among the bap maximum desorption percentages stoc faliph bulk and alkyc bulk where faliph bulk and alkyc bulk represent the contents of aliphatic c and alkyc that were recalculated in the bulk after the persulfate oxidation fig 5b c d the maximum desorption percentages were significantly and negatively correlated with correlation coefficient for stoc bulk r 2 0 864 p 0 01 for faliph bulk r 2 0 868 p 0 01 and for alkyl c bulk r 2 0 860 p 0 01 fig 5b c d which is consistent with the result of huang et al 2017 however no satisfactory correlation between the desorption percentages and the aromatic carbon content had been identified in this study but the study of huang et al 2017 identified a significant correlation they used an acid hydrolysis fraction method of som in the sediments however the persulfate oxidation method that was used in this investigation effectively removed the aromatic carbon of som in the sediments thus it is concluded that the aliphatic carbon significantly retards the desorption behavior of bap in this investigation 3 7 effect of micropores on the bap degradation it was demonstrated that the surface areas and micropore volumes in the sediments and soils were significantly positively correlated with the nhc nonhydrolyzed organic carbon fractions which predominantly originated from structural aliphatic carbon huang et al 2017 it was suggested that a nanopore filling significantly contributed to the sorption and desorption kinetics of hocs in the sediments han et al 2014 hu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 however the effects of the som chemical structures microporosity and pah sorption desorption on the persulfate oxidation kinetics of bap have not been investigated in the investigation a linear regression analysis was conducted between the mineralization percentages and vo bulk according to fig s9b the vo bulk values are highly significantly negatively related to the percentages of mineralization to 14co2 r 2 0 948 p 0 01 in addition vo bulk is highly significantly positively related to stoc bulk as shown in fig s9a this result is consistent with the results of other investigations a biphasic behavior often occurs during the oxidation degradation process of pahs in the initial phase the desorption of pahs is fast and the removal rate of pahs is primarily limited by the oxidation rate in the second phase the desorption is slow and the removal rate of pahs is limited by the desorption rate brusseau et al 1991 the slow desorption led to the decreasing degradation rate and extent of pahs erickson et al 1993 the enhanced solubility of pahs in the aqueous phase could elevate their oxidation rate because the strong oxidant sulfate radical that was generated from sodium persulfate was typically produced in the aqueous phase peluffo et al 2016 the application of surfactants to soil sediment systems could improve the desorption rate of bap by enhancing the rate of mass transfer from the solid sorbed phases juhasz and naidu 2000 therefore we concluded that the micropores in the stoc fraction had a satisfactory protective effect on bap from degradation by na2s2o8 3 8 bap fractions in the sediments during the na2s2o8 treatment the radioactivities of 14co2 water soluble residues extractable residues and bound residues in the a1 sediment during 744 h of oxidation treatment with and without na2s2o8 control were measured and are presented in fig 6 a and 6b it was found that 88 55 of the initial bap 14c was mineralized after 744 h with the na2s2o8 treatment the water soluble radioactivity increased rapidly to approximately 9 0 within the first 6 h which was followed by a gradual decrease to less than 1 90 at 744 h the water soluble radioactivity remained at a low level throughout the process which demonstrated that sodium persulfate had a strong ability to degrade bap in the water phase the extractable radioactivity was approximately 70 29 at 24 h and it gradually decreased to 5 20 at the end of the treatment during this process the bound residue was 31 84 at 24 h then it gradually decreased to 6 30 of the 14c bap radioactivity at the end of treatment these data suggest that the bap bound residues were also gradually released partly during the oxidation treatment in the sediment control the mineralization activity and the water soluble activity of 14c bap were negligible fig 6b the contents of the bound residues and the extractable residues remained almost constant during the oxidation process the content of the bound residues was related to the strong adsorption of 14c bap in the stoc fractions and their micropores all the above findings demonstrate that the structure and microporosity of the stoc fractions are highly important for the sequestration and the oxidative degradation of 14c bap in the investigated sediments 3 9 metabolization of bap in the sediments by na2s2o8 the contents of the parent compound bap in the water soluble fractions and the extractable fractions during the oxidation process for the a1 sample were determined via hplc fig s10 it was found that almost no parent compound was present in the water soluble fractions fig s10a which was consistent with the very low radioactivity that was detected in this fraction fig 6a during the oxidation process 5 10 69 59 of the parent compound was present in the extractable fractions fig s10b the radioactive products in the extractable the water soluble and the bound fractions included either oxidized intermediates or parent bap thus the radioactivities of intermediates in the extractable fractions were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity of the parent compound from the radioactive products in the extractable fractions fig 6c the percentages of the parent bap in the extractable fractions decreased rapidly from 69 59 to 12 06 in the first 6 h gradually increased to 28 41 at 96 h and subsequently decreased to 5 10 at 744 h in contrast the intermediates in the extractable fractions increased rapidly to 51 19 in the first 6 h and decreased gradually to 1 2 at the end of the incubation fig 6c in view of this phenomenon another kinetic model a first order two compartment model was used to fit the data of the bap mineralization to 14co2 in sediment a1 fig 6a detailed information is presented in the supplemental section it was found that a first order two compartment kinetic model described the degradation process very well r 2 0 998 k rap h 1 and k slow h 1 were 0 0087 h 1 and 0 0001 h 1 respectively thereby suggesting that the degradation process of bap in sediment a1 was characterized by a rapid process that was followed by a slow process thus it is assumed that the extractable bap that was adsorbed on usoc was rapidly degraded in the first 6 h thereby leading to an increase of the metabolites in the extractable fractions subsequently due to the strong oxidation the bound bap fractions that were sorbed on stoc began to transfer gradually into the extractable bap fractions thereby resulting in an increase of the extractable bap with the continuous oxidation both the parent bap and the intermediates in the extractable fractions were degraded to less than 5 by the end of the incubation 4 conclusions the effect of the structures and micropores of som on the degradation of benzo a pyrene by na2s2o8 were investigated the results demonstrated that the degradation percentages of bap and k h 1 decreased from the estuarine sediments a1 and a4 to the offshore marine sediments e2 e3 and e5 sodium persulfate is more efficient than hydrogen peroxide in the degradation of bap in the investigated sediments the marine samples e2 e3 and e5 were dominated by aliphatic c while the estuary samples a1 and a4 were dominated by aromatic c the aliphatic c exhibited stronger resistance to the persulfate than that of the aromatic c the desorption percentages degradation percentages and k h 1 were significantly and negatively correlated with stoc bulk faliph bulk and vo bulk hence the micropore volumes and the aliphatic c contents in stoc played crucial roles in protecting adsorbed bap from degradation by na2s2o8 according to the fractionation of bap in sediment a1 during the na2s2o8 treatment a portion of bap that was adsorbed on usoc was degraded initially then a portion of bap that was desorbed on stoc was degraded the bap parent compound in the aqueous phase was almost completely degraded various intermediates were present in the extractable residues and the bound residues which will be identified in future work this detailed investigation is essential for the
