6545,this paper proposes a new conceptual modelling approach and calibration method for sewer systems driven by the interest in using the sewer as a bioreactor and long term biochemical modelling of the integrated system consisting of the sewage collection system and the wastewater treatment plant wwtp the new approach consists of a method for simplifying a complex sewer network into a simpler yet accurate computationally efficient conceptual model able to capture the relevant sewer dynamics both in terms of water quantity and water quality entering the wastewater treatment plant water quality predicted by the conceptual model was assessed using a detailed biochemical process model and compared against a whole network biochemical model that covers all hydraulic segments and pipes of the sewer system the conceptual biochemical model achieves very similar results as the whole network model in terms of water quality while providing much faster simulation speed minutes rather than hours and easy calibration given these advantages the conceptual biochemical model of a collection system can be used in an integrated model with which sewer and wwtp can be simulated simultaneously for long term evaluation of optimization scenarios the model was applied to the prediction of the biochemical components e g sulfide organics and nutrients which are essential for the control and management of sewer corrosion and pollutant removal keywords sewer biochemical processes conceptual model corrosion wastewater quality biological nutrient removal 1 introduction driven by an increasing interest in process intensification and resource recovery integrated management of sewer and wastewater treatment plant wwtp is becoming meaningful more than ever therefore studies on sewage collection systems are increasingly extending from classic sewer hydraulics to also include sewer biochemical processes indeed modelling of pollutant transport and conversion in sewers relies on two categories of models sewer flow models the left box of fig 1 to provide the transport term in the governing equation for pollutant transformation modelling and sewer biochemical process models the right box of fig 1 to provide the reaction term in the governing equation the sewer flow model is built on the basis of the equations that are directly related to available hydraulic information and provides results of flowrate and sewage volume in the pipes on the other hand the biochemical process model consists of the equations defining the biochemical reactions occurring among the different biochemical components e g sulfide chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients the biochemical process model consists of reaction rates kinetic parameters and the stoichiometric matrix thanks to decades of efforts the study of hydraulic or hydrologic modelling has achieved great success elga et al 2015 garcía et al 2015 rossman 2017 traditional hydraulic models like the storm water management model swmm are built on solving hydraulic equations typically saint venant equations and are widely used in modelling of catchment scale sewer systems conceptual models on the other hand are based on simplifying the full scale sewer network and in particular the hydraulic details while keeping the main features of the full network in view of the modelling purpose the approach of conceptual models has been proposed as an alternative to traditional hydraulic models for its fast computation speed which is an advantage in studying real time control in stormwater management meirlaen et al 2001 garcía et al 2015 one commonly used conceptualization method is to simplify the complex network into a set of linear or non linear reservoirs also known as tanks in series the modelling of sewer biochemical processes is drawing more attention in recent years and models have been proposed by modifying or adopting similar concepts as used in the biochemical models of wwtps hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 jiang et al 2009 sharma et al 2008 however using such biochemical models in sewer networks is not as easy as in wwtps when looking at a map of an urban drainage system it is obvious that the sewer network runs over kilometers while the wwtp is shown as a dot therefore besides dynamic variations which are also of importance when it comes to wwtp modelling and control spatial distributions is a key interest in the modelling of collection systems as it provides for example important information for sulfide h2s hotspot identification for sewer pipe corrosion prediction due to this spatial distribution the total number of modelled units and biochemical variables is larger than in wwtps which means that more differential equations have to be solved for a sewer system consequently modelling water quality in large scale sewer networks asks for far more computational effort than wwtps in addition as sewer pipe corrosion is a relatively long term process islander et al 1991 wells and melchers 2014 it requires long term simulations and thus fast computations are in order moreover climate change and water scarcity can change the sewer environment and bring new challenges to wastewater treatment in the future cromwell et al 2009 tram et al 2014 therefore there is also a modelling demand on long term projections of collection system behaviour creating more requirements on computation capacity the above characteristics severely restrict the application of sewer biochemical models and their integration with wwtp models when computational demands of collection system and wwtp differ significantly running them as an integrated system on the same layout is unreasonable for example a plant wide wwtp model like the benchmark simulation model no 2 bsm2 gernaey et al 2014 can easily run a year round simulation in a couple of hours to capture the effect of seasonal temperature changes on water quality and pollutant removal however simulating a similar period may need more than a day for a sewer system in that case it will create challenges to evaluate the long term performance of integrated system and it will be necessary to improve the running speed of the sewer model proper coding and programming of modelling tools i e code structure and numerical algorithms can improve the simulation speed and the user s experience which provides the basis bottom box for testing and running different models fig 1 unfortunately so far little efforts have been put on this topic as an alternative to coding efforts conceptual modelling may be a solution to the computational bottleneck because the fast computation speed of conceptual models makes them equivalent to wwtp model computational load and thus allow for integrated modelling and long term simulation conceptualization and calibration methods were proposed for runoff and storm water management purpose kroll et al 2017 pieper et al 2017 however those studies only paid attentions to physical and hydraulic properties of the system with in depth investigations on flow rate calibration storage tank modelling system division and catchment topology other studies focused on water quality but limited the modelling to transport processes advection sedimentation resuspension and not on biochemical reactions occurring in the sewer system benedetti et al 2013 mannina and viviani 2010 maruéjouls et al 2014 quijano et al 2017 the aim of this study was to break barriers in sewer biochemical modelling and provide a basis for integration of biochemical sewer models with wwtp models to achieve real integrated and long term modelling of water quality therefore a new method is proposed in this paper which simplifies a complex network into a conceptual model in view of biochemical modelling a case study was carried out on the collection system of québec city qc canada 2 method 2 1 conceptualization procedure model conceptualization usually starts from a complex and detailed informed reference model and the conceptualization process is to find a substitute of the reference model meirlaen et al 2001 in this paper swmm was selected as the reference model as suggested in many other studies kroll et al 2017 vanrolleghem et al 2009 willems 2008 wolfs and willems 2017 its simulation results represent hydraulic information of the whole system however although conceptual modelling is not a new concept its application in sewer biochemical process modelling differs from that in sewer flow modelling the difference is caused by the different study interests and calibration objectives between process and flow modelling the conceptualization procedure used in this paper is illustrated in fig 2 first a conceptual hydraulic model was derived from swmm then both the conceptual hydraulic model and swmm were coupled with the same biochemical model i e using the same reactions rates kinetic parameters and stoichiometric matrix in this way it could be evaluated how the choice of hydraulic model i e swmm vs conceptual hydraulic model affects the modelling of in sewer processes note that although in this paper the procedure and method were proposed for biochemical modelling they can also be applied for water quantity modelling and storm water management purposes 2 1 1 identifying key elements and regions in the sewer system before conceptualizing a large sewer network into a simple system the first step is to identify which elements in the network play a crucial role and how to cut the big network into subsystems in the modelling of in sewer biochemical processes the dry weather conditions are of more interest indeed sulfide production mainly occurs under dry weather conditions and corrosion is a consequence of long term exposure to sulfide production in terms of integrated management a considerable number of studies have already been conducted on the assessment and control of the risks and challenges imposed by storm weather conditions astaraie imani et al 2012 benedetti et al 2013 karamouz et al 2016 however in the water quality control of the sewer wwtp integrated system the interest is also to use the sewer as a bioreactor for pollutant removal similar to the bioreactors in a wwtp in such studies the operation and performance of the sewer is first targeted under dry weather conditions therefore in this study the sewer system is only simplified for dry weather flow conditions consequently only the storage tanks and pumping stations that are active under dry weather conditions are identified and included for conceptual modelling usually those elements are also the accessible places for operational adjustments or chemical dosing strategies 2 1 2 conceptualizing and calibrating the sewer network model one vital question in conceptual modelling is calibration in sewer hydraulic modelling calibration is more focused on sewer flow because the interest is to model how the drainage system will discharge and overflow under storm weather and how to manage that by using models however in order to model pollutant concentration changes flow rates and volume of water in the pipes are equally important the left box of fig 1 therefore two calibration targets are set the total volume v target and the final outflow q target of the target sewer network hence the calibration question can be stated as fig 3 knowing all inflows coming into the target network q in total and assuming the volume v and flow q of each of the n conceptual tanks i e reservoirs is expressed in a relationship of q i k v i m find parameters n number of tanks k and m of a tanks in series system to meet v target and q target the flow volume equation was derived by modifying the flow volume linear relationship of the kalinin milyukov nash model kalinin and milyukov 1957 nash 1957 szilagyi 2006 to a non linear relationship in order to make the equation more flexible to fit flow and volume data in most parameter optimization methods the algorithm searches the best parameter set in a pre defined parameter space however this kind of methods usually requires a good guess of the parameter ranges the search can take a long time and sometimes it may end up only in a local optimum dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 for these reasons a simple dedicated calibration procedure is proposed first one should compare q in total and q target if q in total and q target overlap each other closely the network can be simplified into a single tank otherwise one must shift q target forward by a time step ts to get a new data series q target ts until the best match is obtained between ln v target and ln q target ts ln v target a ln q target ts b k and m can then be calculated as 1 m 1 a 2 k n 1 a exp b a n depends on the flow type for a clear plug flow behaviour it is suggested to try n 10 it was found though that no significant improvement in model fit will be obtained when increasing n above 20 tanks 2 1 3 conceptualizing storage tanks the storage tanks controlled by pumping stations can be modelled by applying pumping rules alternatively they may be modelled as a non linear tank reservoir using the equation q st k v st m the same formula used for a sewer conceptual tank i e reservoir 2 2 in sewer biochemical process modeling as shown in fig 1 the modelling of sewer pollutant variations consists of choosing a combination among a set of sewer flow models and a set of biochemical process models therefore a new modelling platform was developed guo et al 2018 which can couple different sewer flow models i e both hydraulic models and conceptual models with different biochemical models the matlab based platform can easily handle large scale networks and quickly deliver results the platform offers a basis in which different biochemical models can be embedded currently it incorporates two biochemical models the sewex model sharma et al 2008 and a modified version of a biofilm model rauch et al 1999 in this study the sewex model was selected which is an extension of the model described by hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 and suitable for simulating conventional sewer processes including sulfide production fermentation etc 3 case study and results 3 1 studied case the studied sewage collection system is located in quebec city quebec canada the swmm model of the sewer network fradet et al 2011 was re calibrated and validated based on actual dry weather flow sensor data fig 4 the wwtp receives wastewater from two big regions in this case the collection system from the central region as shown in fig 4 a was investigated this is the central region of quebec city covering about 26 km2 with about 300 000 inhabitants the swmm model of this studied region has about 41 5 km of sewer pipes and contains 16 pumping stations and 16 storage tanks 3 2 conceptualization results as explained above the first step is to identify key elements and regions as a result the blue zone in fig 4 which covers 477 sewer pipes is the region retained after identifying the key storage tanks and pumping stations clearly this blue zone is the main target of the conceptual modelling in this case because it covers almost the whole network therefore conceptualization was first carried out on this blue zone and then moved on to the remaining small sewer segments key storage tanks and pumping stations as explained in fig 2 the overall wastewater inflow to this blue zone comes from two types based on their sources first the blue zone has a large number of local inflow nodes i e 67 influent nodes all these local inflow nodes are summed up into one input to the blue zone second there are several small subsystems of the network consisting of storage tanks pumping stations and pipes running over a short distance which transport wastewater downstream to the blue zone therefore the blue zone also receives inflows from those small subsystems as a result the sewer network covered by the blue zone was conceptualized and calibrated into a system of 20 tanks in series by using the method presented in section 2 1 2 eqs 1 and 2 fig 5 shows that the calibrated conceptual model gives a good match with the target flows and volumes simulated with the swmm model the virtual tracer test further validates the calibration result in terms of material physical transport fig 5 after that the conceptual model of the collection system was extended to include the storage tanks pumping stations and small network subsystems most of the sewer networks of those small subsystems could be simplified as one conceptual sewer tank i e reservoir in the end the entire network of fig 4 a was conceptualized as fig 6 the regions with colors in fig 4 a were conceptualized into units with the same colors in fig 6 sewer4 is the conceptual sewer of the blue zone in fig 4 a it consists of 20 tanks i e reservoir receiving wastewater from local inflows i e inflow4 colored in blue and two small branches i e the green region inflow1 st1 sewer1 and st4 and the grey region inflow3 sewer3 and st3 the blue region is followed by the yellow region st2 and sewer2 3 3 sewer biochemical modelling results by using the new modelling platform presented above both the swmm model and the conceptual model were coupled with the sewex biochemical model i e leading to the swmm sewex set and the conceptual sewex set as shown in table 1 the swmm sewex set and the conceptual sewex set show very similar results in terms of water quality at the sewer system outlet influent of the wwtp however the simulation with the conceptual model was significantly faster than with swmm minutes vs hours for 5 days simulation the faster running speed of the conceptual sewex model is thanks to the reduction in number of modelled units in the conceptual model compared to swmm i e 20 tanks vs 477 pipes resulting in much less biochemical variables and differential equations to be solved 4 discussion the swmm based and the conceptual system based biochemical models have their own pros and cons so the selection of either of them in real applications depends on purpose and scope of the projects the calculation time spent for the sewer conceptual model is similar to the time needed to simulate a typical full scale wwtp model thanks to this balanced computational load it becomes practical to actually connect the sewer conceptual model to a wwtp model like the bsm2 to form a real integrated model in which both parts take about the same computational load this means that sewer and wwtp can be run together for long term simulations making truly integrated studies feasible in addition the conceptual biochemical model is easier to be calibrated than the swmm biochemical model because the system has fewer objects to be considered and the simulation is faster allowing quick evaluation of calibration results therefore the conceptual system based biochemical model appears more suitable for long term simulation and integrated modelling of urban scale collection system and wwtp on the other hand although the swmm based biochemical simulation runs much slower it allows to show the detailed spatial distribution of water quality for the whole network for example by using the presented modelling platform the diurnal dynamic distribution map of h2s could be generated for the studied collection system fig 7 shows the distribution map every 6 h in a day it can be seen that the studied system generally does not show high sulfide production but there are some hotspots within the network that may warrant further attention in conclusion the swmm based biochemical model is particularly useful for hotspot identification in some situations the two sets of models need to be combined for example the conceptual model can be used to predict wastewater composition from branches flowing to a trunk system whose in sewer processes are simulated by using swmm based biochemical models 5 conclusion in this study a conceptual modelling and calibration method was proposed driven by the needs of long term and large scale modelling of sewer biochemical processes and water quality in the integrated urban wastewater system sewer and wwtp the method allows to quickly simplify a complex network into a series of conceptual tanks i e reservoirs and satisfy calibration goals on sewer flow and sewage volume in pipes it serves as an important component of a new modelling platform which is capable to handle different scales of collection systems and to incorporate different biochemical models the whole network swmm based modelling and the conceptual modelling have each their own advantages in practice the two methods can be selected or combined according to specific modelling purposes and conditions on the one hand the whole network modelling method runs simulations for all pipes of a sewer network to show the spatial distribution of water quality throughout the system this method can be used to identify hot spots e g of corrosion inducing sulfide in a large network on the other hand the conceptual modelling method shows advantages in terms of fast simulation and easy calibration given those reasons it has a great potential in sewer wwtp integrated modelling and long term simulation declaration of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by

6546,to overcome water scarcity issues managed aquifer recharge mar structures are currently developed in many parts of the world including poorly permeable terrain like weathered crystalline rocks in such geological context characterized by relatively limited groundwater storage mainly associated with fractures located at the interface between the upper weathered layer saprolite and the fractured bedrock the efficiency of mar is poorly known to address this question and better understand the factors that control recharge dynamics an artificial recharge basin was implemented at the experimental hydrogeological park in telangana south india a well equipped and continuously monitored site situated in archean granitic terrain the thickness of the saprolite and hydraulic properties are relatively well known all over the site from previous geophysical surveys and hydraulic tests to characterize recharge dynamics recharge has been monitored in different boreholes surrounding the infiltration basin infiltration rates and water level data are interpreted by both a volume balance approach and different analytical solutions in addition a simple numerical model was used to show how the depth of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite controls recharge dynamics and observed water levels variations results show that the permeability of the saprolite bedrock interface is sufficiently large to allow an efficient recharge that propagates laterally throughout the aquifer through this well connected interface however the variable depth of this permeable pathway controls the water level response acting as a semi impervious boundary leading to remarkable water level variations thus our findings show how the characteristics of the most permeable pathways control recharge dynamics in weathered crystalline rocks in addition we show how the depth variations of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite may be inferred from the

world depend on fractured crystalline aquifers as the only source of freshwater unesco 1999 particularly in arid and semi arid regions like india crystalline rocks cover about 70 of india s geographical area saha et al 2013 furthermore india has seen an unprecedented development of groundwater exploitation within the last 50 to 60 years irrigation potential increased from 6 5 m ha to 45 7 m ha sharma et al 2005 out of which it is estimated crystalline rock aquifer groundwater represents more than 50 especially in south india planning commission 2011 the advent of this green revolution aimed towards increasing agricultural output and achieving food security has also brought on a number of water scarcity and groundwater quality degradation issues pingali 2012 pinstrup andersen and hazell 1985 singh 2000 natural replenishment of groundwater reservoirs has become insufficient to keep pace with the excessive continued exploitation of groundwater resources in many regions leading to a long term drop of groundwater levels central ground water board 2013 in this context the government has set out to remediate water table depletion by increasing aquifer recharge from 9 of total rainfall under natural conditions to 15 by 2020 government of andhra pradesh 2003 through the development of large scale managed aquifer recharge mar schemes the central ground water board has proposed the building of 11 million mar structures nation wide as well as the reparation renovation and restoration of the already existing structures the total costs tallying up to over 12bn usd central ground water board 2013 a wide spectrum of mar techniques may be implemented to recharge the groundwater reservoir and these are selected mainly in terms of the hydrogeological framework for example infiltration methods such as percolation tanks are prioritized in relatively permeable environments such as alluvial formations while recharge shafts are preferred when the aquifer is overlain by poorly permeable strata injection wells are used if the aquifer is confined in india and in the state of telangana underlain mainly by hard rock the most prevalent recharge structures are percolation tanks and infiltration basins central ground water board 2013 it was estimated in the latest census of minor irrigation sources that there are 46 531 percolation tanks all of which the department of irrigation has set out to restore by 2020 irrigation cad department 2015 mar can be used to address a wide range of water management issues including reducing seawater intrusion or land subsidence e g masciopinto 2013 smoothing out supply and demand fluctuations e g palma et al 2015 protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems e g ward and dillon 2012 and improving water quality through filtration and chemical and biological processes e g hamadeh et al 2014 in this particular case however mar is only expected to remediate groundwater exploitation and water quality is not managed jakeman et al 2016 overall common belief is that mar initiatives are a viable and suitable solution to water scarcity issues however there is little consensus within published studies about their efficiency and impact especially in hard rock context at small scales a few square meters to a few square kilometers results often point towards increased groundwater resources and predominantly positive impacts of artificial recharge massuel et al 2014 srivastava et al 2009 which benefit only landholders closest to the recharge facilities boisson et al 2015b dillon et al 2009 larger scale studies at the watershed scale or bigger are less common e g glendenning et al 2012 on one hand because of the difficulty in obtaining relevant data de marsily et al 2005 and on the other on the complexity associated with groundwater reservoirs in crystalline rock further many of these studies are limited to water budget analysis and do not focus on hydrodynamic processes e g scanlon et al 2012 boisson et al 2015b while water budgets can provide useful guidelines for groundwater exploitation many authors have pointed out their insufficiency in providing accurate estimates of safe yield and sustainability highlighting the need to understand dynamic processes bredehoeft 2002 zhou 2009 information on dynamic processes is further necessary to make out the spatial distribution of artificial recharge weathered crystalline rock aquifers are characterized by highly variable hydraulic properties acworth 1987 chilton foster 1995 dewandel et al 2012 maréchal et al 2004 which result in a complex combination of diffuse recharge and preferential flows alazard et al 2016 reddy et al 2009 sukhija et al 2003 where the latter have often been shown to dominate groundwater recharge processes cuthbert tindimugaya 2010 gleeson et al 2009 sukhija et al 2003 in the aquifer horizontal preferential flows take place in the most transmissive zones of the aquifer which consist of the main open fractures and most importantly the bedrock weathering interface at the limit between the upper weathered layer saprolite and the fractured granite this has been recognized by many authors e g acworth 1987 chilton foster 1995 dewandel et al 2006 boisson et al 2015a the presence of these zones leads to a vertical anisotropy of permeability maréchal et al 2004 2003 since the bedrock weathering interface is in general hilly its relief may control groundwater flows leading to aquifer compartmentalization where exchanges between compartments depend on water levels relative to interface topography guihéneuf et al 2014 the exact nature of the relationship between the bedrock weathering interface relief and recharge is not yet clearly understood while this study focuses on fractured crystalline rock it should be noted that the existence of sub horizontal preferential flow pathways originating from sharp vertical contrasts in transmissivity exists in other type of media as well such as stratified aquifers nimmo et al 2017 and that the observations outlined in this paper may be applicable in these environments as well artificial recharge may be affected by preferential flow paths in contrasting ways their existence could enhance recharge allowing an efficient and rapid lateral transfer of percolation throughout the aquifer on the other hand the compartmentalization associated with these environments highlighted by previous studies could possibly slow or stop the progression of infiltration fronts leading to focused recharge in specific areas monitoring of mar infiltration front progression is therefore necessary to better understand the role of preferential flow paths on the efficiency of recharge processes in crystalline rock aquifers not only from a quantitative standpoint but also in regards to water quality and pollution propagation issues the aim of this study is to characterize artificial recharge processes in weathered crystalline rock and analyze the complex flow dynamics of recharge inputs through the main flow paths namely the relief of the saprolite bedrock interface to do so we monitored an artificial recharge basin that has been set up in an experimental site equipped with a network of observation borewells a water balance and simple infiltration equations were used to quantify the inputs of the recharge basin and their temporal evolution as well as the vertical hydraulic properties then the lateral progression of the infiltration front in the underlying hard rock reservoir was analyzed analytical solutions were used to infer the lateral hydrodynamic properties of the media while numerical modeling allowed us to quantify the effects of basement relief on recharge in order to explain the particularities of the observed recharge process 2 study site the infiltration basin is situated within the experimental hydrogeological park ehp which is a hydrological observatory located near the choutuppal village in the nalgonda district telangana state since 2014 60 km to the south east of hyderabad latitude 17 17 47 n longitude 78 55 12 e in south india fig 1 the site has been developed by the french geological survey brgm in partnership with the indian national geophysical research institute ngri and is part of the h observatory network most data used in this study can be downloaded from the h database http hplus ore fr en 2 1 geological setting the site is located in an archean granite setting which represents over 80 of the total surface of the telangana state this granitic formation is intruded locally by geological discontinuities such as dikes or quartz reefs but none are present on the ehp guihéneuf et al 2014 the fracturing of the granite is mainly characterized by sub horizontal fractures which can display a lateral extension of tens of meters guihéneuf et al 2014 the typical geological profile in the ehp was obtained through analysis of drilling cuttings and generally follows the description provided in dewandel et al 2006 namely a thin red soil layer a few centimeters a sandy regolith layer 0 2 m thick made up of a sandy clay composition with quartz grains dewandel et al 2006 a laminated saprolite layer of variable thickness ranging from 0 to 20 m derived from in situ weathering of granite it presents a millimeter spaced horizontal laminated structure and coarse sand size clasts and a few preserved conductive fractures dewandel et al 2006 due to its composition the saprolite layer can reach a quite high porosity bulk porosities are mainly between 5 and 30 depending on the lithology of the parent rock and the degree of weathering dewandel et al 2006 granite mainly consisting of quartz potassium feldspars and biotite dewandel et al 2006 the few first meters of the granite in contact with the laminated saprolite i e the saprolite granite interface are highly weathered and fractured the fracture density rapidly decreases with depth although local transmissive fractures may be encountered up to 60 m deep guihéneuf et al 2014 the effective porosity of this layer is relatively low of about 1 and in mainly ensured by the fissure zones dewandel et al 2006 2 2 hydrological setting the climate of this region is semi arid and controlled by the periodicity of monsoons mean annual temperature is 28 c with high temperatures of about 45 c during the dry season the rainy season occurs from june to november for a yearly average of about 800 mm ephemeral streams may be present during the monsoon but are most of the time absent intra seasonal water level variations depend on groundwater recharge but are generally comprised between 10 and 20 m below ground surface m bgs fig 2 there is no apparent straightforward relation between rainfall episodes and water level variations and some intense rainfall episodes do not elicit a groundwater response like in 2012 765 mm of rain fig 2 within the framework of the previously cited state wise mar project an infiltration basin was dug on the ehp during 2015 to meet the demands of farmers in the area facing water scarcity land use in the vicinity of the observatory consists mostly of cotton fields some rice paddies and a few orchards although it is assumed pumping for irrigation does not impact water levels on the site as most pumped borewells are downstream from the site the basin was dug using an excavator its approximate dimensions are 120 m by 40 m with a depth of about 2 m effectively removing the regolith layer and extending into the saprolite debris was piled around the basin to create a bund and avoid spillovers the basin is mainly supplied by a canal which deviates water from the musi river downstream the state capital hyderabad fig 1 the distance traveled by the canal between the musi river and our study site is of about 40 km over this distance the canal branches out into several smaller canals which supply a network of infiltration basins throughout the region the water thus used to recharge aquifers is river water directly rerouted into the subsurface without any treatment whatsoever unfortunately despite several attempts by various governments the river musi is the eighth most polluted river in india receiving nearly 645 million liters per day of sewage water nilesh 2016 as well as industrial effluents let out by pharmaceutical and bulk drug companies cheepi 2012 nitin 2018 the basin was initially filled by the end of 2015 black arrow fig 2 but this period was not yet monitored the continuous monitoring of the basin began during the following filling episode which took place in july 2016 groundwater levels significantly increased following the filling of the basin reaching the highest levels ever monitored on site fig 2 note that in many countries regulations state the need for an infiltration basin and the underlying aquifer to remain hydraulically disconnected bouwer 2002 carleton 2010 réfloch 2018 this allows preservation of an unsaturated zone below the basin which is necessary to allow aerobic processes to take place to partly prevent the propagation of contaminants this criterion was not met during this study because the water supply relied on the sporadic opening of an upstream floodgate managed by a third party entity previous works e g guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015a during which a series of hydraulic tests were performed on site have allowed the estimation of the media s hydrodynamic properties fig 3 namely the transmissivity t m2 s 1 and storativity s the upper fractured granite and the fractures within the granite were shown to be the most conductive with a good storativity fig 3 boisson et al 2015a on the other hand the saprolite layer was characterized as poorly transmissive it must be noted however that several authors have suggested the potential of preserved fractures within the weathered saprolite to contribute to preferential flow dewandel et al 2006 perrin et al 2011 and that overall knowledge on saprolite properties is currently limited in sum the most transmissive zones of the aquifer are the upper fractured zone also known as the weathering interface laterally well connected and some permeable fractures encountered at greater depths which conversely have a limited extension and continuity because the weathering interface has a variable depth dewandel et al 2006 st clair et al 2015 groundwater flow dynamics shift depending on water table elevation guihéneuf et al 2014 in the 2014 paper by guihéneuf et al hydraulic tests performed under different water level conditions high water levels and low water levels in combination with observations on piezometric variations revealed how aquifer compartmentalization causes this contrasting behavior under high level conditions the well connected permeable upper granite saprolite zone allows regional flows to take place more specifically towards the northeast of the site guihéneuf et al 2014 contrariwise because fracture density and therefore connectivity decreases with depth low water levels lead to a lateral compartmentalization of the aquifer the system then shifts to an independent local flow system guihéneuf et al 2014 the site is equipped with 30 borewells of different depths fig 1 all of which are equipped with a casing extending into the saprolite screened or open at the contact zone between the saprolite and the fractured granite table 1 features the technical characteristics of the site boreholes which were used for this study and the hydraulic properties at each of these wells may be found in guihéneuf et al 2014 note that the saprolite thickness which ranges from 14 m to 24 m is very variable table 1 8 boreholes were continuously equipped with pressure and temperature sensors measuring piezometric levels and temperature during the time of this study an additional probe was installed in the infiltration basin to monitor water levels in the basin at the time scales considered the fracture system within the fractured granite and the overlying saprolite are assumed to be at equilibrium meaning there is no significant pressure difference between the unconsolidated saprolite and the fractures in the underlying granite this was later confirmed when superficial wells 15 m were dug only in the saprolite near the ch01 and ch02 boreholes fig 1f which featured virtually the same hydraulic head variations as the deeper wells this is consistent with the unconfined response high storativity fig 3 of the interface to pumping tests under packers which confirms the role of vertical fractures in connecting overlying saprolite with underlying fractures 2 3 water level variations in response to recharge the filling of the artificial recharge basin caused water levels to rise significantly fig 4 the basin remained flooded for most of the observation period although levels in the basin varied widely from a few cm up to almost 3 m depending on the sporadic canal inputs each filling episode was followed by a recession period ranging from a few days to a few months becoming longer towards the end of the observation period borewells can be divided into two groups relative to their groundwater level variations the first composed of ch01 and ch02 is the cluster closest to the basin the second comprises the boreholes in the cluster farthest from the basin ch03 to ch24 out of which only 3 are shown along the ab profile fig 4 for clarity purposes the two groups are characterized by different patterns of water level variations but have similarities between them there are three identifiable phases for both clusters depending on the time t of observation starting from t 0 which is the beginning of the monitoring period july 5th 2016 p1 0 t 60 days approx the overall range of variations is weak the water levels for neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 remain deep about 15 m below surface close to water levels observed before basin infilling this suggests the water table remains disconnected from the infiltration basin during this period of time p2 60 t 80 days approx an abrupt increase in water levels of about 15 m is observed for neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 while the basin water levels vary between 1 and 2 m during this period hydraulic head reaches near surface levels ch02 is at 366 3 m asl and ch01 at 365 7 m asl such variations suggest that the basin and the aquifer are becoming hydraulically connected the increase in remote water levels ch03 to ch24 is much weaker but shows a clear response this phase ends at around 80 days where an important inflection point can be observed fig 4 marking a change in dynamics p3 t 80 days for this period of time water levels in the closest boreholes ch01 and ch02 are very high close to ground surface levels suggesting that the basin remains connected to the water table remote boreholes appear to increase strongly during the first 40 days where water levels reach a depth of only a few meters below ground interestingly remote borehole levels appear to evolve in sync with very similar hydraulic heads measured in all boreholes these observations suggest that p2 is a transition phase between the disconnected phase p1 and the fully connected phase p3 during which the basin fills the whole aquifer accordingly the hydraulic response for remote boreholes is delayed in relation to neighboring boreholes when levels in the near vicinity reach a pseudo steady state remote water levels begin increasing simultaneously this indicates a sort of tipping point mechanism the attenuation of water level increase in the near vicinity of the basin is related to the progression of the pressure front laterally 3 methods the methodology applied aims to characterize the hydraulic properties controlling infiltration and its lateral transmission throughout the aquifer as well as the effects of bedrock topography on the transient aquifer response this was done through a combination of analytical and numerical modeling using water levels in the basin meteorological data rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and the observed water level response in the observation boreholes daily rainfall was measured on site using an automatic weather station and daily open pan evaporation was measured and made available by icrisat international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics about 80 km away from our site 3 1 estimating infiltration rates and vertical hydraulic conductivity infiltration inf from the basin into the aquifer was quantified to characterize recharge and to be used as inputs to the analytical and numerical aquifer response models posteriorly described to do so a volume balance approach vba was applied in parallel to infiltration equations that will be described hereafter the vba approach requires knowledge of all of the water balance components canal inflow q in rainfall p evaporation e and basin stock variations dh all of which are in mm day 1 1 inf q in p e d h it was assumed that the runoff component considering the small impluvium surface 1ha was negligible because it was not possible to measure canal inflow directly for technical reasons the vba approach was only applied to recession periods where q in is assumed to be null dh was deduced from the water levels measured continuously in the basin h where dh h t h t 1 e was assumed to be equal to open pan potential evaporation measurements the equation was applied at a daily time step the vba approach is the most complete as it accounts for all inputs and outputs to the system although it is not applicable during basin filling periods in the absence of rainfall and neglecting evaporation one also expects infiltration rates to be simply related to water levels in the basin with greater water levels leading to greater infiltration to examine such relationships infiltration rates from basin water level variations during recession periods were compared to the corresponding water levels in the basin thus the relationship inf α h with α as the coefficient of proportionality was evaluated empirically if a satisfactory relationship is obtained during recession periods such relationship may be extrapolated to all times including infilling periods comparison to vba infiltration ensured that neglecting p and e is not too strong of an assumption finally with infiltration roughly deduced from basin water levels the canal inflow q in can be calculated during infilling periods as the remnant of eq 1 note that these relationships can generally be described by darcy type equations directly linking infiltration to water levels based on knowledge of saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity bouwer 2002 it was not possible to estimate hydraulic conductivity during the initial phases p1 and p2 because the depth of the wetting front and the apparent hydraulic conductivity are poorly constrained in partially saturated environments when there is a full hydraulic connection between the basin and the aquifer p3 one may assume that the system may be equated to a falling head permeameter during the recession periods flows are assumed to be mainly vertical within the saprolite before reaching the weathering interface which is assumed to be an a priori much more conductive zone it therefore is assumed that flows are mainly controlled by the saprolite s properties which offer the greater resistance to flow and the head gradient over the saprolite s thickness the hydraulic head at the bottom of the saprolite may be given by the hydraulic head in the closest boreholes which are very close to ground level thus the head gradient may be roughly estimated equal to h l i e the difference in hydraulic head between the top of the saprolite h l and the bottom of the saprolite l with l the thickness of the saprolite the vertical flow can be thus described using the darcy equation 2 inf k v h l where k v is the vertical hydraulic conductivity l t 1 knowing that inf dh dt during recession periods this equation can be rearranged to yield dh h k v l d t where the boundary conditions of this problem are h h 0 at t 0 if we integrate dh h on the left hand side from h 0 to h and the right hand side from 0 to t then ln h 0 h k v l t this yields 3 h h 0 e k v l t to check the consistency of the above equation observed water levels were plotted for each recession posterior to hydraulic connection p3 phase when verified a linear regression allows estimating of k v l and with known l hydraulic conductivity can be deduced finally having estimated k v during recession period allows estimating infiltration also for the infilling periods using eq 2 3 2 modeling the aquifer response to infiltration in a second step we calibrated an analytical solution modeling groundwater level variations against observations to provide an estimate of the hydrodynamic parameters controlling lateral flow the effects of the transmissive interface s relief on flow however were ascertained using simple numerical modeling since no analytical solution was available for this purpose to do so different scenarios were tested where bedrock relief and hydrodynamic properties were varied to assess the changes in groundwater response and the overall likeness to the dynamics observed on the experimental site 3 2 1 analytical solutions calibration of simple analytical solutions against observed groundwater levels can allow a first order estimation of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storativity controlling groundwater flow groundwater mechanisms are described by different mathematical models depending whether there is a hydraulic connection between the basin and the water table or not fig 5 the most common analytical solutions for groundwater mounding are valid only in situations where the water table is assumed to be hydraulically disconnected from the bottom of the groundwater infiltration basin conversely analytical modeling of mounds that are fully connected to any recharge structure is relatively rare and most often concerns streams or canals e g dillon and liggett 1983 spanoudaki et al 2010 modeling of connected recharge basins or lagoons e g kacimov et al 2016 is much rarer further if the mechanisms in place deviate from standard conditions assuming homogeneous media then fully realistic descriptions of these processes are said to be beyond any simple analytical solutions alderwish 2010 in this context it was decided to use analytical modeling only in the initial phase of wetting and mounding p1 when the recharge basin is clearly disconnected from the aquifer and thus flow conditions remain relatively simple and respect the initial conditions required because remote boreholes ch03 to ch24 show little to no response during this phase analytical modeling was only calibrated against observations in neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 which show a clear response to basin infilling even during the initial phase of wetting and mounding p1 we used hantush s solution for rectangular basins hantush 1967 3 2 1 1 hantush s solution for rectangular basins in general analytical solutions to predict the rate of growth and shape of a recharge mound solve the governing partial differential equation describing the flow of groundwater as given by the linearized boussinesq equation warner et al 1989 4 k b 2 h x 2 2 h y 2 r s h t where the different variables and parameters are defined in fig 5 the solution developed by hantush hantush 1967 simulates groundwater mound growth and decay in response to percolation and is valid when the top of the groundwater mound is disconnected from the bottom of the recharge basin 5 z r b 2 s 0 t erf l b 2 x 4 υ τ erf l b 2 x 4 υ τ erf w b 2 y 4 υ τ erf w b 2 y 4 υ τ d τ where z h 2 b 2 υ is a simplifying term with υ k b s and τ t t the time during which percolation takes place initial conditions assume a horizontal water table and the boundary conditions of zero slope of the mound profile at the center of the basin and at infinity in eq 5 recharge from infiltration is assumed to be constant however infiltration was found to vary significantly in time to get around this issue the approach was modified rather than directly integrating eq 5 by gauss quadrature a convolution of the impulse response of the aquifer to r 1 and the daily infiltration time series was made so that at a given time t 6 z t k 1 t z k 1 z u k r t k where zu is the impulse response and r is the recharge rate assumed equal to daily infiltration this solution was applied and calibrated at each borehole for which hydraulic head measurements are available where x y b and b were set to match the borehole s position and initial water table conditions hydraulic conductivity k and storativity s were obtained by optimizing the analytical models performance i e minimizing the root mean square error rmse between h sim simulated water table elevation and h obs observed water table elevation the 2d parameter space was thus explored in order to reach a parameter set for which the error was minimal and which fit realistic standards the resulting 2d rmse matrix was then analyzed to assess whether the model converged towards a unique solution as opposed to a situation where there is equifinality of parameters which implies there are several acceptable sets of parameters that cannot easily be dismissed and should be considered in the evaluation of uncertainty beven 2006 because this solution simulates how recharge inputs move laterally throughout the aquifer and considering the important vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity in fractured crystalline aquifers maréchal et al 2004 2003 k is assimilated to horizontal hydraulic conductivity 3 2 2 numerical modeling for connected basin while analytical solutions are easily and straightforwardly applied they do not account for the geometry of the aquifer and specific boundary conditions under these circumstances we tested the effect of bedrock relief on drawup i e the increase of water level due to basin infiltration using modflow and its bcf2 package which allows wetting of previously dry cells harbaugh 2005 modflow is a us geological survey block centered finite difference modular flow model and the source code is free public domain software the model was run using flopy bakker et al 2016 a python package for creating running and post processing modflow based models the numerical simulations were based on very simple conceptual models first a synthetic scenario with constant recharge was tested in order to analyze the causal relationship between the boundary conditions imposed by the bedrock relief and the groundwater response to recharge synthetic results were roughly compared to field results at this stage however the objective was not to attempt to perfectly match the observed groundwater response to infiltration then in a second step aimed at better reproducing the recharge dynamics actual estimated infiltration rates were used as inputs to the model the conceptual models tested all consist of a rectangular unconfined aquifer overlain by a thick unsaturated zone with an infiltration basin in its central part fig 6 the infiltration basin covers 6400 m2 and recharges the aquifer at a rate r of 1 10 6 m s 1 about 85 mm day 1 for the synthetic tests or at a transient rate determined by previously calculated infiltration for the final applied scenario recharge is applied to the highest active cell which is automatically determined meaning there is no retardation or storage of water in the unsaturated zone this is equivalent to simulating a partially or fully hydraulically connected environment i e p2 and p3 the initial phase p1 was not simulated due to poorly constrained boundary conditions during this unsaturated phase and because the modlfow model does not accurately accommodate transient unsaturated flow hydraulic parameters s and k were varied over one and an half and two orders of magnitude respectively 1 10 3 s 5 10 2 and 1 10 5 k 1 10 3 m s 1 to test the sensitivity of the model to these parameters while remaining in a realistic range and were later fixed respectively at 1 10 2 and 1 10 4 m s 1 to match the first order estimation of parameters from the analytical model for the synthetic tests or more precise values for the applied scenario the ratio of vertical to horizontal conductivity was fixed at 1 10 according to maréchal et al 2004 results we only simulate one quadrant of the aquifer fig 6a because all four quadrants are symmetrical therefore there is no flow between quadrants the hydrological system was simulated using a grid of 100 rows and columns with a 20 m spacing for a total model size of 2000 2000 m size at which it was estimated the outer boundary conditions did not affect the results for the simulated duration and six 5 m thick layers necessary to model stability fig 6b to ensure that the grid size and disposition were stable tests were performed where the size of the model and of the grid cells were varied to ensure water levels near the boundary remained stable initially layers 1 5 are dry head is 5 m and only the deepest layer is saturated the evolution of the groundwater mound over time was modeled using a transient simulation which was run for one stress period of 300 days with a one day time step using the pcg2 solver two scenarios were tested using two model configurations a reference scenario in which there is no compartmentalization and a compartmentalized scenario where an impervious boundary was added fig 6c the reference scenario was used to simulate water table mounding resulting from local recharge in homogeneous conditions with a sub horizontal bedrock the other scenario accounted for the more complex boundary conditions imposed by the basement relief by featuring a cuboid depression at the center the depression was aimed at representing a topographic depression at the granite saprolite interface as it was determined from previous electrical resistivity tomography ert soundings that the recharge basin is located above a bedrock depression this was done by adding an impermeable k and s 1 10 20 layer covering the bottom of the aquifer except at the center where the compartment is located fig 6 we tested different compartment widths ranging from 100 m to 1000 m with a 100 m interval and heights from 5 m to 25 m with a 5 m interval to test their causal relationship to groundwater drawup dynamics finally a simulation was run using the site s actual infiltration estimations from 3 1 as inputs to account for the observed variability of inputs over time and fit the model to observations hydraulic parameters were set equal to those obtained with the analytical solution only the compartment size was adjusted to fit the simulation to the observed data this allowed us to test the model s ability to simulate the observed groundwater variations by assuming a heterogeneous basement elevation 4 results 4 1 infiltration estimation and relative contributions estimating infiltration from the vba eq 1 or from water levels in the basin eq 2 was almost equivalent rainfall and evaporation do not have a strong effect on stock variations relative to canal inflow and infiltration in total it was estimated canal inflow accounted for 97 of inputs to the basin and infiltration for 95 of outputs table 2 they are the main drivers of stock variations note that infiltration from recession periods was obtained using a volume balance approach and then linked to water levels in the basin to obtain relationships that could be extrapolated to filling periods these relationships were indeed found to be linear and are shown in full below as explained in the previous section canal inputs were estimated as the remnants of eq 1 with known infiltration inputs from the canal are quite high fig 7 and concentrated into short periods of time infiltration takes place more homogeneously throughout the observation period but there are still non negligible variations that mimic but do not follow perfectly water level variations fig 7 interestingly when the recharge mound reaches the base of the aquifer between 55 and 65 days approximately infiltration reaches its maximum value around 350 mm day 1 for a water level in the basin close to 2 6 m regardless of the large amounts of water brought on afterward and similar basin water levels recharge remains bounded reaching at most about 150 mm day 1 suggesting a decrease in the recharge potential another way to show this evolution is to investigate the evolution of the relationship between daily infiltration and water levels in the basin fig 8 a for each recession period infiltration is roughly proportional to water levels in the basin as expected from eq 2 but with different relations for the different period of recessions the coefficient of proportionality α decreases strongly with time fig 8b during phase p2 for times greater than 80 days p3 no significant changes are observed however the efficiency of the infiltration seems to be reduced by a factor of 6 from the early times until 80 days this behavior is expected when connecting the basin with the aquifer bouwer 2002 carleton 2010 because of the decrease in hydraulic gradient which results from the pore space filling up at the point of hydraulic connection this further supports the statement that p2 is a transition phase during which the basin becomes hydraulically connected to the aquifer 4 2 vertical hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity posterior to hydraulic connection was obtained using eq 3 from the recession slopes shown in fig 9 it was found to vary slightly between each recession slope ranging from 7 4 10 6 m s 1 to 9 4 10 6 m s 1 averaging 8 1 10 6 m s 1 such values are slightly higher than what is typically expected in the saprolite in this area but much lower than the most transmissive pathways at the interface between saprolite and the upper fractured granite fig 3 guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015a 4 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storativity calibration of observed groundwater levels to simulated water levels for the disconnected phase p1 using the hantush solution resulted in the parameters summed up in table 3 the best model fits can be seen in fig 10 rmse was normalized by the range of variation n r m s e rmse h max h m i n model error was satisfactory nrmse s being weaker than 5 averaged to all boreholes hydraulic conductivity was found to be 6 5 10 5 m s 1 with little variability between both estimates this estimate is clearly higher than the estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of the saprolite obtained from water level recessions averaging 8 10 6 m s 1 but very close to what boisson et al 2015a and guihéneuf et al 2014 obtained for the weathering interface fig 3 1 3 t 10 4 m2 s 1 and thus k 10 5 m s 1 the interface being a few meters thick storativity was found to be around 5 10 2 which is higher than the fig 3 weathering interface estimate s 9 7 10 3 denoting a possible influence of the saprolite on the apparent estimated storativity according to the variations of storativity between ch01 and ch02 it nevertheless seems to weaken as we move away from the basin 4 4 effect of bedrock relief numerical model 4 4 1 synthetic scenarios synthetic results obtained from numerical simulations are shown in fig 11 the reference model with parameters in the range of those obtained from analytical simulations k 10 4 m s 1 and s 10 2 showed very weak variations and a weak drawup slope black curve on fig 11a and b which cannot explain observed water level variations from the study site recharge dynamics cannot be modeled satisfactorily using these reasonable hydraulic parameters sensitivity tests not shown in fig 11 were also performed on k and s s variations of one order of magnitude led to a difference lower than 2 m decreasing k elicited a stronger groundwater response but with a weak drawup slope again disagreeing with observed data the most realistic simulation is obtained when considering a heterogeneous basement and thus semi penetrating impermeable boundary conditions the lateral extension of the depression compartment at the center of the model controls the slope of the drawup smaller lateral extensions of the compartment lead to stronger slopes fig 11a and as the lateral compartment size is progressively increased drawup dynamics approach that of the reference scenario i e no boundary effect the vertical extension of the depression does not have an impact of the slope of the drawup it does however control the amplitude of variations fig 11b where a greater difference in altitudes leads to a greater drawup amplitude 4 4 2 application to the present field case the application of the compartmentalized scenario to estimated infiltration inputs proved quite successful in recreating the dynamics of the closest boreholes for phase 2 and 3 fig 12 using the hydraulic parameters obtained from analytical modeling table 3 and varying only the shape of the basement we obtained a relatively good agreement between the simulated water levels and the observed ones nrmse 8 7 and 12 1 for ch01 and ch02 respectively the strong slope of the drawup is successfully reproduced and the following stabilization of water levels as well a lateral extension of about 120 m seems to best recreate the recharge dynamics of the study site with the above cited parameters although storativity was shown to be somewhat overestimated under the influence of the saprolite values owing to the borehole s proximity to the basin decreasing storativity to a value closer to that of the weathering interface s 9 7 10 3 requires increasing the theoretical lateral extension of the compartment to about 200 m to correctly model observations the calibrated vertical extension was found relatively constant around 18 m there is a slight discrepancy between the model and the simulation where the simulation under estimates water levels during the drawup phase and over estimates them during p3 this is probably because the actual system modeled is in reality much more complex than the model proposed here as we do not account for flow in fractures storage effects or matrix effects the underlying geometry of the interface may also be much more complex than the way it is simulated in the model we believe this is a testament to the interest this model brings wherein a very simple numerical model recreated complex dynamics note also that it was not possible to simulate remote boreholes using the model as is placing the observation point outside of the compartment did recreate the delay in borehole response observed in fig 4 but did not allow to simulate the amplitude of the variations correctly addressing this issue would imply complexifying the model to account for a much more complex geometry of the weathering interface which is currently beyond the scope of this paper a schematic summary of recharge dynamics is presented in fig 13 in a very simplified way the hydraulically disconnected phase of groundwater mounding p1 resembles that of a relatively homogeneous environment when hydraulic connection begins between the infiltration basin and the aquifer we observe boundary conditions leading to a rapid increase of water levels because infiltration is focused into a bounded domain the hydraulic connection also slows the infiltration process the final stage p3 is much less subject to boundary effects and a pseudo steady state is reached where levels oscillate around a constant value 5 discussion 5 1 representativity of hydraulic parameters overall infiltration efficiency i e the ratio of infiltration to total inputs is quite high 96 in the present case as opposed to previous studies in similar environments boisson et al 2015b 56 perrin et al 2009 54 singh et al 2004 67 but in agreement with efficiencies recorded by the central groundwater board in 2011 of up to 98 in hard rock environments a possible explanation of this difference is the age of the infiltration basins studies showing low infiltration efficiencies focused on percolation tanks that had not been recently desilted contrary to the basin studied here dug in 2015 and those present in the cgwb s case studies further the way in which the basin is supplied where large amounts of water are brought in short periods of time leads to an important water depth in the basin up to almost 3 m this could contribute to stronger infiltration rates linked to a higher hydraulic head this is as opposed to typical percolation tanks which accumulate a few centimeters of runoff over larger extended areas and thus subject to a higher amount of direct evaporation compared to infiltration although overall infiltration efficiency is high infiltration rates decrease significantly with hydraulic connection because of a decrease in hydraulic gradient infiltration is then more spread out in time which allows more evaporation to take place although the amount evaporated remains much weaker than the overall infiltrated volume this is not likely to continue to be the case if significant silting occurs this study s estimate of vertical permeability k v 8 1 10 6 m s 1 is slightly higher than what boisson et al 2015a obtained at the same site for the upper saprolite layer 9 10 8 to 3 10 7 m s 1 but overall in the same range as other studies performed on saprolite e g george 1992 7 10 6 m s 1 cook et al 1996 1 10 6 to 1 10 5 m s 1 boisson et al 2015a used falling head borehole permeameter tests which render point values whereas the large horizontal extent of the infiltration basin could allow sampling of otherwise undetectable vertical preferential flow paths i e preserved fractures in the saprolite and thus lead to an increase in hydraulic conductivity dewandel et al 2006 horizontal hydraulic properties were found to be in the upper range of values for fractured crystalline rock k 6 5 10 5 m s 1 and s 5 0 10 2 rather corresponding to the properties of the weathering interface obtained in boisson et al 2015a the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the system is thus much higher than the vertical hydraulic conductivity about 8 times higher this is consistent with the fact that the vertical hydraulic conductivity is controlled by the less transmissive saprolite and the lateral hydraulic conductivity by the highly transmissive weathering interface acting as a preferential flow path overall analytical modeling highlighted the strong influence of preferential flow in recharge processes 5 2 comparison to inferred interface relief previous acquisition of electrical resistivity tomography ert profiles chandra et al 2009 permitted the mapping of the depth of the weathering interface at the ehp site fig 14 the ert survey was carried out using a syscal jr switch with 10 m electrode spacing across 9 profiles using a wenner schlumberger configuration chandra et al 2009 profiles were analyzed using a routine inversion method and a threshold of about 400 ohm m braun et al 2009 was set to delineate the limit between fresh and weathered rock chandra et al 2009 point data was then interpolated using standard kriging techniques the obtained interface is significantly hilly composed of depressions and crests the protruding areas where crests delineate a set of sub drainage basins fig 14a the hilliness of the interface relief suggests the system is compartmentalized which supports the observations made in previous works highlighting the existence of compartmentalization in crystalline environments and its effects on groundwater flow and chemistry e g guihéneuf et al 2014 perrin et al 2011 two main compartments were identified one east of the site and the other north of the site extending beyond the site limits the lowest point of the bedrock topography appears to be north of the profile the compartment over which the infiltration basin is situated is trefoil like shaped with a diameter of about 500 m a low point at about 42 m depth and summits at about 20 m depth so a height difference of approximately 20 m this is similar to the dimensions obtained while fitting the numerical simulation to observed water levels i e a radius of 200 m and a height difference of 18 m using the ab profile outlined in fig 4 we traced the relief of the bedrock interface obtained from ert and replaced observed water levels so as to compare observed data to simulations fig 15 the depth of the interface was very similar to the depth estimated from borehole logs neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 are situated in a topographic depression whereas remote boreholes are in a crest area where the two compartments identified in fig 14a are separated ch03 being at the highest point the same phases outlined in fig 13 can be transposed to observed data prior to the supposed date of hydraulic connection in fig 15 t 0 and t 40 water level variations are weak and the water table is deep which corresponds to p1 then water levels increase rapidly under the effect of the lateral boundary condition in fig 15 t 60 and t 70 corresponding to p2 this continues until water levels exceed the topographic threshold downstream from the basin at about 70 days after the beginning of the observation period from that point onwards compartments become connected and water levels vary weakly but on a large extent which corresponds to p3 this conceptual model supports observations made by guihéneuf et al in 2014 the hydrogeological system is compartmentalized and the aquifer connectivity and associated flow regime is a function of water levels relative to the well connected bedrock interface 5 3 artificial recharge modeling the model most commonly used to explain recharge dynamics was proposed by bouwer 2002 in this model two scenarios explain an infiltration basin s dynamics if the bottom of the basin the clogging layer is less conductive than the underlying aquifer then infiltration is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the clogging layer the water within the basin is disconnected from the underlying aquifer perched over the silting layer otherwise infiltration is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the underlying aquifer in this case the water table may rise until hydraulic connection takes place and then the infiltration rate is controlled either solely by gravity and vertical flows in deep aquifers or by the slope of the water table mound in shallow aquifers this concept was developed assuming homogeneous sedimentary aquifers of infinite lateral extension instances of variable recharge dynamics have been documented in literature either stemming from progressive and heterogeneous silting e g racz et al 2012 mawer et al 2016 saturation of the vadose zone dillon liggett 1983 or more rarely structural discontinuities massuel et al 2014 in most cases the influence of heterogeneity on flow is limited to qualitative observations very few studies actually model processes with consideration of aquifer geometry e g ronayne et al 2008 probably because it is not easy to image the aquifer s geometry and practically impossible to obtain three dimensional information about hydraulic properties especially in hard rock context de marsily et al 2005 in this study we successfully quantified the role played by the basement relief and its associated compartmentalization on the hydraulic response of the aquifer to recharge also highlighting the effects of it on recharge propagation and infiltration potentials this study showed that the relief of the bedrock can produce an effect somehow analogous to the effect of impervious or semi impervious boundaries on drawdown during pumping tests de marsily 1986 in both cases a change in drawdown slope relative to a situation where no impervious boundary is present is expected to the best of our knowledge there are no other instances in literature where this effect was identified during recharge or as a result of a heterogeneous bedrock relief further because the relief crests are only a semi penetrating impervious boundary the increase in drawup slope relative to the reference scenario was shown to provide information on the dimensions of the relief in question where the larger the depression below the recharge basin the lesser the increase in drawup slope the in depth analysis of the transient aquifer response to recharge in a heterogeneous environment can be used to improve mar management in crystalline rock the requirements to perform this type of analysis are i an approximation of the aquifer s hydraulic properties ii a map of the contact zone between the saprolite and the granite and iii knowledge on the actual or desired water volumes to be stored in the aquifer the most challenging aspect of this methodology is obtaining a map of the subsurface although geophysical methods are becoming increasingly accurate and accessible one can for example cite the development of airborne electromagnetic methods which allow large scale high resolution mapping of the subsurface sørensen auken 2004 however if bedrock relief data is unobtainable we also showed how monitoring groundwater levels in the vicinity of the basin can provide valuable information on bedrock topography and on the storage potentials of the aquifer as such not only should the infiltration basin be monitored but also if possible groundwater levels around the basin extrapolation of our simple method could improve present day forward models used for mar management in such geological environments and possibly be extended into predictive modeling from a quantitative standpoint consideration of the effects of boundary conditions would be useful to regulate inputs in order to limit evaporation losses if the bedrock topography is known decision makers can gain a greater awareness of the extent to which recharge will propagate throughout the aquifer and choose whether to prioritize a strong localized reaction which may be easier to retrieve at later times or a weaker reaction over larger areas depending on the density and extent of the settlements affected by groundwater depletion and which stand to benefit from the augmentation of groundwater resources further implications on water quality are also non negligible we highlighted the importance of preferential flow which implies contaminant attenuation is not likely to take place rapidly enough to mitigate the negative effects of injecting wastewater into the aquifer the dominance of advective processes over diffusive processes in hard rock guihéneuf et al 2017 will likely aggravate this issue it is essential this be taken into consideration by decision makers the water currently used to feed the network of mar structures state wise originates directly from the musi river downstream of hyderabad and is highly polluted both by domestic and industrial effluents another element of risk that was identified in this study is that of hydraulic connection between the infiltration basin and the water table to which fractured crystalline environments are particularly susceptible due to their low transmissivities and variable saprolite thickness the best way to infer hydraulic connection is through groundwater level observation but it is still possible to infer that hydraulic connection has taken place when infiltration rates decrease significantly which may lead the basin to overflow or water levels in the basin to stagnate additionally to the loss of infiltration potentials which may dampen the efficiency of this water stress remediation method and lead to important losses by et hydraulic connection may amplify the risk of groundwater contamination if no unsaturated zone exists below the infiltration basin aerobic processes and sorption of contaminants which play an important part in retaining and degrading contaminants and that depend on residence times may be impeded 6 conclusions our study of artificial recharge processes in a fractured crystalline environment highlighted the role the heterogeneity of the horizontal weathering interface depth plays on recharge during the initial stages of wetting when the recharge mound is disconnected from the bottom of the basin infiltration is governed by the vertical properties of the relatively homogeneous and poorly conductive saprolite the lateral transmission of infiltration inputs reaching the aquifer is ensured mainly by the weathering interface thus foregrounding the importance of preferential flows once hydraulic connection between the infiltration basin and the aquifer takes place which is relatively rapidly due to the shallowness of the aquifer two simultaneous phenomena are observed infiltration potential decreases and water levels increase strongly and rapidly it was shown from numerical simulations that this can be interpreted as resulting from the control by the weathering interface relief where summits act as semi impervious boundaries which delimit a set of hydrogeological compartments the advancement of the infiltration front is thus impeded until the crest separating the east and north hydrogeological compartments is exceeded and the compartment is filled which focuses infiltration inputs into smaller volumes explaining the strong and sudden local water level increase once the summits are overpassed the different hydrogeological compartments are connected and the no flow boundary effect becomes less critical it has yet to be confirmed if the simple analytical and numerical approach used here can be applied more generally in crystalline rock environments but we believe this is a first step in better understanding the propagation of infiltration fronts in heterogeneous aquifers this in turn could provide useful information

6546,to overcome water scarcity issues managed aquifer recharge mar structures are currently developed in many parts of the world including poorly permeable terrain like weathered crystalline rocks in such geological context characterized by relatively limited groundwater storage mainly associated with fractures located at the interface between the upper weathered layer saprolite and the fractured bedrock the efficiency of mar is poorly known to address this question and better understand the factors that control recharge dynamics an artificial recharge basin was implemented at the experimental hydrogeological park in telangana south india a well equipped and continuously monitored site situated in archean granitic terrain the thickness of the saprolite and hydraulic properties are relatively well known all over the site from previous geophysical surveys and hydraulic tests to characterize recharge dynamics recharge has been monitored in different boreholes surrounding the infiltration basin infiltration rates and water level data are interpreted by both a volume balance approach and different analytical solutions in addition a simple numerical model was used to show how the depth of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite controls recharge dynamics and observed water levels variations results show that the permeability of the saprolite bedrock interface is sufficiently large to allow an efficient recharge that propagates laterally throughout the aquifer through this well connected interface however the variable depth of this permeable pathway controls the water level response acting as a semi impervious boundary leading to remarkable water level variations thus our findings show how the characteristics of the most permeable pathways control recharge dynamics in weathered crystalline rocks in addition we show how the depth variations of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite may be inferred from the

world depend on fractured crystalline aquifers as the only source of freshwater unesco 1999 particularly in arid and semi arid regions like india crystalline rocks cover about 70 of india s geographical area saha et al 2013 furthermore india has seen an unprecedented development of groundwater exploitation within the last 50 to 60 years irrigation potential increased from 6 5 m ha to 45 7 m ha sharma et al 2005 out of which it is estimated crystalline rock aquifer groundwater represents more than 50 especially in south india planning commission 2011 the advent of this green revolution aimed towards increasing agricultural output and achieving food security has also brought on a number of water scarcity and groundwater quality degradation issues pingali 2012 pinstrup andersen and hazell 1985 singh 2000 natural replenishment of groundwater reservoirs has become insufficient to keep pace with the excessive continued exploitation of groundwater resources in many regions leading to a long term drop of groundwater levels central ground water board 2013 in this context the government has set out to remediate water table depletion by increasing aquifer recharge from 9 of total rainfall under natural conditions to 15 by 2020 government of andhra pradesh 2003 through the development of large scale managed aquifer recharge mar schemes the central ground water board has proposed the building of 11 million mar structures nation wide as well as the reparation renovation and restoration of the already existing structures the total costs tallying up to over 12bn usd central ground water board 2013 a wide spectrum of mar techniques may be implemented to recharge the groundwater reservoir and these are selected mainly in terms of the hydrogeological framework for example infiltration methods such as percolation tanks are prioritized in relatively permeable environments such as alluvial formations while recharge shafts are preferred when the aquifer is overlain by poorly permeable strata injection wells are used if the aquifer is confined in india and in the state of telangana underlain mainly by hard rock the most prevalent recharge structures are percolation tanks and infiltration basins central ground water board 2013 it was estimated in the latest census of minor irrigation sources that there are 46 531 percolation tanks all of which the department of irrigation has set out to restore by 2020 irrigation cad department 2015 mar can be used to address a wide range of water management issues including reducing seawater intrusion or land subsidence e g masciopinto 2013 smoothing out supply and demand fluctuations e g palma et al 2015 protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems e g ward and dillon 2012 and improving water quality through filtration and chemical and biological processes e g hamadeh et al 2014 in this particular case however mar is only expected to remediate groundwater exploitation and water quality is not managed jakeman et al 2016 overall common belief is that mar initiatives are a viable and suitable solution to water scarcity issues however there is little consensus within published studies about their efficiency and impact especially in hard rock context at small scales a few square meters to a few square kilometers results often point towards increased groundwater resources and predominantly positive impacts of artificial recharge massuel et al 2014 srivastava et al 2009 which benefit only landholders closest to the recharge facilities boisson et al 2015b dillon et al 2009 larger scale studies at the watershed scale or bigger are less common e g glendenning et al 2012 on one hand because of the difficulty in obtaining relevant data de marsily et al 2005 and on the other on the complexity associated with groundwater reservoirs in crystalline rock further many of these studies are limited to water budget analysis and do not focus on hydrodynamic processes e g scanlon et al 2012 boisson et al 2015b while water budgets can provide useful guidelines for groundwater exploitation many authors have pointed out their insufficiency in providing accurate estimates of safe yield and sustainability highlighting the need to understand dynamic processes bredehoeft 2002 zhou 2009 information on dynamic processes is further necessary to make out the spatial distribution of artificial recharge weathered crystalline rock aquifers are characterized by highly variable hydraulic properties acworth 1987 chilton foster 1995 dewandel et al 2012 maréchal et al 2004 which result in a complex combination of diffuse recharge and preferential flows alazard et al 2016 reddy et al 2009 sukhija et al 2003 where the latter have often been shown to dominate groundwater recharge processes cuthbert tindimugaya 2010 gleeson et al 2009 sukhija et al 2003 in the aquifer horizontal preferential flows take place in the most transmissive zones of the aquifer which consist of the main open fractures and most importantly the bedrock weathering interface at the limit between the upper weathered layer saprolite and the fractured granite this has been recognized by many authors e g acworth 1987 chilton foster 1995 dewandel et al 2006 boisson et al 2015a the presence of these zones leads to a vertical anisotropy of permeability maréchal et al 2004 2003 since the bedrock weathering interface is in general hilly its relief may control groundwater flows leading to aquifer compartmentalization where exchanges between compartments depend on water levels relative to interface topography guihéneuf et al 2014 the exact nature of the relationship between the bedrock weathering interface relief and recharge is not yet clearly understood while this study focuses on fractured crystalline rock it should be noted that the existence of sub horizontal preferential flow pathways originating from sharp vertical contrasts in transmissivity exists in other type of media as well such as stratified aquifers nimmo et al 2017 and that the observations outlined in this paper may be applicable in these environments as well artificial recharge may be affected by preferential flow paths in contrasting ways their existence could enhance recharge allowing an efficient and rapid lateral transfer of percolation throughout the aquifer on the other hand the compartmentalization associated with these environments highlighted by previous studies could possibly slow or stop the progression of infiltration fronts leading to focused recharge in specific areas monitoring of mar infiltration front progression is therefore necessary to better understand the role of preferential flow paths on the efficiency of recharge processes in crystalline rock aquifers not only from a quantitative standpoint but also in regards to water quality and pollution propagation issues the aim of this study is to characterize artificial recharge processes in weathered crystalline rock and analyze the complex flow dynamics of recharge inputs through the main flow paths namely the relief of the saprolite bedrock interface to do so we monitored an artificial recharge basin that has been set up in an experimental site equipped with a network of observation borewells a water balance and simple infiltration equations were used to quantify the inputs of the recharge basin and their temporal evolution as well as the vertical hydraulic properties then the lateral progression of the infiltration front in the underlying hard rock reservoir was analyzed analytical solutions were used to infer the lateral hydrodynamic properties of the media while numerical modeling allowed us to quantify the effects of basement relief on recharge in order to explain the particularities of the observed recharge process 2 study site the infiltration basin is situated within the experimental hydrogeological park ehp which is a hydrological observatory located near the choutuppal village in the nalgonda district telangana state since 2014 60 km to the south east of hyderabad latitude 17 17 47 n longitude 78 55 12 e in south india fig 1 the site has been developed by the french geological survey brgm in partnership with the indian national geophysical research institute ngri and is part of the h observatory network most data used in this study can be downloaded from the h database http hplus ore fr en 2 1 geological setting the site is located in an archean granite setting which represents over 80 of the total surface of the telangana state this granitic formation is intruded locally by geological discontinuities such as dikes or quartz reefs but none are present on the ehp guihéneuf et al 2014 the fracturing of the granite is mainly characterized by sub horizontal fractures which can display a lateral extension of tens of meters guihéneuf et al 2014 the typical geological profile in the ehp was obtained through analysis of drilling cuttings and generally follows the description provided in dewandel et al 2006 namely a thin red soil layer a few centimeters a sandy regolith layer 0 2 m thick made up of a sandy clay composition with quartz grains dewandel et al 2006 a laminated saprolite layer of variable thickness ranging from 0 to 20 m derived from in situ weathering of granite it presents a millimeter spaced horizontal laminated structure and coarse sand size clasts and a few preserved conductive fractures dewandel et al 2006 due to its composition the saprolite layer can reach a quite high porosity bulk porosities are mainly between 5 and 30 depending on the lithology of the parent rock and the degree of weathering dewandel et al 2006 granite mainly consisting of quartz potassium feldspars and biotite dewandel et al 2006 the few first meters of the granite in contact with the laminated saprolite i e the saprolite granite interface are highly weathered and fractured the fracture density rapidly decreases with depth although local transmissive fractures may be encountered up to 60 m deep guihéneuf et al 2014 the effective porosity of this layer is relatively low of about 1 and in mainly ensured by the fissure zones dewandel et al 2006 2 2 hydrological setting the climate of this region is semi arid and controlled by the periodicity of monsoons mean annual temperature is 28 c with high temperatures of about 45 c during the dry season the rainy season occurs from june to november for a yearly average of about 800 mm ephemeral streams may be present during the monsoon but are most of the time absent intra seasonal water level variations depend on groundwater recharge but are generally comprised between 10 and 20 m below ground surface m bgs fig 2 there is no apparent straightforward relation between rainfall episodes and water level variations and some intense rainfall episodes do not elicit a groundwater response like in 2012 765 mm of rain fig 2 within the framework of the previously cited state wise mar project an infiltration basin was dug on the ehp during 2015 to meet the demands of farmers in the area facing water scarcity land use in the vicinity of the observatory consists mostly of cotton fields some rice paddies and a few orchards although it is assumed pumping for irrigation does not impact water levels on the site as most pumped borewells are downstream from the site the basin was dug using an excavator its approximate dimensions are 120 m by 40 m with a depth of about 2 m effectively removing the regolith layer and extending into the saprolite debris was piled around the basin to create a bund and avoid spillovers the basin is mainly supplied by a canal which deviates water from the musi river downstream the state capital hyderabad fig 1 the distance traveled by the canal between the musi river and our study site is of about 40 km over this distance the canal branches out into several smaller canals which supply a network of infiltration basins throughout the region the water thus used to recharge aquifers is river water directly rerouted into the subsurface without any treatment whatsoever unfortunately despite several attempts by various governments the river musi is the eighth most polluted river in india receiving nearly 645 million liters per day of sewage water nilesh 2016 as well as industrial effluents let out by pharmaceutical and bulk drug companies cheepi 2012 nitin 2018 the basin was initially filled by the end of 2015 black arrow fig 2 but this period was not yet monitored the continuous monitoring of the basin began during the following filling episode which took place in july 2016 groundwater levels significantly increased following the filling of the basin reaching the highest levels ever monitored on site fig 2 note that in many countries regulations state the need for an infiltration basin and the underlying aquifer to remain hydraulically disconnected bouwer 2002 carleton 2010 réfloch 2018 this allows preservation of an unsaturated zone below the basin which is necessary to allow aerobic processes to take place to partly prevent the propagation of contaminants this criterion was not met during this study because the water supply relied on the sporadic opening of an upstream floodgate managed by a third party entity previous works e g guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015a during which a series of hydraulic tests were performed on site have allowed the estimation of the media s hydrodynamic properties fig 3 namely the transmissivity t m2 s 1 and storativity s the upper fractured granite and the fractures within the granite were shown to be the most conductive with a good storativity fig 3 boisson et al 2015a on the other hand the saprolite layer was characterized as poorly transmissive it must be noted however that several authors have suggested the potential of preserved fractures within the weathered saprolite to contribute to preferential flow dewandel et al 2006 perrin et al 2011 and that overall knowledge on saprolite properties is currently limited in sum the most transmissive zones of the aquifer are the upper fractured zone also known as the weathering interface laterally well connected and some permeable fractures encountered at greater depths which conversely have a limited extension and continuity because the weathering interface has a variable depth dewandel et al 2006 st clair et al 2015 groundwater flow dynamics shift depending on water table elevation guihéneuf et al 2014 in the 2014 paper by guihéneuf et al hydraulic tests performed under different water level conditions high water levels and low water levels in combination with observations on piezometric variations revealed how aquifer compartmentalization causes this contrasting behavior under high level conditions the well connected permeable upper granite saprolite zone allows regional flows to take place more specifically towards the northeast of the site guihéneuf et al 2014 contrariwise because fracture density and therefore connectivity decreases with depth low water levels lead to a lateral compartmentalization of the aquifer the system then shifts to an independent local flow system guihéneuf et al 2014 the site is equipped with 30 borewells of different depths fig 1 all of which are equipped with a casing extending into the saprolite screened or open at the contact zone between the saprolite and the fractured granite table 1 features the technical characteristics of the site boreholes which were used for this study and the hydraulic properties at each of these wells may be found in guihéneuf et al 2014 note that the saprolite thickness which ranges from 14 m to 24 m is very variable table 1 8 boreholes were continuously equipped with pressure and temperature sensors measuring piezometric levels and temperature during the time of this study an additional probe was installed in the infiltration basin to monitor water levels in the basin at the time scales considered the fracture system within the fractured granite and the overlying saprolite are assumed to be at equilibrium meaning there is no significant pressure difference between the unconsolidated saprolite and the fractures in the underlying granite this was later confirmed when superficial wells 15 m were dug only in the saprolite near the ch01 and ch02 boreholes fig 1f which featured virtually the same hydraulic head variations as the deeper wells this is consistent with the unconfined response high storativity fig 3 of the interface to pumping tests under packers which confirms the role of vertical fractures in connecting overlying saprolite with underlying fractures 2 3 water level variations in response to recharge the filling of the artificial recharge basin caused water levels to rise significantly fig 4 the basin remained flooded for most of the observation period although levels in the basin varied widely from a few cm up to almost 3 m depending on the sporadic canal inputs each filling episode was followed by a recession period ranging from a few days to a few months becoming longer towards the end of the observation period borewells can be divided into two groups relative to their groundwater level variations the first composed of ch01 and ch02 is the cluster closest to the basin the second comprises the boreholes in the cluster farthest from the basin ch03 to ch24 out of which only 3 are shown along the ab profile fig 4 for clarity purposes the two groups are characterized by different patterns of water level variations but have similarities between them there are three identifiable phases for both clusters depending on the time t of observation starting from t 0 which is the beginning of the monitoring period july 5th 2016 p1 0 t 60 days approx the overall range of variations is weak the water levels for neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 remain deep about 15 m below surface close to water levels observed before basin infilling this suggests the water table remains disconnected from the infiltration basin during this period of time p2 60 t 80 days approx an abrupt increase in water levels of about 15 m is observed for neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 while the basin water levels vary between 1 and 2 m during this period hydraulic head reaches near surface levels ch02 is at 366 3 m asl and ch01 at 365 7 m asl such variations suggest that the basin and the aquifer are becoming hydraulically connected the increase in remote water levels ch03 to ch24 is much weaker but shows a clear response this phase ends at around 80 days where an important inflection point can be observed fig 4 marking a change in dynamics p3 t 80 days for this period of time water levels in the closest boreholes ch01 and ch02 are very high close to ground surface levels suggesting that the basin remains connected to the water table remote boreholes appear to increase strongly during the first 40 days where water levels reach a depth of only a few meters below ground interestingly remote borehole levels appear to evolve in sync with very similar hydraulic heads measured in all boreholes these observations suggest that p2 is a transition phase between the disconnected phase p1 and the fully connected phase p3 during which the basin fills the whole aquifer accordingly the hydraulic response for remote boreholes is delayed in relation to neighboring boreholes when levels in the near vicinity reach a pseudo steady state remote water levels begin increasing simultaneously this indicates a sort of tipping point mechanism the attenuation of water level increase in the near vicinity of the basin is related to the progression of the pressure front laterally 3 methods the methodology applied aims to characterize the hydraulic properties controlling infiltration and its lateral transmission throughout the aquifer as well as the effects of bedrock topography on the transient aquifer response this was done through a combination of analytical and numerical modeling using water levels in the basin meteorological data rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and the observed water level response in the observation boreholes daily rainfall was measured on site using an automatic weather station and daily open pan evaporation was measured and made available by icrisat international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics about 80 km away from our site 3 1 estimating infiltration rates and vertical hydraulic conductivity infiltration inf from the basin into the aquifer was quantified to characterize recharge and to be used as inputs to the analytical and numerical aquifer response models posteriorly described to do so a volume balance approach vba was applied in parallel to infiltration equations that will be described hereafter the vba approach requires knowledge of all of the water balance components canal inflow q in rainfall p evaporation e and basin stock variations dh all of which are in mm day 1 1 inf q in p e d h it was assumed that the runoff component considering the small impluvium surface 1ha was negligible because it was not possible to measure canal inflow directly for technical reasons the vba approach was only applied to recession periods where q in is assumed to be null dh was deduced from the water levels measured continuously in the basin h where dh h t h t 1 e was assumed to be equal to open pan potential evaporation measurements the equation was applied at a daily time step the vba approach is the most complete as it accounts for all inputs and outputs to the system although it is not applicable during basin filling periods in the absence of rainfall and neglecting evaporation one also expects infiltration rates to be simply related to water levels in the basin with greater water levels leading to greater infiltration to examine such relationships infiltration rates from basin water level variations during recession periods were compared to the corresponding water levels in the basin thus the relationship inf α h with α as the coefficient of proportionality was evaluated empirically if a satisfactory relationship is obtained during recession periods such relationship may be extrapolated to all times including infilling periods comparison to vba infiltration ensured that neglecting p and e is not too strong of an assumption finally with infiltration roughly deduced from basin water levels the canal inflow q in can be calculated during infilling periods as the remnant of eq 1 note that these relationships can generally be described by darcy type equations directly linking infiltration to water levels based on knowledge of saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity bouwer 2002 it was not possible to estimate hydraulic conductivity during the initial phases p1 and p2 because the depth of the wetting front and the apparent hydraulic conductivity are poorly constrained in partially saturated environments when there is a full hydraulic connection between the basin and the aquifer p3 one may assume that the system may be equated to a falling head permeameter during the recession periods flows are assumed to be mainly vertical within the saprolite before reaching the weathering interface which is assumed to be an a priori much more conductive zone it therefore is assumed that flows are mainly controlled by the saprolite s properties which offer the greater resistance to flow and the head gradient over the saprolite s thickness the hydraulic head at the bottom of the saprolite may be given by the hydraulic head in the closest boreholes which are very close to ground level thus the head gradient may be roughly estimated equal to h l i e the difference in hydraulic head between the top of the saprolite h l and the bottom of the saprolite l with l the thickness of the saprolite the vertical flow can be thus described using the darcy equation 2 inf k v h l where k v is the vertical hydraulic conductivity l t 1 knowing that inf dh dt during recession periods this equation can be rearranged to yield dh h k v l d t where the boundary conditions of this problem are h h 0 at t 0 if we integrate dh h on the left hand side from h 0 to h and the right hand side from 0 to t then ln h 0 h k v l t this yields 3 h h 0 e k v l t to check the consistency of the above equation observed water levels were plotted for each recession posterior to hydraulic connection p3 phase when verified a linear regression allows estimating of k v l and with known l hydraulic conductivity can be deduced finally having estimated k v during recession period allows estimating infiltration also for the infilling periods using eq 2 3 2 modeling the aquifer response to infiltration in a second step we calibrated an analytical solution modeling groundwater level variations against observations to provide an estimate of the hydrodynamic parameters controlling lateral flow the effects of the transmissive interface s relief on flow however were ascertained using simple numerical modeling since no analytical solution was available for this purpose to do so different scenarios were tested where bedrock relief and hydrodynamic properties were varied to assess the changes in groundwater response and the overall likeness to the dynamics observed on the experimental site 3 2 1 analytical solutions calibration of simple analytical solutions against observed groundwater levels can allow a first order estimation of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storativity controlling groundwater flow groundwater mechanisms are described by different mathematical models depending whether there is a hydraulic connection between the basin and the water table or not fig 5 the most common analytical solutions for groundwater mounding are valid only in situations where the water table is assumed to be hydraulically disconnected from the bottom of the groundwater infiltration basin conversely analytical modeling of mounds that are fully connected to any recharge structure is relatively rare and most often concerns streams or canals e g dillon and liggett 1983 spanoudaki et al 2010 modeling of connected recharge basins or lagoons e g kacimov et al 2016 is much rarer further if the mechanisms in place deviate from standard conditions assuming homogeneous media then fully realistic descriptions of these processes are said to be beyond any simple analytical solutions alderwish 2010 in this context it was decided to use analytical modeling only in the initial phase of wetting and mounding p1 when the recharge basin is clearly disconnected from the aquifer and thus flow conditions remain relatively simple and respect the initial conditions required because remote boreholes ch03 to ch24 show little to no response during this phase analytical modeling was only calibrated against observations in neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 which show a clear response to basin infilling even during the initial phase of wetting and mounding p1 we used hantush s solution for rectangular basins hantush 1967 3 2 1 1 hantush s solution for rectangular basins in general analytical solutions to predict the rate of growth and shape of a recharge mound solve the governing partial differential equation describing the flow of groundwater as given by the linearized boussinesq equation warner et al 1989 4 k b 2 h x 2 2 h y 2 r s h t where the different variables and parameters are defined in fig 5 the solution developed by hantush hantush 1967 simulates groundwater mound growth and decay in response to percolation and is valid when the top of the groundwater mound is disconnected from the bottom of the recharge basin 5 z r b 2 s 0 t erf l b 2 x 4 υ τ erf l b 2 x 4 υ τ erf w b 2 y 4 υ τ erf w b 2 y 4 υ τ d τ where z h 2 b 2 υ is a simplifying term with υ k b s and τ t t the time during which percolation takes place initial conditions assume a horizontal water table and the boundary conditions of zero slope of the mound profile at the center of the basin and at infinity in eq 5 recharge from infiltration is assumed to be constant however infiltration was found to vary significantly in time to get around this issue the approach was modified rather than directly integrating eq 5 by gauss quadrature a convolution of the impulse response of the aquifer to r 1 and the daily infiltration time series was made so that at a given time t 6 z t k 1 t z k 1 z u k r t k where zu is the impulse response and r is the recharge rate assumed equal to daily infiltration this solution was applied and calibrated at each borehole for which hydraulic head measurements are available where x y b and b were set to match the borehole s position and initial water table conditions hydraulic conductivity k and storativity s were obtained by optimizing the analytical models performance i e minimizing the root mean square error rmse between h sim simulated water table elevation and h obs observed water table elevation the 2d parameter space was thus explored in order to reach a parameter set for which the error was minimal and which fit realistic standards the resulting 2d rmse matrix was then analyzed to assess whether the model converged towards a unique solution as opposed to a situation where there is equifinality of parameters which implies there are several acceptable sets of parameters that cannot easily be dismissed and should be considered in the evaluation of uncertainty beven 2006 because this solution simulates how recharge inputs move laterally throughout the aquifer and considering the important vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity in fractured crystalline aquifers maréchal et al 2004 2003 k is assimilated to horizontal hydraulic conductivity 3 2 2 numerical modeling for connected basin while analytical solutions are easily and straightforwardly applied they do not account for the geometry of the aquifer and specific boundary conditions under these circumstances we tested the effect of bedrock relief on drawup i e the increase of water level due to basin infiltration using modflow and its bcf2 package which allows wetting of previously dry cells harbaugh 2005 modflow is a us geological survey block centered finite difference modular flow model and the source code is free public domain software the model was run using flopy bakker et al 2016 a python package for creating running and post processing modflow based models the numerical simulations were based on very simple conceptual models first a synthetic scenario with constant recharge was tested in order to analyze the causal relationship between the boundary conditions imposed by the bedrock relief and the groundwater response to recharge synthetic results were roughly compared to field results at this stage however the objective was not to attempt to perfectly match the observed groundwater response to infiltration then in a second step aimed at better reproducing the recharge dynamics actual estimated infiltration rates were used as inputs to the model the conceptual models tested all consist of a rectangular unconfined aquifer overlain by a thick unsaturated zone with an infiltration basin in its central part fig 6 the infiltration basin covers 6400 m2 and recharges the aquifer at a rate r of 1 10 6 m s 1 about 85 mm day 1 for the synthetic tests or at a transient rate determined by previously calculated infiltration for the final applied scenario recharge is applied to the highest active cell which is automatically determined meaning there is no retardation or storage of water in the unsaturated zone this is equivalent to simulating a partially or fully hydraulically connected environment i e p2 and p3 the initial phase p1 was not simulated due to poorly constrained boundary conditions during this unsaturated phase and because the modlfow model does not accurately accommodate transient unsaturated flow hydraulic parameters s and k were varied over one and an half and two orders of magnitude respectively 1 10 3 s 5 10 2 and 1 10 5 k 1 10 3 m s 1 to test the sensitivity of the model to these parameters while remaining in a realistic range and were later fixed respectively at 1 10 2 and 1 10 4 m s 1 to match the first order estimation of parameters from the analytical model for the synthetic tests or more precise values for the applied scenario the ratio of vertical to horizontal conductivity was fixed at 1 10 according to maréchal et al 2004 results we only simulate one quadrant of the aquifer fig 6a because all four quadrants are symmetrical therefore there is no flow between quadrants the hydrological system was simulated using a grid of 100 rows and columns with a 20 m spacing for a total model size of 2000 2000 m size at which it was estimated the outer boundary conditions did not affect the results for the simulated duration and six 5 m thick layers necessary to model stability fig 6b to ensure that the grid size and disposition were stable tests were performed where the size of the model and of the grid cells were varied to ensure water levels near the boundary remained stable initially layers 1 5 are dry head is 5 m and only the deepest layer is saturated the evolution of the groundwater mound over time was modeled using a transient simulation which was run for one stress period of 300 days with a one day time step using the pcg2 solver two scenarios were tested using two model configurations a reference scenario in which there is no compartmentalization and a compartmentalized scenario where an impervious boundary was added fig 6c the reference scenario was used to simulate water table mounding resulting from local recharge in homogeneous conditions with a sub horizontal bedrock the other scenario accounted for the more complex boundary conditions imposed by the basement relief by featuring a cuboid depression at the center the depression was aimed at representing a topographic depression at the granite saprolite interface as it was determined from previous electrical resistivity tomography ert soundings that the recharge basin is located above a bedrock depression this was done by adding an impermeable k and s 1 10 20 layer covering the bottom of the aquifer except at the center where the compartment is located fig 6 we tested different compartment widths ranging from 100 m to 1000 m with a 100 m interval and heights from 5 m to 25 m with a 5 m interval to test their causal relationship to groundwater drawup dynamics finally a simulation was run using the site s actual infiltration estimations from 3 1 as inputs to account for the observed variability of inputs over time and fit the model to observations hydraulic parameters were set equal to those obtained with the analytical solution only the compartment size was adjusted to fit the simulation to the observed data this allowed us to test the model s ability to simulate the observed groundwater variations by assuming a heterogeneous basement elevation 4 results 4 1 infiltration estimation and relative contributions estimating infiltration from the vba eq 1 or from water levels in the basin eq 2 was almost equivalent rainfall and evaporation do not have a strong effect on stock variations relative to canal inflow and infiltration in total it was estimated canal inflow accounted for 97 of inputs to the basin and infiltration for 95 of outputs table 2 they are the main drivers of stock variations note that infiltration from recession periods was obtained using a volume balance approach and then linked to water levels in the basin to obtain relationships that could be extrapolated to filling periods these relationships were indeed found to be linear and are shown in full below as explained in the previous section canal inputs were estimated as the remnants of eq 1 with known infiltration inputs from the canal are quite high fig 7 and concentrated into short periods of time infiltration takes place more homogeneously throughout the observation period but there are still non negligible variations that mimic but do not follow perfectly water level variations fig 7 interestingly when the recharge mound reaches the base of the aquifer between 55 and 65 days approximately infiltration reaches its maximum value around 350 mm day 1 for a water level in the basin close to 2 6 m regardless of the large amounts of water brought on afterward and similar basin water levels recharge remains bounded reaching at most about 150 mm day 1 suggesting a decrease in the recharge potential another way to show this evolution is to investigate the evolution of the relationship between daily infiltration and water levels in the basin fig 8 a for each recession period infiltration is roughly proportional to water levels in the basin as expected from eq 2 but with different relations for the different period of recessions the coefficient of proportionality α decreases strongly with time fig 8b during phase p2 for times greater than 80 days p3 no significant changes are observed however the efficiency of the infiltration seems to be reduced by a factor of 6 from the early times until 80 days this behavior is expected when connecting the basin with the aquifer bouwer 2002 carleton 2010 because of the decrease in hydraulic gradient which results from the pore space filling up at the point of hydraulic connection this further supports the statement that p2 is a transition phase during which the basin becomes hydraulically connected to the aquifer 4 2 vertical hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic conductivity posterior to hydraulic connection was obtained using eq 3 from the recession slopes shown in fig 9 it was found to vary slightly between each recession slope ranging from 7 4 10 6 m s 1 to 9 4 10 6 m s 1 averaging 8 1 10 6 m s 1 such values are slightly higher than what is typically expected in the saprolite in this area but much lower than the most transmissive pathways at the interface between saprolite and the upper fractured granite fig 3 guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015a 4 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity and storativity calibration of observed groundwater levels to simulated water levels for the disconnected phase p1 using the hantush solution resulted in the parameters summed up in table 3 the best model fits can be seen in fig 10 rmse was normalized by the range of variation n r m s e rmse h max h m i n model error was satisfactory nrmse s being weaker than 5 averaged to all boreholes hydraulic conductivity was found to be 6 5 10 5 m s 1 with little variability between both estimates this estimate is clearly higher than the estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of the saprolite obtained from water level recessions averaging 8 10 6 m s 1 but very close to what boisson et al 2015a and guihéneuf et al 2014 obtained for the weathering interface fig 3 1 3 t 10 4 m2 s 1 and thus k 10 5 m s 1 the interface being a few meters thick storativity was found to be around 5 10 2 which is higher than the fig 3 weathering interface estimate s 9 7 10 3 denoting a possible influence of the saprolite on the apparent estimated storativity according to the variations of storativity between ch01 and ch02 it nevertheless seems to weaken as we move away from the basin 4 4 effect of bedrock relief numerical model 4 4 1 synthetic scenarios synthetic results obtained from numerical simulations are shown in fig 11 the reference model with parameters in the range of those obtained from analytical simulations k 10 4 m s 1 and s 10 2 showed very weak variations and a weak drawup slope black curve on fig 11a and b which cannot explain observed water level variations from the study site recharge dynamics cannot be modeled satisfactorily using these reasonable hydraulic parameters sensitivity tests not shown in fig 11 were also performed on k and s s variations of one order of magnitude led to a difference lower than 2 m decreasing k elicited a stronger groundwater response but with a weak drawup slope again disagreeing with observed data the most realistic simulation is obtained when considering a heterogeneous basement and thus semi penetrating impermeable boundary conditions the lateral extension of the depression compartment at the center of the model controls the slope of the drawup smaller lateral extensions of the compartment lead to stronger slopes fig 11a and as the lateral compartment size is progressively increased drawup dynamics approach that of the reference scenario i e no boundary effect the vertical extension of the depression does not have an impact of the slope of the drawup it does however control the amplitude of variations fig 11b where a greater difference in altitudes leads to a greater drawup amplitude 4 4 2 application to the present field case the application of the compartmentalized scenario to estimated infiltration inputs proved quite successful in recreating the dynamics of the closest boreholes for phase 2 and 3 fig 12 using the hydraulic parameters obtained from analytical modeling table 3 and varying only the shape of the basement we obtained a relatively good agreement between the simulated water levels and the observed ones nrmse 8 7 and 12 1 for ch01 and ch02 respectively the strong slope of the drawup is successfully reproduced and the following stabilization of water levels as well a lateral extension of about 120 m seems to best recreate the recharge dynamics of the study site with the above cited parameters although storativity was shown to be somewhat overestimated under the influence of the saprolite values owing to the borehole s proximity to the basin decreasing storativity to a value closer to that of the weathering interface s 9 7 10 3 requires increasing the theoretical lateral extension of the compartment to about 200 m to correctly model observations the calibrated vertical extension was found relatively constant around 18 m there is a slight discrepancy between the model and the simulation where the simulation under estimates water levels during the drawup phase and over estimates them during p3 this is probably because the actual system modeled is in reality much more complex than the model proposed here as we do not account for flow in fractures storage effects or matrix effects the underlying geometry of the interface may also be much more complex than the way it is simulated in the model we believe this is a testament to the interest this model brings wherein a very simple numerical model recreated complex dynamics note also that it was not possible to simulate remote boreholes using the model as is placing the observation point outside of the compartment did recreate the delay in borehole response observed in fig 4 but did not allow to simulate the amplitude of the variations correctly addressing this issue would imply complexifying the model to account for a much more complex geometry of the weathering interface which is currently beyond the scope of this paper a schematic summary of recharge dynamics is presented in fig 13 in a very simplified way the hydraulically disconnected phase of groundwater mounding p1 resembles that of a relatively homogeneous environment when hydraulic connection begins between the infiltration basin and the aquifer we observe boundary conditions leading to a rapid increase of water levels because infiltration is focused into a bounded domain the hydraulic connection also slows the infiltration process the final stage p3 is much less subject to boundary effects and a pseudo steady state is reached where levels oscillate around a constant value 5 discussion 5 1 representativity of hydraulic parameters overall infiltration efficiency i e the ratio of infiltration to total inputs is quite high 96 in the present case as opposed to previous studies in similar environments boisson et al 2015b 56 perrin et al 2009 54 singh et al 2004 67 but in agreement with efficiencies recorded by the central groundwater board in 2011 of up to 98 in hard rock environments a possible explanation of this difference is the age of the infiltration basins studies showing low infiltration efficiencies focused on percolation tanks that had not been recently desilted contrary to the basin studied here dug in 2015 and those present in the cgwb s case studies further the way in which the basin is supplied where large amounts of water are brought in short periods of time leads to an important water depth in the basin up to almost 3 m this could contribute to stronger infiltration rates linked to a higher hydraulic head this is as opposed to typical percolation tanks which accumulate a few centimeters of runoff over larger extended areas and thus subject to a higher amount of direct evaporation compared to infiltration although overall infiltration efficiency is high infiltration rates decrease significantly with hydraulic connection because of a decrease in hydraulic gradient infiltration is then more spread out in time which allows more evaporation to take place although the amount evaporated remains much weaker than the overall infiltrated volume this is not likely to continue to be the case if significant silting occurs this study s estimate of vertical permeability k v 8 1 10 6 m s 1 is slightly higher than what boisson et al 2015a obtained at the same site for the upper saprolite layer 9 10 8 to 3 10 7 m s 1 but overall in the same range as other studies performed on saprolite e g george 1992 7 10 6 m s 1 cook et al 1996 1 10 6 to 1 10 5 m s 1 boisson et al 2015a used falling head borehole permeameter tests which render point values whereas the large horizontal extent of the infiltration basin could allow sampling of otherwise undetectable vertical preferential flow paths i e preserved fractures in the saprolite and thus lead to an increase in hydraulic conductivity dewandel et al 2006 horizontal hydraulic properties were found to be in the upper range of values for fractured crystalline rock k 6 5 10 5 m s 1 and s 5 0 10 2 rather corresponding to the properties of the weathering interface obtained in boisson et al 2015a the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the system is thus much higher than the vertical hydraulic conductivity about 8 times higher this is consistent with the fact that the vertical hydraulic conductivity is controlled by the less transmissive saprolite and the lateral hydraulic conductivity by the highly transmissive weathering interface acting as a preferential flow path overall analytical modeling highlighted the strong influence of preferential flow in recharge processes 5 2 comparison to inferred interface relief previous acquisition of electrical resistivity tomography ert profiles chandra et al 2009 permitted the mapping of the depth of the weathering interface at the ehp site fig 14 the ert survey was carried out using a syscal jr switch with 10 m electrode spacing across 9 profiles using a wenner schlumberger configuration chandra et al 2009 profiles were analyzed using a routine inversion method and a threshold of about 400 ohm m braun et al 2009 was set to delineate the limit between fresh and weathered rock chandra et al 2009 point data was then interpolated using standard kriging techniques the obtained interface is significantly hilly composed of depressions and crests the protruding areas where crests delineate a set of sub drainage basins fig 14a the hilliness of the interface relief suggests the system is compartmentalized which supports the observations made in previous works highlighting the existence of compartmentalization in crystalline environments and its effects on groundwater flow and chemistry e g guihéneuf et al 2014 perrin et al 2011 two main compartments were identified one east of the site and the other north of the site extending beyond the site limits the lowest point of the bedrock topography appears to be north of the profile the compartment over which the infiltration basin is situated is trefoil like shaped with a diameter of about 500 m a low point at about 42 m depth and summits at about 20 m depth so a height difference of approximately 20 m this is similar to the dimensions obtained while fitting the numerical simulation to observed water levels i e a radius of 200 m and a height difference of 18 m using the ab profile outlined in fig 4 we traced the relief of the bedrock interface obtained from ert and replaced observed water levels so as to compare observed data to simulations fig 15 the depth of the interface was very similar to the depth estimated from borehole logs neighboring boreholes ch01 and ch02 are situated in a topographic depression whereas remote boreholes are in a crest area where the two compartments identified in fig 14a are separated ch03 being at the highest point the same phases outlined in fig 13 can be transposed to observed data prior to the supposed date of hydraulic connection in fig 15 t 0 and t 40 water level variations are weak and the water table is deep which corresponds to p1 then water levels increase rapidly under the effect of the lateral boundary condition in fig 15 t 60 and t 70 corresponding to p2 this continues until water levels exceed the topographic threshold downstream from the basin at about 70 days after the beginning of the observation period from that point onwards compartments become connected and water levels vary weakly but on a large extent which corresponds to p3 this conceptual model supports observations made by guihéneuf et al in 2014 the hydrogeological system is compartmentalized and the aquifer connectivity and associated flow regime is a function of water levels relative to the well connected bedrock interface 5 3 artificial recharge modeling the model most commonly used to explain recharge dynamics was proposed by bouwer 2002 in this model two scenarios explain an infiltration basin s dynamics if the bottom of the basin the clogging layer is less conductive than the underlying aquifer then infiltration is controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the clogging layer the water within the basin is disconnected from the underlying aquifer perched over the silting layer otherwise infiltration is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the underlying aquifer in this case the water table may rise until hydraulic connection takes place and then the infiltration rate is controlled either solely by gravity and vertical flows in deep aquifers or by the slope of the water table mound in shallow aquifers this concept was developed assuming homogeneous sedimentary aquifers of infinite lateral extension instances of variable recharge dynamics have been documented in literature either stemming from progressive and heterogeneous silting e g racz et al 2012 mawer et al 2016 saturation of the vadose zone dillon liggett 1983 or more rarely structural discontinuities massuel et al 2014 in most cases the influence of heterogeneity on flow is limited to qualitative observations very few studies actually model processes with consideration of aquifer geometry e g ronayne et al 2008 probably because it is not easy to image the aquifer s geometry and practically impossible to obtain three dimensional information about hydraulic properties especially in hard rock context de marsily et al 2005 in this study we successfully quantified the role played by the basement relief and its associated compartmentalization on the hydraulic response of the aquifer to recharge also highlighting the effects of it on recharge propagation and infiltration potentials this study showed that the relief of the bedrock can produce an effect somehow analogous to the effect of impervious or semi impervious boundaries on drawdown during pumping tests de marsily 1986 in both cases a change in drawdown slope relative to a situation where no impervious boundary is present is expected to the best of our knowledge there are no other instances in literature where this effect was identified during recharge or as a result of a heterogeneous bedrock relief further because the relief crests are only a semi penetrating impervious boundary the increase in drawup slope relative to the reference scenario was shown to provide information on the dimensions of the relief in question where the larger the depression below the recharge basin the lesser the increase in drawup slope the in depth analysis of the transient aquifer response to recharge in a heterogeneous environment can be used to improve mar management in crystalline rock the requirements to perform this type of analysis are i an approximation of the aquifer s hydraulic properties ii a map of the contact zone between the saprolite and the granite and iii knowledge on the actual or desired water volumes to be stored in the aquifer the most challenging aspect of this methodology is obtaining a map of the subsurface although geophysical methods are becoming increasingly accurate and accessible one can for example cite the development of airborne electromagnetic methods which allow large scale high resolution mapping of the subsurface sørensen auken 2004 however if bedrock relief data is unobtainable we also showed how monitoring groundwater levels in the vicinity of the basin can provide valuable information on bedrock topography and on the storage potentials of the aquifer as such not only should the infiltration basin be monitored but also if possible groundwater levels around the basin extrapolation of our simple method could improve present day forward models used for mar management in such geological environments and possibly be extended into predictive modeling from a quantitative standpoint consideration of the effects of boundary conditions would be useful to regulate inputs in order to limit evaporation losses if the bedrock topography is known decision makers can gain a greater awareness of the extent to which recharge will propagate throughout the aquifer and choose whether to prioritize a strong localized reaction which may be easier to retrieve at later times or a weaker reaction over larger areas depending on the density and extent of the settlements affected by groundwater depletion and which stand to benefit from the augmentation of groundwater resources further implications on water quality are also non negligible we highlighted the importance of preferential flow which implies contaminant attenuation is not likely to take place rapidly enough to mitigate the negative effects of injecting wastewater into the aquifer the dominance of advective processes over diffusive processes in hard rock guihéneuf et al 2017 will likely aggravate this issue it is essential this be taken into consideration by decision makers the water currently used to feed the network of mar structures state wise originates directly from the musi river downstream of hyderabad and is highly polluted both by domestic and industrial effluents another element of risk that was identified in this study is that of hydraulic connection between the infiltration basin and the water table to which fractured crystalline environments are particularly susceptible due to their low transmissivities and variable saprolite thickness the best way to infer hydraulic connection is through groundwater level observation but it is still possible to infer that hydraulic connection has taken place when infiltration rates decrease significantly which may lead the basin to overflow or water levels in the basin to stagnate additionally to the loss of infiltration potentials which may dampen the efficiency of this water stress remediation method and lead to important losses by et hydraulic connection may amplify the risk of groundwater contamination if no unsaturated zone exists below the infiltration basin aerobic processes and sorption of contaminants which play an important part in retaining and degrading contaminants and that depend on residence times may be impeded 6 conclusions our study of artificial recharge processes in a fractured crystalline environment highlighted the role the heterogeneity of the horizontal weathering interface depth plays on recharge during the initial stages of wetting when the recharge mound is disconnected from the bottom of the basin infiltration is governed by the vertical properties of the relatively homogeneous and poorly conductive saprolite the lateral transmission of infiltration inputs reaching the aquifer is ensured mainly by the weathering interface thus foregrounding the importance of preferential flows once hydraulic connection between the infiltration basin and the aquifer takes place which is relatively rapidly due to the shallowness of the aquifer two simultaneous phenomena are observed infiltration potential decreases and water levels increase strongly and rapidly it was shown from numerical simulations that this can be interpreted as resulting from the control by the weathering interface relief where summits act as semi impervious boundaries which delimit a set of hydrogeological compartments the advancement of the infiltration front is thus impeded until the crest separating the east and north hydrogeological compartments is exceeded and the compartment is filled which focuses infiltration inputs into smaller volumes explaining the strong and sudden local water level increase once the summits are overpassed the different hydrogeological compartments are connected and the no flow boundary effect becomes less critical it has yet to be confirmed if the simple analytical and numerical approach used here can be applied more generally in crystalline rock environments but we believe this is a first step in better understanding the propagation of infiltration fronts in heterogeneous aquifers this in turn could provide useful information

6547,streamflow forecasting has great significance in water resource management particularly for reservoir operation however accurately predicting streamflow is challenging due to the non stationary characteristics of hydrologic processes and the effects of noise to improve monthly streamflow forecasting this study proposes a data driven model based on a double processing strategy which combines singular spectrum analysis ssa improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise iceemdan and extreme learning machine elm approaches in the proposed double processing model called ssa iceemdan elm the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa for denoising then the processed series are reprocessed via iceemdan to decompose them into relatively stationary sub series finally these sub series are modelled using elm the performance of the proposed model is tested for one month ahead prediction using streamflow data from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the gulang river basin in addition the proposed double processing model is compared with four single processing models namely empirical mode decomposition emd elm ensemble emd eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm and two single models without any processing namely autoregressive integrated moving average arima and elm the results show that a the four single processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models and the performance of the ssa elm model is the best of these single processing models implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored b the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is superior to the single processing models and single models demonstrating that the double processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy thus the proposed model which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series keywords streamflow prediction data driven model extreme learning machine singular spectrum analysis empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting has great significance in the management and optimal allocation of water resources especially for reservoir operation optimization singh 2016 zhang et al 2016 however it is a challenging task because streamflow processes exhibit complex nonlinearity and stochastic characteristics yaseen et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 therefore improving the accuracy of streamflow forecasting is an important topic for hydrologists and research on streamflow forecasting methods has received considerable attention the existing methods of streamflow prediction can be roughly grouped into two categories process driven methods and data driven methods abdollahi et al 2017 chu et al 2017 process driven methods have a potential advantage in building a physical understanding of hydrological processes badrzadeh et al 2018 humphrey et al 2016 however these methods typically require a large amount of hydrological data and sufficient data are rarely available for physical modelling which limits practical applications noori and kalin 2016 peng et al 2017 furthermore the influences and complex interactions of many random factors result in uncertainties and poor model performance liu et al 2016 sun et al 2014 relative to process driven methods data driven methods require minimal data can be quickly modelled and are simple to implement karran et al 2014 liu et al 2014 additionally data driven methods exhibit better prediction performance than process driven methods kalteh 2016 wang et al 2013 therefore data driven methods have become more popular in streamflow forecasting applications data driven methods generally include statistical based methods such as autoregressive moving average arma and multiple linear regression mlr and artificial intelligence ai based methods such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and classification and regression tree cart hadi and tombul 2018 yang et al 2016 among the ai based methods extreme learning machine elm approach is a new learning method zong et al 2013 relative to traditional neural network methods elm does not require iteration for weight adjustment and offers many advantages such as outstanding performance with a rapid learning speed wang et al 2015a in recent years elm has been widely applied in different scientific fields mehmet et al 2014 applied elm to estimate solar radiation and showed its reliability deo and şahin 2015 used elm to forecast the effective drought index in eastern australia and the results indicated that compared to an ann model the elm achieved much better forecasting accuracy was 32 times faster in terms of learning speed and 6 1 times faster in terms of training speed shiri et al 2016 applied elm to predict the daily water level in urmia lake and confirmed the excellent performance of elm therefore elm is an advanced approach for forecasting and estimation nevertheless there have been few applications of elm in streamflow forecasting in this study elm is used for monthly streamflow forecasting although it is important to select excellent ai based methods such as elm as prediction models for streamflow forecasting they are single models which are not sufficient to satisfy increasing accuracy requirements therefore hybrid models have been developed to improve prediction accuracy and the hybrid models usually adopt two methods of combination the first method optimizes an ai based prediction model by combining optimization algorithms for example yaseen et al 2017 proposed a hybrid model that combined an optimization algorithm firefly algorithm with an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model for improving streamflow prediction the second method decreases the influence of non stationary features and improves the performance of an ai based prediction model by combining signal processing algorithms which is a new trend in improving streamflow prediction moosavi et al 2017 zhao and chen 2015 the signal processing methods include wavelet decomposition wd empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and singular spectrum analysis ssa ravansalar et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 compared mlr ann wd mlr and wd ann models for streamflow forecasting and the comparisons demonstrated that the inclusion of wd as a processing technique in hybrid models can enhance prediction accuracy zhao et al 2017 developed an emd least squares support vector machine lssvm model and wang et al 2015b proposed an eemd autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the two hybrid models were used for annual runoff forecasting and both were found to significantly improve prediction performance zhang et al 2011 developed a ssa arima model for forecasting annual runoff wang et al 2014 coupled ssa with svm or genetic programming gp models for monthly inflow prediction and the results verified that the hydrological series contained noise and the hybrid models exhibited better prediction precision than the svm and gp models based on the literature mentioned above it has been found that the appropriate processing approaches are effective for improving prediction accuracy however these streamflow forecasting studies are based on single processing models in which the streamflow series are processed only one time and hydrological dynamic information is not fully excavated therefore there is still much room to further improve the accuracy of streamflow forecasting huang et al 2014 proposed a modified emd svm model for monthly streamflow forecasting although this model is still a single processing model it is an improvement on the conventional single processing model by removing the highest intrinsic mode function imf1 to enhance prediction accuracy in another research field fijani et al 2019 developed a two layer decomposition model to estimate water quality parameters in this model the original water quality parameter series were first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions imfs by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan then the highest frequency imf1 was further decomposed into several imfs by variational mode decomposition vmd this model was proven to be robust in identifying water quality parameters however the two decomposition processes produced many imfs and each imf need to be modelled and estimated which as this reference mentioned costs too much in terms of computation cost therefore this study aims to develop a hybrid data driven model based on a double processing strategy to better capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series and further improve the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction in contrast with the model described in ref fijani et al 2019 the proposed double processing model combines ssa with improved ceemdan iceemdan and elm approaches the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model does not produce as many imfs that require modelling as it directly uses ssa to filter noises from the original streamflow series and then uses iceemdan to decompose the processed series into several imfs thus the proposed model has a lower computation cost and a less complicated computation process than the model in ref fijani et al 2019 the main contributions of this study include the following 1 in contrast to most existing studies on streamflow prediction in which single processing models are adopted for streamflow forecasting this study proposes a double processing model for streamflow forecasting the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa to recognize and reduce the noise they contain then these processed series are reprocessed via iceemdan to reduce the influence of non stationary features and to gain a deep understanding of data features the double processed series are easier to model by elm and have higher data quality than the original streamflow series 2 considering that emd can easily lead to the mode mixing problem and that eemd contains a certain amount of noise state of the art iceemdan is used in this study to overcome these problems and extract useful information with less noise 3 this study adopts the elm approach which has been seldom applied to streamflow forecasting the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the study area and data section 3 introduces the proposed model and evaluation criteria section 4 describes the method and model application section 5 presents the results and discussion and section 6 outlines the conclusions of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the gulang river basin which has an area of 882 km2 is located in the eastern portion of the hexi corridor and on the northern slope of the tibetan plateau the gulang river which originates from qilian mountain and enters the main stream of the shiyang river through the hongshui river has seven tributaries including the huangyangchuan river and the longgou river the gulang river basin is a typical arid and semi arid area and the climate is characterized by infrequent rain strong evaporation great temperature differences between day and night adequate sunshine and dry air the mean annual precipitation is 361 3 mm and the mean annual evaporation is 1783 8 mm precipitation snowmelt and all kinds of phreatic water account for 28 9 28 6 and 42 5 respectively in the recharge of the gulang river hu 2009 the basin terrain is high in the south and low in the north with an elevation decreasing from 3469 m to 1550 m and the landform type is complex and variable in this region wang et al 2016 among the land types in this basin crops account for 35 69 forests for 33 82 grasslands for 27 72 houses for 1 06 and bare land for 1 61 ma et al 2008 therefore the proportion of water demand for agricultural irrigation in this region is very large and streamflow is a crucial index whose analysis and trend prediction are of great significance to the allocation of water resources in this region 2 2 data used in the study the monthly streamflow data were sourced from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the upper reaches of the gulang river basin the locations of these two reservoirs are shown in fig 1 the two reservoirs are mainly used for farmland irrigation the caojiahu reservoir is located on the huangyangchuan river which is a tributary of gulang river the catchment area of this reservoir is 403 km2 and the guaranteed irrigation area is 28 km2 the shibalipu reservoir is located on the longgou river which is a tributary of gulang river the catchment area of this reservoir is 430 km2 and the guaranteed irrigation area is 47 km2 table 1 lists some basic statistics of the streamflow data of the two reservoirs monthly streamflow data for an observation period from january 1959 to december 2016 are available for each reservoir for the two reservoirs the training dataset covers the period from 1959 to 2004 and the remaining 12 years of data are used for validation monthly streamflow typically has an obvious period of 1 year 12 months and the monthly streamflow of the two reservoirs shown in fig 2 is no exception 3 the proposed model and evaluation criteria 3 1 the proposed model the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model contains three calculation steps as depicted in fig 3 and described as follows step 1 double processing this step is the core of the entire algorithm and contains two sub steps first the original streamflow series are processed via ssa to obtain the processed streamflow series this sub step can recognize and filter the noise in the original streamflow series then the processed streamflow series are reprocessed via iceemdan which decomposes the processed series into a sequence of sub series this sub step transforms the non stationary series into a series of relatively stationary sub series and improves the prediction capacity step 2 elm modelling the sub series are modelled using elm to obtain the sub series prediction and arithmetic averaging is used to improve the stability of the elm step 3 summarization all of the sub series predictions are summarized to produce the final streamflow forecast 3 2 evaluation criteria to evaluate the accuracies of the involved forecasting models in this study five error criteria are applied as shown in table 2 generally low mae rmse and mape values and high r and nsec values reflect strong modelling performance 4 methods and model application 4 1 singular spectrum analysis 4 1 1 the theory of singular spectrum analysis ssa is a powerful nonparametric method for time series analysis that can efficiently identify and extract trends oscillatory behaviour and noise zhang et al 2017 standard ssa consists of four steps embedding singular value decomposition svd grouping and diagonal averaging xiao et al 2017 step 1 embedding consider a time series y y 1 y 2 y n t of length n the embedding procedure is applied to construct a trajectory matrix from the original time series let k n l 1 and let the l lagged vectors be defined as follows 1 x i y i y i 1 y i l 1 t i 1 2 k the trajectory matrix is defined as follows 2 x y 1 y 2 y k y 2 y 3 y k 1 y l y l 1 y n where x is a hankel matrix step 2 svd define the covariance matrix x x t the svd of xxt is used to obtain a set of l eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ l and the corresponding eigenvectors u 1 u 2 u l the svd of the trajectory matrix can be expressed as abdollahzade et al 2015 3 x s 1 s 2 s d where d r a n k x and s i λ i u i v i t are elementary matrices and u i and v i are the ith left and right eigenvectors of x x t respectively afshar and bigdeli 2011 step 3 grouping in this step the elementary matrices s i i 1 d are grouped into m groups i 1 i 2 i m wu and chau 2011 the resultant matrix x i is defined as x i x i 1 x i p where i i 1 i p therefore 4 x x i 1 x i m step 4 diagonal averaging this step converts each matrix x i n n 1 m into a time series let z be an l n matrix with elements z ij 1 i l 1 j n set l min l n k max l n and n n l 1 if l n then z ij z ij otherwise z ij z ji diagonal averaging transforms the matrix z into a series z 1 z 2 z n using the following formula unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2018 zhang et al 2017 5 y k 1 k q 1 k 1 z q k q 1 1 k l 1 l q 1 l z q k q 1 l k k 1 n k 1 q k k 1 n k 1 z q k q 1 k k n eq 5 corresponds to the average of the matrix elements along the diagonals i j k 1 abdollahzade et al 2015 this step is applied to the matrix x i n and produces a time series y n of length n thus the original noisy time series y is decomposed into a sum of m series 6 y y 1 y 2 y m 4 1 2 processing via ssa the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa which reduces the noise and improves data quality after this processing sub step the processed series are obtained which are the reconstructed series in the ssa process two key parameters must be determined the window length l and the number of components m proper selection of l and m are crucial to the denoising performance of ssa briceño et al 2013 generally l n 2 is suggested however if a distinct feature of an integer period component exists for the original series it is advisable to define l to be proportional to that period zhang et al 2017 as mentioned previously the period of the streamflow in the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs is 12 months therefore l 12 is selected which is sufficient for mapping the period of the monthly streamflow series the number of components m is crucial to the reconstruction and its value is generally based on the contribution of each eigentriple whereas noise components typically contribute little claudio 2013 the eigenvalues of these components of the two reservoirs are shown in fig 4 from which it can be observed that the values of components 1 6 of the two reservoirs are obviously larger than those of the remaining components tables 3 and 4 show the performance indexes of the ssa elm model when m is set to different values and it is clear that m 6 results in the best values with the increase in m the performance of ssa elm decreases indicating that the components after 6 are noise components that should be eliminated and that the components before 6 are informative components that should be retained thus m 6 is selected for the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs as the starting point of the noise floor fig 5 shows the processed streamflow series for the two reservoirs after ssa processing 4 2 improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise 4 2 1 the theory of iceemdan iceemdan is a new algorithm that was proposed by colominas et al 2014 to address two problems the spurious modes and residual noise in the modes iceemdan calculates the local mean and subtracts it from the original signal and does not directly use white noise chen et al 2016 the calculation steps of iceemdan are shown in fig 6 4 2 2 reprocessing via iceemdan after the original streamflow series are processed by ssa the processed series are decomposed into sub series by iceemdan the decomposed results for the two reservoirs are shown in figs 7 and 8 and it can be observed that the order of the imf components ranges from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency there are seven imfs and one residue for the caojiahu reservoir and six imfs and one residue for the shibalipu reservoir 4 3 extreme learning machine 4 3 1 the theory of elm elm is a novel learning algorithm developed by huang et al 2006 this algorithm which is a type of single hidden layer feed forward neural network slfn has been proven to be an efficient algorithm the basic theory of elm is described as follows suppose there is a dataset with n arbitrary distinct samples x i t i r m r m the standard slfn with n hidden nodes and an activation function g x can be described as follows huang et al 2006 7 i 1 n β i g i x j i 1 n β i g i w i x j b i y j j 1 n where β i β i 1 β i 2 β im t is the output weight w i w i 1 w i 2 w in t is the input weight and b i is the threshold of the ith hidden node the basic premise of elm is to obtain a zero error for the n samples via j 1 n y j t j 0 where y is the actual output vector therefore the following exists 8 i 1 n β i g i w i x j b i t j j 1 n the above equations can be reorganized as h β t where h h x 1 h x n h 1 x 1 h n x 1 h 1 x n h n x n β β 1 β 2 β n t and t t 1 t 2 t n t 4 3 2 elm modelling and summarization after the processed streamflow series are decomposed into sub series via iceemdan these sub series are modelled using elm and the partial autocorrelation function and the trial and error approach are applied to select the input variables for the elm model during the elm modelling min max normalization is adopted to scale the real time data to a range from 0 to 1 moreover it should be noted that there are slight fluctuations in the elm output wang et al 2018 however the fluctuations in elm are much lower than those of an ann model because elm has a higher generalization ability than ann to enhance the stability of the proposed model arithmetic averaging is adopted in this study for its simplicity due to the extremely fast learning speed of elm modelling is performed one hundred times to obtain an arithmetic average which is sufficient for ensuring stability finally all of the sub series predictions are summarized to obtain the final predictions for the original streamflow data 5 results and discussion 5 1 results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed double processing model ssa iceemdan elm the proposed model is compared with four single processing models emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm moreover two single models without any processing i e arima and elm are considered for comparison therefore a total of 7 models are involved in the comparison the one month ahead forecasting results of the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs predicted by different models are shown in fig 9 and the assessments of the forecasting results are presented in tables 5 and 6 these results indicate that the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model exhibits satisfactory prediction accuracy and its performance is better than that of other compared models in the two reservoir experiments 5 2 discussion to reveal the effect of different methods on streamflow prediction accuracy a comprehensive comparative analysis is needed the results in tables 5 and 6 can be analysed as follows 1 the elm and arima models are single models and their comparison shows that the forecasting performance of the elm model is far better than that of the arima model which indicates that the elm model has a better ability to capture significant features from hydrological series than the arima model and is more appropriate for monthly streamflow forecasting for the two reservoirs the elm model shows average improvements over the arima model of a 25 25 decrease in mae a 24 20 decrease in rmse a 20 36 decrease in mape a 44 17 increase in r and a 516 04 increase in nsec therefore the elm model exhibits excellent performance in streamflow forecasting however for the two reservoirs with irrigation as the main function the hydrological processes are not only affected by rainfall and the underlying surface but also and more importantly by frequent human activities thus these hydrological series exhibit highly disordered and nonlinear as shown in fig 2 although the elm model has better prediction performance than the arima model the single model is limited in its ability to handle such a highly nonlinear system and cannot accurately describe the complex behaviour of hydrological series 2 the four single processing models namely emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm adopt only one of four methods emd eemdn iceemdan and ssa to process the original streamflow and these single processing models show significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared with the elm model for the two reservoirs the rmse values of the emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm models are improved on average by 29 79 39 84 45 96 and 51 69 respectively when compared with the elm model therefore the combination of these processing approaches with the elm model improves the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy this finding can be attributed to the fact that hydrological series contain hydrological behaviours related to seasonal annual variation or sunspot activity which are not easily captured and directly affect the modelling effect the single processing models can better extract the intrinsic nature of hydrological series by processing technology among them the emd elm eemd elm and iceemdan elm models employ decomposition methods to decompose the original streamflow into several sub series with different scales and the characteristics of these sub series can be easily learned the ssa elm model uses noise reduction to filter the noise from the original streamflow and the filtered series exhibits more obvious trends and better regularity than the original streamflow which is why these single processing models perform much better than the single models 3 among the four single processing models the ssa elm model exhibits the best performance for the two reservoirs and the performance of the iceemdan elm model ranked second for instance the r value of the ssa elm model is 0 931 for the caojiahu reservoir whereas those of the iceemdan elm eemd elm and emd elm models are 0 887 0 856 and 0 793 respectively the nsec of the ssa elm model is 0 836 for the shibalipu reservoir and those of the iceemdan elm eemd elm and emd elm models are 0 827 0 787 and 0 722 respectively these results indicate that the ssa approach has an excellent ability in nonlinear data processing and the ability of iceeman is second only to ssa therefore it is reasonable to choose ssa and iceemdan to build the double processing model and their combination is an excellent way to improve streamflow forecasting in addition the superiority of ssa elm proves that noise in hydrological series is a very important factor that seriously affects and interferes with the mining of valuable information in hydrological series thus hydrological noise cannot be ignored the performance of the ssa elm model shown in tables 3 and 4 shows that this model is affected by the parameter m if m is too small it will affect the essential information in the streamflow if m is too large it will make the noise filtering unclean therefore more noise that is filtered from the original streamflow data the better the quality of the data the smaller influence of random interference and the greater the improvement in the prediction accuracy 4 a comparison of the double processing model ssa iceemdan elm with the four single processing models shows that the double processing model is superior to the single processing models which is because the ssa iceemdan elm model combines the advantages of different methods utilizing the denoising ability of ssa the decomposition ability of iceemdan and the nonlinear mapping ability of elm the original streamflows are first processed by ssa to identify and remove noise from the original streamflow and after this process the noise disturbance of the original streamflow is greatly reduced which is very helpful for the subsequent hydrological information extraction then the processed streamflows are decomposed by iceemdan into sub series which are more stationary than the original streamflows as shown in figs 7 and 8 the frequency of these sub series and the information they contain are different as shown in tables 7 and 8 the correlation of imf2 is significantly larger than those of the other sub series implying that this sub series involves the most important information from the original streamflow series moreover the fluctuation period of imf2 is approximately 12 months as shown in fig 10 which is consistent with the 1 year period of the original monthly streamflows and the annual variation is more clearly displayed the decomposition process of iceemdan effectively improves the predictable of streamflow features and indicates that there are several multiscale components with different characteristics in the monthly streamflow after the double processing the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model further improves the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy for example the rmse of the ssa iceemdan elm model is improved by 9 70 and 26 18 when compared with those of the ssa elm and iceemdan elm models respectively for the caojiahu reservoir the mape of the ssa iceemdan elm model is improved by 7 71 and 16 08 when compared with those of the ssa elm and iceemdan elm models respectively for the shibalipu reservoir therefore the double processing model ssa iceemdan elm can achieve better prediction accuracy than the single processing models demonstrating that the double processing model can better reduce the interference between the deterministic components and the stochastic components in hydrological series improve the stability of hydrological series changes and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological variation processes 5 fig 11 shows scatter plots between the observed and forecasted streamflows for the different models it can be seen from fig 11 that the proposed double processing model adheres more tightly to the 45 degree line than the other models and as shown in fig 9 the peak and minimum streamflow estimated by the proposed model are in good agreement with the observed values which implies that this model has good prospect in predicting extreme events such as floods and droughts in addition in terms of the mae rmse mape r and nsec criteria it is clear that the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model shows the best performances for streamflow forecasting in the two reservoirs experiments compared with the elm model that does not adopt any processing approach the proposed model reduces mae rmse and mape by 59 57 55 20 and 67 22 on average and improves r and nsec by 43 78 and 163 91 on average respectively in addition compared with the ssa elm model that is the best of the four types of single processing models the proposed model reduces mae rmse and mape by 11 90 7 42 and 19 08 on average and improves r and nsec by 0 98 and 2 54 on average respectively therefore the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is a promising method for monthly streamflow forecasting and the comparative analysis of different models indicates that prediction performance of data driven hydrological models is related to the quality of hydrological data the degree of nonlinearity of the hydrological series the use of appropriate data processing methods and modelling methods and the ability of the modelers 6 conclusions this study proposes a double processing model called ssa iceemdan elm for improving monthly streamflow forecasting the monthly streamflow data from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the gulang river basin are analysed in the case study the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa to recognize and filter out noise then the processed streamflow series are reprocessed via iceemdan which decomposes the processed streamflow into relatively stationary sub series to reduce the effects of non stationarity these sub series are modelled using elm and the final forecasting result can be obtained by summarization to investigate the prediction performance of the proposed model four single processing models emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm and two single models arima and elm are considered for comparison and five comparative criteria mae rmse mape r and nsec are chosen based on the results of the two experiments the conclusions are summarized as follows a the four single processing models have much higher prediction accuracy than the single models and the ssa elm model shows better forecasting performance than the other single processing models emd elm eemd elm and iceemdan elm implying that the noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored b among all of the considered models the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model has the best performance for monthly streamflow forecasting demonstrating that the double processing approach is more helpful than single processing approach in improving the prediction accuracy and capturing the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series therefore the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is a superior alternative to the other compared models for monthly streamflow forecasting with its significant improvement in monthly streamflow prediction accuracy the proposed model will be helpful for reservoir management and provides a new method for hydrological forecasting based on data driven modelling although the proposed model obtains satisfactory prediction performance this study focuses on univariate streamflow forecasting without consideration of exogenous variables that affect streamflow such as rainfall in future research other variables will be considered in the modelling of streamflow forecasting declaration of interests

called ssa iceemdan elm the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa for denoising then the processed series are reprocessed via iceemdan to decompose them into relatively stationary sub series finally these sub series are modelled using elm the performance of the proposed model is tested for one month ahead prediction using streamflow data from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the gulang river basin in addition the proposed double processing model is compared with four single processing models namely empirical mode decomposition emd elm ensemble emd eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm and two single models without any processing namely autoregressive integrated moving average arima and elm the results show that a the four single processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models and the performance of the ssa elm model is the best of these single processing models implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored b the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is superior to the single processing models and single models demonstrating that the double processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy thus the proposed model which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series keywords streamflow prediction data driven model extreme learning machine singular spectrum analysis empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting has great significance in the management and optimal allocation of water resources especially for reservoir operation optimization singh 2016 zhang et al 2016 however it is a challenging task because streamflow processes exhibit complex nonlinearity and stochastic characteristics yaseen et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 therefore improving the accuracy of streamflow forecasting is an important topic for hydrologists and research on streamflow forecasting methods has received considerable attention the existing methods of streamflow prediction can be roughly grouped into two categories process driven methods and data driven methods abdollahi et al 2017 chu et al 2017 process driven methods have a potential advantage in building a physical understanding of hydrological processes badrzadeh et al 2018 humphrey et al 2016 however these methods typically require a large amount of hydrological data and sufficient data are rarely available for physical modelling which limits practical applications noori and kalin 2016 peng et al 2017 furthermore the influences and complex interactions of many random factors result in uncertainties and poor model performance liu et al 2016 sun et al 2014 relative to process driven methods data driven methods require minimal data can be quickly modelled and are simple to implement karran et al 2014 liu et al 2014 additionally data driven methods exhibit better prediction performance than process driven methods kalteh 2016 wang et al 2013 therefore data driven methods have become more popular in streamflow forecasting applications data driven methods generally include statistical based methods such as autoregressive moving average arma and multiple linear regression mlr and artificial intelligence ai based methods such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and classification and regression tree cart hadi and tombul 2018 yang et al 2016 among the ai based methods extreme learning machine elm approach is a new learning method zong et al 2013 relative to traditional neural network methods elm does not require iteration for weight adjustment and offers many advantages such as outstanding performance with a rapid learning speed wang et al 2015a in recent years elm has been widely applied in different scientific fields mehmet et al 2014 applied elm to estimate solar radiation and showed its reliability deo and şahin 2015 used elm to forecast the effective drought index in eastern australia and the results indicated that compared to an ann model the elm achieved much better forecasting accuracy was 32 times faster in terms of learning speed and 6 1 times faster in terms of training speed shiri et al 2016 applied elm to predict the daily water level in urmia lake and confirmed the excellent performance of elm therefore elm is an advanced approach for forecasting and estimation nevertheless there have been few applications of elm in streamflow forecasting in this study elm is used for monthly streamflow forecasting although it is important to select excellent ai based methods such as elm as prediction models for streamflow forecasting they are single models which are not sufficient to satisfy increasing accuracy requirements therefore hybrid models have been developed to improve prediction accuracy and the hybrid models usually adopt two methods of combination the first method optimizes an ai based prediction model by combining optimization algorithms for example yaseen et al 2017 proposed a hybrid model that combined an optimization algorithm firefly algorithm with an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model for improving streamflow prediction the second method decreases the influence of non stationary features and improves the performance of an ai based prediction model by combining signal processing algorithms which is a new trend in improving streamflow prediction moosavi et al 2017 zhao and chen 2015 the signal processing methods include wavelet decomposition wd empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and singular spectrum analysis ssa ravansalar et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 compared mlr ann wd mlr and wd ann models for streamflow forecasting and the comparisons demonstrated that the inclusion of wd as a processing technique in hybrid models can enhance prediction accuracy zhao et al 2017 developed an emd least squares support vector machine lssvm model and wang et al 2015b proposed an eemd autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the two hybrid models were used for annual runoff forecasting and both were found to significantly improve prediction performance zhang et al 2011 developed a ssa arima model for forecasting annual runoff wang et al 2014 coupled ssa with svm or genetic programming gp models for monthly inflow prediction and the results verified that the hydrological series contained noise and the hybrid models exhibited better prediction precision than the svm and gp models based on the literature mentioned above it has been found that the appropriate processing approaches are effective for improving prediction accuracy however these streamflow forecasting studies are based on single processing models in which the streamflow series are processed only one time and hydrological dynamic information is not fully excavated therefore there is still much room to further improve the accuracy of streamflow forecasting huang et al 2014 proposed a modified emd svm model for monthly streamflow forecasting although this model is still a single processing model it is an improvement on the conventional single processing model by removing the highest intrinsic mode function imf1 to enhance prediction accuracy in another research field fijani et al 2019 developed a two layer decomposition model to estimate water quality parameters in this model the original water quality parameter series were first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions imfs by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ceemdan then the highest frequency imf1 was further decomposed into several imfs by variational mode decomposition vmd this model was proven to be robust in identifying water quality parameters however the two decomposition processes produced many imfs and each imf need to be modelled and estimated which as this reference mentioned costs too much in terms of computation cost therefore this study aims to develop a hybrid data driven model based on a double processing strategy to better capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series and further improve the accuracy of monthly streamflow prediction in contrast with the model described in ref fijani et al 2019 the proposed double processing model combines ssa with improved ceemdan iceemdan and elm approaches the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model does not produce as many imfs that require modelling as it directly uses ssa to filter noises from the original streamflow series and then uses iceemdan to decompose the processed series into several imfs thus the proposed model has a lower computation cost and a less complicated computation process than the model in ref fijani et al 2019 the main contributions of this study include the following 1 in contrast to most existing studies on streamflow prediction in which single processing models are adopted for streamflow forecasting this study proposes a double processing model for streamflow forecasting the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa to recognize and reduce the noise they contain then these processed series are reprocessed via iceemdan to reduce the influence of non stationary features and to gain a deep understanding of data features the double processed series are easier to model by elm and have higher data quality than the original streamflow series 2 considering that emd can easily lead to the mode mixing problem and that eemd contains a certain amount of noise state of the art iceemdan is used in this study to overcome these problems and extract useful information with less noise 3 this study adopts the elm approach which has been seldom applied to streamflow forecasting the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents details of the study area and data section 3 introduces the proposed model and evaluation criteria section 4 describes the method and model application section 5 presents the results and discussion and section 6 outlines the conclusions of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the gulang river basin which has an area of 882 km2 is located in the eastern portion of the hexi corridor and on the northern slope of the tibetan plateau the gulang river which originates from qilian mountain and enters the main stream of the shiyang river through the hongshui river has seven tributaries including the huangyangchuan river and the longgou river the gulang river basin is a typical arid and semi arid area and the climate is characterized by infrequent rain strong evaporation great temperature differences between day and night adequate sunshine and dry air the mean annual precipitation is 361 3 mm and the mean annual evaporation is 1783 8 mm precipitation snowmelt and all kinds of phreatic water account for 28 9 28 6 and 42 5 respectively in the recharge of the gulang river hu 2009 the basin terrain is high in the south and low in the north with an elevation decreasing from 3469 m to 1550 m and the landform type is complex and variable in this region wang et al 2016 among the land types in this basin crops account for 35 69 forests for 33 82 grasslands for 27 72 houses for 1 06 and bare land for 1 61 ma et al 2008 therefore the proportion of water demand for agricultural irrigation in this region is very large and streamflow is a crucial index whose analysis and trend prediction are of great significance to the allocation of water resources in this region 2 2 data used in the study the monthly streamflow data were sourced from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the upper reaches of the gulang river basin the locations of these two reservoirs are shown in fig 1 the two reservoirs are mainly used for farmland irrigation the caojiahu reservoir is located on the huangyangchuan river which is a tributary of gulang river the catchment area of this reservoir is 403 km2 and the guaranteed irrigation area is 28 km2 the shibalipu reservoir is located on the longgou river which is a tributary of gulang river the catchment area of this reservoir is 430 km2 and the guaranteed irrigation area is 47 km2 table 1 lists some basic statistics of the streamflow data of the two reservoirs monthly streamflow data for an observation period from january 1959 to december 2016 are available for each reservoir for the two reservoirs the training dataset covers the period from 1959 to 2004 and the remaining 12 years of data are used for validation monthly streamflow typically has an obvious period of 1 year 12 months and the monthly streamflow of the two reservoirs shown in fig 2 is no exception 3 the proposed model and evaluation criteria 3 1 the proposed model the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model contains three calculation steps as depicted in fig 3 and described as follows step 1 double processing this step is the core of the entire algorithm and contains two sub steps first the original streamflow series are processed via ssa to obtain the processed streamflow series this sub step can recognize and filter the noise in the original streamflow series then the processed streamflow series are reprocessed via iceemdan which decomposes the processed series into a sequence of sub series this sub step transforms the non stationary series into a series of relatively stationary sub series and improves the prediction capacity step 2 elm modelling the sub series are modelled using elm to obtain the sub series prediction and arithmetic averaging is used to improve the stability of the elm step 3 summarization all of the sub series predictions are summarized to produce the final streamflow forecast 3 2 evaluation criteria to evaluate the accuracies of the involved forecasting models in this study five error criteria are applied as shown in table 2 generally low mae rmse and mape values and high r and nsec values reflect strong modelling performance 4 methods and model application 4 1 singular spectrum analysis 4 1 1 the theory of singular spectrum analysis ssa is a powerful nonparametric method for time series analysis that can efficiently identify and extract trends oscillatory behaviour and noise zhang et al 2017 standard ssa consists of four steps embedding singular value decomposition svd grouping and diagonal averaging xiao et al 2017 step 1 embedding consider a time series y y 1 y 2 y n t of length n the embedding procedure is applied to construct a trajectory matrix from the original time series let k n l 1 and let the l lagged vectors be defined as follows 1 x i y i y i 1 y i l 1 t i 1 2 k the trajectory matrix is defined as follows 2 x y 1 y 2 y k y 2 y 3 y k 1 y l y l 1 y n where x is a hankel matrix step 2 svd define the covariance matrix x x t the svd of xxt is used to obtain a set of l eigenvalues λ 1 λ 2 λ l and the corresponding eigenvectors u 1 u 2 u l the svd of the trajectory matrix can be expressed as abdollahzade et al 2015 3 x s 1 s 2 s d where d r a n k x and s i λ i u i v i t are elementary matrices and u i and v i are the ith left and right eigenvectors of x x t respectively afshar and bigdeli 2011 step 3 grouping in this step the elementary matrices s i i 1 d are grouped into m groups i 1 i 2 i m wu and chau 2011 the resultant matrix x i is defined as x i x i 1 x i p where i i 1 i p therefore 4 x x i 1 x i m step 4 diagonal averaging this step converts each matrix x i n n 1 m into a time series let z be an l n matrix with elements z ij 1 i l 1 j n set l min l n k max l n and n n l 1 if l n then z ij z ij otherwise z ij z ji diagonal averaging transforms the matrix z into a series z 1 z 2 z n using the following formula unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2018 zhang et al 2017 5 y k 1 k q 1 k 1 z q k q 1 1 k l 1 l q 1 l z q k q 1 l k k 1 n k 1 q k k 1 n k 1 z q k q 1 k k n eq 5 corresponds to the average of the matrix elements along the diagonals i j k 1 abdollahzade et al 2015 this step is applied to the matrix x i n and produces a time series y n of length n thus the original noisy time series y is decomposed into a sum of m series 6 y y 1 y 2 y m 4 1 2 processing via ssa the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa which reduces the noise and improves data quality after this processing sub step the processed series are obtained which are the reconstructed series in the ssa process two key parameters must be determined the window length l and the number of components m proper selection of l and m are crucial to the denoising performance of ssa briceño et al 2013 generally l n 2 is suggested however if a distinct feature of an integer period component exists for the original series it is advisable to define l to be proportional to that period zhang et al 2017 as mentioned previously the period of the streamflow in the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs is 12 months therefore l 12 is selected which is sufficient for mapping the period of the monthly streamflow series the number of components m is crucial to the reconstruction and its value is generally based on the contribution of each eigentriple whereas noise components typically contribute little claudio 2013 the eigenvalues of these components of the two reservoirs are shown in fig 4 from which it can be observed that the values of components 1 6 of the two reservoirs are obviously larger than those of the remaining components tables 3 and 4 show the performance indexes of the ssa elm model when m is set to different values and it is clear that m 6 results in the best values with the increase in m the performance of ssa elm decreases indicating that the components after 6 are noise components that should be eliminated and that the components before 6 are informative components that should be retained thus m 6 is selected for the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs as the starting point of the noise floor fig 5 shows the processed streamflow series for the two reservoirs after ssa processing 4 2 improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise 4 2 1 the theory of iceemdan iceemdan is a new algorithm that was proposed by colominas et al 2014 to address two problems the spurious modes and residual noise in the modes iceemdan calculates the local mean and subtracts it from the original signal and does not directly use white noise chen et al 2016 the calculation steps of iceemdan are shown in fig 6 4 2 2 reprocessing via iceemdan after the original streamflow series are processed by ssa the processed series are decomposed into sub series by iceemdan the decomposed results for the two reservoirs are shown in figs 7 and 8 and it can be observed that the order of the imf components ranges from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency there are seven imfs and one residue for the caojiahu reservoir and six imfs and one residue for the shibalipu reservoir 4 3 extreme learning machine 4 3 1 the theory of elm elm is a novel learning algorithm developed by huang et al 2006 this algorithm which is a type of single hidden layer feed forward neural network slfn has been proven to be an efficient algorithm the basic theory of elm is described as follows suppose there is a dataset with n arbitrary distinct samples x i t i r m r m the standard slfn with n hidden nodes and an activation function g x can be described as follows huang et al 2006 7 i 1 n β i g i x j i 1 n β i g i w i x j b i y j j 1 n where β i β i 1 β i 2 β im t is the output weight w i w i 1 w i 2 w in t is the input weight and b i is the threshold of the ith hidden node the basic premise of elm is to obtain a zero error for the n samples via j 1 n y j t j 0 where y is the actual output vector therefore the following exists 8 i 1 n β i g i w i x j b i t j j 1 n the above equations can be reorganized as h β t where h h x 1 h x n h 1 x 1 h n x 1 h 1 x n h n x n β β 1 β 2 β n t and t t 1 t 2 t n t 4 3 2 elm modelling and summarization after the processed streamflow series are decomposed into sub series via iceemdan these sub series are modelled using elm and the partial autocorrelation function and the trial and error approach are applied to select the input variables for the elm model during the elm modelling min max normalization is adopted to scale the real time data to a range from 0 to 1 moreover it should be noted that there are slight fluctuations in the elm output wang et al 2018 however the fluctuations in elm are much lower than those of an ann model because elm has a higher generalization ability than ann to enhance the stability of the proposed model arithmetic averaging is adopted in this study for its simplicity due to the extremely fast learning speed of elm modelling is performed one hundred times to obtain an arithmetic average which is sufficient for ensuring stability finally all of the sub series predictions are summarized to obtain the final predictions for the original streamflow data 5 results and discussion 5 1 results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed double processing model ssa iceemdan elm the proposed model is compared with four single processing models emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm moreover two single models without any processing i e arima and elm are considered for comparison therefore a total of 7 models are involved in the comparison the one month ahead forecasting results of the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs predicted by different models are shown in fig 9 and the assessments of the forecasting results are presented in tables 5 and 6 these results indicate that the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model exhibits satisfactory prediction accuracy and its performance is better than that of other compared models in the two reservoir experiments 5 2 discussion to reveal the effect of different methods on streamflow prediction accuracy a comprehensive comparative analysis is needed the results in tables 5 and 6 can be analysed as follows 1 the elm and arima models are single models and their comparison shows that the forecasting performance of the elm model is far better than that of the arima model which indicates that the elm model has a better ability to capture significant features from hydrological series than the arima model and is more appropriate for monthly streamflow forecasting for the two reservoirs the elm model shows average improvements over the arima model of a 25 25 decrease in mae a 24 20 decrease in rmse a 20 36 decrease in mape a 44 17 increase in r and a 516 04 increase in nsec therefore the elm model exhibits excellent performance in streamflow forecasting however for the two reservoirs with irrigation as the main function the hydrological processes are not only affected by rainfall and the underlying surface but also and more importantly by frequent human activities thus these hydrological series exhibit highly disordered and nonlinear as shown in fig 2 although the elm model has better prediction performance than the arima model the single model is limited in its ability to handle such a highly nonlinear system and cannot accurately describe the complex behaviour of hydrological series 2 the four single processing models namely emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm adopt only one of four methods emd eemdn iceemdan and ssa to process the original streamflow and these single processing models show significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared with the elm model for the two reservoirs the rmse values of the emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm models are improved on average by 29 79 39 84 45 96 and 51 69 respectively when compared with the elm model therefore the combination of these processing approaches with the elm model improves the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy this finding can be attributed to the fact that hydrological series contain hydrological behaviours related to seasonal annual variation or sunspot activity which are not easily captured and directly affect the modelling effect the single processing models can better extract the intrinsic nature of hydrological series by processing technology among them the emd elm eemd elm and iceemdan elm models employ decomposition methods to decompose the original streamflow into several sub series with different scales and the characteristics of these sub series can be easily learned the ssa elm model uses noise reduction to filter the noise from the original streamflow and the filtered series exhibits more obvious trends and better regularity than the original streamflow which is why these single processing models perform much better than the single models 3 among the four single processing models the ssa elm model exhibits the best performance for the two reservoirs and the performance of the iceemdan elm model ranked second for instance the r value of the ssa elm model is 0 931 for the caojiahu reservoir whereas those of the iceemdan elm eemd elm and emd elm models are 0 887 0 856 and 0 793 respectively the nsec of the ssa elm model is 0 836 for the shibalipu reservoir and those of the iceemdan elm eemd elm and emd elm models are 0 827 0 787 and 0 722 respectively these results indicate that the ssa approach has an excellent ability in nonlinear data processing and the ability of iceeman is second only to ssa therefore it is reasonable to choose ssa and iceemdan to build the double processing model and their combination is an excellent way to improve streamflow forecasting in addition the superiority of ssa elm proves that noise in hydrological series is a very important factor that seriously affects and interferes with the mining of valuable information in hydrological series thus hydrological noise cannot be ignored the performance of the ssa elm model shown in tables 3 and 4 shows that this model is affected by the parameter m if m is too small it will affect the essential information in the streamflow if m is too large it will make the noise filtering unclean therefore more noise that is filtered from the original streamflow data the better the quality of the data the smaller influence of random interference and the greater the improvement in the prediction accuracy 4 a comparison of the double processing model ssa iceemdan elm with the four single processing models shows that the double processing model is superior to the single processing models which is because the ssa iceemdan elm model combines the advantages of different methods utilizing the denoising ability of ssa the decomposition ability of iceemdan and the nonlinear mapping ability of elm the original streamflows are first processed by ssa to identify and remove noise from the original streamflow and after this process the noise disturbance of the original streamflow is greatly reduced which is very helpful for the subsequent hydrological information extraction then the processed streamflows are decomposed by iceemdan into sub series which are more stationary than the original streamflows as shown in figs 7 and 8 the frequency of these sub series and the information they contain are different as shown in tables 7 and 8 the correlation of imf2 is significantly larger than those of the other sub series implying that this sub series involves the most important information from the original streamflow series moreover the fluctuation period of imf2 is approximately 12 months as shown in fig 10 which is consistent with the 1 year period of the original monthly streamflows and the annual variation is more clearly displayed the decomposition process of iceemdan effectively improves the predictable of streamflow features and indicates that there are several multiscale components with different characteristics in the monthly streamflow after the double processing the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model further improves the monthly streamflow prediction accuracy for example the rmse of the ssa iceemdan elm model is improved by 9 70 and 26 18 when compared with those of the ssa elm and iceemdan elm models respectively for the caojiahu reservoir the mape of the ssa iceemdan elm model is improved by 7 71 and 16 08 when compared with those of the ssa elm and iceemdan elm models respectively for the shibalipu reservoir therefore the double processing model ssa iceemdan elm can achieve better prediction accuracy than the single processing models demonstrating that the double processing model can better reduce the interference between the deterministic components and the stochastic components in hydrological series improve the stability of hydrological series changes and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological variation processes 5 fig 11 shows scatter plots between the observed and forecasted streamflows for the different models it can be seen from fig 11 that the proposed double processing model adheres more tightly to the 45 degree line than the other models and as shown in fig 9 the peak and minimum streamflow estimated by the proposed model are in good agreement with the observed values which implies that this model has good prospect in predicting extreme events such as floods and droughts in addition in terms of the mae rmse mape r and nsec criteria it is clear that the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model shows the best performances for streamflow forecasting in the two reservoirs experiments compared with the elm model that does not adopt any processing approach the proposed model reduces mae rmse and mape by 59 57 55 20 and 67 22 on average and improves r and nsec by 43 78 and 163 91 on average respectively in addition compared with the ssa elm model that is the best of the four types of single processing models the proposed model reduces mae rmse and mape by 11 90 7 42 and 19 08 on average and improves r and nsec by 0 98 and 2 54 on average respectively therefore the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is a promising method for monthly streamflow forecasting and the comparative analysis of different models indicates that prediction performance of data driven hydrological models is related to the quality of hydrological data the degree of nonlinearity of the hydrological series the use of appropriate data processing methods and modelling methods and the ability of the modelers 6 conclusions this study proposes a double processing model called ssa iceemdan elm for improving monthly streamflow forecasting the monthly streamflow data from the caojiahu and shibalipu reservoirs in the gulang river basin are analysed in the case study the original streamflow series are first processed via ssa to recognize and filter out noise then the processed streamflow series are reprocessed via iceemdan which decomposes the processed streamflow into relatively stationary sub series to reduce the effects of non stationarity these sub series are modelled using elm and the final forecasting result can be obtained by summarization to investigate the prediction performance of the proposed model four single processing models emd elm eemd elm iceemdan elm and ssa elm and two single models arima and elm are considered for comparison and five comparative criteria mae rmse mape r and nsec are chosen based on the results of the two experiments the conclusions are summarized as follows a the four single processing models have much higher prediction accuracy than the single models and the ssa elm model shows better forecasting performance than the other single processing models emd elm eemd elm and iceemdan elm implying that the noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored b among all of the considered models the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model has the best performance for monthly streamflow forecasting demonstrating that the double processing approach is more helpful than single processing approach in improving the prediction accuracy and capturing the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series therefore the proposed ssa iceemdan elm model is a superior alternative to the other compared models for monthly streamflow forecasting with its significant improvement in monthly streamflow prediction accuracy the proposed model will be helpful for reservoir management and provides a new method for hydrological forecasting based on data driven modelling although the proposed model obtains satisfactory prediction performance this study focuses on univariate streamflow forecasting without consideration of exogenous variables that affect streamflow such as rainfall in future research other variables will be considered in the modelling of streamflow forecasting declaration of interests

productivity here we develop a dielectric based frequency domain fd impedance sensor operating at 100 mhz with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board this perforated cylinder coaxial pcc sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content vswc and of temperature the temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water we characterize the performance of the pcc sensor and compare it with alternative 3 pin and 2 pin electrode fd impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board a series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted including i sensors calibration ii temperature effects and their correction iii soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal ssr test and iv accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the nswc measurements the calibration results verified that the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes were suitable to measure vswc rmse 0 0142 cm3 cm 3 the simulation analysis using high frequency structure simulator software hfss indicated that the novel pcc probe had a symmetrical distribution of the e field wholly contained within the cylinder avoiding leakage of the e field into air at the soil atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on vswc the results of the ssr test showed that the e field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the pcc probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on vswc i e up to 8 mm for 3 pin and up to 11 mm for 2 pin designs when vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 which corresponds to the simulation analysis moreover the new pcc probe provided more accurate nswc measurement than 3 pin or 2 pin probes because the e field was contained within the perforated cylinder avoiding e field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of vswc the pin structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface keywords dielectric sensor perforated cylinder coaxial probe soil surface soil water content temperature correction accuracy improvement 1 introduction near surface soil water content nswc the volumetric soil water content vswc of the uppermost of soil is an important parameter for investigating hydrological and biological processes involving water vapor and energy exchanges at the soil atmosphere boundary monteith and unsworth 2013 the nswc varies rapidly in response to rainfall and evaporation and correlates with longer term measurements of soil water content in the root zone li and islam 2002 due to these large spatial and temporal variations accurate determination of nswc is challenging but important for many applications several measurement techniques have been applied to this problem satellite based remote sensing rs has been used successfully to estimate nswc spectral reflectance across several domains of the electromagnetic spectrum decreases with increasing nswc e g liu et al 2002 gao et al 2013 however these methods are influenced by surface roughness and vegetation cover reducing their accuracy petropoulos et al 2015 ground penetrating radar gpr has been used to monitor nswc the determination of soil dielectric properties is based on the travel time between the antennae and a reflector target koyama et al 2017 and on surface reflectivity serbin et al 2004 the speed of a voltage pulse through the soil decreases with increasing dielectric constant a function of vswc due to the large difference between the dielectric constant of water and of other soil constituents however gpr signals combine contributions of reflection scattering or diffraction and topsoil characteristics as well as soil horizon depth and surface roughness rohman et al 2018 making decoding of the signal complex more satisfactory results have been obtained with contact methods dielectric sensors such as time domain reflectometry tdr and frequency domain fd impedance sensors have proven to be practical for determining nswc in situ e g adams et al 2015 sheng et al 2017 nolz and kammerer 2017 and for validating data acquired by other e g rs or gpr techniques albergel et al 2012

design sensors for nswc are preferably installed horizontally to best represent vswc dynamics near the soil surface and to avoid providing a conduit for exchange of water and heat at the soil atmosphere boundary as may occur with a vertically installed probe nolz and kammerer 2017 however horizontal installation of available rod and pin type probes near the soil atmosphere interface has a potential risk that allows the electromagnetic field e field strength to leak to the air which reduces sensor accuracy because the sensed volume of soil is correlated with vswc sun et al 2012 in the present study we try to develop a dielectric based fd impedance sensor with an innovative design to avoid this risk of leakage of the e field and integrate a temperature sensor into the new sensor to

fd designs were evaluated for nswc measurement 2 materials and methods 2 1 measurement principle vswc is determined in this study using the dielectric frequency domain fd impedance method gaskin and

limitations of existing probes the pcc probe contains a stainless steel pin surrounded by a stainless steel cylinder with uniform perforations to allow equilibration of vswc with the bulk soil fig 2 the stainless steel cylinder inner diameter 29 mm outer diameter 30 length 60 mm functions as a shield conductor soldered to the receiving contact of the circuit board the 30 uniform 10 mm diameter

circuit boards were created and fitted with each of three fd impedance sensor configurations pcc fig 2 3 pin fig 3 a and 2 pin fig 3b the pins of all electrodes were 60 mm in length 3 mm in diameter the distance between the pin center and the shield center in the pcc probe was about 14 5 mm and the center to center distance between the adjacent pins for 2 pin and 3 pin probes was 15 mm 2 3 experiment 1 calibration of the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes to obtain the relationships between the outputs of the three different probe designs and vswc a calibration was carried out using a loamy soil sand 42 1 silt 44 2 clay 13 7 taken from an experimental field at china agricultural university passed through a 2 mm mesh screen and oven dried at 105 c for 48 h the soil was placed in a cylindrical pvc container 300 mm diameter 150 mm height under laboratory conditions with room temperature 21 1 c during calibration the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes were vertically inserted into the soil sample fig 4 leaving the circuit boards in their plastic housings in the air to avoid interactions of the e fields the three sensors were tested one at a time in the order 2 pin 3 pin and pcc

dry to near saturation 0 0 41 cm3cm 3 with three spatial measurement replications for every probe at each water content level surface evaporation was ignored during a 15 min test at each water content level 2 4 experiment 2 temperature correction the output of a dielectric sensor is affected by temperature topp et al 1980 topp et al 1987 due to the temperature coefficient of the circuit board and of the permittivity of water correction of these effects can improve the measurement accuracy of vswc saito el al 2009 especially applied for nswc determination 2 4 1 correction of temperature sensitivity of the circuit board to determine the temperature coefficient of the circuit board a 10 pf capacitor insensitive to temperature was connected between the emitter and the receiver as the load of the tested circuit board replacing the impedance zp of the bulk soil this eliminated the temperature dependency of the permittivity of soil water at the probe and allowed correction for only the sensitivity of the circuit board the output of the circuit board was recorded as a function of changing ambient temperature in a temperature controlled incubator the temperature coefficient of the circuit board was applied during data processing to correct the relationship between sensor output and temperature 2 4 2 correction of the temperature effect on the permittivity of water in soil the permittivity of water in the soil is also temperature dependent the measurement of temperature on the circuit board reflects soil temperature when the fd sensor is completely inserted into the soil we develop a permittivity model to correct for this effect incorporating a solution for the temperature effects on porous materials birchak et al 1974 6 ε α θ l ε l t α θ s ε s α θ a ε a α 7 1 θ l θ s θ

the soil sample containing the fd sensor was wrapped by a film to prevent evaporation and then placed in the temperature controlled incubator at 40 c for 3 h the incubator was then set to 15 c for 3 h the embedded temperature sensor fig 2 determined the temperature of the circuit board and of the soil another temperature sensor was put in the air to monitor ambient temperature data from the fd and temperature sensors were acquired once per minute 2 5 experiment 3 analysis and experimental determination of sensed soil volumes of the three probes 2 5 1 analysis of sensed volume by high frequency structure simulation software hfss the e field distribution of each electrode design was simulated using high frequency structure simulator software hfss 13 0 ansoft corporation pa usa these simulations provided a theoretical characterization of the sensed volume of the three sensor configurations in air and in wet soil the driven modal solution was chosen in hfss the relative permittivity of air was set to 1 and that of wet soil to 20 materials were assigned as stainless steel for the pcc and pin structure probes and wave port excitation was assigned to the ends of the three dielectric probes integration lines are positive in the direction of the e field pointing from the emitting electrodes to the receiving electrodes the matrix space was bounded as wet soil or air 2 5 2 experimental determination of sensed volume by step wise soil removal the sensed soil volumes of the three probes were investigated experimentally under laboratory condition by stepwise removing soil layer by layer beginning outside the sensed volume fig 5 a about 25 mm the calibration soil was used with vswc of 0 17 cm3 cm 3 in run 1 and 0 26 cm3 cm 3 in run 2 to test whether the sensed volume was influenced by soil water content soil was removed stepwise in 1 mm layers until the receiving pin electrode was fully exposed fig 5b the output of the sensor was recorded using a voltmeter and transformed to vswc with the soil water calibration curve section 2 3 2 6 experiment 4 accuracy comparison of the three sensors for nswc measurement to assess the accuracies of the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes for the nswc measurement an experiment was conducted under laboratory condition a rectangular pvc box 415 mm length 45 mm height 150 mm width was filled with soil sample to a bulk density ρb of 1 22 g cm 3 fig 6 and initial gravimetric soil water content of 0 15 g g 1 initial vswc of 0 183 cm3 cm 3 the three sensors probes together with housings were mostly buried with the receiving pin or cylinder of the pcc probe just at the soil atmosphere interface fig 6 the emitting electrodes red pins in fig 6 of the three sensors were all at the same depth 15 mm in the soil this configuration monitored the variations of nswc and temperature of the circuit board when the experiment was finished the tested soil was sampled in four places flanking the three probes at the depth of 0 3 cm fig 6 and oven dried to determine the final vswc the accuracies of the three sensors were assessed by comparing the sensor readings at the initial and final stages of the experiment with the initial and final nswc of the tested soil at the depth of 0 3 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 cross calibration of the 2 pin 3 pin and pcc probes the 2 pin 3 pin and pcc probes all yielded linear relationships between the vswc and sensor output fig 7 the vswc of the soil sample covered the entire range from oven dry to near saturation 0 0 41 cm3 cm 3 obtained by wetting and repacking the soil the r2 0 9978 of the pcc probe is marginally higher than those of the 2 pin 0 9913 and 3 pin probes 0 9947 and the rmse 0 00718 cm3 cm 3 is significantly lower 0 0110 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0142 cm3 cm 3 indicating greater precision 3 2 results before and after temperature correction the circuit board of the sensor exhibited a strong non linear response to ambient temperature fig 8 a over an operating range of 10 30 c the positive temperature coefficient was well described by a quadratic regression equation with high r2 0 959 and rmse of 2 6 mv this relationship allowed precise temperature correction of sensor output fig 8b shows a near step change in ambient temperature and a slewed rate of change of soil temperature along with uncorrected and corrected sensor output in this case soil temperature is inferred from temperature within the buried circuit board housing whose thermal properties differ from the soil direct measurement of tsoil when available may provide even better correction for the permittivity of soil water before temperature correction the uncorrected sensor measurement decreased as the soil temperature increased and they yielded a negative correlation even if the temperature coefficient of the circuit board was positive the rmse of the uncorrected sensor measurement was 0 0138 cm3 cm 3 the corrected curve green curve was acquired by first correcting the temperature coefficient of circuit board using the equation yielded in fig 8a and then correcting temperature dependent permittivity of water in soil with eq 9 after temperature correction the accuracy rmse 0 0026 cm3 cm 3 of the sensor measurement is significantly improved 3 3 test of sensed volume by simulation of e field distribution the e field distribution around the electrodes is closely related to sensor accuracy for nswc measurement electrode configuration has a large effect on the effective sensed volume of soil probes zegelin et al 1989 applying the hfss to the three sensor configurations with identical excitation demonstrates the expected e field distributions in air fig 9 a c and e and in wet soil fig 9b d and f it can be seen that i in general the 2 pin and 3 pin probes have larger effective sensed volumes in air than in wet soil a potential source of error related to vswc itself that has been previously identified sun et al 2012 ii the distributions of the e field around the electrodes for the 2 pin probe are asymmetric fig 9a and b whereas iii both the 3 pin probe fig 9c and d and the pcc probe fig 9e and f have symmetric e field distributions iv for the pcc probe all of the e field was distributed within the perforated cylinder and v radial e field attenuation was more significant in wet soil than in air e field distribution around the 2 pin fig 9a and b and 3 pin fig 9c and d probes indicates a potential for leakage to the air when used for the measurement of nswc because the intensity of e field leakage to the air will depend on both the installed depth of the 2 or 3 pin probes in the soil and on the variable water content near the soil surface consequently the measurement accuracies of the pin electrodes sensors could be reduced and poorly characterized the constant sensed volume of the pcc probe enables greater consistency fig 7 in contrast to the vswc dependent sensed volumes of the 2 pin and 3 pin probes especially at vswc higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 the more compact sensed volume of the 3 pin probe fig 9 enables greater measurement sensitivity inverse slope of the calibration curve 3 pin probe 2 042 pcc probe 1 781 fig 7 3 4 test of sensed volume by stepwise soil removal the differences among the sensor types in sensed volume and e field distribution are reflected in output responses to the proximity of the soil surface to the receiving electrode of the probe as soil above the sensor was removed there was no effect on the output of the pcc probe at either vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 or vswc 0 26 cm3 cm 3 e filed leakage from the pcc probe can be ignored when the probe is installed horizontally near the soil surface for measurement of nswc this result is consistent with the simulated results shown in fig 9e and 9f in contrast to the pcc probe the signal output and apparent vswc declined in the 3 pin and 2 pin probes when the distance between the receiving electrode and the soil surface was shorter than a critical value d0 indicating e field leakage to the air the critical distances for the 3 pin and 2 pin probes were about 8 mm and 11 mm at vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 respectively and about 7 mm and 10 mm at vswc 0 26 cm3 cm 3 for these probe designs the effective sensed volume declines with increasing vswc sun et al 2012 this is consistent with simulated results fig 9a d 3 5 accuracy comparison of the three sensors for nswc measurement based on the results shown in fig 10 the 3 pin and 2 pin probes may exhibit reductions in accuracy when the receiving electrodes are near the soil atmosphere interface to assess the measurement accuracies of the three probes fig 11 shows the time courses of nswcs 0 3 cm measured by the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes and the actual nswcs at the initial and final stages of the experiment 4 at the starting point of fig 11 the actual nswc was 0 183 cm3 cm 3 the nswc measured by the pcc probe was about 0 18 cm3 cm 3 an underestimation of about 0 003 cm3 cm 3 in contrast the 3 pin and 2 pin probes significantly underestimated the actual values about 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the 3 pin and about 0 029 cm3 cm 3 for the 2 pin probes this is attributed to leakage of the e field to the air from the soil atmosphere interface when the pin type probes were installed near the soil surface as nswc decreased from 0 183 to 0 102 cm3 cm 3 the underestimation due to e field leakage decreased from 0 013 to 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for the 3 pin and from 0 029 to 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the 2 pin probes the underestimation due to the e field leakage was reduced as nswc declined because air in the soil reduced the mixed permittivity to more closely correspond to the measurement that included leakage to the air above the soil atmosphere interface the pin structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface 4 conclusions in this study we developed and tested a dielectric sensor based on the fd principle in a novel perforated cylinder coaxial pcc configuration to monitor nswc a temperature sensor allowed correction for the temperature coefficient of both the circuit board and the permittivity of liquid water in the soil pores improving the measurement accuracy moreover the novel pcc probe has a symmetrical distribution of the e field wholly contained within the cylinder this avoids leakage of the e field into air at the soil atmosphere interface and removes the dependency of sensed volume on nswc in comparison the e field of both pin type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on vswc the pcc probe provided a more accurate measure of nswc than 2 pin and 3 pin probes because of e field leakage during near surface measurements future technical improvements are expected to include a range of probe diameters of the perforated coaxial cylinder for additional applications declaration of interests none acknowledgements we acknowledge

productivity here we develop a dielectric based frequency domain fd impedance sensor operating at 100 mhz with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board this perforated cylinder coaxial pcc sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content vswc and of temperature the temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water we characterize the performance of the pcc sensor and compare it with alternative 3 pin and 2 pin electrode fd impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board a series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted including i sensors calibration ii temperature effects and their correction iii soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal ssr test and iv accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the nswc measurements the calibration results verified that the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes were suitable to measure vswc rmse 0 0142 cm3 cm 3 the simulation analysis using high frequency structure simulator software hfss indicated that the novel pcc probe had a symmetrical distribution of the e field wholly contained within the cylinder avoiding leakage of the e field into air at the soil atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on vswc the results of the ssr test showed that the e field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the pcc probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on vswc i e up to 8 mm for 3 pin and up to 11 mm for 2 pin designs when vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 which corresponds to the simulation analysis moreover the new pcc probe provided more accurate nswc measurement than 3 pin or 2 pin probes because the e field was contained within the perforated cylinder avoiding e field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of vswc the pin structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface

ρb of 1 22 g cm 3 fig 6 and initial gravimetric soil water content of 0 15 g g 1 initial vswc of 0 183 cm3 cm 3 the three sensors probes together with housings were mostly buried with the receiving pin or cylinder of the pcc probe just at the soil atmosphere interface fig 6 the emitting electrodes red pins in fig 6 of the three sensors were all at the same depth 15 mm in the soil this configuration monitored the variations of nswc and temperature of the circuit board when the experiment was finished the tested soil was sampled in four places flanking the three probes at the depth of 0 3 cm fig 6 and oven dried to determine the final vswc the accuracies of the three sensors were assessed by comparing the sensor readings at the initial and final stages of the experiment with the initial and final nswc of the tested soil at the depth of 0 3 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 cross calibration of the 2 pin 3 pin and pcc probes the 2 pin 3 pin and pcc probes all yielded linear relationships between the vswc and sensor output fig 7 the vswc of the soil sample covered the entire range from oven dry to near saturation 0 0 41 cm3 cm 3 obtained by wetting and repacking the soil the r2 0 9978 of the pcc probe is marginally higher than those of the 2 pin 0 9913 and 3 pin probes 0 9947 and the rmse 0 00718 cm3 cm 3 is significantly lower 0 0110 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0142 cm3 cm 3 indicating greater precision 3 2 results before and after temperature correction the circuit board of the sensor exhibited a strong non linear response to ambient temperature fig 8 a over an operating range of 10 30 c the positive temperature coefficient was well described by a quadratic regression equation with high r2 0 959 and rmse of 2 6 mv this relationship allowed precise temperature correction of sensor output fig 8b shows a near step change in ambient temperature and a slewed rate of change of soil temperature along with uncorrected and corrected sensor output in this case soil temperature is inferred from temperature within the buried circuit board housing whose thermal properties differ from the soil direct measurement of tsoil when available may provide even better correction for the permittivity of soil water before temperature correction the uncorrected sensor measurement decreased as the soil temperature increased and they yielded a negative correlation even if the temperature coefficient of the circuit board was positive the rmse of the uncorrected sensor measurement was 0 0138 cm3 cm 3 the corrected curve green curve was acquired by first correcting the temperature coefficient of circuit board using the equation yielded in fig 8a and then correcting temperature dependent permittivity of water in soil with eq 9 after temperature correction the accuracy rmse 0 0026 cm3 cm 3 of the sensor measurement is significantly improved 3 3 test of sensed volume by simulation of e field distribution the e field distribution around the electrodes is closely related to sensor accuracy for nswc measurement electrode configuration has a large effect on the effective sensed volume of soil probes zegelin et al 1989 applying the hfss to the three sensor configurations with identical excitation demonstrates the expected e field distributions in air fig 9 a c and e and in wet soil fig 9b d and f it can be seen that i in general the 2 pin and 3 pin probes have larger effective sensed volumes in air than in wet soil a potential source of error related to vswc itself that has been previously identified sun et al 2012 ii the distributions of the e field around the electrodes for the 2 pin probe are asymmetric fig 9a and b whereas iii both the 3 pin probe fig 9c and d and the pcc probe fig 9e and f have symmetric e field distributions iv for the pcc probe all of the e field was distributed within the perforated cylinder and v radial e field attenuation was more significant in wet soil than in air e field distribution around the 2 pin fig 9a and b and 3 pin fig 9c and d probes indicates a potential for leakage to the air when used for the measurement of nswc because the intensity of e field leakage to the air will depend on both the installed depth of the 2 or 3 pin probes in the soil and on the variable water content near the soil surface consequently the measurement accuracies of the pin electrodes sensors could be reduced and poorly characterized the constant sensed volume of the pcc probe enables greater consistency fig 7 in contrast to the vswc dependent sensed volumes of the 2 pin and 3 pin probes especially at vswc higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 the more compact sensed volume of the 3 pin probe fig 9 enables greater measurement sensitivity inverse slope of the calibration curve 3 pin probe 2 042 pcc probe 1 781 fig 7 3 4 test of sensed volume by stepwise soil removal the differences among the sensor types in sensed volume and e field distribution are reflected in output responses to the proximity of the soil surface to the receiving electrode of the probe as soil above the sensor was removed there was no effect on the output of the pcc probe at either vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 or vswc 0 26 cm3 cm 3 e filed leakage from the pcc probe can be ignored when the probe is installed horizontally near the soil surface for measurement of nswc this result is consistent with the simulated results shown in fig 9e and 9f in contrast to the pcc probe the signal output and apparent vswc declined in the 3 pin and 2 pin probes when the distance between the receiving electrode and the soil surface was shorter than a critical value d0 indicating e field leakage to the air the critical distances for the 3 pin and 2 pin probes were about 8 mm and 11 mm at vswc 0 17 cm3 cm 3 respectively and about 7 mm and 10 mm at vswc 0 26 cm3 cm 3 for these probe designs the effective sensed volume declines with increasing vswc sun et al 2012 this is consistent with simulated results fig 9a d 3 5 accuracy comparison of the three sensors for nswc measurement based on the results shown in fig 10 the 3 pin and 2 pin probes may exhibit reductions in accuracy when the receiving electrodes are near the soil atmosphere interface to assess the measurement accuracies of the three probes fig 11 shows the time courses of nswcs 0 3 cm measured by the pcc 3 pin and 2 pin probes and the actual nswcs at the initial and final stages of the experiment 4 at the starting point of fig 11 the actual nswc was 0 183 cm3 cm 3 the nswc measured by the pcc probe was about 0 18 cm3 cm 3 an underestimation of about 0 003 cm3 cm 3 in contrast the 3 pin and 2 pin probes significantly underestimated the actual values about 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the 3 pin and about 0 029 cm3 cm 3 for the 2 pin probes this is attributed to leakage of the e field to the air from the soil atmosphere interface when the pin type probes were installed near the soil surface as nswc decreased from 0 183 to 0 102 cm3 cm 3 the underestimation due to e field leakage decreased from 0 013 to 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for the 3 pin and from 0 029 to 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the 2 pin probes the underestimation due to the e field leakage was reduced as nswc declined because air in the soil reduced the mixed permittivity to more closely correspond to the measurement that included leakage to the air above the soil atmosphere interface the pin structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface 4 conclusions in this study we developed and tested a dielectric sensor based on the fd principle in a novel perforated cylinder coaxial pcc configuration to monitor nswc a temperature sensor allowed correction for the temperature coefficient of both the circuit board and the permittivity of liquid water in the soil pores improving the measurement accuracy moreover the novel pcc probe has a symmetrical distribution of the e field wholly contained within the cylinder this avoids leakage of the e field into air at the soil atmosphere interface and removes the dependency of sensed volume on nswc in comparison the e field of both pin type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on vswc the pcc probe provided a more accurate measure of nswc than 2 pin and 3 pin probes because of e field leakage during near surface measurements future technical improvements are expected to include a range of probe diameters of the perforated coaxial cylinder for additional applications declaration of interests none acknowledgements we acknowledge

6549,transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon doc in rivers are important aspects of the carbon cycle and the critical linkage between terrestrial aquatic and marine systems recent studies have quantified fluvial export to the marine environment in many systems but in stream losses of doc are poorly constrained this study compares doc yields kg c ha between the area weighted averages of several tributaries within larger watersheds with the doc yields of the larger watersheds to gain insight on in stream losses in larger river systems four large watersheds 22 tributaries to those watersheds and 5 additional main stem locations in maine were studied during 1 april to 15 november in 2011 through 2013 there were no significant differences in the area weighted average doc yield of the tributaries and the larger watersheds indicating little net in stream loss in the main stems of the larger rivers it is unlikely that inputs of doc from un gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries based on similarity in doc yield longitudinally along the main stems of two of the rivers in addition wetland abundance which is associated with higher doc yield in this environment did not consistently increase from tributaries to the larger watershed or longitudinally along the main stems this geographic distribution of wetlands therefore also indicates that it is unlikely that inputs of doc from un gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries these findings suggest that in stream losses of doc in these larger river systems are minimal and that the vast majority of doc in major rivers in maine is transported conservatively to the coastal ocean keywords dissolved organic carbon carbon yield fluvial carbon export conservative transport organic carbon uptake velocity freshwater carbon dynamics 1 introduction understanding the fate of dissolved organic carbon doc in aquatic systems during transport to the marine environment has become critically important in global change science benner et al 2004 bianchi 2011 fichot and benner 2014 kaplan and cory 2016 rivers transport freshwater nutrients and doc to the oceans linking terrestrial estuarine and marine carbon cycling richey 2004 there is substantial uncertainty in the fate of doc in stream and river systems raymond and bauer 2001 raymond et al 2004 lauerwald et al 2012 several processes can influence the fate of doc in rivers and associated impoundments including burial in sediments photooxidation and microbial decomposition heterotrophy resulting in evasion to the atmosphere battin et al 2008 the fate of doc in aquatic systems is also influenced by residence time temnerud et al 2007 agren et al 2014 kothawala et al 2015 the nature of the doc casas ruiz et al 2017 catalán et al 2018 and may be influenced by other factors noted by casas ruiz et al 2017 including availability of nutrients microbial community composition temperature irradiance and interaction with dissolved metals several recent studies have reported estimates of in stream losses of doc representing up to 50 of the doc that entered the streams jonsson et al 2007 lauerwald et al 2012 worrall et al 2012 tiwari et al 2014 however much smaller losses have also been reported in some areas maranger et al 2005 lauerwald et al 2012 wollheim et al 2015 kothawala et al 2015 in other areas both losses and gains have been reported palmer et al 2016 butturini et al 2016 casas ruiz et al 2017 understanding the fate of doc in rivers and streams and how changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions could influence net removal could be important for determining the causes of reported trends in doc concentrations in rivers and lakes stoddard et al 2003 burns et al 2006 erlandsson et al 2008 sarkkola et al 2009 clair et al 2011 monteith et al 2014 and in riverine export of doc tranvik and jansson 2002 worrall and burt 2007 freeman et al 2001 monteith et al 2007 huntington et al 2016 changes in the export of doc could influence various processes including sequestration of organic carbon on continental shelves chen 2010 primary productivity in the near coastal ocean balch et al 2012 2016 remote sensing of ocean color mobley 1994 and formation of disinfection byproducts during water treatment fujii et al 2001 microbial decomposition of doc in streams and rivers and subsequent evasion of co2 to the atmosphere can be quantitatively important in regional carbon accounting butman et al 2016 the methods used to estimate in stream losses are not well constrained for several reasons some studies have relied in large part on estimates of co2 evasion e g cole et al 2007 jonsson et al 2007 that includes co2 derived from a variety of sources including soil respiration and subsequent transport of dissolved co2 to streams bacterial respiration of autochthonous doc as well as allochthonous doc and root respiration from riparian vegetation cole et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 butman and raymond 2011 abril et al 2014 many studies have used simple organic compounds of leaf and tissue leachates in carbon addition experiments to estimate decomposition rates in streams wiegner et al 2005 newbold et al 2006 kaplan et al 2008 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 johnson and tank 2009 decomposition of these simple compounds is likely to be much faster than decomposition of naturally occurring doc because they are far more labile possibly resulting in overestimation of in stream loss fellman et al 2009 used soil leachates in experimental additions but even in this case it is not clear whether these leachates are truly representative of naturally occurring doc in streams that have undergone transformations during transport to streams modeling these processes is inherently problematic because of the site specific characteristics of doc quality along a continuum of labile to recalcitrant and local climatic and hydrologic conditions the fraction of doc transported in rivers that is of terrestrial origin is not known however terrestrially derived humic substances constitute the majority of the doc pool in rivers and streams thurman 1985 webster and meyer 1997 raymond and bauer 2001 benner 2003 there is little direct evidence of substantial transformation of terrestrially derived doc in temperate rivers hanley et al 2013 wollheim et al 2015 biodegradation of doc is thought to decline from headwaters to larger rivers vannote et al 1980 battin et al 2008 this linear progression implicit in the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity creed et al 2008 where variable doc sources and flowpaths influence carbon cycle dynamics this study addresses the processes that influence doc in larger rivers therefore the evolution of doc in terms of chemical quality and carbon yield from headwaters to larger rivers is not considered we employed an empirical mass balance approach to assess losses of doc in river systems by comparing doc yields kg c ha unit time between tributaries nested within larger river basins and the doc yields of the larger basins and by comparing doc along the main stems of major rivers we hypothesized that if substantial in stream losses occurred then doc yields from the outlets of the major river basins would be lower than doc yields in their nested tributaries and at upstream locations on the mainstems this mass balance approach was designed to quantify net doc losses between upstream and downstream points in a river network this spatially explicit empirical approach does not rely on comparisons between smaller and larger watersheds in substantially different landscapes with different climatic regimes that assumes that processes acting on doc are similar across scales as was the case with the lauerwald et al 2012 study this approach cannot account for losses that occur in the streams above the tributary sampling points where the most labile highly reactive components may be removed therefore our interpretations are limited to the net transport of doc along the main stems of major rivers in maine our approach focuses on net losses of doc and does not account for inputs that are balanced by losses that could occur along the main stem between our measurement sites our primary objective was to calculate doc yields at multiple points tributaries and main stem locations in 4 major river systems to compare yields to determine whether doc yields decreased systematically from tributaries to the river outlets a secondary objective was to determine whether mean time of travel from tributary sampling locations to river outlets was related to doc yields we also tested hypotheses that the abundance of wetlands a known source of doc or the distance from the geographic centroid of a tributary sub basin could explain differences in carbon yields between the river outlets and upstream locations we compared suva254 a surrogate for aromaticity between tributaries and river outlets to assess whether there was evidence for major changes in aromaticity that could indicate replacement of allochthonous with autochthonous sources of doc finally we calculated doc uptake velocities mass transfer coefficients and uptake rates per unit area in the gulf of maine watershed river systems to relate our findings to recently published uptake velocities in other river and streams 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the major rivers in this study st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin have a combined discharge gauged area of 57 264 km2 and drain to the gulf of maine the climate of the study area is humid continental peel et al 2007 and precipitation ranges from about 0 9 m yr 1 to 1 2 m yr 1 with the highest precipitation in coastal areas precipitation is relatively evenly distributed seasonally cember and wilks 1993 annual runoff ranges from about 55 to 63 of rainfall inputs huntington and billmire 2014 the study watersheds are primarily comprised of forest land falcone et al 2010 table s1 the remaining land cover types are lakes reservoirs swamps and ponds and a small proportion 4 is in agriculture the abundance of palustrine wetlands varies from 1 to 28 of the land area for the tributaries and major river basins studied median 6 2 table 1 the abundance of open water lakes ponds and reservoirs varied from 1 to 11 median 3 9 land cover metrics vary among watersheds in this study table 1 s1 however they are comparatively similar in many characteristics in contrast to the widely varying watershed characteristics over 450 watersheds spanning canada south of 60 north latitude and the conterminous united states that were used in the lauerwald et al 2012 analysis additionally our comparisons of tributaries to the major rivers that they are nested within ensures more similarity in climate and landscape characteristics the differences between tributaries and the major rivers they are nested in generally are 10 to 15 for net primary productivity percent forest cover percent conifer forest cover soil organic matter content table s1 the percent of land in cultivated agriculture is quite small substantially 10 in all but two tributaries a previous study in the penobscot river basin showed that concentrations of doc typically ranged from 4 to 15 mg c l were lowest in winter and spring higher in summer and highest in fall huntington and aiken 2013 in that study the presence of impoundments in some tributaries was shown to dampen the seasonal variation in doc concentration in those tributaries we anticipated that the presence of large impoundments in some tributary basins might affect doc losses in those river systems for most tributaries and the main stem of the penobscot river there was a positive relation between discharge and doc concentration that is seasonally variable being highest in summer and fall but nonexistent in winter and during snowmelt in spring huntington and aiken 2013 2 2 data sources discharge data for most of the sites listed in table 1 were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system nwis online database https doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn the accuracy of daily discharge records varies by site in this study area but usually is rated good 95 of the daily record is within 10 of the true value stewart et al 2006 there is no evidence that errors in discharge measurement are biased in sign or temporally biased where record extension techniques were used to estimate discharge the uncertainty in discharge measurements increased and there is a potential for bias that we cannot quantify streamflow data quality record extension techniques used to estimate daily streamflow and methods for estimating instantaneous discharge have been previously described huntington and aiken 2013 huntington and billmire 2014 discharge for the penobscot river at eddington was not measured during this study so it was calculated using discharge data from the penobscot river at west enfield maine daily flow at eddington was calculated using a basic drainage area adjustment equation eq 1 1 q edd q enf a edd a enf c where qedd and qenf equal flow at eddington and at west enfield respectively and aedd and aenf equal drainage area at eddington and at west enfield respectively the usgs operated a continuous streamflow gaging station at the penobscot river at eddington from 1979 through 1996 we used the continuous flow data from the west enfield station to calculate flows for the eddington station during 1979 1996 and we then compared these data to the published flows at the eddington station and found the value for c to be 1 0 discharge for the penobscot river at eddington at the time of sampling was estimated using continuous 15 minute discharge data at west enfield a regression equation to estimate time of travel between west enfield and eddington and the area adjustment described above the regression equation eq 2 was based on an analysis of the differences in timing of peak flow between the two sites at different rates of discharge 2 t diff 2 4649 10 6 q enf 2 8 58 10 3 q enf 21 02767 where tdiff is the time in hours between peak flow at west enfield and at eddington the instantaneous flow at eddington at the time of sample collection was calculated as the flow at west enfield tdiff hours earlier times the drainage area adjustment basin wetland area percent open water land cover soil organic matter content surficial geology and net primary productivity in

usgs gov osw streamstats maine html accessed september 21 2016 the latitude and longitude of basin centroids were obtained from the gages2 database or the streamstats program accessed february 17 2015 and are reported in table s2 time of travel from sampling points on tributaries to the downstream gage on the main stem for each river system was obtained from the enhanced river reach file 2 0 erf1 2 https pubs er usgs gov publication ofr0240 accessed 8 25 2016 nolan et al 2003 time of travel is computed as the quotient of stream length and mean velocity time of travel in stream reaches and reservoirs are computed separately and summed if reservoirs are present the mean time of travel for a river basin was computed as the reach length weighted average time of travel for each of the tributaries 2 3 sample collection and analysis grab samples were collected approximately monthly during the ice free season 1 april to 15 november from 2011 to 2013 for the tributaries and the main stem sites table 1 fig 1 the tributaries are sampled at the stations where they are gauged near their confluence with the main stem of the major river samples were collected from fast flowing sections of the rivers using pre cleaned acid and deionized water rinsed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and refrigerated immediately samples were collected filtered and analyzed by the usgs or bowdoin college samples were filtered in the field within one hour of sample collection or after returning to the laboratory within 4 to 24 h of sample collection analyses of holding times prior to filtration indicated no measurable changes in doc concentration with holding times of up to 24 h samples were filtered using a pre rinsed 60 ml becton dickinson plastic syringe with luer lok fitting equipped with a pre combusted 25 mm 0 7 µm gf f filter whatman gf f or a 32 mm diameter 0 45 μm supor membrane filter syringe filters were in sealed polypropylene housings that were pre rinsed prior to use no differences in doc concentration were detected between filters samples were filtered into baked amber glass scintillation vials or bottles with teflon lined caps most samples were collected by bowdoin college refrigerated and stored in the dark and analyzed within 1 to 2 weeks or immediately frozen and then analyzed within 1 to 4 months samples collected by bowdoin college were analyzed using high temperature catalytic oxidation followed by non dispersive infrared ndir detection on a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer dickson et al 2007 the analytical error under normal conditions is a standard deviation of 0 1 mg c l 1 and a maximum coefficient of variation of 2 supplemental samples were conducted by the usgs at the main stem outlet gages for three rivers map nos 14 22 and 31 and at st john at nine mile piscataquis at dover foxcroft carrabassett at north anson and at wild river at gilead map nos 1 9 18 26 samples collected by the usgs were analyzed within 1 to 2 weeks of sample collection using the platinum catalyzed persulfate wet oxidation method on an o i analytical model 700 toc analyzer aiken 1992 in other studies we have observed a fairly consistent low bias 10 for the shimadzu determined doc compared with the o i analyzer when analyzing freshwater samples that have relatively high concentrations of humic acids that are characteristic of maine rivers this bias is consistent with that reported by singh et al 2016 for a forested headwater stream in north carolina no adjustments were made to the determinations from either laboratory however additional loadest regressions were performed to determine whether including supplemental usgs analyses would have resulted in substantial bias including usgs samples for the main stems of the penobscot kennebec and androscoggin rivers resulted in small positive increases in estimated doc yield of 2 7 3 3 and 1 3 respectively absorbance was measured in the ultraviolet and visible ranges on a hewlett packard model 8453 photo diode array spectrophotometer between 200 and 800 nm with distilled water as the blank specific uv absorbance suva254 defined as uv absorbance at 254 nm was measured in inverse meters m 1 divided by the doc concentration measured in milligrams per liter mg l 1 suva254 is a doc normalized absorption that indicates the nature or quality of doc in a given sample and has been used as a surrogate measurement of doc aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 the instrument bias for doc determinations would raise the shimadzu based suva254 by about 10 relative to o i based suva the suva254 data presented is based on samples analyzed for doc by the shimadzu only except for the st john river at ninemile where only o i based data were available we estimated seasonal average suva values using the loadest regression model runkel et al 2004 2 4 estimation of doc concentration and yield mean daily doc concentrations and yields kg c ha 1 season 1 were estimated using site specific regression models for each tributary and main stem gage location developed using the load estimator loadest regression model runkel et al 2004 the models were calibrated using discrete pairs of doc concentration and instantaneous discharge values loadest determines the best regression model based on aic akaike information criteria the approximate maximum likelihood estimator amle is used with loadest for calibration and estimation of daily fluxes and uncertainty the regression model implements sine and cosine terms to reflect the seasonality of constituent loads doc yields from the ungauged areas in each major river basin were estimated from the area weighted average doc yields from all non nested tributaries within each basin equation 3 3 tributaryareawieghteddocyield i 1 n t c i t a i i 1 n ta i where i is the index of summation for n tributaries tci represents each successive tributary doc yield and tai represents each successive tributary area the regression models were applied over the period for which we had discrete sample collections during 2011 through 2013 doc yields were calculated for the ice free season 1 april through 15 november uncertainty estimates in the loadest model determined mean daily load kg c day 1 and model bias diagnostics are reported in table s2 descriptions of the bias diagnostics were included in model updates in 2013 runkel 2013 that can be accessed from the url http water usgs gov software loadest doc bias diagnostics include concentration bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency index uncertainty in seasonal average doc yield kg c ha 1 season 1 was expressed as 4 uncertainty 95 c o n f i d e n c e i n t e r v a l 2 s e p 229 ha where sep is the loadest model derived standard error of prediction for the mean daily load for the estimation period 1

confidence interval the student s t test was used to determine the probability that doc yields were different between the tributaries and the larger river basins using an alpha of 0 05 as a threshold for statistical significance the nonparametric kendall s rank correlation test was used to test for the statistical significance of correlation between variables using splus software simple linear regression was also used to test for significance of the relation between doc yield wetland abundance and runoff using splus software the non parametric kendall theil robust line was calculated using ktrline software granato 2006 2 5 calculation of uptake velocity doc uptake velocity mass transfer coefficient was calculated from the measured net removal stream discharge stream length and stream width following wollheim et al 2015 using eq 5 5 v f h l l n r 1 where r is the fraction of incoming flux removed based on measured doc fluxes from the gauged and ungauged tributaries and the gauged main stem r 1 is the absolute value of r 1 v f is the uptake velocity m yr 1 and hl is the hydraulic load m yr 1 doc input fluxes from the ungauged areas in each river system were estimated from the area weighted average fluxes from the measured tributaries in each river system eq 6 6 r doc in doc out doc in the hydraulic load hl is a function of measured river discharge river width and river length using the expression in equation 7 7 h l q w l 229 where q is measured river discharge m3 d 1 w and l are river width m and length m and 229 is the number of days april 1 to november 15 mean length was calculated as the area weighted tributary average reach length and mean width was calculated as the reach length weighted tributary average reach length in this calculation of hl the river discharge at the downstream gage was used discharge is lower upstream therefore this overestimates the uptake velocity and thus is conservative in comparison to literature values the estimated uptake velocities reported for the major rivers apply to the entire reaches from the gages on the tributaries near the confluences with the main stem to the major river outlet on the main stem stream width w was obtained from the narwidth data set http gaia geosci unc edu narwidth accessed 8 24 2016 using the polygon selection tool in arcmap the narwidth data set does not report river widths 30 m and for a few tributaries stream widths were not recorded from the gauging station to the confluence with the main stems because along this stream reach the width was 30 m for these stream reaches we assumed a stream width equivalent to the average stream width between the gauging station on the tributary to the downstream gauging station on the main stem this assumption results in an overestimation of the benthic surface area and underestimation in hl however the estimation errors are 5 because these reaches are substantially shorter and substantially narrower widths 30 m than the path lengths on the main stems stream length l was obtained from the enhanced river reach file 2 0 erf1 2 https pubs er usgs gov publication ofr0240 accessed 8 25 2016 nolan et al 2003 the mean april 1 to nov 15 discharge at the downstream most river outlet gauging station on the main stem and the gauged tributary area weighted average w and l from gauging and sampling stations to the river outlet gage on the main stem were used to calculate hydraulic load there are several sources of error in the calculation of uptake velocity including estimation of discharge laboratory analytical error in measurement of doc concentration loadest calculation of doc fluxes error associated with the assumption that the doc yield from ungauged areas is equivalent to the weighted average of doc yield from gauged tributaries and errors associated with stream width and stream length estimation we have reported error estimates for loadest model error in estimation of doc fluxes and applied these errors to estimate error in calculations of uptake velocity table 3 these error estimates underestimate the true error because they do not include the other sources of error noted above that we cannot quantify the uptake of doc per unit area of stream bottom u stream solute workshop 1990 was calculated from the uptake velocity and the median concentration of doc from the sampling period april 1 to november 15 as estimated from using the loadest regression model runkel et al 2004 and using equation 8 8 u v f c 0 001 where vf is the uptake velocity m d 1 c is the median doc concentration mg c l 1 measured at the river outlet gage on the main stem and u is expressed in units of mg c m 2 d 1 in this study the uptake rate u is a measure of the net rate of removal biotic and abiotic along the course of the river network from the upstream gauging stations to the downstream most gauging stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc yields of tributaries in comparison to major basins the area weighted average doc yields from the tributaries and ungauged areas of the major rivers were all within 2 to 10 of the doc yields of their main stems fig 2 table 1 s3 the combined tributary areas accounted for 61 81 58 and 51 of the watershed areas at the gages on the main stems for the st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin rivers respectively there was no statistically significant difference in doc yield between the area weighted averages of the tributaries plus the ungauged areas and the major river basins that they were nested within using a student s t test p 0 05 the doc yields at the river outlet gages on the main stems of the st john 4 penobscot 14 and androscoggin 31 rivers were slightly greater but not significantly than the doc yields from their respective tributaries and ungauged areas table s3 suggesting some small net gains gains could come from ungauged sources or autochthonous inputs that were not quantified in this study doc yield on the main stem of the kennebec river 22 however was slightly lower than the yield on its tributaries and ungauged areas doc yields for the rivers in this study are relatively high in comparison to many other rivers in northern temperate regions we reported carbon yields for the ice free period ranging from 31 8 to 57 8 kg c ha season table 1 in a previous study huntington et al 2016 we reported annual carbon yields for three of these rivers androscoggin penobscot and st john rivers at the same downstream locations as were reported for this study as 43 8 59 2 and 65 1 kg c ha yr respectively earlier reports for temperate forests in north america and europe report average doc yields typically in the range of 30 to 50 kg c ha yr hope et al 1994 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 findlay 2005 ågren et al 2007 more recent reports from northern temperate rivers have also typically reported lower carbon yields in the range of 20 to 45 kg c ha yr buffam et al 2011 stets and striegl 2012 räike et al 2016 most studies that have examined factors controlling doc concentration or flux have found a stronger positive relation between amount of wetlands and the amount of doc exported than we found in this study e g frost et al 2006 ågren et al 2007 creed et al 2008 hanley et al 2013 runoff is also critically important in controlling doc yields tranvik and jansson 2002 raymond and oh 2007 dawson et al 2011 the fact that a weaker relationship between doc yield and wetland abundance fig 3 a was observed for the four rivers in this study could be partially explained by the fact that for all but the penobscot river there was little variation in wetland abundance table 1 so that other factors like runoff a function of precipitation slope and evapotranspiration time of travel and percent open water were more important doc quality as inferred from suva254 in these rivers in maine 3 5 to 4 5 l mg 1 m 1 table 2 is consistent with a comparatively high proportion of more aromatic compounds of terrestrial origin than are found in many rivers with more diverse land cover including more agricultural land spencer et al 2012 hanley et al 2013 spencer et al 2012 reported that the majority of the 30 rivers they studied throughout the u s had mean suva254 values between 2 00 and 3 80 l mg 1 m 1 spencer et al 2012 showed that colored dissolved organic matter cdom from the penobscot 14 and androscoggin 31 rivers had a low spectral slope and spectral slope ratio compared with most rivers throughout the united states indicative of higher aromaticity higher molecular weight and greater allochthonous sources for maine rivers than most other rivers in stream photosynthesis autochthonous doc can be a major source of the organic carbon transported in some rivers shih et al 2010 hotchkiss and hall 2015 however autochthonous doc is more labile and therefore more rapidly decomposed kellerman et al 2015 so it is likely less important in these rivers the differences in doc yields between tributaries plus ungauged areas compared with river outlets in the 4 river basins fig 2 was not related to the abundance of wetlands within each basin p 0 05 table 1 s3 these differences in doc yields were also not related to the area weighted average reach lengths or times of travel between the tributary gages and the river outlets p 0 05 table s4 the kennebec river 22 had about 10 lower average seasonal runoff 46 5 cm than the other rivers that ranged from 51 5 to 52 5 cm table 1 the seasonal doc yield 31 8 kg c ha yr was also lowest in the kennebec river basin it is not clear why lower runoff or lower doc yield would be related to the loss or gain of doc in the kennebec river doc yields were lowest from tributary basins having the highest area of lakes and reservoirs fig 4 a table 1 such as the kennebec at the forks 15 androscoggin at errol 24 and west branch of the penobscot river 6 consistent with earlier findings for the penobscot river basin tributaries huntington and aiken 2013 there was a significant p 0 01 negative correlation between seasonal carbon yield and percent open water fig 4a the trend towards decreasing doc yield with increasing percent open water was much less pronounced on the kennebec and androscoggin river systems these two rivers had lower carbon yields and longer travel times that may have reduced their sensitivity to losses associated with an increasing abundance of open water low doc yields from basins with higher areas of open water is consistent with the possibility of higher in stream doc losses in lakes and reservoirs where the residence time is substantially longer than in free flowing streams and rivers however unexpectedly suva254 decreased with increasing percent open water fig 4b which is not consistent with increasing microbial decomposition of more labile aliphatic doc fractions in lakes and reservoirs rather it suggests preferential loss of aromatic humic like doc fractions through photoxidation or gains in lower suva254 fractions like aliphatic compounds since presence of reservoirs is associated with an apparent decrease in suva254 and a reduced seasonal doc yield it suggests that presence of a larger amount of lakes and reservoirs is more associated with lower inputs of doc rather than in reservoir losses of doc when considering the entire basin or sub basin from the perspective of the main stem outlet stations the role of lakes and reservoirs as sources or sinks for doc for the larger basin is complicated by their locations in the basins the time of travel and the relative contribution of wetlands throughout the basin that supply preferentially more aromatic higher suva254 doc the influence of reservoirs and lakes on time of travel as a surrogate for residence time is evident in the longer times of travel in the kennebec and androscoggin rivers compared with the st john and penobscot river table s4 the relation between time of travel and doc yield for the non nested basins was highly variable among major rivers fig 5 there was no relation between these variables for the androscoggin and st john and rivers but in the kennebec and penobscot rivers doc yield decreased with increasing time of travel analysis of all basins in table s4 showed that the non parametric kendall rank correlation was statistically significant p value 0 02 tau 0 36 3 2 doc yields along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin rivers synoptic sampling to determine doc concentration and yield at four locations along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin river basins in 2011 through 2013 allowed us to determine whether there was any change in doc yield moving down river along the main stem basin area on the kennebec river increased from 4 118 sq km at the upstream most site kennebec at the forks map no 15 to 13 994 sq km at the river outlet gage kennebec at north sidney map no 22 basin area on the androscoggin river increased from 2 709 sq km at the upstream most site androscoggin at errol map no 24 to 8 451 sq km at the river outlet gage androscoggin near auburn map no 31 doc yield varied among the sites on each main stem table 1 28 5 to 31 2 kg c ha season for the kennebec main stem sites and 28 3 to 35 9 kg c ha season for the androscoggin river main stem sites but the differences were small compared with the average yields and there was no systematic decrease in doc yield from the upstream to the river outlet gauging stations for either river fig 6 the small increase in doc yield between the upstream most site on the main stem of the androscoggin river and the other downstream sites in this river basin is most likely a result of there being lower doc yields from upstream sub basins with a higher proportion of open water like the kennebec at the forks and the androscoggin at errol compared with most downstream sub basins that have substantially lower abundances of open water table 1 the increase does not appear to be due to a lower abundance of wetlands in the headwaters since the upstream most site has a similar or higher wetland abundance in comparison to the next two downstream sites table 1 the small increase could be due to in stream production of doc i e autochthonous doc there was a small increase in runoff along the main stem of the androscoggin river that may contribute to the increase in yield in that basin but increases in runoff moving downstream were not observed in the kennebec river table 1 the similarity in doc yield between tributaries and the main stems and synoptically along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin rivers is consistent with there being little net in stream loss between the tributaries and the river outlet gages on the main stems table 1 it is likely that some in stream losses are balanced by gains from autochthonous production production from sediments and allochthonous inputs between gauged tributaries and the river outlet gages on the main stems doc yield shows no consistent evidence of systematic changes moving downstream in these basins apart from the small increases from the open water rich headwaters in the kennebec and androscoggin rivers table 1 fig 6 the variability in doc yield among tributaries in a given river basin in a downstream direction can be seen in table 1 where the station ids are arranged in order from upstream lowest number to downstream highest number and the relative positions of the sampling locations in fig 1 3 3 the influence of wetlands on doc yields the abundance of wetlands in a river basin has usually been found to be positively related to the concentration of doc in stream water creed et al 2008 frost et al 2006 the relation between wetlands and carbon yield is more complicated because the potential for higher runoff in watersheds with lower wetland abundance can compensate for lower doc concentration a simple linear regression showed that doc yield was significantly related to the abundance of wetlands fig 3a p value 0 0001 adjusted r squared 0 42 the addition of runoff as a variable improved the regression and increased adjusted r squared to 0 57 regression not shown in fig 5a the non parametric kendall s correlation for the relation between wetlands and doc yield was not statistically significant at p 0 05 p value 0 066 however kendall s correlation for the relation between wetlands and doc yield divided by runoff was statistically significant at p value 0 01 the simple linear regression and the kendall theil robust line for wetlands versus doc yield are shown in fig 3a tributary and major river basin median doc concentration was significantly correlated p 0 0001 with abundance of wetlands figure s1 if a substantial amount of doc had been lost between the tributary gages and the main stem gage we would expect a lower carbon yield on the main stem unless the ungauged area contributed proportionately more doc the ungauged areas could contribute more doc if they had a substantially higher wetland abundance than the gauged tributaries the area weighted averages of wetland area for the gauged tributaries that are not nested within other tributaries are 6 90 10 8 7 15 and 3 29 compared with 7 83 11 45 7 43 and 4 78 for the entire st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin river basins respectively table 2 these area weighted gauged tributary wetland abundances are similar to those for the main stems but they indicate that the ungauged areas have slightly higher wetland abundances than the gauged tributaries therefore we cannot rule out some doc loss from the tributary inputs as shown in fig 2 that was compensated for higher doc inputs from ungauged areas with higher wetland abundances there was no relation between doc yield at the tributary gages near the confluence with the main stem and distance from those gages to their respective sub basin geographic centroids p 0 05 fig 7 if in stream loss were proportional to distance travelled where distance is a surrogate for residence time we would expect lower doc yields with increasing distance from sub basin centroids to the gages on those tributaries the lack of a relation between doc yield and distance is consistent with minimal in stream loss of doc in the tributaries themselves 3 4 suva254 of tributaries in comparison to major basins surface water suva254 is a surrogate for aromaticity that can be used to infer source of the chromophoric fraction of doc weishaar et al 2003 suva254 increased with increasing percent wetlands in the penobscot river basin but not in the other river basins fig 5b the average suva254 was variable among the tributaries ranging from 3 51 to 4 74 table 2 there was no consistent relationship between suva254 at the river outlet gage on the main stem and the area weighted average value for the tributaries table 2 in the two more northerly basins st john and penobscot rivers suva254 for the large river basin was slightly higher than the area weighted average value for the tributaries and the reverse was true for the other major river basins the slightly higher suva at the outlet gages on the st john and penobscot rivers may reflect proportionately higher inputs of allochthonous versus autochthonous doc in these basins and the reverse in the kennebec and androscoggin river basins similarly there was no significant difference in average suva254 values among the four main stem locations along either the kennebec or the androscoggin rivers figure s2 if the fraction of doc having lower suva254 was preferentially lost due to bacterial respiration we would expect to see increases in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem or along the main stem if the fraction of doc having higher suva254 was preferentially lost due to photooxidation battin et al 2008 between the tributaries and the main stem or along the main stems we would expect to see decreases in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem or along the main stems the fact that we do not see consistent changes in suva254 is further evidence that in stream losses of doc are small in these rivers and it is also evidence that autochthonous doc inputs are not replacing in stream losses of doc if autochthonous inputs of more aliphatic doc were replacing aromatic doc with increasing stream order as postulated by creed et al 2015 we would expect to see a decrease in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem outlet and moving downstream along the main stem but we did not observe this in our rivers we do not know the relative contribution of autochthonous doc to the measured bulk doc from tributaries to the river outlet gages on the main stems of these maine rivers however autochthonous doc is generally considered to be more labile and rapidly metabolized by bacteria than allochthonous doc del giorgio and pace 2008 guillemette et al 2013 suggesting that it is not transported conservatively furthermore the median suva254 values reported for the tributaries table 2 are consistent with dominance by allochthonous inputs rather than autochthonous inputs associated with microbial dominated systems such as certain lakes spencer et al 2012 and citations therein the lack of change in the chemical characteristics of doc based on suva254 and hydrophobic acid content in a comparable river basin in new england indicated that if autotrophic production occurs it is likely to be quickly respired so that downstream transport of autotrophic doc is less likely wollheim et al 2015 3 5 doc uptake velocity and time of travel average river basin doc uptake velocities were calculated from the differences in doc yields between tributaries and the main stem gages discharge river length and river width to compare with other published values the penobscot st john and androscoggin rivers had small negative uptake velocities indicating net in stream gains and associated negative uptake rates per unit area table 3 negative uptake velocities could be due to in stream or in reservoir production of doc i e autochthonous doc shih et al 2010 hotchkiss and hall 2015 however the absolute values for these uptake velocities and uptake rates are very small and the uncertainties are large enough that they are not distinguishable from zero no uptake or loss uptake velocity was not related to time of travel p 0 05 a positive uptake velocity and uptake rate per unit area was calculated for the kennebec river the positive uptake velocity indicates a loss of doc between the tributary gages and the river outlet gage on the main stem in the kennebec river the calculated uptake velocities are small in relation to most published values a wide range of uptake velocities have been reported in the literature frequently using different approaches but typically involving small streams or river reaches mineau et al 2016 the highest uptake velocities 0 005 to 0 47 mm s 1 were measured following the addition of simple compounds like arabinose or acetate at stream reach scales kaplan et al 2008 johnson and tank 2009 newbold et al 2006 mineau et al 2016 lower uptake velocities 0 000035 to 0 118 mm s 1 were measured with soil or leaf leachates wiegner et al 2005 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 mineau et al 2016 information on doc uptake velocities in larger rivers is limited wollheim et al 2015 used spatially distributed sampling and a river network and modeling approach to estimate uptake velocity of naturally occurring doc throughout a river network and reported an average uptake velocity of 0 00044 mm s 1 and an interquartile range of 0 00041 to 0 00048 mm s 1 mineau et al 2016 reviewed reach scale measurements of doc uptake velocity for a wide range of organic compounds including simple sugars acetate and leachates from leaves soil and manure and applied a correction factor based on doc bioavailability to estimate a median uptake velocity for ambient doc of 0 0043 mm s 1 the estimated uptake velocity that we estimated for the kennebec river 0 000354 mm s 1 table 3 was similar to the median value reported for the ipswitch river in eastern massachusetts wollheim et al 2015 within the ranges reported for leaf leachates 0 000033 to 0 118 mm s 1 and lower than the range reported for soil leachates 0 01 to 0 063 mm s 1 reported by mineau et al 2016 we estimated a range of mean seasonal doc uptake rates u in the four rivers we studied from 217 mg m 2 d 1 net removal or loss in the kennebec river to 1 644 mg m 2 d 1 net release or gain in the penobscot river table 3 most studies that have reported uptake velocities v f have not reported uptake rates u for the ipswitch river in eastern massachusetts wollheim et al 2015 reported a v f of 0 00044 mm s 1 and a median bulk doc concentration of 10 mg c l 1 which corresponds to a u of 380 mg m 2 d 1 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 reported a wide range of uptake rates 170 to 9800 mg m 2 d 1 for sugar maple and spruce leaf leachates in experiments where leachates were injected to a small headwater stream fellman et al 2009 reported uptake rates ranging from 1 640 0 t 3 470 mg m 2 d 1 for slug additions of soil leachates from upland forest wetland and bog soils to small streams in alaska our estimates that indicated negative uptake rates gain in doc rather than removal in the larger rivers we studied contrast with the uptake rates removal reported for leachates in small streams in injection experiments it is possible that a higher fraction of doc is removed in small headwater streams and tributaries before reaching our sampling points on the tributaries battin et al 2008 especially if as expected there are more labile leachates in these upper reaches higher losses in smaller streams might also be expected based on proportionately greater river length and benthic surface area in lower order streams of a river network ensign and doyle 2006 wollheim et al 2006 if in stream losses are disproportionately higher in headwaters then estimated uptake velocities in larger rivers would be lower than those of entire river basin networks however mineau et al 2016 found little relationship between stream size and uptake rate in their review of published studies on a variety of organic compounds time of travel residence time is an important variable to consider in comparing our results for uptake velocity and in stream loss or gain with other river systems longer residence times allow for more dynamic carbon cycling production and decomposition and thus time of travel is critical for understanding the fate of doc in rivers casas ruiz et al 2017 this is also consistent with storm induced decreases in residence time resulting in more conservative transport of doc during periods of high flow raymond et al 2016 individual large storm events can be very important in the seasonal or annual export and chemical nature of doc eimers et al 2008 raymond and saiers 2010 raymond et al 2016 loadest regression modeling runkel et al 2004 accounts for the influence of storms in terms of higher runoff volumes and in terms of variability of doc concentration during storms shorter times of travel and higher proportions of allochthonous more aromatic doc would result in lower rates of uptake in stream loss of doc during storms these storm related effects are accounted for in this study using loadest to model doc export at tributaries and on the main stem simultaneously the limitations in this approach are how well the sampling has captured variation in doc concentration during storms and whether the derived seasonal concentration discharge relation remains constant over the study period the mean time of travel from tributary sampling locations to the river outlet gage on the main stem was lowest on the st john river 1 78 d and highest on the androscoggin river 8 22 d table s4 time of travel increased with river reach length and when there were impoundments behind dams reservoirs there was no relation between time of travel from tributaries to the river outlet gage on the main stem and the differences in doc yield between the area weighted averages for the tributaries plus ungauged area and the larger basins p 0 05 fig 5 if there were significant in stream losses between the tributaries and the river outlet gages we would expect greater loss with longer travel times but we did not observe this these findings are in contrast to studies that have reported a positive relation between residence time and doc loss temnerud et al 2007 agren et al 2014 kothawala et al 2015 4 summary we found no evidence for substantial net in stream losses of dissolved organic carbon doc between the tributaries and the river outlet gages along the main stems of four major river basins in maine these findings contrasted with recent reports of up to 50 in stream losses of doc in major rivers and an emerging conceptual model of systematic changes in doc quality with increasing stream order conservative transport of doc in maine rivers may reflect characteristics of maine rivers that are different from rivers where higher losses have been reported for example 1 more recalcitrant doc 2 relatively short residence times where average slopes and water velocities maybe higher and stream lengths shorter 3 lower water temperatures and 4 fewer and smaller impoundments all of these factors would reduce stream heterotrophy and in stream loss by bacterial respiration of doc similarity in doc yield along the main stems moving downstream in two of the rivers indicated that it was unlikely that doc inputs from ungauged areas especially since these areas did not have a higher abundance of wetlands in the lower parts of the watershed compensated for upstream losses we have accounted for seasonal net losses or gains but we have not considered the proportion of carbon inputs that are balanced by measured losses in these rivers therefore we do not know whether there could be rapid cycling of autochthonous or labile allochthonous inputs but suva254 analysis suggests that changes in the bulk doc properties of these rivers is small and that in general autochthonous inputs do not replace allochthonous inputs moving down stream our results suggest that doc in major rivers in maine is transported conservatively and that aquatic carbon cycling has little net effect on lateral

6549,transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon doc in rivers are important aspects of the carbon cycle and the critical linkage between terrestrial aquatic and marine systems recent studies have quantified fluvial export to the marine environment in many systems but in stream losses of doc are poorly constrained this study compares doc yields kg c ha between the area weighted averages of several tributaries within larger watersheds with the doc yields of the larger watersheds to gain insight on in stream losses in larger river systems four large watersheds 22 tributaries to those watersheds and 5 additional main stem locations in maine were studied during 1 april to 15 november in 2011 through 2013 there were no significant differences in the area weighted average doc yield of the tributaries and the larger watersheds indicating little net in stream loss in the main stems of the larger rivers it is unlikely that inputs of doc from un gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries based on similarity in doc yield longitudinally along the main stems of two of the rivers in addition wetland abundance which is associated with higher doc yield in this environment did not consistently increase from tributaries to the larger watershed or longitudinally along the main stems this geographic distribution of wetlands therefore also indicates that it is unlikely that inputs of doc from un gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries these findings suggest that in stream losses of doc in these larger river systems are minimal and that the vast majority of doc in major rivers in maine is transported conservatively to the coastal ocean keywords dissolved organic carbon carbon yield fluvial carbon export conservative transport organic carbon uptake velocity freshwater carbon dynamics 1 introduction understanding the fate of dissolved organic carbon doc in aquatic systems during transport to the marine environment has become critically important in global change science benner et al 2004 bianchi 2011 fichot and benner 2014 kaplan and cory 2016 rivers transport freshwater nutrients and doc to the oceans linking terrestrial estuarine and marine carbon cycling richey 2004 there is substantial uncertainty in the fate of doc in stream and river systems raymond and bauer 2001 raymond et al 2004 lauerwald et al 2012 several processes can influence the fate of doc in rivers and associated impoundments including burial in sediments photooxidation and microbial decomposition heterotrophy resulting in evasion to the atmosphere battin et al 2008 the fate of doc in aquatic systems is also influenced by residence time temnerud et al 2007 agren et al 2014 kothawala et al 2015 the nature of the doc casas ruiz et al 2017 catalán et al 2018 and may be influenced by other factors noted by casas ruiz et al 2017 including availability of nutrients microbial community composition temperature irradiance and interaction with dissolved metals several recent studies have reported estimates of in stream losses of doc representing up to 50 of the doc that entered the streams jonsson et al 2007 lauerwald et al 2012 worrall et al 2012 tiwari et al 2014 however much smaller losses have also been reported in some areas maranger et al 2005 lauerwald et al 2012 wollheim et al 2015 kothawala et al 2015 in other areas both losses and gains have been reported palmer et al 2016 butturini et al 2016 casas ruiz et al 2017 understanding the fate of doc in rivers and streams and how changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions could influence net removal could be important for determining the causes of reported trends in doc concentrations in rivers and lakes stoddard et al 2003 burns et al 2006 erlandsson et al 2008 sarkkola et al 2009 clair et al 2011 monteith et al 2014 and in riverine export of doc tranvik and jansson 2002 worrall and burt 2007 freeman et al 2001 monteith et al 2007 huntington et al 2016 changes in the export of doc could influence various processes including sequestration of organic carbon on continental shelves chen 2010 primary productivity in the near coastal ocean balch et al 2012 2016 remote sensing of ocean color mobley 1994 and formation of disinfection byproducts during water treatment fujii et al 2001 microbial decomposition of doc in streams and rivers and subsequent evasion of co2 to the atmosphere can be quantitatively important in regional carbon accounting butman et al 2016 the methods used to estimate in stream losses are not well constrained for several reasons some studies have relied in large part on estimates of co2 evasion e g cole et al 2007 jonsson et al 2007 that includes co2 derived from a variety of sources including soil respiration and subsequent transport of dissolved co2 to streams bacterial respiration of autochthonous doc as well as allochthonous doc and root respiration from riparian vegetation cole et al 2007 aufdenkampe et al 2011 butman and raymond 2011 abril et al 2014 many studies have used simple organic compounds of leaf and tissue leachates in carbon addition experiments to estimate decomposition rates in streams wiegner et al 2005 newbold et al 2006 kaplan et al 2008 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 johnson and tank 2009 decomposition of these simple compounds is likely to be much faster than decomposition of naturally occurring doc because they are far more labile possibly resulting in overestimation of in stream loss fellman et al 2009 used soil leachates in experimental additions but even in this case it is not clear whether these leachates are truly representative of naturally occurring doc in streams that have undergone transformations during transport to streams modeling these processes is inherently problematic because of the site specific characteristics of doc quality along a continuum of labile to recalcitrant and local climatic and hydrologic conditions the fraction of doc transported in rivers that is of terrestrial origin is not known however terrestrially derived humic substances constitute the majority of the doc pool in rivers and streams thurman 1985 webster and meyer 1997 raymond and bauer 2001 benner 2003 there is little direct evidence of substantial transformation of terrestrially derived doc in temperate rivers hanley et al 2013 wollheim et al 2015 biodegradation of doc is thought to decline from headwaters to larger rivers vannote et al 1980 battin et al 2008 this linear progression implicit in the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 is complicated by spatial and temporal heterogeneity creed et al 2008 where variable doc sources and flowpaths influence carbon cycle dynamics this study addresses the processes that influence doc in larger rivers therefore the evolution of doc in terms of chemical quality and carbon yield from headwaters to larger rivers is not considered we employed an empirical mass balance approach to assess losses of doc in river systems by comparing doc yields kg c ha unit time between tributaries nested within larger river basins and the doc yields of the larger basins and by comparing doc along the main stems of major rivers we hypothesized that if substantial in stream losses occurred then doc yields from the outlets of the major river basins would be lower than doc yields in their nested tributaries and at upstream locations on the mainstems this mass balance approach was designed to quantify net doc losses between upstream and downstream points in a river network this spatially explicit empirical approach does not rely on comparisons between smaller and larger watersheds in substantially different landscapes with different climatic regimes that assumes that processes acting on doc are similar across scales as was the case with the lauerwald et al 2012 study this approach cannot account for losses that occur in the streams above the tributary sampling points where the most labile highly reactive components may be removed therefore our interpretations are limited to the net transport of doc along the main stems of major rivers in maine our approach focuses on net losses of doc and does not account for inputs that are balanced by losses that could occur along the main stem between our measurement sites our primary objective was to calculate doc yields at multiple points tributaries and main stem locations in 4 major river systems to compare yields to determine whether doc yields decreased systematically from tributaries to the river outlets a secondary objective was to determine whether mean time of travel from tributary sampling locations to river outlets was related to doc yields we also tested hypotheses that the abundance of wetlands a known source of doc or the distance from the geographic centroid of a tributary sub basin could explain differences in carbon yields between the river outlets and upstream locations we compared suva254 a surrogate for aromaticity between tributaries and river outlets to assess whether there was evidence for major changes in aromaticity that could indicate replacement of allochthonous with autochthonous sources of doc finally we calculated doc uptake velocities mass transfer coefficients and uptake rates per unit area in the gulf of maine watershed river systems to relate our findings to recently published uptake velocities in other river and streams 2 methods 2 1 description of study area the major rivers in this study st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin have a combined discharge gauged area of 57 264 km2 and drain to the gulf of maine the climate of the study area is humid continental peel et al 2007 and precipitation ranges from about 0 9 m yr 1 to 1 2 m yr 1 with the highest precipitation in coastal areas precipitation is relatively evenly distributed seasonally cember and wilks 1993 annual runoff ranges from about 55 to 63 of rainfall inputs huntington and billmire 2014 the study watersheds are primarily comprised of forest land falcone et al 2010 table s1 the remaining land cover types are lakes reservoirs swamps and ponds and a small proportion 4 is in agriculture the abundance of palustrine wetlands varies from 1 to 28 of the land area for the tributaries and major river basins studied median 6 2 table 1 the abundance of open water lakes ponds and reservoirs varied from 1 to 11 median 3 9 land cover metrics vary among watersheds in this study table 1 s1 however they are comparatively similar in many characteristics in contrast to the widely varying watershed characteristics over 450 watersheds spanning canada south of 60 north latitude and the conterminous united states that were used in the lauerwald et al 2012 analysis additionally our comparisons of tributaries to the major rivers that they are nested within ensures more similarity in climate and landscape characteristics the differences between tributaries and the major rivers they are nested in generally are 10 to 15 for net primary productivity percent forest cover percent conifer forest cover soil organic matter content table s1 the percent of land in cultivated agriculture is quite small substantially 10 in all but two tributaries a previous study in the penobscot river basin showed that concentrations of doc typically ranged from 4 to 15 mg c l were lowest in winter and spring higher in summer and highest in fall huntington and aiken 2013 in that study the presence of impoundments in some tributaries was shown to dampen the seasonal variation in doc concentration in those tributaries we anticipated that the presence of large impoundments in some tributary basins might affect doc losses in those river systems for most tributaries and the main stem of the penobscot river there was a positive relation between discharge and doc concentration that is seasonally variable being highest in summer and fall but nonexistent in winter and during snowmelt in spring huntington and aiken 2013 2 2 data sources discharge data for most of the sites listed in table 1 were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system nwis online database https doi org 10 5066 f7p55kjn the accuracy of daily discharge records varies by site in this study area but usually is rated good 95 of the daily record is within 10 of the true value stewart et al 2006 there is no evidence that errors in discharge measurement are biased in sign or temporally biased where record extension techniques were used to estimate discharge the uncertainty in discharge measurements increased and there is a potential for bias that we cannot quantify streamflow data quality record extension techniques used to estimate daily streamflow and methods for estimating instantaneous discharge have been previously described huntington and aiken 2013 huntington and billmire 2014 discharge for the penobscot river at eddington was not measured during this study so it was calculated using discharge data from the penobscot river at west enfield maine daily flow at eddington was calculated using a basic drainage area adjustment equation eq 1 1 q edd q enf a edd a enf c where qedd and qenf equal flow at eddington and at west enfield respectively and aedd and aenf equal drainage area at eddington and at west enfield respectively the usgs operated a continuous streamflow gaging station at the penobscot river at eddington from 1979 through 1996 we used the continuous flow data from the west enfield station to calculate flows for the eddington station during 1979 1996 and we then compared these data to the published flows at the eddington station and found the value for c to be 1 0 discharge for the penobscot river at eddington at the time of sampling was estimated using continuous 15 minute discharge data at west enfield a regression equation to estimate time of travel between west enfield and eddington and the area adjustment described above the regression equation eq 2 was based on an analysis of the differences in timing of peak flow between the two sites at different rates of discharge 2 t diff 2 4649 10 6 q enf 2 8 58 10 3 q enf 21 02767 where tdiff is the time in hours between peak flow at west enfield and at eddington the instantaneous flow at eddington at the time of sample collection was calculated as the flow at west enfield tdiff hours earlier times the drainage area adjustment basin wetland area percent open water land cover soil organic matter content surficial geology and net primary productivity in each basin was obtained primarily from the gages2 database falcone et al 2010 and in a few cases from the streamstats data base u s geological survey 2012 the streamstats program online at http water usgs gov osw streamstats maine html accessed september 21 2016 the latitude and longitude of basin centroids were obtained from the gages2 database or the streamstats program accessed february 17 2015 and are reported in table s2 time of travel from sampling points on tributaries to the downstream gage on the main stem for each river system was obtained from the enhanced river reach file 2 0 erf1 2 https pubs er usgs gov publication ofr0240 accessed 8 25 2016 nolan et al 2003 time of travel is computed as the quotient of stream length and mean velocity time of travel in stream reaches and reservoirs are computed separately and summed if reservoirs are present the mean time of travel for a river basin was computed as the reach length weighted average time of travel for each of the tributaries 2 3 sample collection and analysis grab samples were collected approximately monthly during the ice free season 1 april to 15 november from 2011 to 2013 for the tributaries and the main stem sites table 1 fig 1 the tributaries are sampled at the stations where they are gauged near their confluence with the main stem of the major river samples were collected from fast flowing sections of the rivers using pre cleaned acid and deionized water rinsed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and refrigerated immediately samples were collected filtered and analyzed by the usgs or bowdoin college samples were filtered in the field within one hour of sample collection or after returning to the laboratory within 4 to 24 h of sample collection analyses of holding times prior to filtration indicated no measurable changes in doc concentration with holding times of up to 24 h samples were filtered using a pre rinsed 60 ml becton dickinson plastic syringe with luer lok fitting equipped with a pre combusted 25 mm 0 7 µm gf f filter whatman gf f or a 32 mm diameter 0 45 μm supor membrane filter syringe filters were in sealed polypropylene housings that were pre rinsed prior to use no differences in doc concentration were detected between filters samples were filtered into baked amber glass scintillation vials or bottles with teflon lined caps most samples were collected by bowdoin college refrigerated and stored in the dark and analyzed within 1 to 2 weeks or immediately frozen and then analyzed within 1 to 4 months samples collected by bowdoin college were analyzed using high temperature catalytic oxidation followed by non dispersive infrared ndir detection on a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer dickson et al 2007 the analytical error under normal conditions is a standard deviation of 0 1 mg c l 1 and a maximum coefficient of variation of 2 supplemental samples were conducted by the usgs at the main stem outlet gages for three rivers map nos 14 22 and 31 and at st john at nine mile piscataquis at dover foxcroft carrabassett at north anson and at wild river at gilead map nos 1 9 18 26 samples collected by the usgs were analyzed within 1 to 2 weeks of sample collection using the platinum catalyzed persulfate wet oxidation method on an o i analytical model 700 toc analyzer aiken 1992 in other studies we have observed a fairly consistent low bias 10 for the shimadzu determined doc compared with the o i analyzer when analyzing freshwater samples that have relatively high concentrations of humic acids that are characteristic of maine rivers this bias is consistent with that reported by singh et al 2016 for a forested headwater stream in north carolina no adjustments were made to the determinations from either laboratory however additional loadest regressions were performed to determine whether including supplemental usgs analyses would have resulted in substantial bias including usgs samples for the main stems of the penobscot kennebec and androscoggin rivers resulted in small positive increases in estimated doc yield of 2 7 3 3 and 1 3 respectively absorbance was measured in the ultraviolet and visible ranges on a hewlett packard model 8453 photo diode array spectrophotometer between 200 and 800 nm with distilled water as the blank specific uv absorbance suva254 defined as uv absorbance at 254 nm was measured in inverse meters m 1 divided by the doc concentration measured in milligrams per liter mg l 1 suva254 is a doc normalized absorption that indicates the nature or quality of doc in a given sample and has been used as a surrogate measurement of doc aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 the instrument bias for doc determinations would raise the shimadzu based suva254 by about 10 relative to o i based suva the suva254 data presented is based on samples analyzed for doc by the shimadzu only except for the st john river at ninemile where only o i based data were available we estimated seasonal average suva values using the loadest regression model runkel et al 2004 2 4 estimation of doc concentration and yield mean daily doc concentrations and yields kg c ha 1 season 1 were estimated using site specific regression models for each tributary and main stem gage location developed using the load estimator loadest regression model runkel et al 2004 the models were calibrated using discrete pairs of doc concentration and instantaneous discharge values loadest determines the best regression model based on aic akaike information criteria the approximate maximum likelihood estimator amle is used with loadest for calibration and estimation of daily fluxes and uncertainty the regression model implements sine and cosine terms to reflect the seasonality of constituent loads doc yields from the ungauged areas in each major river basin were estimated from the area weighted average doc yields from all non nested tributaries within each basin equation 3 3 tributaryareawieghteddocyield i 1 n t c i t a i i 1 n ta i where i is the index of summation for n tributaries tci represents each successive tributary doc yield and tai represents each successive tributary area the regression models were applied over the period for which we had discrete sample collections during 2011 through 2013 doc yields were calculated for the ice free season 1 april through 15 november uncertainty estimates in the loadest model determined mean daily load kg c day 1 and model bias diagnostics are reported in table s2 descriptions of the bias diagnostics were included in model updates in 2013 runkel 2013 that can be accessed from the url http water usgs gov software loadest doc bias diagnostics include concentration bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency index uncertainty in seasonal average doc yield kg c ha 1 season 1 was expressed as 4 uncertainty 95 c o n f i d e n c e i n t e r v a l 2 s e p 229 ha where sep is the loadest model derived standard error of prediction for the mean daily load for the estimation period 1

confidence interval the student s t test was used to determine the probability that doc yields were different between the tributaries and the larger river basins using an alpha of 0 05 as a threshold for statistical significance the nonparametric kendall s rank correlation test was used to test for the statistical significance of correlation between variables using splus software simple linear regression was also used to test for significance of the relation between doc yield wetland abundance and runoff using splus software the non parametric kendall theil robust line was calculated using ktrline software granato 2006 2 5 calculation of uptake velocity doc uptake velocity mass transfer coefficient was calculated from the measured net removal stream discharge stream length and stream width following wollheim et al 2015 using eq 5 5 v f h l l n r 1 where r is the fraction of incoming flux removed based on measured doc fluxes from the gauged and ungauged tributaries and the gauged main stem r 1 is the absolute value of r 1 v f is the uptake velocity m yr 1 and hl is the hydraulic load m yr 1 doc input fluxes from the ungauged areas in each river system were estimated from the area weighted average fluxes from the measured tributaries in each river system eq 6 6 r doc in doc out doc in the hydraulic load hl is a function of measured river discharge river width and river length using the expression in equation 7 7 h l q w l 229 where q is measured river discharge m3 d 1 w and l are river width m and length m and 229 is the number of days april 1 to november 15 mean length was calculated as the area weighted tributary average reach length and mean width was calculated as the reach length weighted tributary average reach length in this calculation of hl the river discharge at the downstream gage was used discharge is lower upstream therefore this overestimates the uptake velocity and thus is conservative in comparison to literature values the estimated uptake velocities reported for the major rivers apply to the entire reaches from the gages on the tributaries near the confluences with the main stem to the major river outlet on the main stem stream width w was obtained from the narwidth data set http gaia geosci unc edu narwidth accessed 8 24 2016 using the polygon selection tool in arcmap the narwidth data set does not report river widths 30 m and for a few tributaries stream widths were not recorded from the gauging station to the confluence with the main stems because along this stream reach the width was 30 m for these stream reaches we assumed a stream width equivalent to the average stream width between the gauging station on the tributary to the downstream gauging station on the main stem this assumption results in an overestimation of the benthic surface area and underestimation in hl however the estimation errors are 5 because these reaches are substantially shorter and substantially narrower widths 30 m than the path lengths on the main stems stream length l was obtained from the enhanced river reach file 2 0 erf1 2 https pubs er usgs gov publication ofr0240 accessed 8 25 2016 nolan et al 2003 the mean april 1 to nov 15 discharge at the downstream most river outlet gauging station on the main stem and the gauged tributary area weighted average w and l from gauging and sampling stations to the river outlet gage on the main stem were used to calculate hydraulic load there are several sources of error in the calculation of uptake velocity including estimation of discharge laboratory analytical error in measurement of doc concentration loadest calculation of doc fluxes error associated with the assumption that the doc yield from ungauged areas is equivalent to the weighted average of doc yield from gauged tributaries and errors associated with stream width and stream length estimation we have reported error estimates for loadest model error in estimation of doc fluxes and applied these errors to estimate error in calculations of uptake velocity table 3 these error estimates underestimate the true error because they do not include the other sources of error noted above that we cannot quantify the uptake of doc per unit area of stream bottom u stream solute workshop 1990 was calculated from the uptake velocity and the median concentration of doc from the sampling period april 1 to november

at the river outlet gage on the main stem and u is expressed in units of mg c m 2 d 1 in this study the uptake rate u is a measure of the net rate of removal biotic and abiotic along the course of the river network from the upstream gauging stations to the downstream most gauging stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc yields of tributaries in comparison to major basins the area weighted average doc yields from the tributaries and ungauged areas of the major rivers were all within 2 to 10 of the doc yields of their main stems fig 2 table 1 s3 the combined tributary areas accounted for 61 81 58 and 51 of the watershed areas at the gages on the main stems for the st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin rivers respectively there was no statistically significant difference in doc yield between the area weighted averages of the tributaries plus the ungauged areas and the major river basins that they were nested within using a student s t test p 0 05 the doc yields at the river outlet gages on the main stems of the st john 4 penobscot 14 and androscoggin 31 rivers were slightly greater but not significantly than the doc yields from their respective tributaries and ungauged areas table s3 suggesting some small net gains gains could come from ungauged sources or autochthonous inputs that were not quantified in this study doc yield on the main stem of the kennebec river 22 however was slightly lower than the yield on its tributaries and ungauged areas doc yields for the rivers in this study are relatively high in comparison to many other rivers in northern temperate regions we reported carbon yields for the ice free period ranging from 31 8 to 57 8 kg c ha season table 1 in a previous study huntington et al 2016 we reported annual carbon yields for three of these rivers androscoggin penobscot and st john rivers at the same downstream locations as were reported for this study as 43 8 59 2 and 65 1 kg c ha yr respectively earlier reports for temperate forests in north america and europe report average doc yields typically in the range of 30 to 50 kg c ha yr hope et al 1994 mulholland 1997 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 findlay 2005 ågren et al 2007 more recent reports from northern temperate rivers have also typically reported lower carbon yields in the range of 20 to 45 kg c ha yr buffam et al 2011 stets and striegl 2012 räike et al 2016 most studies that have examined factors controlling doc concentration or flux have found a stronger positive relation between amount of wetlands and the amount of doc exported than we found in this study e g frost et al 2006 ågren et al 2007 creed et al 2008 hanley et al 2013 runoff is also critically important in controlling doc yields tranvik and jansson 2002 raymond and oh 2007 dawson et al 2011 the fact that a weaker relationship between doc yield and wetland abundance fig 3 a was observed for the four rivers in this study could be partially explained by the fact that for all but the penobscot river there was little variation in wetland abundance table 1 so that other factors like runoff a function of precipitation slope and evapotranspiration time of travel and percent open water were more important doc quality as inferred from suva254 in these rivers in maine 3 5 to 4 5 l mg 1 m 1 table 2 is consistent with a comparatively high proportion of more aromatic compounds of terrestrial origin than are found in many rivers with more diverse land cover including more agricultural land spencer et al 2012 hanley et al 2013 spencer et al 2012 reported that the majority of the 30 rivers they studied throughout the u s had mean suva254 values between 2 00 and 3 80 l mg 1 m 1 spencer et al 2012 showed that colored dissolved organic matter cdom from the penobscot 14 and androscoggin 31 rivers had a low spectral slope and spectral slope ratio compared with most rivers throughout the united states indicative of higher aromaticity higher molecular weight and greater allochthonous sources for maine rivers than most other rivers in stream photosynthesis autochthonous doc can be a major source of the organic carbon transported in some rivers shih et al 2010 hotchkiss and hall 2015 however autochthonous doc is more labile and therefore more rapidly decomposed kellerman et al 2015 so it is likely less important in these rivers the differences in doc yields between tributaries plus ungauged areas compared with river outlets in the 4 river basins fig 2 was not related to the abundance of wetlands within each basin p 0 05 table 1 s3 these differences in doc yields were also not related to the area weighted average reach lengths or times of travel between the tributary gages and the river outlets p 0 05 table s4 the kennebec river 22 had about 10 lower average seasonal runoff 46 5 cm than the other rivers that ranged from 51 5 to 52 5 cm table 1 the seasonal doc yield 31 8 kg c ha yr was also lowest in the kennebec river basin it is not clear why lower runoff or lower doc yield would be related to the loss or gain of doc in the kennebec river doc yields were lowest from tributary basins having the highest area of lakes and reservoirs fig 4 a table 1 such as the kennebec at the forks 15 androscoggin at errol 24 and west branch of the penobscot river 6 consistent with earlier findings for the penobscot river basin tributaries huntington and aiken 2013 there was a significant p 0 01 negative correlation between seasonal carbon yield and percent open water fig 4a the trend towards decreasing doc yield with increasing percent open water was much less pronounced on the kennebec and androscoggin river systems these two rivers had lower carbon yields and longer travel times that may have reduced their sensitivity to losses associated with an increasing abundance of open water low doc yields from basins with higher areas of open water is consistent with the possibility of higher in stream doc losses in lakes and reservoirs where the residence time is substantially longer than in free flowing streams and rivers however unexpectedly suva254 decreased with increasing percent open water fig 4b which is not consistent with increasing microbial decomposition of more labile aliphatic doc fractions in lakes and reservoirs rather it suggests preferential loss of aromatic humic like doc fractions through photoxidation or gains in lower suva254 fractions like aliphatic compounds since presence of reservoirs is associated with an apparent decrease in suva254 and a reduced seasonal doc yield it suggests that presence of a larger amount of lakes and reservoirs is more associated with lower inputs of doc rather than in reservoir losses of doc when considering the entire basin or sub basin from the perspective of the main stem outlet stations the role of lakes and reservoirs as sources or sinks for doc for the larger basin is complicated by their locations in the basins the time of travel and the relative contribution of wetlands throughout the basin that supply preferentially more aromatic higher suva254 doc the influence of reservoirs and lakes on time of travel as a surrogate for residence time is evident in the longer times of travel in the kennebec and androscoggin rivers compared with the st john and penobscot river table s4 the relation between time of travel and doc yield for the non nested basins was highly variable among major rivers fig 5 there was no relation between these variables for the androscoggin and st john and rivers but in the kennebec and penobscot rivers doc yield decreased with increasing time of travel analysis of all basins in table s4 showed that the non parametric kendall rank correlation was statistically significant p value 0 02 tau 0 36 3 2 doc yields along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin rivers synoptic sampling to determine doc concentration and yield at four locations along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin river basins in 2011 through 2013 allowed us to determine whether there was any change in doc yield moving down river along the main stem basin area on the kennebec river increased from 4 118 sq km at the upstream most site kennebec at the forks map no 15 to 13 994 sq km at the river outlet gage kennebec at north sidney map no 22 basin area on the androscoggin river increased from 2 709 sq km at the upstream most site androscoggin at errol map no 24 to 8 451 sq km at the river outlet gage androscoggin near auburn map no 31 doc yield varied among the sites on each main stem table 1 28 5 to 31 2 kg c ha season for the kennebec main stem sites and 28 3 to 35 9 kg c ha season for the androscoggin river main stem sites but the differences were small compared with the average yields and there was no systematic decrease in doc yield from the upstream to the river outlet gauging stations for either river fig 6 the small increase in doc yield between the upstream most site on the main stem of the androscoggin river and the other downstream sites in this river basin is most likely a result of there being lower doc yields from upstream sub basins with a higher proportion of open water like the kennebec at the forks and the androscoggin at errol compared with most downstream sub basins that have substantially lower abundances of open water table 1 the increase does not appear to be due to a lower abundance of wetlands in the headwaters since the upstream most site has a similar or higher wetland abundance in comparison to the next two downstream sites table 1 the small increase could be due to in stream production of doc i e autochthonous doc there was a small increase in runoff along the main stem of the androscoggin river that may contribute to the increase in yield in that basin but increases in runoff moving downstream were not observed in the kennebec river table 1 the similarity in doc yield between tributaries and the main stems and synoptically along the main stems of the kennebec and androscoggin rivers is consistent with there being little net in stream loss between the tributaries and the river outlet gages on the main stems table 1 it is likely that some in stream losses are balanced by gains from autochthonous production production from sediments and allochthonous inputs between gauged tributaries and the river outlet gages on the main stems doc yield shows no consistent evidence of systematic changes moving downstream in these basins apart from the small increases from the open water rich headwaters in the kennebec and androscoggin rivers table 1 fig 6 the variability in doc yield among tributaries in a given river basin in a downstream direction can be seen in table 1 where the station ids are arranged in order from upstream lowest number to downstream highest number and the relative positions of the sampling locations in fig 1 3 3 the influence of wetlands on doc yields the abundance of wetlands in a river basin has usually been found to be positively related to the concentration of doc in stream water creed et al 2008 frost et al 2006 the relation between wetlands and carbon yield is more complicated because the potential for higher runoff in watersheds with lower wetland abundance can compensate for lower doc concentration a simple linear regression showed that doc yield was significantly related to the abundance of wetlands fig 3a p value 0 0001 adjusted r squared 0 42 the addition of runoff as a variable improved the regression and increased adjusted r squared to 0 57 regression not shown in fig 5a the non parametric kendall s correlation for the relation between wetlands and doc yield was not statistically significant at p 0 05 p value 0 066 however kendall s correlation for the relation between wetlands and doc yield divided by runoff was statistically significant at p value 0 01 the simple linear regression and the kendall theil robust line for wetlands versus doc yield are shown in fig 3a tributary and major river basin median doc concentration was significantly correlated p 0 0001 with abundance of wetlands figure s1 if a substantial amount of doc had been lost between the tributary gages and the main stem gage we would expect a lower carbon yield on the main stem unless the ungauged area contributed proportionately more doc the ungauged areas could contribute more doc if they had a substantially higher wetland abundance than the gauged tributaries the area weighted averages of wetland area for the gauged tributaries that are not nested within other tributaries are 6 90 10 8 7 15 and 3 29 compared with 7 83 11 45 7 43 and 4 78 for the entire st john penobscot kennebec and androscoggin river basins respectively table 2 these area weighted gauged tributary wetland abundances are similar to those for the main stems but they indicate that the ungauged areas have slightly higher wetland abundances than the gauged tributaries therefore we cannot rule out some doc loss from the tributary inputs as shown in fig 2 that was compensated for higher doc inputs from ungauged areas with higher wetland abundances there was no relation between doc yield at the tributary gages near the confluence with the main stem and distance from those gages to their respective sub basin geographic centroids p 0 05 fig 7 if in stream loss were proportional to distance travelled where distance is a surrogate for residence time we would expect lower doc yields with increasing distance from sub basin centroids to the gages on those tributaries the lack of a relation between doc yield and distance is consistent with minimal in stream loss of doc in the tributaries themselves 3 4 suva254 of tributaries in comparison to major basins surface water suva254 is a surrogate for aromaticity that can be used to infer source of the chromophoric fraction of doc weishaar et al 2003 suva254 increased with increasing percent wetlands in the penobscot river basin but not in the other river basins fig 5b the average suva254 was variable among the tributaries ranging from 3 51 to 4 74 table 2 there was no consistent relationship between suva254 at the river outlet gage on the main stem and the area weighted average value for the tributaries table 2 in the two more northerly basins st john and penobscot rivers suva254 for the large river basin was slightly higher than the area weighted average value for the tributaries and the reverse was true for the other major river basins the slightly higher suva at the outlet gages on the st john and penobscot rivers may reflect proportionately higher inputs of allochthonous versus autochthonous doc in these basins and the reverse in the kennebec and androscoggin river basins similarly there was no significant difference in average suva254 values among the four main stem locations along either the kennebec or the androscoggin rivers figure s2 if the fraction of doc having lower suva254 was preferentially lost due to bacterial respiration we would expect to see increases in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem or along the main stem if the fraction of doc having higher suva254 was preferentially lost due to photooxidation battin et al 2008 between the tributaries and the main stem or along the main stems we would expect to see decreases in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem or along the main stems the fact that we do not see consistent changes in suva254 is further evidence that in stream losses of doc are small in these rivers and it is also evidence that autochthonous doc inputs are not replacing in stream losses of doc if autochthonous inputs of more aliphatic doc were replacing aromatic doc with increasing stream order as postulated by creed et al 2015 we would expect to see a decrease in suva254 between tributaries and the main stem outlet and moving downstream along the main stem but we did not observe this in our rivers we do not know the relative contribution of autochthonous doc to the measured bulk doc from tributaries to the river outlet gages on the main stems of these maine rivers however autochthonous doc is generally considered to be more labile and rapidly metabolized by bacteria than allochthonous doc del giorgio and pace 2008 guillemette et al 2013 suggesting that it is not transported conservatively furthermore the median suva254 values reported for the tributaries table 2 are consistent with dominance by allochthonous inputs rather than autochthonous inputs associated with microbial dominated systems such as certain lakes spencer et al 2012 and citations therein the lack of change in the chemical characteristics of doc based on suva254 and hydrophobic acid content in a comparable river basin in new england indicated that if autotrophic production occurs it is likely to be quickly respired so that downstream transport of autotrophic doc is less likely wollheim et al 2015 3 5 doc uptake velocity and time of travel average river basin doc uptake velocities were calculated from the differences in doc yields between tributaries and the main stem gages discharge river length and river width to compare with other published values the penobscot st john and androscoggin rivers had small negative uptake velocities indicating net in stream gains and associated negative uptake rates per unit area table 3 negative uptake velocities could be due to in stream or in reservoir production of doc i e autochthonous doc shih et al 2010 hotchkiss and hall 2015 however the absolute values for these uptake velocities and uptake rates are very small and the uncertainties are large enough that they are not distinguishable from zero no uptake or loss uptake velocity was not related to time of travel p 0 05 a positive uptake velocity and uptake rate per unit area was calculated for the kennebec river the positive uptake velocity indicates a loss of doc between the tributary gages and the river outlet gage on the main stem in the kennebec river the calculated uptake velocities are small in relation to most published values a wide range of uptake velocities have been reported in the literature frequently using different approaches but typically involving small streams or river reaches mineau et al 2016 the highest uptake velocities 0 005 to 0 47 mm s 1 were measured following the addition of simple compounds like arabinose or acetate at stream reach scales kaplan et al 2008 johnson and tank 2009 newbold et al 2006 mineau et al 2016 lower uptake velocities 0 000035 to 0 118 mm s 1 were measured with soil or leaf leachates wiegner et al 2005 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 mineau et al 2016 information on doc uptake velocities in larger rivers is limited wollheim et al 2015 used spatially distributed sampling and a river network and modeling approach to estimate uptake velocity of naturally occurring doc throughout a river network and reported an average uptake velocity of 0 00044 mm s 1 and an interquartile range of 0 00041 to 0 00048 mm s 1 mineau et al 2016 reviewed reach scale measurements of doc uptake velocity for a wide range of organic compounds including simple sugars acetate and leachates from leaves soil and manure and applied a correction factor based on doc bioavailability to estimate a median uptake velocity for ambient doc of 0 0043 mm s 1 the estimated uptake velocity that we estimated for the kennebec river 0 000354 mm s 1 table 3 was similar to the median value reported for the ipswitch river in eastern massachusetts wollheim et al 2015 within the ranges reported for leaf leachates 0 000033 to 0 118 mm s 1 and lower than the range reported for soil leachates 0 01 to 0 063 mm s 1 reported by mineau et al 2016 we estimated a range of mean seasonal doc uptake rates u in the four rivers we studied from 217 mg m 2 d 1 net removal or loss in the kennebec river to 1 644 mg m 2 d 1 net release or gain in the penobscot river table 3 most studies that have reported uptake velocities v f have not reported uptake rates u for the ipswitch river in eastern massachusetts wollheim et al 2015 reported a v f of 0 00044 mm s 1 and a median bulk doc concentration of 10 mg c l 1 which corresponds to a u of 380 mg m 2 d 1 bernhardt and mcdowell 2008 reported a wide range of uptake rates 170 to 9800 mg m 2 d 1 for sugar maple and spruce leaf leachates in experiments where leachates were injected to a small headwater stream fellman et al 2009 reported uptake rates ranging from 1 640 0 t 3 470 mg m 2 d 1 for slug additions of soil leachates from upland forest wetland and bog soils to small streams in alaska our estimates that indicated negative uptake rates gain in doc rather than removal in the larger rivers we studied contrast with the uptake rates removal reported for leachates in small streams in injection experiments it is possible that a higher fraction of doc is removed in small headwater streams and tributaries before reaching our sampling points on the tributaries battin et al 2008 especially if as expected there are more labile leachates in these upper reaches higher losses in smaller streams might also be expected based on proportionately greater river length and benthic surface area in lower order streams of a river network ensign and doyle 2006 wollheim et al 2006 if in stream losses are disproportionately higher in headwaters then estimated uptake velocities in larger rivers would be lower than those of entire river basin networks however mineau et al 2016 found little relationship between stream size and uptake rate in their review of published studies on a variety of organic compounds time of travel residence time is an important variable to consider in comparing our results for uptake velocity and in stream loss or gain with other river systems longer residence times allow for more dynamic carbon cycling production and decomposition and thus time of travel is critical for understanding the fate of doc in rivers casas ruiz et al 2017 this is also consistent with storm induced decreases in residence time resulting in more conservative transport of doc during periods of high flow raymond et al 2016 individual large storm events can be very important in the seasonal or annual export and chemical nature of doc eimers et al 2008 raymond and saiers 2010 raymond et al 2016 loadest regression modeling runkel et al 2004 accounts for the influence of storms in terms of higher runoff volumes and in terms of variability of doc concentration during storms shorter times of travel and higher proportions of allochthonous more aromatic doc would result in lower rates of uptake in stream loss of doc during storms these storm related effects are accounted for in this study using loadest to model doc export at tributaries and on the main stem simultaneously the limitations in this approach are how well the sampling has captured variation in doc concentration during storms and whether the derived seasonal concentration discharge relation remains constant over the study period the mean time of travel from tributary sampling locations to the river outlet gage on the main stem was lowest on the st john river 1 78 d and highest on the androscoggin river 8 22 d table s4 time of travel increased with river reach length and when there were impoundments behind dams reservoirs there was no relation between time of travel from tributaries to the river outlet gage on the main stem and the differences in doc yield between the area weighted averages for the tributaries plus ungauged area and the larger basins p 0 05 fig 5 if there were significant in stream losses between the tributaries and the river outlet gages we would expect greater loss with longer travel times but we did not observe this these findings are in contrast to studies that have reported a positive relation between residence time and doc loss temnerud et al 2007 agren et al 2014 kothawala et al 2015 4 summary we found no evidence for substantial net in stream losses of dissolved organic carbon doc between the tributaries and the river outlet gages along the main stems of four major river basins in maine these findings contrasted with recent reports of up to 50 in stream losses of doc in major rivers and an emerging conceptual model of systematic changes in doc quality with increasing stream order conservative transport of doc in maine rivers may reflect characteristics of maine rivers that are different from rivers where higher losses have been reported for example 1 more recalcitrant doc 2 relatively short residence times where average slopes and water velocities maybe higher and stream lengths shorter 3 lower water temperatures and 4 fewer and smaller impoundments all of these factors would reduce stream heterotrophy and in stream loss by bacterial respiration of doc similarity in doc yield along the main stems moving downstream in two of the rivers indicated that it was unlikely that doc inputs from ungauged areas especially since these areas did not have a higher abundance of wetlands in the lower parts of the watershed compensated for upstream losses we have accounted for seasonal net losses or gains but we have not considered the proportion of carbon inputs that are balanced by measured losses in these rivers therefore we do not know whether there could be rapid cycling of autochthonous or labile allochthonous inputs but suva254 analysis suggests that changes in the bulk doc properties of these rivers is small and that in general autochthonous inputs do not replace allochthonous inputs moving down stream our results suggest that doc in major rivers in maine is transported conservatively and that aquatic carbon cycling has little net effect on lateral carbon export by inland waters of what is likely dominated by terrestrially derived doc declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
