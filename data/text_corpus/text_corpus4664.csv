23320,in this paper detailed experimental results are reported to study the effect of the surface wave of different frequencies on turbulent characteristics of flow over a regular array of cubical roughness the velocity time series of current only and combined wave current flow is analyzed to obtain the distribution of first and the second order turbulence statistics turbulent kinetic energy production turbulent dissipation and kinetic energy fluxes at a fixed reynolds number to highlight the changes due to combined wave current flow a comparative study was made between the velocity profiles for current only flow and those measured for combined wave current flow as expected the rough profiles are shifted downwards with the amount equivalent to the roughness function δ u which was obtained directly from mean velocity profiles further the thickness of turbulent boundary layer increases with the superposition of surface wave compared to current only flow particular attention is also given to understand the behavior of kinetic energy flux to explicitly account for turbulent momentum transport characteristics over roughness under wave current interactions keywords cubical roughness open channel wave current turbulence rough bed 1 introduction flows observed in coastal environments are usually a combination of waves and currents the presence of surface waves are known to modulate the mean flow and turbulence field which results in an amendment in the momentum transfer flow resistance and sediment transport characteristics of the flow most of both experimental brevik and aas 1980 kemp and simons 1982 mazumder and ojha 2007 umeyama 2005 singh and debnath 2017a singh et al 2018a and numerical modeling grant and madsen 1979 olabarrieta et al 2010 teles et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 tambroni et al 2015a b developed in order to increase the understanding in wave current interaction had been taken over a flat surface in these studies the emphasis was given to examine the mean velocity profile and how it changes from the universal logarithmic law observed for current only flow they also reported the changes in the different turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress due to the superimposition of a surface wave on a uniform flow over a flat surface in addition the above mentioned works have contributed to the understanding of the subject comparatively little is known about the combined wave and current flow over the artificially covered rough bed despite the fact that such experimentally based information has great importance in practice the rough bed here investigated is covered with a relatively large array of regular roughness elements in this case regular large size vortices are routed into the main stream of the water in a classified manner both in space and in time in this respect mathisen and madsen 1996 have conducted experiments in a wave tank with triangular bars as roughness elements the height and spacing of these elements were chosen such that the bars simulated the ripples they mainly focused on apparent hydraulic roughness in the case of the combined flow and showed that the apparent hydraulic roughness was underestimated by the model proposed in grant and madsen 1979 fredsoe et al 1999 performed both experimental as well as the numerical study of the combined wave current flow over a ripple covered bed the ripples used in their work were symmetric davies and villaret 1999 proposed an analytical model to predict the eulerian drift that is caused by progressive waves over rippled or very rough bed ridler and sleath 2000 studied experimentally the eulerian time mean drift induced by progressive waves over the rough bed measurements were made in a laboratory flume with a laser doppler anemometer and two different two dimensional artificial bed roughness cases were investigated the measurements showed that the maximum value of the time mean drift velocity at the bed might be increased or decreased relative to the value predicted by longuet higgins theory for smooth beds dumas et al 2005 performed an experimental study in a wave current co existing environment to provide a better understanding of the genesis of the bedforms they reported that under low orbital velocity symmetric small ripples became progressively more asymmetric ojha and mazumder 2010 presented the results of an experimental study on the mean flow and turbulence characteristics over a series of two dimensional 2d bedforms in the presence of surface waves of different frequencies banerjee et al 2015 performed flume experiments on wind induced flow in static water bodies in the presence of protruding vegetation they reported that wave and turbulence effects are simultaneously produced at the air water interface and the nature of their coexistence is found to vary with different flow parameters including water level mean wind speed vegetation density and flexibility the more general case of waves superposed to uniform current flowing over a mobile sediment bed covered with vegetation has been addressed experimentally by tambroni et al 2015b direct numerical simulation of the oscillatory flow close to a wall covered with spherical roughness elements have been performed by mazzuoli and vittori 2016 with the aim to identify three flow regimes which are named the laminar transitional turbulent and hydrodynamically rough turbulent regimes they reported that the transition from one regime to the other depends on the reynolds number and on the diameter of the spheres covering the bed in nature the seabed is covered with 3 d ripples bars dunes and great variety of shapes and arrangements of roughness elements having small values of the roughness parameter a k s where a is the amplitude of the orbital motion at the bed and k s is the nikuradse s equivalent roughness which may be taken as 2 2 5k k being the size of the roughness elements dixen et al 2008 the behavior of wave boundary layer at small values of the roughness parameter a k s is important in connection with the investigation of the stability of rip rap scour protection in the marine environment where large size of ripples stones rock armour blocks inevitably leads to small values of a k s a k s o 1 or smaller as suggested by dixen et al 2008 in the present study array of cubes are used as a rough bed with values of roughness parameter similar to that observed in the seabed note that cubes are used in many experimental and numerical studies e g coceal et al 2007 florens et al 2013 with the advantage of having only one length scale thus a matrix of cubes is ideal for fundamental studies of the flow around roughness elements and above them such basic research may be useful in dealing with the morpho dynamics of alluvial rivers and may be transferable to more natural sea bed scenarios thus the experimental setting here employed allows for providing some understanding of the turbulence statistics due to combined wave current flow over the large bottom roughness without adding any difficulty in the measurement procedure therefore the aim of this study is to approach the problem experimentally by measuring the velocity field in a wave current coexisting environment on a rough boundary created by fixing a large number wooden cube with different relative spacing the vertical profiles of stream wise mean velocity and reynolds stress were obtained from the velocity data collected by an adv additionally turbulent energy fluxes and energy production for simple current and combined wave current flows are investigated the investigators are affirmative that the quantitative analysis reported in the present study will find wide applications in the area of the environmental hydraulics of rough bed flows and in the understanding of morphodynamic processes like sediment pickup grain sorting and sediment transport over the rough beds with variable spacing between roughness elements 2 experimental technique and procedure the experiments were conducted in the fluid mechanics and hydraulic laboratory of the indian institute of engineering and science and technology iiest shibpur india a specially designed flat bed open channel flume of 18 3 m length 0 90 m width and 0 90 m depth was used for the experiments fig 1 at the downstream section of the flume waterfalls freely into a large 37 m long 8 m wide and 2 m deep sump from where it is recirculated into the flume using a vertical turbine pump located outside the main body of the flume waves were generated along the unidirectional current by a plunger type wave maker placed at the upstream end of the flume the wave maker was connected to a variac in order to control the frequency of oscillation the basic details of wave maker and its working principle are reported in singh and debnath 2016 2017b the pump system circulated the water from the large sump and flow depth h 20 cm was kept constant throughout the experiments by adjusting the discharge valve and tail gate simultaneously for the experiments rough bed was prepared fixing to the bed a large number of artificial wooden cubes of side 0 025 m two different values of pitch length p centre to centre spacing between two consecutive cubes were chosen to achieve isolated roughness flow and wake interference flow perry et al 1969 the cubes were equally spaced along lateral and longitudinal directions so that the flow pattern repeats along the flume bed three different categories of tests were carried out in the present study 1 current only test over the plane bed 2 current only tests over the cubical roughness mounted on the plane bed with different spacing p k 5 and 9 where k is the cube height and 3 tests over the cubical roughness for different spacing p k 5 and 9 with superimposition of surface waves of different frequencies 1 and 2 hz on the main flow all the experiments were carried out in the fully developed flow region x 12 m downstream from the flume entrance where the flow was verified to be fully developed four different measuring locations a d were selected for p k 5 and 9 along the centreline of the flume as shown in fig 1 direct measurements of velocity were made using a sontek 16 mhz 5 cm down looking 3 d micro acoustic doppler velocimeter micro adv which has the precision of 1 cm s on a measured velocity of 100 cm s the velocity signals recorded by micro adv were always affected by doppler noise associated with the measurement technique the presence of this noise causes an aliasing effect that results in spikes in micro adv signals for turbulence studies it is important that the signal is filtered to remove doppler noise otherwise estimates of second and higher order turbulence statistics would be biased because of noise in signals in the present study the noise in raw adv data were processed by a phase space threshold de spiking method described in goring and nikora 2002 and implemented in the win adv software the adv velocity data were cleaned by removing the communication errors low signal to noise ratio data 15 db and low correlation 70 this was performed by win adv software and resulted in the removal of approximately 2 of all collected raw velocity time series such excluded signals were replaced by data using a cubic polynomial interpolation method singh et al 2017 the large noise in the velocity signal was removed by minimizing the possible aliasing effect near the nyquist frequency herein f n 20 hz 3 hydraulic conditions experiments were performed for constant flow depth h 0 2 m volume flow rate q 0 053 m3 s reynolds number re u h ν 58 800 and froude number f r u g h 0 21 where u 0 294 m s is the mean velocity ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of water and g is the acceleration due to gravity in the experiments the relative submergence was 6 5 h k 10 5 corresponding to the case of rough open channel flow with intermediate submergence nikora et al 2001 the wave length l w and wave amplitude a w have been calculated taking a statistical average of the values obtained from the analysis of twenty images of the water surface profile the quantity a w l w called wave steepness factor was then computed the wave steepness factor does not exceed 0 05 in nature banerjee et al 2015 and in all the experiments here performed is well below it furthermore in the present study we considered waves with frequencies f 1 2 hz corresponding to ratios of l w h 1 75 3 25 respectively falling within the range of l w h 1 25 and ratios of l w h 11 29 32 5 within the range of l w h 4 56 where h is the wave height these ranges of l w h and l w h are prevalent in natural wave conditions goda 2000 thus it may be observed that the wave characteristics used in the present study represent waves that occur in nature in terms of non dimensional parameters the amplitude a of the orbital motion at the bed and the wave length is calculated by using the formula from the linear wave theory as follows 1 a h 2 sinh 2 π h l w 2 l w g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π h l w the orbital velocity u a is calculated by u a a ω where ω 2πf is the angular frequency of the surface waves f 1 t is the frequency of the surface waves and t is the wave period and g is the acceleration due to gravity the value of wave length 1 20 and 0 39 m for f 1 and 2 hz respectively calculated using eq 2 overestimates the observed wavelength 0 65 and 0 38 m by about 45 and 2 5 for f 1 and 2 hz respectively in flume experiment a similar difference is also observed by banerjee et al 2015 and singh et al 2015 however in the present experiment the values of re h 23 814 it is to be noted here that re h is different from the above mention reynolds number re because the re value is calculated based on water depth whereas re h value is calculate based on hydraulic mean depth for comparison purpose only h l w 0 30 0 57 and h l w 0 030 0 08 are approximately similar to other flume based combined wave current flow studies for e g kemp and simons 1982 carried out experiments for combined wave current flow with re h 11 735 19 730 h l w 0

current under re h 11 455 and h l w 0 101 0 165 h l w 0 0154 0 0192 the experiment with wave frequency f 0 hz corresponds to the current only test various experimental conditions for current only test and combined wave current flow are summarized in table 1 to ensure the fully developed flow at the experimental channel velocity data were collected using a micro adv at seven different locations 4 10 m from the flume entrance over the cube mounted rough bed fig 2 shows the plots of normalized stream wise mean velocity profile u u 0 distribution for current only and combined wave current flow over a cube mounted rough bed at seven different locations for p k 5 the velocity is normalized using the measured maximum mean velocity u 0 in order to highlight the relative changes in velocity profile a comparative plot has been made between the velocity profiles at the plane bed surface without cubes and that observed over a cube mounted rough bed at different locations the solid curved line shown in fig 2 is drawn approximately by joining the points of intersection of profiles over cube mounted rough bed and the profiles over the plane bed the curved solid line clearly shows fig 2 the developing flow beyond 9 m from the upstream end of the flume and reaches to quasi state along downstream the developing flow over the cube mounted rough bed is more akin to the turbulent boundary layer tbl beyond 9 m which is similar to the finding of ojha and mazumder 2010 4 experimental observations and results 4 1 distribution of mean velocity for each run the collected instantaneous velocity data were used to derive mean and turbulence characteristics in the stream wise and wall normal directions at first instantaneous velocity data were time averaged and reynolds decomposition was applied thereafter the time averaged stream wise and wall normal velocities u w at each measuring point were computed as follows 3 u 1 n i 1 n u i 4 w 1 n i 1 n w i the vertical profiles of stream wise mean velocity components against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 3 together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison the velocity is normalized using the measured maximum velocity u 0 observed at the level of z h 0 55 for the plane bed case instead of the computed friction velocity u similar to roussinova and balachandar 2011 roughness has a strong effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it extracts the momentum inside the boundary layer which results in a decrease of stream wise mean velocity near the bed compared to plane bed profile for all the conditions studied here the result shows that at location c the stream wise mean velocity is negative for p k 5 for all three cases f 0 1 and 2 hz indicating the occurrence of flow separation and recirculation below the level z h 0 125 while for p k 9 the stream wise velocity seems negative only for f 0 hz case at f 1 hz the separation zone is shifted slightly upwards for p k 5 the upcoming flow is deflected more in the bottom normal direction with largest magnitude of the stream wise velocity is observed for a larger spacing p k 9 and surface wave frequency f 2 hz unlike the plane bed profile close to the rough surface z h 0 125 a kink in the case of p k 5 is noticed on the top of the cube whereas a kink in the velocity profile is not observed in case of p k 9 after a superposition of surface wave of different frequencies at locations a and d low stream wise mean velocity is observed compared to the plane bed for all cases as reported in fig 3 it is also revealed that close to the bottom the velocity profile is deflected more compared to a plane bed for p k 5 inside the cavity the shape of mean velocity profiles is smoother with no effect of local flow separation at locations a and d for both the spacing as well surface wave further at locations a d for p k 9 a decrease in the mean velocity profile towards the free surface is observed when compared to current only profile whereas towards the surface the mean velocity profile does not seem to influenced by the presence of surface waves for p k 5 the vertical profiles of wall normal mean velocity component against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 4 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison it is observed that for current only flow the wall normal mean velocity at location a for both p k 5 and 9 cases are almost zero but for wave induced conditions the velocity assumes no vanishing values it also revealed from fig 4 that near the surface for all the locations the velocity profiles do not change much compared to that of the plane bed if waves are absent whereas in both the cases of wave with f 1 and 2 hz case the velocity becomes negative indicating downward flow near the surface furthermore at location c for p k 9 the shape of the velocity profile is similar for both current only and wave induced cases i e velocity increases near the bed to the maximum value at z h 0 05 and thereafter decreases however at the same location for p k 5 the wall normal mean velocity starts with positive values in the region 0 z h 0 1 for all the cases and thereafter becomes negative for f 1 and 2 hz cases whereas for f 0 hz the velocity becomes equivalent to the plane bed profile these positive and negative values of wall normal mean velocity at location c imply that downstream of the cube two different regions are observed a region with upward moving fluid close to the bed 0 z h 0 1 and a region with downward moving fluid for z h 0 1 this is probably because near to the bed flow is affected by bottom roughness and away from the bed the flow is affected more by the presence of surface wave for current only case f 0 hz close to the surface wall normal mean velocity approaches that of the profile obtained for the plane bed case at both the relative roughness spacing p k 5 and 9 4 2 vertical distribution of reynolds shear stress the time averaged reynolds shear stress τ at each measuring point for a simple current f 0 hz case can be obtained as follows nezu and nakagawa 1993 5 τ ρ u w ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u w i w where n is the total number of observation at each measuring point and ρ is the density of the fluid similarly for combined wave current flow the reynolds shear stress for the phase averaged quantities can be expressed as follows kemp and simons 1982 umeyama 2009 singh et al 2018a 2018b 6 τ ρ 1 n c n 1 n c u t n t u t w t n t w t 0 t t where t is the period of the artificially generated wave n is the oscillation cycle number n c is the total number of oscillation cycles in this study n c 100 wave cycles were taken and indicates the phase averaged variables calculation of turbulence parameters for combined wave current cases was performed by phase averaging of the velocity signal the phase averaging method of velocity signals conducted here is described in singh et al 2016 hereafter for simplicity the notation u w will be used instead of u w for the combined wave current flow cases therefore the normalized reynolds shear stress for both current only and combined wave current flow is thus defined as follow 7 u w τ ρ u 0 2 the vertical profiles of normalized reynolds stress against z h for a simple current f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 5 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison fig 5 shows that for current only and combined wave current flow the shear stress reached its maximum value close to the roughness top location c for p k 5 and 9 which is probably due to the interface between the low momentum fluid near the wall below the roughness height and the relatively high speed fluid above the roughness height roussinova and balachandar 2011 away from the bed z h 2 the reynolds stress varied in an approximately linear manner for a simple current case locations a d p k 5 and 9 which confirms that the flow was fully developed in the outer layer and it is independent of surface roughness effect shamloo and pirzadeh 2015 it is observed that at locations c and d fig 5 the maximum value of normalized reynolds stress 0 015 at location c is higher for f 2 hz compared to f 0 and 1 hz cases for all the roughness spacing the reynolds stress is higher for p k 5 compared to p k 9 thereby indicating larger turbulence and flow resistance for p k 5 is generated further at location a d p k 5 and 9 for surface wave frequency 1 and 2 hz cases the shear stress showed negative values in the upper region of the flow and being more prominent for f 2 hz compared to f 1 hz indicating outward flux of momentum 4 3 turbulence production and dissipation the vertical profiles of normalized turbulent kinetic energy production t p u w u z h u 3 against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 6 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison this plot confirms that turbulent production t p is mainly concentrated in the recirculation zone for both p k 5 and 9 with the increase in surface wave frequency t p increases up to the roughness top and thereafter decreases monotonically with the increases in z h and takes a profile similar to the plane bed profile beyond z h 0 3 and 0 2 for p k 5 and 9 respectively it is observed from fig 6 p k 5 locations a c and d that t p in the near bed region z h 0 05 is constant and thereafter start increasing for all the cases the constant value of t p in the near bed region for p k 5 is probably due to the effect of damping in the local reynolds shear stress produced by the closely spaced roughness element on the top of the roughness location b t p profile shows the smaller value for p k 9 compared to p k 5 for both current only and combined wave current cases the results for current only data are consistent with the data reported by roussinova et al 2009 who also obtained smaller t p value for k type roughness p k 5 compared to d type roughness p k 5 in turbulent flow accurate estimation of turbulent dissipation rate is always challenging there are several methods of estimation of turbulent dissipation ε but in the present study turbulent dissipation is estimated by assuming isotropy and measuring the temporal derivative of the stream wise velocity fluctuations as follows irwin 1973 8 ε 15 ν u 2 u t 2 where t is the time and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water the vertical profiles of normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation t d ε h u 3 against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 7 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison the trend of t d is similar to that of t p apart from the near bed amplification however in the near bed region a constant value of t d is not observed as in the case of t p for p k 5 as z h increases both turbulent production and dissipation tend to vanish moreover similarly to turbulent production the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy for p k 5 is slightly greater than for p k 9 agelinchaab and tachie 2006 reported that the values of turbulence production increase as the roughness effect increases and this is in conformity with the present results since for p k 5 the effective roughness is larger than in the case p k 9 for combined wave current flow t d increases slightly compared to current only profile but towards the surface t d is nearly zero for all the conditions 4 4 distribution turbulent kinetic energy flux the gradient of turbulent kinetic energy flux indicates the rate of loss or gain of kinetic energy due to turbulent diffusion with the change in roughness spacing the production of turbulent kinetic energy near the bed changes significantly as observed from fig 6 this implies that transport of energy should also be significantly affected by roughness spacing to understand this process the vertical distribution of normalized stream wise and wall normal fluxes of the turbulent kinetic energy f ku f k u u 0 3 and f kw f k w u 0 3 are plotted against z h in figs 8 and 9 respectively for current only and combined wave current flow at different stream wise locations for p k 5 and 9 in turbulent flows the stream wise and bottom normal fluxes of the turbulent energy are calculated as follows 9 f k u 0 5 u 3 u w 2 u v 2 10 f k w 0 5 w 3 u 2 w w v 2 it is observed fig 8 p k 9 that at location a the stream wise kinetic energy flux f ku starts with a positive value near the wall for all the cases f 0 1 2 hz then it decreases with an increase in z h attaining f ku 0 at z h 0 05 finally it becomes negative for all cases f 0 1 2 hz meaning upstream kinetic energy flux in the near bed region for a simple current flow the upper flow region also shows negative values but with the superimposition of the wave f 1 and 2 hz f ku again attains positive values for z h 0 4 which indicate downstream kinetic energy flux in the upper flow region however for p k 5 the f ku values increase with an increase in z h attaining maximum value at z h 0 1 for both current only and combined wave current flow and then they start to decrease and attain negative values beyond z h 0 15 and thereafter it change sign close to the top of the roughness p k 9 location b the slight decrease in f ku is observed when compared to plane bed profile for all the cases whereas at p k 5 the tke flux showed positive and negative values up to z h 0 4 and thereafter became negative throughout the depth for f 0 case whereas for f 1 and 2 hz it changed from negative to positive value towards the surface further at location c the stream wise kinetic energy flux starts with a positive value in the vicinity of the rough bed for p k 9 attaining maximum value at z h 0 1 for current only and combined wave current flow indicating that turbulent kinetic energy is transported from the wall region at c the f ku values attain minimum value at z h 0 125 for the wave induced cases while for current only flow f ku takes a similar pattern as observed for the plane bed profile however for p k 5 the f ku starts with positive values and not to many differences in the profiles are observed for all three cases f 0 1 2 hz it revealed from fig 8 that at location d near the bed for both p k 5 and 9 the profile of f ku is similar to the profile at location c whereas towards the surface positive values are observed for f 1 hz while negative values are observed for f 0 and 2 hz cases similar to the profiles observed for the other locations it is observed fig 9 that the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases the f kw profile remains positive p k 5 and 9 for z h 0 25 for current only flow at all the stream wise locations indicating an upward energy flux however for z h 0 25 the minimum value of f kw occurs at an elevation from the bed which is close to the one corresponding to the maximum value of f ku for both current only and combined wave current flow at locations a c and d the nature of f kw profiles are similar to the f ku profiles over the entire depth except that in general they take opposite signs at same z h it is interesting to note that near the rough bed surface waves of different frequencies do not affect the f kw profile significantly compared to current only flow however after superposition of surface wave the profile of f kw changes significantly near the surface indeed it becomes negative while the values of f kw are close to zero for current only flow 5 discussions study of flow associated with a rough bed in the wave current co existing environment is inherently difficult since it is usually hard to measure the near bed flow in wave current combined environment and hard to quantify the nature of turbulence over the rough bed the current paper presents the experimental data for the mean flow and the turbulence characteristics associated with the rough bed which could be thought of as a basic research which may be useful in dealing with morpho dynamics of alluvial rivers and may be transferable to more natural sea bed scenarios the novelty of this study is the execution of the flume experiments to characterize the turbulent flow over the cube mounted rough bed in the wave current coexisting environment which are akin to the natural sea bed scenarios and to make the necessary comparative discussions with the experiment and numerical investigations of dynamics of rough bed in tidal environments moreover the test data are used to analyze the turbulent statistics of flow over the regular rough bed with different roughness spacing which were not studied earlier thus series of experiments are performed to document the salient features of wave current flow in the presence of bottom wall cubic roughness the bottom wall roughness is classified into two categories such as intermediate and k type roughness these relative values of roughness with the coexisting wave current interacting flow with two frequencies f 1 and 2 hz cases are examined in terms of mean velocity and turbulence characteristics in the developed flow region and compared with that over a smooth channel bed data roughness has a profound effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it increases the momentum deficit which results in a decrease of velocity near the bed compared to plane bed velocity profiles for all the flow conditions roussinova and balachandar 2011 for p k 5 the negative velocity is clearly observed for all the cases including wave cases with negative magnitude larger for the current only case in comparison to the wave cases this indicates that the stream wise mean velocity increases slightly due to the superposition of surface wave over unidirectional current inside the cavity the shape of velocity profiles is smoother with no effect of local flow separation at location a and d further at locations a d for both the roughness spacing a decrease in the mean velocity profile towards the free surface is observed when compared to the current only profile as suggested by huang and mei 2003 the driving factor for the reduction of mean velocity towards the free surface in the presence of the waves along the flow as observed in the present study was due to the increase in the wave induced reynolds stress when the wave propagates in a flume from the oscillations induced by the superposition of surface waves the mean flow is modified when the wave is superimposed on a current flowing in the same direction the shear velocity is positive when approaching the free surface the wave related contributions have the opposite sign with the current resulting in a decrease of the mean shear velocity huang and mei 2003 the velocity distribution in the log region for the rough bed can be expressed in the following form schlichting 1969 11 u 1 κ ln z b 1 δ u where u u u z z u ν κ 0 40 and b 1 5 are the log law constant and δ u is the roughness function which represents the downward shift associated with roughness in the overlap region for plane bed the value of roughness function δ u is zero kim et al 1987 the mean velocity profiles against z z u ν for the current only case at different stream wise locations for relative roughness spacings p k 5 and 9 are shown in fig 10 in the present experiment the log law was fitted to the measured mean velocity data and position virtual origin and u computed from the clauser chart method as described by wei et al 2005 singh et al 2018b was adjusted to ensure a reasonable agreement between the measured data and log law the value of u and roughness shift δ u for the two different roughness spacing are summarized in table 2 f 0 hz fig 10 and table 2 clearly shows that the u as a function of z take a downward shift for both the roughness spacing cases as an example the estimation of δ u for roughness spacing case p k 5 is shown in fig 10 the downward shift of δ u for p k 5 is less δ u 8 5 than that for p k 9 δ u 9 8 the roughness shift δ u can be expressed as a function of a roughness reynolds number k s schlichting 1969 as follows 12 δ u 1 κ ln k s b 1 c 1 where κ 0 40 b 1 5 0 and c 1 8 5 based on δ u obtained from fig 10 k s was estimated using eq 12 for the two roughness cases resulting equal to 121 5 and 204 38 for p k 5 and 9 respectively using these k s values thus obtained equivalent sand roughness k s was estimated for the two roughness cases results are summarized in table 2 the flow resistance over the rough bed may be quantified by the ratio of equivalent sand roughness to the height of the roughness k s k therefore in the present study the values of k s k 0 22 and 0 28 for p k 5 and 9 respectively indicate that p k 5 provides lesser resistance to the flow in comparison to that of the p k 9 the effectiveness of the roughness to generate flow resistance in the present study is also compared with other roughness geometries for example agelinchaab and tachie 2006 performing experiments on a rough bed characterised by hemispherical ribs spanning across the entire width of the channel with different rib spacing reported a k s k value of 1 75 and 4 16 for p k 4 and 8 respectively in the present experiments much smaller values were obtained k s k 0 22 and 0 28 for p k 5 and 9 respectively it may be noted here that the roughness elements used in the study of agelinchaab and tachie 2006 represent two dimensional roughnesses while in the present experiments three dimensional roughness elements were used thus it is evident based on this limited comparison that channel roughened with a roughness that spans the entire width of the channel is more effective in increasing flow resistance compared to the roughness arrangement used in the present study which represents three dimensional roughness type however this is not conclusive based on the present experiment the flow resistance for both 2d and 3d surface depends on k s and on the p k so there are 2d surfaces with a larger flow resistance than 3d surfaces keeping p k or roughness density constant and same friction velocity probably 3d surfaces may present a large resistance force the reynolds stress is higher for f 2 hz compared to f 0 and 1 hz cases for all the roughness spacing this is probably due to the eddy compression caused by a higher surface wave of frequency f 2 hz that limits upward propagation and growth of turbulent structure towards the surface and as a result structures are compressed along a horizontal plane schlichting 1969 moreover in the presence of waves both for f 1 and 2 hz cases the shear stress showed negative values in the upper region of the flow being more prominent for f 2 hz compared to f 1 hz for both the roughness spacing indicating outward flux of momentum turbulent production t p is mainly concentrated in the recirculation zone for both p k 5 and 9 a positive value of t p signifies that the energy is being extracted from the mean flow to fluctuating kinetic energy and vice versa cao and chiew 2015 the superposition of higher frequency of the surface wave is more effective in the extracting energy of turbulent fluctuations compared to 1 hz frequency wave for all the relative roughness spacing cases the growth in t p profile in the near bed region indicates a high rate of mixing while above the roughness top both turbulent production and dissipation diminish to a large extent for all the cases at the recirculation zone the profile of stream wise turbulent kinetic energy flux f ku towards the surface shows negative values for the current only case while positive values are observed for combined wave current flow signifying an upstream and downstream transport of energy respectively in fact the inertia of the fluid streaks in the outer layer gives rise to a resilience effect inducing a negative f ku for current only flow however for combined wave current flow the inertia of the fluid streaks in the outer layer gives rise to an accelerating effect thereby inducing increased magnitudes of f ku the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases and the minimum value of f kw occurs at a location close to the maximum value of f ku for both current only and combined wave current flows the eddy viscosity v t for two dimensional turbulent flows is defined as follows nezu and rodi 1986 13 v t u w u z in a steady flow over the plane bed surface with a logarithmic velocity distribution the eddy viscosity v t is parabolic and approximately linear near the bottom as suggested by nezu and rodi 1986 therefore to investigate the nature of eddy viscosity for combined wave current flow the normalized vertical distributions of v t v t h u against z h for current only and combined wave current flow are plotted in fig 11 along with the data of flat bed for comparison the present normalized eddy viscosity profile for current only flow is also compared with equation proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 used for calculating the eddy viscosity over the flat bed the form of the equation proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 is the following 14 v t κ 1 z h κ v t h z π sin π z h here κ 0 40 is the von karman constant 0 is the wake parameter and v t 0 is the viscous term it is observed from fig 11 that the eddy viscosity over the plane bed followed the standard parabolic profile similar to the profile suggested by nezu and rodi 1986 and it also shows good agreement with semi empirical relation eq 14 proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 however for combined wave current flow the eddy viscosity increases linearly near the vicinity of the rough bed for all the surface wave frequency note that grant and madsen 1979 presented an analytical theory for combined flow in which the eddy viscosity increases linearly with elevation in the vicinity of a rough bed similarly christofferson and jonsson 1985 extended grant and madsen s 1979 analytical theory and also consider linear and constant models respectively for eddy viscosity inside the wave boundary layer further you et al 2001 also presented the theoretical model for combined wave current flow and predicted that the eddy viscosity distributions for current and waves are unlikely to be same inside the wave boundary layer the present results are also in accordance with the grant and madsen 1979 and you et al 2001 model for combined wave current flow in the vicinity of rough bed 6 conclusions the emphasis of this study is to investigate the mean flow and turbulence characteristics in the vicinity of a rough bed due to the presence of surface waves the data presented in this paper demonstrate that the roughness has a strong effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it increases the momentum loss inside the boundary layer which results in a decrease of stream wise mean velocity near the bed compared to the plane bed for all the conditions studied here the recirculation zone within the roughness elements decreases due to the superposition of surface waves on unidirectional current the turbulent intensities and the reynolds shear stresses are found to be significantly enhanced by the increase in roughness spacing thereby indicating higher turbulence and flow resistance for p k 9 the trend of the turbulent dissipation rate is similar to that of the rate of production of the turbulent kinetic energy as the elevation from the bottom increases z h 02 both production and dissipation tend to vanish similarly turbulent production the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy also increases near the roughness with an increase in p k the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases and negative maximum value of wall normal kinetic energy flux occurs at a location close to the maximum positive value of stream wise kinetic energy flux for both current only and combined wave current flow present experimental results can appropriately be utilized for validation and benchmarking of numerical models of turbulent flows and then the validated and calibrated numerical models can be used to explore the flow field detail for wider ranges of parameters in the presence of surface wave over large bottom roughness acknowledgments the author would like to acknowledge the department of science and technology government of india for the financial support for this

23320,in this paper detailed experimental results are reported to study the effect of the surface wave of different frequencies on turbulent characteristics of flow over a regular array of cubical roughness the velocity time series of current only and combined wave current flow is analyzed to obtain the distribution of first and the second order turbulence statistics turbulent kinetic energy production turbulent dissipation and kinetic energy fluxes at a fixed reynolds number to highlight the changes due to combined wave current flow a comparative study was made between the velocity profiles for current only flow and those measured for combined wave current flow as expected the rough profiles are shifted downwards with the amount equivalent to the roughness function δ u which was obtained directly from mean velocity profiles further the thickness of turbulent boundary layer increases with the superposition of surface wave compared to current only flow particular attention is also given to understand the behavior of kinetic energy flux to explicitly account for turbulent momentum transport characteristics over roughness under wave current interactions keywords cubical roughness open channel wave current turbulence rough bed 1 introduction flows observed in coastal environments are usually a combination of waves and currents the presence of surface waves are known to modulate the mean flow and turbulence field which results in an amendment in the momentum transfer flow resistance and sediment transport characteristics of the flow most of both experimental brevik and aas 1980 kemp and simons 1982 mazumder and ojha 2007 umeyama 2005 singh and debnath 2017a singh et al 2018a and numerical modeling grant and madsen 1979 olabarrieta et al 2010 teles et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 tambroni et al 2015a b developed in order to increase the understanding in wave current interaction had been taken over a flat surface in these studies the emphasis was given to examine the mean velocity profile and how it changes from the universal logarithmic law observed for current only flow they also reported the changes in the different turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress due to the superimposition of a surface wave on a uniform flow over a flat surface in addition the above mentioned works have contributed to the understanding of the subject comparatively little is known about the combined wave and current flow over the artificially covered rough bed despite the fact that such experimentally based information has great importance in practice the rough bed here investigated is covered with a relatively large array of regular roughness elements in this case regular large size vortices are routed into the main stream of the water in a classified manner both in space and in time in this respect mathisen and madsen 1996 have conducted experiments in a wave tank with triangular bars as roughness elements the height and spacing of these elements were chosen such that the bars simulated the ripples they mainly focused on apparent hydraulic roughness in the case of the combined flow and showed that the apparent hydraulic roughness was underestimated by the model proposed in grant and madsen 1979 fredsoe et al 1999 performed both experimental as well as the numerical study of the combined wave current flow over a ripple covered bed the ripples used in their work were symmetric davies and villaret 1999 proposed an analytical model to predict the eulerian drift that is caused by progressive waves over rippled or very rough bed ridler and sleath 2000 studied experimentally the eulerian time mean drift induced by progressive waves over the rough bed measurements were made in a laboratory flume with a laser doppler anemometer and two different two dimensional artificial bed roughness cases were investigated the measurements showed that the maximum value of the time mean drift velocity at the bed might be increased or decreased relative to the value predicted by longuet higgins theory for smooth beds dumas et al 2005 performed an experimental study in a wave current co existing environment to provide a better understanding of the genesis of the bedforms they reported that under low orbital velocity symmetric small ripples became progressively more asymmetric ojha and mazumder 2010 presented the results of an experimental study on the mean flow and turbulence characteristics over a series of two dimensional 2d bedforms in the presence of surface waves of different frequencies banerjee et al 2015 performed flume experiments on wind induced flow in static water bodies in the presence of protruding vegetation they reported that wave and turbulence effects are simultaneously produced at the air water interface and the nature of their coexistence is found to vary with different flow parameters including water level mean wind speed vegetation density and flexibility the more general case of waves superposed to uniform current flowing over a mobile sediment bed covered with vegetation has been addressed experimentally by tambroni et al 2015b direct numerical simulation of the oscillatory flow close to a wall covered with spherical roughness elements have been performed by mazzuoli and vittori 2016 with the aim to identify three flow regimes which are named the laminar transitional turbulent and hydrodynamically rough turbulent regimes they reported that the transition from one regime to the other depends on the reynolds number and on the diameter of the spheres covering the bed in nature the seabed is covered with 3 d ripples bars dunes and great variety of shapes and arrangements of roughness elements having small values of the roughness parameter a k s where a is the amplitude of the orbital motion at the bed and k s is the nikuradse s equivalent roughness which may be taken as 2 2 5k k being the size of the roughness elements dixen et al 2008 the behavior of wave boundary layer at small values of the roughness parameter a k s is important in connection with the investigation of the stability of rip rap scour protection in the marine environment where large size of ripples stones rock armour blocks inevitably leads to small values of a k s a k s o 1 or smaller as suggested by dixen et al 2008 in the present study array of cubes are used as a rough bed with values of roughness parameter similar to that observed in the seabed note that cubes are used in many experimental and numerical studies e g coceal et al 2007 florens et al 2013 with the advantage of having only one length scale thus a matrix of cubes is ideal for fundamental studies of the flow around roughness elements and above them such basic research may be useful in dealing with the morpho dynamics of alluvial rivers and may be transferable to more natural sea bed scenarios thus the experimental setting here employed allows for providing some understanding of the turbulence statistics due to combined wave current flow over the large bottom roughness without adding any difficulty in the measurement procedure therefore the aim of this study is to approach the problem experimentally by measuring the velocity field in a wave current coexisting environment on a rough boundary created by fixing a large number wooden cube with different relative spacing the vertical profiles of stream wise mean velocity and reynolds stress were obtained from the velocity data collected by an adv additionally turbulent energy fluxes and energy production for simple current and combined wave current flows are investigated the investigators are affirmative that the quantitative analysis reported in the present study will find wide applications in the area of the environmental hydraulics of rough bed flows and in the understanding of morphodynamic processes like sediment pickup grain sorting and sediment transport over the rough beds with variable spacing between roughness elements 2 experimental technique and procedure the experiments were conducted in the fluid mechanics and hydraulic laboratory of the indian institute of engineering and science and technology iiest shibpur india a specially designed flat bed open channel flume of 18 3 m length 0 90 m width and 0 90 m depth was used for the experiments fig 1 at the downstream section of the flume waterfalls freely into a large 37 m long 8 m wide and 2 m deep sump from where it is recirculated into the flume using a vertical turbine pump located outside the main body of the flume waves were generated along the unidirectional current by a plunger type wave maker placed at the upstream end of the flume the wave maker was connected to a variac in order to control the frequency of oscillation the basic details of wave maker and its working principle are reported in singh and debnath 2016 2017b the pump system circulated the water from the large sump and flow depth h 20 cm was kept constant throughout the experiments by adjusting the discharge valve and tail gate simultaneously for the experiments rough bed was prepared fixing to the bed a large number of artificial wooden cubes of side 0 025 m two different values of pitch length p centre to centre spacing between two consecutive cubes were chosen to achieve isolated roughness flow and wake interference flow perry et al 1969 the cubes were equally spaced along lateral and longitudinal directions so that the flow pattern repeats along the flume bed three different categories of tests were carried out in the present study 1 current only test over the plane bed 2 current only tests over the cubical roughness mounted on the plane bed with different spacing p k 5 and 9 where k is the cube height and 3 tests over the cubical roughness for different spacing p k 5 and 9 with superimposition of surface waves of different frequencies 1 and 2 hz on the main flow all the experiments were carried out in the fully developed flow region x 12 m downstream from the flume entrance where the flow was verified to be fully developed four different measuring locations a d were selected for p k 5 and 9 along the centreline of the flume as shown in fig 1 direct measurements of velocity were made using a sontek 16 mhz 5 cm down looking 3 d micro acoustic doppler velocimeter micro adv which has the precision of 1 cm s on a measured velocity of 100 cm s the velocity signals recorded by micro adv were always affected by doppler noise associated with the measurement technique the presence of this noise causes an aliasing effect that results in spikes in micro adv signals for turbulence studies it is important that the signal is filtered to remove doppler noise otherwise estimates of second and higher order turbulence statistics would be biased because of noise in signals in the present study the noise in raw adv data were processed by a phase space threshold de spiking method described in goring and nikora 2002 and implemented in the win adv software the adv velocity data were cleaned by removing the communication errors low signal to noise ratio data 15 db and low correlation 70 this was performed by win adv software and resulted in the removal of approximately 2 of all collected raw velocity time series such excluded signals were replaced by data using a cubic polynomial interpolation method singh et al 2017 the large noise in the velocity signal was removed by minimizing the possible aliasing effect near the nyquist frequency herein f n 20 hz 3 hydraulic conditions experiments were performed for constant flow depth h 0 2 m volume flow rate q 0 053 m3 s reynolds number re u h ν 58 800 and froude number f r u g h 0 21 where u 0 294 m s is the mean velocity ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of water and g is the acceleration due to gravity in the experiments the relative submergence was 6 5 h k 10 5 corresponding to the case of rough open channel flow with intermediate submergence nikora et al 2001 the wave length l w and wave amplitude a w have been calculated taking a statistical average of the values obtained from the analysis of twenty images of the water surface profile the quantity a w l w called wave steepness factor was then computed the wave steepness factor does not exceed 0 05 in nature banerjee et al 2015 and in all the experiments here performed is well below it furthermore in the present study we considered waves with frequencies f 1 2 hz corresponding to ratios of l w h 1 75 3 25 respectively falling within the range of l w h 1 25 and ratios of l w h 11 29 32 5 within the range of l w h 4 56 where h is the wave height these ranges of l w h and l w h are prevalent in natural wave conditions goda 2000 thus it may be observed that the wave characteristics used in the present study represent waves that occur in nature in terms of non dimensional parameters the amplitude a of the orbital motion at the bed and the wave length is calculated by using the formula from the linear wave theory as follows 1 a h 2 sinh 2 π h l w 2 l w g t 2 2 π tanh 2 π h l w the orbital velocity u a is calculated by u a a ω where ω 2πf is the angular frequency of the surface waves f 1 t is the frequency of the surface waves and t is the wave period and g is the acceleration due to gravity the value of wave length 1 20 and 0 39 m for f 1 and 2 hz respectively calculated using eq 2 overestimates the observed wavelength 0 65 and 0 38 m by about 45 and 2 5 for f 1 and 2 hz respectively in flume experiment a similar difference is also observed by banerjee et al 2015 and singh et al 2015 however in the present experiment the values of re h 23 814 it is to be noted here that re h is different from the above mention reynolds number re because the re value is calculated based on water depth whereas re h value is calculate based on hydraulic mean depth for comparison purpose only h l w 0 30 0 57 and h l w 0 030 0 08 are approximately similar to other flume based combined wave current flow studies for e g kemp and simons 1982 carried out experiments for combined wave current flow with re h 11 735 19 730 h l w 0 136 0 190 h l w 0 015 0 056 klopman 1994 conducted experiments for regular and irregular waves under re h 33 556 h l w 0 187 h l w 0 045 and umeyama 2005 carried out experiments for combined wave current under re h 11 455 and h l w 0 101 0 165 h l w 0 0154 0 0192 the experiment with wave frequency f 0 hz corresponds to the current only test various experimental conditions for current only test and combined wave current flow are summarized in table 1 to ensure the fully developed flow at the experimental channel velocity data were collected using a micro adv at seven different locations 4 10 m from the flume entrance over the cube mounted rough bed fig 2 shows the plots of normalized stream wise mean velocity profile u u 0 distribution for current only and combined wave current flow over a cube mounted rough bed at seven different locations for p k 5 the velocity is normalized using the measured maximum mean velocity u 0 in order to highlight the relative changes in velocity profile a comparative plot has been made between the velocity profiles at the plane bed surface without cubes and that observed over a cube mounted rough bed at different locations the solid curved line shown in fig 2 is drawn approximately by joining the points of intersection of profiles over cube mounted rough bed and the profiles over the plane bed the curved solid line clearly shows fig 2 the developing flow beyond 9 m from the upstream end of the flume and reaches to quasi state along downstream the developing flow over the cube mounted rough bed is more akin to the turbulent boundary layer tbl beyond 9 m which is similar to the finding of ojha and mazumder 2010 4 experimental observations and results 4 1 distribution of mean velocity for each run the collected instantaneous velocity data were used to derive mean and turbulence characteristics in the stream wise and wall normal directions at first instantaneous velocity data were time averaged and reynolds decomposition was applied thereafter the time averaged stream wise and wall normal velocities u w at each measuring point were computed as follows 3 u 1 n i 1 n u i 4 w 1 n i 1 n w i the vertical profiles of stream wise mean velocity components against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 3 together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison the velocity is normalized using the measured maximum velocity u 0 observed at the level of z h 0 55 for the plane bed case instead of the computed friction velocity u similar to roussinova and balachandar 2011 roughness has a strong effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it extracts the momentum inside the boundary layer which results in a decrease of stream wise mean velocity near the bed compared to plane bed profile for all the conditions studied here the result shows that at location c the stream wise mean velocity is negative for p k 5 for all three cases f 0 1 and 2 hz indicating the occurrence of flow separation and recirculation below the level z h 0 125 while for p k 9 the stream wise velocity seems negative only for f 0 hz case at f 1 hz the separation zone is shifted slightly upwards for p k 5 the upcoming flow is deflected more in the bottom normal direction with largest magnitude of the stream wise velocity is observed for a larger spacing p k 9 and surface wave frequency f 2 hz unlike the plane bed profile close to the rough surface z h 0 125 a kink in the case of p k 5 is noticed on the top of the cube whereas a kink in the velocity profile is not observed in case of p k 9 after a superposition of surface wave of different frequencies at locations a and d low stream wise mean velocity is observed compared to the plane bed for all cases as reported in fig 3 it is also revealed that close to the bottom the velocity profile is deflected more compared to a plane bed for p k 5 inside the cavity the shape of mean velocity profiles is smoother with no effect of local flow separation at locations a and d for both the spacing as well surface wave further at locations a d for p k 9 a decrease in the mean velocity profile towards the free surface is observed when compared to current only profile whereas towards the surface the mean velocity profile does not seem to influenced by the presence of surface waves for p k 5 the vertical profiles of wall normal mean velocity component against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 4 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison it is observed that for current only flow the wall normal mean velocity at location a for both p k 5 and 9 cases are almost zero but for wave induced conditions the velocity assumes no vanishing values it also revealed from fig 4 that near the surface for all the locations the velocity profiles do not change much compared to that of the plane bed if waves are absent whereas in both the cases of wave with f 1 and 2 hz case the velocity becomes negative indicating downward flow near the surface furthermore at location c for p k 9 the shape of the velocity profile is similar for both current only and wave induced cases i e velocity increases near the bed to the maximum value at z h 0 05 and thereafter decreases however at the same location for p k 5 the wall normal mean velocity starts with positive values in the region 0 z h 0 1 for all the cases and thereafter becomes negative for f 1 and 2 hz cases whereas for f 0 hz the velocity becomes equivalent to the plane bed profile these positive and negative values of wall normal mean velocity at location c imply that downstream of the cube two different regions are observed a region with upward moving fluid close to the bed 0 z h 0 1 and a region with downward moving fluid for z h 0 1 this is probably because near to the bed flow is affected by bottom roughness and away from the bed the flow is affected more by the presence of surface wave for current only case f 0 hz close to the surface wall normal mean velocity approaches that of the profile obtained for the plane bed case at both the relative roughness spacing p k 5 and 9 4 2 vertical distribution of reynolds shear stress the time averaged reynolds shear stress τ at each measuring point for a simple current f 0 hz case can be obtained as follows nezu and nakagawa 1993 5 τ ρ u w ρ 1 n i 1 n u i u w i w where n is the total number of observation at each measuring point and ρ is the density of the fluid similarly for combined wave current flow the reynolds shear stress for the phase averaged quantities can be expressed as follows kemp and simons 1982 umeyama 2009 singh et al 2018a 2018b 6 τ ρ 1 n c n 1 n c u t n t u t w t n t w t 0 t t where t is the period of the artificially generated wave n is the oscillation cycle number n c is the total number of oscillation cycles in this study n c 100 wave cycles were taken and indicates the phase averaged variables calculation of turbulence parameters for combined wave current cases was performed by phase averaging of the velocity signal the phase averaging method of velocity signals conducted here is described in singh et al 2016 hereafter for simplicity the notation u w will be used instead of u w for the combined wave current flow cases therefore the normalized reynolds shear stress for both current only and combined wave current flow is thus defined as follow 7 u w τ ρ u 0 2 the vertical profiles of normalized reynolds stress against z h for a simple current f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 5 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison fig 5 shows that for current only and combined wave current flow the shear stress reached its maximum value close to the roughness top location c for p k 5 and 9 which is probably due to the interface between the low momentum fluid near the wall below the roughness height and the relatively high speed fluid above the roughness height roussinova and balachandar 2011 away from the bed z h 2 the reynolds stress varied in an approximately linear manner for a simple current case locations a d p k 5 and 9 which confirms that the flow was fully developed in the outer layer and it is independent of surface roughness effect shamloo and pirzadeh 2015 it is observed that at locations c and d fig 5 the maximum value of normalized reynolds stress 0 015 at location c is higher for f 2 hz compared to f 0 and 1 hz cases for all the roughness spacing the reynolds stress is higher for p k 5 compared to p k 9 thereby indicating larger turbulence and flow resistance for p k 5 is generated further at location a d p k 5 and 9 for surface wave frequency 1 and 2 hz cases the shear stress showed negative values in the upper region of the flow and being more prominent for f 2 hz compared to f 1 hz indicating outward flux of momentum 4 3 turbulence production and dissipation the vertical profiles of normalized turbulent kinetic energy production t p u w u z h u 3 against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 6 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison this plot confirms that turbulent production t p is mainly concentrated in the recirculation zone for both p k 5 and 9 with the increase in surface wave frequency t p increases up to the roughness top and thereafter decreases monotonically with the increases in z h and takes a profile similar to the plane bed profile beyond z h 0 3 and 0 2 for p k 5 and 9 respectively it is observed from fig 6 p k 5 locations a c and d that t p in the near bed region z h 0 05 is constant and thereafter start increasing for all the cases the constant value of t p in the near bed region for p k 5 is probably due to the effect of damping in the local reynolds shear stress produced by the closely spaced roughness element on the top of the roughness location b t p profile shows the smaller value for p k 9 compared to p k 5 for both current only and combined wave current cases the results for current only data are consistent with the data reported by roussinova et al 2009 who also obtained smaller t p value for k type roughness p k 5 compared to d type roughness p k 5 in turbulent flow accurate estimation of turbulent dissipation rate is always challenging there are several methods of estimation of turbulent dissipation ε but in the present study turbulent dissipation is estimated by assuming isotropy and measuring the temporal derivative of the stream wise velocity fluctuations as follows irwin 1973 8 ε 15 ν u 2 u t 2 where t is the time and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water the vertical profiles of normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation t d ε h u 3 against z h for current only f 0 hz and combined wave current flow f 1 and 2 hz are plotted in fig 7 at different stream wise locations together with that of the plane bed profile for comparison the trend of t d is similar to that of t p apart from the near bed amplification however in the near bed region a constant value of t d is not observed as in the case of t p for p k 5 as z h increases both turbulent production and dissipation tend to vanish moreover similarly to turbulent production the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy for p k 5 is slightly greater than for p k 9 agelinchaab and tachie 2006 reported that the values of turbulence production increase as the roughness effect increases and this is in conformity with the present results since for p k 5 the effective roughness is larger than in the case p k 9 for combined wave current flow t d increases slightly compared to current only profile but towards the surface t d is nearly zero for all the conditions 4 4 distribution turbulent kinetic energy flux the gradient of turbulent kinetic energy flux indicates the rate of loss or gain of kinetic energy due to turbulent diffusion with the change in roughness spacing the production of turbulent kinetic energy near the bed changes significantly as observed from fig 6 this implies that transport of energy should also be significantly affected by roughness spacing to understand this process the vertical distribution of normalized stream wise and wall normal fluxes of the turbulent kinetic energy f ku f k u u 0 3 and f kw f k w u 0 3 are plotted against z h in figs 8 and 9 respectively for current only and combined wave current flow at different stream wise locations for p k 5 and 9 in turbulent flows the stream wise and bottom normal fluxes of the turbulent energy are calculated as follows 9 f k u 0 5 u 3 u w 2 u v 2 10 f k w 0 5 w 3 u 2 w w v 2 it is observed fig 8 p k 9 that at location a the stream wise kinetic energy flux f ku starts with a positive value near the wall for all the cases f 0 1 2 hz then it decreases with an increase in z h attaining f ku 0 at z h 0 05 finally it becomes negative for all cases f 0 1 2 hz meaning upstream kinetic energy flux in the near bed region for a simple current flow the upper flow region also shows negative values but with the superimposition of the wave f 1 and 2 hz f ku again attains positive values for z h 0 4 which indicate downstream kinetic energy flux in the upper flow region however for p k 5 the f ku values increase with an increase in z h attaining maximum value at z h 0 1 for both current only and combined wave current flow and then they start to decrease and attain negative values beyond z h 0 15 and thereafter it change sign close to the top of the roughness p k 9 location b the slight decrease in f ku is observed when compared to plane bed profile for all the cases whereas at p k 5 the tke flux showed positive and negative values up to z h 0 4 and thereafter became negative throughout the depth for f 0 case whereas for f 1 and 2 hz it changed from negative to positive value towards the surface further at location c the stream wise kinetic energy flux starts with a positive value in the vicinity of the rough bed for p k 9 attaining maximum value at z h 0 1 for current only and combined wave current flow indicating that turbulent kinetic energy is transported from the wall region at c the f ku values attain minimum value at z h 0 125 for the wave induced cases while for current only flow f ku takes a similar pattern as observed for the plane bed profile however for p k 5 the f ku starts with positive values and not to many differences in the profiles are observed for all three cases f 0 1 2 hz it revealed from fig 8 that at location d near the bed for both p k 5 and 9 the profile of f ku is similar to the profile at location c whereas towards the surface positive values are observed for f 1 hz while negative values are observed for f 0 and 2 hz cases similar to the profiles observed for the other locations it is observed fig 9 that the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases the f kw profile remains positive p k 5 and 9 for z h 0 25 for current only flow at all the stream wise locations indicating an upward energy flux however for z h 0 25 the minimum value of f kw occurs at an elevation from the bed which is close to the one corresponding to the maximum value of f ku for both current only and combined wave current flow at locations a c and d the nature of f kw profiles are similar to the f ku profiles over the entire depth except that in general they take opposite signs at same z h it is interesting to note that near the rough bed surface waves of different frequencies do not affect the f kw profile significantly compared to current only flow however after superposition of surface wave the profile of f kw changes significantly near the surface indeed it becomes negative while the values of f kw are close to zero for current only flow 5 discussions study of flow associated with a rough bed in the wave current co existing environment is inherently difficult since it is usually hard to measure the near bed flow in wave current combined environment and hard to quantify the nature of turbulence over the rough bed the current paper presents the experimental data for the mean flow and the turbulence characteristics associated with the rough bed which could be thought of as a basic research which may be useful in dealing with morpho dynamics of alluvial rivers and may be transferable to more natural sea bed scenarios the novelty of this study is the execution of the flume experiments to characterize the turbulent flow over the cube mounted rough bed in the wave current coexisting environment which are akin to the natural sea bed scenarios and to make the necessary comparative discussions with the experiment and numerical investigations of dynamics of rough bed in tidal environments moreover the test data are used to analyze the turbulent statistics of flow over the regular rough bed with different roughness spacing which were not studied earlier thus series of experiments are performed to document the salient features of wave current flow in the presence of bottom wall cubic roughness the bottom wall roughness is classified into two categories such as intermediate and k type roughness these relative values of roughness with the coexisting wave current interacting flow with two frequencies f 1 and 2 hz cases are examined in terms of mean velocity and turbulence characteristics in the developed flow region and compared with that over a smooth channel bed data roughness has a profound effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it increases the momentum deficit which results in a decrease of velocity near the bed compared to plane bed velocity profiles for all the flow conditions roussinova and balachandar 2011 for p k 5 the negative velocity is clearly observed for all the cases including wave cases with negative magnitude larger for the current only case in comparison to the wave cases this indicates that the stream wise mean velocity increases slightly due to the superposition of surface wave over unidirectional current inside the cavity the shape of velocity profiles is smoother with no effect of local flow separation at location a and d further at locations a d for both the roughness spacing a decrease in the mean velocity profile towards the free surface is observed when compared to the current only profile as suggested by huang and mei 2003 the driving factor for the reduction of mean velocity towards the free surface in the presence of the waves along the flow as observed in the present study was due to the increase in the wave induced reynolds stress when the wave propagates in a flume from the oscillations induced by the superposition of surface waves the mean flow is modified when the wave is superimposed on a current flowing in the same direction the shear velocity is positive when approaching the free surface the wave related contributions have the opposite sign with the current resulting in a decrease of the mean shear velocity huang and mei 2003 the velocity distribution in the log region for the rough bed can be expressed in the following form schlichting 1969 11 u 1 κ ln z b 1 δ u where u u u z z u ν κ 0 40 and b 1 5 are the log law constant and δ u is the roughness function which represents the downward shift associated with roughness in the overlap region for plane bed the value of roughness function δ u is zero kim et al 1987 the mean velocity profiles against z z u ν for the current only case at different stream wise locations for relative roughness spacings p k 5 and 9 are shown in fig 10 in the present experiment the log law was fitted to the measured mean velocity data and position virtual origin and u computed from the clauser chart method as described by wei et al 2005 singh et al 2018b was adjusted to ensure a reasonable agreement between the measured data and log law the value of u and roughness shift δ u for the two different roughness spacing are summarized in table 2 f 0 hz fig 10 and table 2 clearly shows that the u as a function of z take a downward shift for both the roughness spacing cases as an example the estimation of δ u for roughness spacing case p k 5 is shown in fig 10 the downward shift of δ u for p k 5 is less δ u 8 5 than that for p k 9 δ u 9 8 the roughness shift δ u can be expressed as a function of a roughness reynolds number k s schlichting 1969 as follows 12 δ u 1 κ ln k s b 1 c 1 where κ 0 40 b 1 5 0 and c 1 8 5 based on δ u obtained from fig 10 k s was estimated using eq 12 for the two roughness cases resulting equal to 121 5 and 204 38 for p k 5 and 9 respectively using these k s values thus obtained equivalent sand roughness k s was estimated for the two roughness cases results are summarized in table 2 the flow resistance over the rough bed may be quantified by the ratio of equivalent sand roughness to the height of the roughness k s k therefore in the present study the values of k s k 0 22 and 0 28 for p k 5 and 9 respectively indicate that p k 5 provides lesser resistance to the flow in comparison to that of the p k 9 the effectiveness of the roughness to generate flow resistance in the present study is also compared with other roughness geometries for example agelinchaab and tachie 2006 performing experiments on a rough bed characterised by hemispherical ribs spanning across the entire width of the channel with different rib spacing reported a k s k value of 1 75 and 4 16 for p k 4 and 8 respectively in the present experiments much smaller values were obtained k s k 0 22 and 0 28 for p k 5 and 9 respectively it may be noted here that the roughness elements used in the study of agelinchaab and tachie 2006 represent two dimensional roughnesses while in the present experiments three dimensional roughness elements were used thus it is evident based on this limited comparison that channel roughened with a roughness that spans the entire width of the channel is more effective in increasing flow resistance compared to the roughness arrangement used in the present study which represents three dimensional roughness type however this is not conclusive based on the present experiment the flow resistance for both 2d and 3d surface depends on k s and on the p k so there are 2d surfaces with a larger flow resistance than 3d surfaces keeping p k or roughness density constant and same friction velocity probably 3d surfaces may present a large resistance force the reynolds stress is higher for f 2 hz compared to f 0 and 1 hz cases for all the roughness spacing this is probably due to the eddy compression caused by a higher surface wave of frequency f 2 hz that limits upward propagation and growth of turbulent structure towards the surface and as a result structures are compressed along a horizontal plane schlichting 1969 moreover in the presence of waves both for f 1 and 2 hz cases the shear stress showed negative values in the upper region of the flow being more prominent for f 2 hz compared to f 1 hz for both the roughness spacing indicating outward flux of momentum turbulent production t p is mainly concentrated in the recirculation zone for both p k 5 and 9 a positive value of t p signifies that the energy is being extracted from the mean flow to fluctuating kinetic energy and vice versa cao and chiew 2015 the superposition of higher frequency of the surface wave is more effective in the extracting energy of turbulent fluctuations compared to 1 hz frequency wave for all the relative roughness spacing cases the growth in t p profile in the near bed region indicates a high rate of mixing while above the roughness top both turbulent production and dissipation diminish to a large extent for all the cases at the recirculation zone the profile of stream wise turbulent kinetic energy flux f ku towards the surface shows negative values for the current only case while positive values are observed for combined wave current flow signifying an upstream and downstream transport of energy respectively in fact the inertia of the fluid streaks in the outer layer gives rise to a resilience effect inducing a negative f ku for current only flow however for combined wave current flow the inertia of the fluid streaks in the outer layer gives rise to an accelerating effect thereby inducing increased magnitudes of f ku the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases and the minimum value of f kw occurs at a location close to the maximum value of f ku for both current only and combined wave current flows the eddy viscosity v t for two dimensional turbulent flows is defined as follows nezu and rodi 1986 13 v t u w u z in a steady flow over the plane bed surface with a logarithmic velocity distribution the eddy viscosity v t is parabolic and approximately linear near the bottom as suggested by nezu and rodi 1986 therefore to investigate the nature of eddy viscosity for combined wave current flow the normalized vertical distributions of v t v t h u against z h for current only and combined wave current flow are plotted in fig 11 along with the data of flat bed for comparison the present normalized eddy viscosity profile for current only flow is also compared with equation proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 used for calculating the eddy viscosity over the flat bed the form of the equation proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 is the following 14 v t κ 1 z h κ v t h z π sin π z h here κ 0 40 is the von karman constant 0 is the wake parameter and v t 0 is the viscous term it is observed from fig 11 that the eddy viscosity over the plane bed followed the standard parabolic profile similar to the profile suggested by nezu and rodi 1986 and it also shows good agreement with semi empirical relation eq 14 proposed by nezu and nakagawa 1993 however for combined wave current flow the eddy viscosity increases linearly near the vicinity of the rough bed for all the surface wave frequency note that grant and madsen 1979 presented an analytical theory for combined flow in which the eddy viscosity increases linearly with elevation in the vicinity of a rough bed similarly christofferson and jonsson 1985 extended grant and madsen s 1979 analytical theory and also consider linear and constant models respectively for eddy viscosity inside the wave boundary layer further you et al 2001 also presented the theoretical model for combined wave current flow and predicted that the eddy viscosity distributions for current and waves are unlikely to be same inside the wave boundary layer the present results are also in accordance with the grant and madsen 1979 and you et al 2001 model for combined wave current flow in the vicinity of rough bed 6 conclusions the emphasis of this study is to investigate the mean flow and turbulence characteristics in the vicinity of a rough bed due to the presence of surface waves the data presented in this paper demonstrate that the roughness has a strong effect on the shape of mean velocity profiles it increases the momentum loss inside the boundary layer which results in a decrease of stream wise mean velocity near the bed compared to the plane bed for all the conditions studied here the recirculation zone within the roughness elements decreases due to the superposition of surface waves on unidirectional current the turbulent intensities and the reynolds shear stresses are found to be significantly enhanced by the increase in roughness spacing thereby indicating higher turbulence and flow resistance for p k 9 the trend of the turbulent dissipation rate is similar to that of the rate of production of the turbulent kinetic energy as the elevation from the bottom increases z h 02 both production and dissipation tend to vanish similarly turbulent production the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy also increases near the roughness with an increase in p k the wall normal kinetic energy flux is relatively weak compared to stream wise kinetic energy flux for all the cases and negative maximum value of wall normal kinetic energy flux occurs at a location close to the maximum positive value of stream wise kinetic energy flux for both current only and combined wave current flow present experimental results can appropriately be utilized for validation and benchmarking of numerical models of turbulent flows and then the validated and calibrated numerical models can be used to explore the flow field detail for wider ranges of parameters in the presence of surface wave over large bottom roughness acknowledgments the author would like to acknowledge the department of science and technology government of india for the financial support for this

23321,this paper proposes a regression genetic fuzzy system gfs fruler for a problem of sea wave parameters estimation from neighbor buoys with application on wave energy systems fruler is a recently proposed three staged algorithm that combines an instance selection method for regression a multigranularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm to generate accurate and simple takagi sugeno kant tsk fuzzy rules we have applied fruler to a real problem of significant wave height and energy flux prediction in one buoy of the west coast of the usa california from values of other two neighbor buoys in the case of the significant wave height fruler is able to obtain a robust prediction with only three rules which in addition are fully interpretable since they clearly separate swell situations from wind sea in the prediction in both cases the variables used in the significant wave prediction are completely different and can be identified as relevant for the specific case swell or wind sea in the case of the energy flux prediction the interpretation of the rules provided by fruler is more difficult since eight rules are necessary to obtain the prediction even in this case several rules can be clearly classified as swell predictors and the rest of the rules describe local wind situation of waves this study shows that the gfss are useful tools to obtain robust and interpretable predictions in ocean wave parameter estimation problems keywords significant wave height wave energy flux marine systems genetic fuzzy systems 1 introduction sea waves parameters prediction problems play an important role in many different ocean engineering tasks such as the design of marine structures like oil platforms or harbours comola et al 2014 kim and suh 2014 or in the design and management of marine energy systems arinaga and cheung 2012 esteban and leary 2012 like the proper operation of wave energy converters lópez et al 2013 among others among the different sea wave parameters the significant wave height h m 0 and the wave energy flux p are the two most studied in the literature in the case of h m 0 it is usually estimated using in situ sensors such as buoys recording time series of wave elevation information the significant wave height prediction is useful for a number of ocean engineering systems including facilities safety in situations of severe weather rao and mandal 2005 chang et al 2011 regarding the sea wave energy flux p it is more related to marine energy bahaj 2011 falcão 2010 which is currently one of the most promising sources of renewable energy still minor at a global level but playing a major role in several offshore islands fadaeenejad et al 2014 rusu and guedes soares 2012 in this case the accurate estimation of the wave energy flux p is relevant to characterize the wave energy production from wave energy converters wecs facilities cuadra et al 2016 the research work on wave parameters prediction systems has been intense in the last years with special incidence in machine learning or soft computing approaches one of the first works on this topic was the direct prediction of h m 0 using artificial neural networks in deo and naidu 1998 improvements on this prediction system were further presented in agrawal and deo 2004 neural networks have also been applied to other problems of h m 0 and p prediction such as tsai et al 2002 where h m 0 and p are inferred from observed wave records using time series neural networks in castro et al 2014 a neural network is applied to estimate the wave energy resource in the northern coast of spain in alexandre et al 2015 and cornejo bueno et al 2016a different hybrid algorithms mixed with an extreme learning machine neural network were proposed for the estimation of h m 0 and p in the context of marine energy applications alternative methods based on different computational approaches have been recently proposed for example in mahjoobi et al 2008 different soft computing techniques are tested for h m 0 prediction support vector regression svr has also been applied to marine energy related problems such as in mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 similarly salcedo sanz et al 2015 and cornejo bueno et al 2016b proposed to feed svr approaches with information from radar sources in order to obtain an accurate prediction of h m 0 and p parameters classification approaches have been applied in fernández et al 2015 to analyze and predict h m 0 and p ranges in buoys for marine energy applications in nitsure et al 2012 use of genetic programming for h m 0 reconstruction problems was proposed in spite of this important research work on the application of different soft computing approaches in wave parameters prediction the use of fuzzy based systems in this field is still under exploration one of the first works on the application of fuzzy systems to wave parameters estimation is kazeminezhad et al 2005 where the performance of an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis in a problem of wave parameters estimation is investigated on real data from lake ontario in sylaios et al 2009 a takagi sugeno rule based fuzzy inference system fis was developed for forecasting sea wave parameters input data such as wind speed and direction and lagged wave characteristics were used in this case the model was successfully applied to data from an oceanographic buoy deployed in the aegean sea greece in özger 2010 a forecasting system based on the combination of wavelet and fuzzy logic approaches was proposed for wave parameters prediction up to 48 h the idea of the system is to use the wavelet technique to separate time series into its spectral bands and then these spectral bands are estimated individually by the fuzzy logic approach results in different deep sea and coastal buoys of the pacific coast of the usa are shown in zanaganeh et al 2009 a hybrid genetic algorithm adaptive network based fuzzy inference system model was developed to forecast h m 0 and the peak spectral period at lake michigan in özger 2009 a neuro fuzzy approach is used to define spatial variability of the significant wave height assumed as a regionalized variable in such a way that it is possible to estimate the significant wave height values of a selected station from neighboring stations which exhibit similar features experiments with buoys in the gulf of mexico show the performance of this approach in stefanakos 2016 fuzzy inference systems fis are combined with adaptive network based fuzzy inference systems anfis for the modelling of non stationary time series for an improved prediction of wind and wave parameters this system was tested with data from weather models in the north atlantic in this paper we propose the application of fruler rodríguez fernández et al 2016a a genetic fuzzy system gfs for regression cordón et al 2001 finotto et al 2013 in a problem of sea wave parameters estimation from neighbor buoys fruler is based on takagi sugeno kant tsk rules and it is composed of an instance selection method for regression a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm that uses a fast and scalable method with elastic net regularization to generate accurate and simple tsk 1 fuzzy rules we show the performance of fruler in a problem of h m 0 and p estimation using three buoys in the west coast of the usa california results are discussed in terms of the good interpretability of the obtained rules which allow an intuitive explanation of the wave parameters reconstruction using a reduced number of rules and predictive variables the rest of the paper is organized as follows next section details the calculation of the parameters of interest in ocean wave characterization h m 0 and p in this case section 3 presents the tsk rules which are learned through fruler section 4 briefly describes the main components of fruler rodríguez fernández et al 2016a the instance selection method the multi granularity fuzzy discretization and the evolutionary algorithm section 5 presents the experimental part of the paper where the performance of fruler is tested for h m 0 and p predictions in the western coast of the usa finally section 6 closes the paper with some final conclusions and remarks on this research 2 wave parameters of interest calculation of h m 0 and p the accurate characterization of wave parameters is essential in the evaluation of marine systems specifically in the case of wave energy plants or wave energy converters it is necessary to characterize the amount of wave energy available at a particular location which is given by parameters such as h m 0 and p in order to obtain these parameters it is necessary to focus on the water surface and take into account the framework of the linear wave theory in which the vertical wave elevation η r t at a point r x y on the sea surface at time t can be assumed as a superposition of different monochromatic wave components nieto borge et al 2013 goda 2010 this model is appropriate when the free wave components do not vary appreciably in space and time i e statistical temporal stationarity and spatial homogeneity can be assumed goda 2010 in this model the concept of sea state refers to the sea area and the time interval in which the statistical and spectral characteristics of the wave do not change considerably the parameters of a given sea state are then the combined contribution of all parameters from different sources for example the wind sea occurs when the waves are caused by the energy transferred between the local wind and the free surface of the sea the swell is the situation in which the waves have been generated by winds blowing on another far area for instance by storms and propagate towards the region of observation usually sea states are the composition of these two pure states forming multi modal or mixed seas in a given sea state the wave elevation η r t with respect to the mean ocean level can be assumed as a zero mean gaussian stochastic process with statistical symmetry between wave maxima and minima a buoy deployed at point r b takes samples from this process η r b t j j 1 2 t max generating thus a time series of empirical vertical wave elevations the discrete fourier transform dft of this sequence using the fast fourier transform fft algorithm allows estimating the energy spectral density s f its spectral moments of order n can be computed as follows 1 m n 0 f n s f d f the significant wave height swh is then defined as the average in meters of the highest one third of all the wave heights during a 20 min sampling period and it has been widely researched it can be calculated from moment of order 0 in equation 1 as follows 2 h m 0 4 m 0 1 2 on the other hand the wave energy flux is a first indicator of the amount of wave energy available in a given area of the ocean wave energy flux p or power density per meter of wave crest cahill and lewis 2013 can be computed as 3 p ρ g 2 4 π 0 s f f d f ρ g 2 4 π m 1 ρ g 2 64 π h m 0 2 t e where ρ is the sea water density 1025 kg m3 g the acceleration due to gravity h m 0 4 m 0 is the spectral estimation of the significant wave height and t e t 1 0 m 1 m 0 is an estimation of the mean wave period normally known as the period of energy which is used in the design of turbines for wave energy conversion expression 3 with h m 0 in meters and t e in seconds leads to 4 p 0 49 h m 0 2 t e measured in k w m which helps engineers estimate the amount of wave energy available when planning the deployment of wecs at a given location 3 tsk fuzzy rules the tsk fuzzy rule model was developed by takagi sugeno and kang takagi and sugeno 1985 sugeno and kang 1988 as a mathematical tool to fuzzily describe systems using rules where the antecedent is defined with linguistic variables and the consequent is represented as a polynomial function of the input variables these rules are usually denoted as tsk 0 for polynomials of order 0 tsk 1 for polynomials of order 1 and so on the most common function for the consequent of a tsk rule is a linear combination of the x 1 x p input variables tsk 1 5 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is a 2 and and x p is a p then y β 0 x 1 β 1 x 2 β 2 x p β p where x j represents the j th input variable a j is the linguistic fuzzy term for x j β j is the coefficient associated with x j in the consequent part of the rule representing the weight of the importance of each variable in the consequent part and y is the output variable the final output of a tsk fuzzy rule base system with m tsk fuzzy rules can be computed as the weighted average of each outputs y k produced by each rule where the weight corresponds with the matching degree 6 y ˆ k 1 m h k y k k 1 m h k in equation 6 the h k represents the weight applied to each output and it is computed as the matching degree between the antecedent of each rule r k and the inputs x 1 x 2 x p 7 h k t a 1 k x 1 a 2 k x 2 a p k x p where a j k is the linguistic fuzzy term for the j th input variable in the k th rule and t is the t norm conjunctive operator usually the minimum function one of the main advantages of the tsk fuzzy rule systems is that they represent a good trade off between accuracy and interpretability due to full description of the input space using linguistic terms in the antecedent of the rules ability to learn accurate solutions using different well studied statistical methods to optimize the coefficients of the polynomials easy understanding of the relationship between the inputs and outputs using a linear combination of the input variables in the consequent of the rules although the interpretability of tsk fuzzy rules is not as easy a task as in the case of the mamdani approach mamdani and assilian 1975 the use of tsk rules can still bring useful information to many domains 4 fruler fuzzy rule learning through evolution for regression fruler fuzzy rule learning through evolution for regression rodríguez fernández et al 2016a is a genetic fuzzy system that automatically generates accurate tsk 1 fuzzy rules for regression problems 1 1 for a detailed description of fruler please refer to rodríguez fernández et al 2016a the goal of fruler is to generate fuzzy knowledge bases with a high accuracy while keeping a low complexity in the learned rules there is also a scalable distributed version of fruler which is able to solve regression problems for big data rodríguez fernández et al 2016b the main three components of fruler consist of an instance selection method for regression a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm that uses elastic net regularization to generate simple and accurate tsk 1 fuzzy rule bases the first two components of fruler are part of a two stage preprocessing step that was included in the algorithm in order to improve the accuracy and simplicity of the fuzzy rules obtained by the evolutionary algorithm 4 1 instance selection the aim of the instance selection method is to reduce the variance of the models by generating rules using the most representative examples the technique is an improvement of the ccisr class conditional instance selection for regression algorithm rodríguez fernández et al 2013 which is an adaptation for regression of the instance selection method for classification ccis class conditional instance selection marchiori 2010 the selection process starts calculating a score for each of the instances based on the distances to similar and different examples then an initial core of instances is selected sorted by the score after this the instance selection method iteratively selects instances and adds them to the set until the error increases finally in order to further improve the number of selected instances the method applies a post processing step to select examples close to the decision boundary 4 2 multi granularity fuzzy discretization in this step the fuzzy linguistic labels are automatically generated from data through fuzzy discretization fig 1 using a multi granularity approach where each variable v a r is divided into i fuzzy labels i e g v a r i a v a r i 1 a v a r i i the generation of the fuzzy linguistic labels consists of a two step process first the variable is discretized to obtain a set of split points c g for each granularity g these split points are generated in an interative way adding a new split point at each step to generate two new intervals which preserves the interpretability between contiguous granularities then the fuzzy labels are defined for each granularity using the selected split points in fruler the discretization process searches for the split point that minimizes the mean squared error when a linear model is applied to each of the resulting intervals 4 3 evolutionary algorithm finally the objective of the evolutionary algorithm is to learn accurate and simple tsk 1 rule bases for a regression problem the integration of the evolutionary algorithm with the preprocessing stage is as follows 1 the instance selection process is executed over the training examples e t r a in order to obtain a subset of representative examples e s 2 the multi granularity fuzzy discretization algorithm obtains the fuzzy partitions for each input variable 3 the evolutionary algorithm searches for the best data base configuration using the obtained fuzzy partitions generates the entire linguistic tsk rule base using e s and evaluates the different rule bases using e t r a the chromosome in the evolutionary algorithm is codified with a double coding scheme c c 1 c 2 in this encoding c 1 represents the granularity of each input variable in turn c 2 represents the lateral displacements of the split points of the input variables fuzzy partitions fruler uses the wang mendel algorithm to create the antecedent part of the rule base for each individual the coefficients of the consequent part of the rules i e the importance weight of each variable in the consequent is automatically learned using the elastic net method zou and hastie 2005 elastic net linearly combines the ℓ 1 lasso regularization and ℓ 2 ridge regularization penalties of the lasso and ridge methods minimizing the following equation 8 β ˆ arg min β y x β 2 2 λ α β 2 2 λ 1 α β 1 where β is the coefficients vector y is the outputs vector x is the inputs matrix λ is the regularization parameter and α represents the trade off between ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 penalization in order to solve the minimization problem of elastic net equation 8 we used stochastic gradient descent sgd the rule base is generated using only those examples in e s this way those examples that are not representative are not taken into account and therefore the method avoids the generation of too specific rules and reduces the time needed to create the rule base the fitness function is 9 fitness mse e tra 1 2 e i 1 e f x i y i 2 where e t r a is the full training dataset and f x i is the output obtained by the knowledge base for input x i using all the examples for evaluation can be seen in some way as a validation process as the rule base was constructed with a subset of them e s 5 experiments and results to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we present some experiments in which we tackle the estimation of the significant wave height and energy flux with fruler we focus on two aspects of the system its interpretability and accuracy furthermore in order to validate that fruler is able to learn interpretable knowledge bases without loss of accuracy we also compare the results against two other accurate but non interpretable state of the art predictive models 5 1 problem description fig 2 and table 1 show the three buoys considered in this study at the western coast of the usa and their main characteristics noaa in this case we consider the reconstruction of buoy 46069 from a number of predictive variables from the other two buoys for this 10 predictive variables measured at each neighbor buoy are considered a total of 20 predictive variables to carry out the reconstruction table 2 shows details on the predictive variables for this problem data for two complete years 1st january 2009 to 31st december 2010 with a hourly time resolution were used note that complete data without missing values in both predictive and objective variables are available for the considered period in the three buoys 5 2 methodology data were divided into training and test sets in such a way that data from the complete year 2009 were used for the training and data from the complete year 2010 were used for the test to estimate how well the proposed approach performs on unseen data we trained each model using the training data set and we measured the performance of the models on the test set in terms of the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ce the coefficient of efficiency ce proposed by nash and sutcliffe is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as 10 c e 1 i 1 n y i f x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i are the true observations and f x i are the predicted values the range of ce lies between inf 1 where a c e 1 indicates a perfect fit and negative values of the coefficient indicates that the model performs arbitrarily worse finally to validate the interpretability of the rules obtained with fruler we analyzed the resulting knowledge bases and we provide an explanation of the different rules that are consistent with the underlying physical processes of the observed phenomena 5 3 results fruler has been applied to the prediction of h m 0 and p from neighbor buoys fig 2 obtaining accurate estimations but also highly interpretable results supported by the underlying physical processes first we compare the root mean square rmse error and the ce coefficient of fruler with the results of the state of the art hybrid algorithms in the same problem specifically we compare the performance of the fruler approach with a hybrid grouping genetic algorithm extreme learning machine gga elm and a support vector regression algorithm gga svr reported in cornejo bueno et al 2016a table 3 shows the obtained results as can be seen fruler performance is competitive in terms of the quality of results obtained with slightly better performance than gga elm and slightly worse results than gga svr both for h m 0 and p predictions although the performance of all the algorithms is similar gga elm and gga svr are black boxes approaches whereas fruler provides fully interpretable results accordingly to the physical characteristics of the prediction problem this is the main advantage of the prediction system proposed in this paper moreover the scatter plots of the predictions are shown in figs 3 and 4 where the reader can appreciate the similarity in the results among the three methods compared regarding the interpretation of the specific solutions found first we analyze the results for the h m 0 prediction case figs 5 7 show the three rules obtained by fruler for the prediction of h m 0 and the most important variables involved in the final prediction the variables on the left side of the figures represent the multi granularity dicretization of the variables in the antecedent part of the rule as automatically learned by fruler in fig 5 variables m w d 46042 and g s t 46025 were selected for the antecedent part and were discretized into two labels we can interpret these labels as low and high in the case of m w d 46042 the definition of low goes from 0 to 342 whereas high is interpreted as values above 221 note that values between 221 6 and 342 have different degrees of membership for low and high labels as for the case of the g s t 46025 low means those values between 0 and 21 2 and high above 5 7 panel on the right shows the weight of each variable in the consequent part i e the coefficient β j of each variable x j these are the values selected by fruler that minimize the expression represented in equation 8 during the learning process following the definition of a tsk rule as described in equation 5 the tsk rule represented in fig 5 can be defined as 11 if m w d 46042 is high and g s t 46025 is low then y 0 07 w s p d 46042 0 08 g s t 46042 0 12 w t m p 46025 as can be seen all the rules are triggered based only on two antecedent variables m w d 46042 and g s t 46025 i e mean ocean waves direction and wind gust and they mainly correspond to two different physical situations of swell rule 1 and rule 3 and wind sea rule 2 recall that swell is defined as those ocean surface waves which are not generated by the immediate local wind but instead by distant weather systems such as storms etc note that swell is opposed to a locally generated wind wave wind sea which is mainly produced by local mechanisms such as wind blowing in particular for rules 1 and 3 we are in a situation of swell in both cases but the difference between them due to variable mwd mean wave direction note that in rule 1 the antecedent m w d 46042 goes from values of 221 6 to 360 whereas in rule 3 m w d 46042 covers a different range of directions from 0 to 342 approximately this affects the influence that the consequent variables have in the prediction of h m 0 for rule 1 we can appreciate the great impact that the following consequent variables have in the prediction w v h t 46042 m w d 46042 p r e s 46042 w v h t 46025 and p r e s 46025 this is corroborated in fig 5 on the other hand in rule 3 the consequent variables that affect the most in the prediction of h m 0 are w v h t 46042 m w d 46042 w v h t 46025 d p d 46025 a p d 46025 m w d 46025 a t m p 46025 and w t m p 46025 note how the value of h m 0 in both neighbor buoys is included in the prediction as expected plus a number of alternative variables to make the prediction more accurate fig 7 shows that in rule 3 the overall influence of the consequent variables belonging to buoy 46025 is much higher than in rule 1 all the variables from buoy 46025 but w s p d 46025 are important for the prediction this seems reasonable since in this case the swell mainly comes from the south where buoy 46025 is located figs 8 and 9 show these two cases of swell in relation with the mwd in buoy 46042 note the clear difference in the swell situation captured by each rule swell from the north west and swell from the south rule 2 shows a completely different scenario this rule takes into account wind sea situations which are characterized by an irregular sea where local meteorological values have more relevance than in the previous case of swell in this case we must highlight the antecedent g s t 46025 because it is decisive to determine if we are in a swell situation or wind sea condition in rule 2 we can see that the values of g s t 46025 go from 5 7 m s to 21 2 m s which are larger values than those in rules 1 and 3 label g s t 46025 has the maximum membership values in the range 0 5 7 m s this fact causes higher wind gusts that produce the physical situation of wind sea captured in rule 2 the variables with a higher influence in the prediction of rule 2 are w s p d 46042 g s t 46042 a t m p 46042 p r e s 46025 a t m p 46025 and w t m p 46025 it is very interesting to check out that the local meteorological variables have more importance in this case as shown in fig 6 regarding the prediction of the wave energy flux p fruler provides 8 rules figs 10 17 triggered based on 4 antecedent variables w s p d 46042 d p d 46042 m w d 46042 and w t m p 46042 note that in this case the antecedent variables only refer to buoy 46042 a more in depth analysis of these antecedent variables shows that wind speed and the dominant wave period value and direction together with the water temperature are the main variables taken into account by the rules learned with fruler the inclusion of the dominant wave period and its direction in this case is significant as it is fully related to the wave energy flux see equation 4 a direct interpretation of the rules in this case is harder since there are 8 rules however it is possible to locate interpretable swell cases in rules 1 6 and 7 i e high values of period low value of local wind the differences are given by the dominant period direction north in the case of rules 1 and 7 and mainly south in the case of rule 6 rules 1 and 7 are different due to the values of temperature in the latter case the higher the temperature the more important are the variables of buoy 46042 in the prediction mainly the significant wave height and the variables related to the wave period as expected the rest of the rules provided by fruler describe situations of wind sea wave and other local events related to the prediction of wave energy flux in summary the rules learned by fruler are able to obtain very accurate and interpretable predictions both for significant wave height and wave energy flux estimations the comparison with the state of the art approaches reflects that there are no significant differences in accuracy between the best method gga svr and fruler 4 in rmse for h m 0 and 3 for p moreover gga svr is a black box approach while the linguistic rules generated by fruler are fully interpretable and the generated knowledge bases have a low number of rules with few antecedent variables 6 conclusions in this paper we have applied fruler in two different problems related to ocean wave energy significant wave height and wave energy flux predictions using data from three buoys in the california coast the fruler approach is based on an evolutionary algorithm to obtain takagi sugeno kant tsk fuzzy rules together with an instance selection method and a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables we have shown how the proposed system is able to obtain robust and very accurate predictions for both objective variables with a precision very similar to the best state of the art approach moreover the predictions obtained by fruler are fully interpretable in the case of the significant wave height and partially interpretable for the harder case of the energy flux problem acknowledgement this work has been partially supported by projects tin2014 54583 c2 2 r and tin2014 56633 c3 1 r co funded by

23321,this paper proposes a regression genetic fuzzy system gfs fruler for a problem of sea wave parameters estimation from neighbor buoys with application on wave energy systems fruler is a recently proposed three staged algorithm that combines an instance selection method for regression a multigranularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm to generate accurate and simple takagi sugeno kant tsk fuzzy rules we have applied fruler to a real problem of significant wave height and energy flux prediction in one buoy of the west coast of the usa california from values of other two neighbor buoys in the case of the significant wave height fruler is able to obtain a robust prediction with only three rules which in addition are fully interpretable since they clearly separate swell situations from wind sea in the prediction in both cases the variables used in the significant wave prediction are completely different and can be identified as relevant for the specific case swell or wind sea in the case of the energy flux prediction the interpretation of the rules provided by fruler is more difficult since eight rules are necessary to obtain the prediction even in this case several rules can be clearly classified as swell predictors and the rest of the rules describe local wind situation of waves this study shows that the gfss are useful tools to obtain robust and interpretable predictions in ocean wave parameter estimation problems keywords significant wave height wave energy flux marine systems genetic fuzzy systems 1 introduction sea waves parameters prediction problems play an important role in many different ocean engineering tasks such as the design of marine structures like oil platforms or harbours comola et al 2014 kim and suh 2014 or in the design and management of marine energy systems arinaga and cheung 2012 esteban and leary 2012 like the proper operation of wave energy converters lópez et al 2013 among others among the different sea wave parameters the significant wave height h m 0 and the wave energy flux p are the two most studied in the literature in the case of h m 0 it is usually estimated using in situ sensors such as buoys recording time series of wave elevation information the significant wave height prediction is useful for a number of ocean engineering systems including facilities safety in situations of severe weather rao and mandal 2005 chang et al 2011 regarding the sea wave energy flux p it is more related to marine energy bahaj 2011 falcão 2010 which is currently one of the most promising sources of renewable energy still minor at a global level but playing a major role in several offshore islands fadaeenejad et al 2014 rusu and guedes soares 2012 in this case the accurate estimation of the wave energy flux p is relevant to characterize the wave energy production from wave energy converters wecs facilities cuadra et al 2016 the research work on wave parameters prediction systems has been intense in the last years with special incidence in machine learning or soft computing approaches one of the first works on this topic was the direct prediction of h m 0 using artificial neural networks in deo and naidu 1998 improvements on this prediction system were further presented in agrawal and deo 2004 neural networks have also been applied to other problems of h m 0 and p prediction such as tsai et al 2002 where h m 0 and p are inferred from observed wave records using time series neural networks in castro et al 2014 a neural network is applied to estimate the wave energy resource in the northern coast of spain in alexandre et al 2015 and cornejo bueno et al 2016a different hybrid algorithms mixed with an extreme learning machine neural network were proposed for the estimation of h m 0 and p in the context of marine energy applications alternative methods based on different computational approaches have been recently proposed for example in mahjoobi et al 2008 different soft computing techniques are tested for h m 0 prediction support vector regression svr has also been applied to marine energy related problems such as in mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 similarly salcedo sanz et al 2015 and cornejo bueno et al 2016b proposed to feed svr approaches with information from radar sources in order to obtain an accurate prediction of h m 0 and p parameters classification approaches have been applied in fernández et al 2015 to analyze and predict h m 0 and p ranges in buoys for marine energy applications in nitsure et al 2012 use of genetic programming for h m 0 reconstruction problems was proposed in spite of this important research work on the application of different soft computing approaches in wave parameters prediction the use of fuzzy based systems in this field is still under exploration one of the first works on the application of fuzzy systems to wave parameters estimation is kazeminezhad et al 2005 where the performance of an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis in a problem of wave parameters estimation is investigated on real data from lake ontario in sylaios et al 2009 a takagi sugeno rule based fuzzy inference system fis was developed for forecasting sea wave parameters input data such as wind speed and direction and lagged wave characteristics were used in this case the model was successfully applied to data from an oceanographic buoy deployed in the aegean sea greece in özger 2010 a forecasting system based on the combination of wavelet and fuzzy logic approaches was proposed for wave parameters prediction up to 48 h the idea of the system is to use the wavelet technique to separate time series into its spectral bands and then these spectral bands are estimated individually by the fuzzy logic approach results in different deep sea and coastal buoys of the pacific coast of the usa are shown in zanaganeh et al 2009 a hybrid genetic algorithm adaptive network based fuzzy inference system model was developed to forecast h m 0 and the peak spectral period at lake michigan in özger 2009 a neuro fuzzy approach is used to define spatial variability of the significant wave height assumed as a regionalized variable in such a way that it is possible to estimate the significant wave height values of a selected station from neighboring stations which exhibit similar features experiments with buoys in the gulf of mexico show the performance of this approach in stefanakos 2016 fuzzy inference systems fis are combined with adaptive network based fuzzy inference systems anfis for the modelling of non stationary time series for an improved prediction of wind and wave parameters this system was tested with data from weather models in the north atlantic in this paper we propose the application of fruler rodríguez fernández et al 2016a a genetic fuzzy system gfs for regression cordón et al 2001 finotto et al 2013 in a problem of sea wave parameters estimation from neighbor buoys fruler is based on takagi sugeno kant tsk rules and it is composed of an instance selection method for regression a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm that uses a fast and scalable method with elastic net regularization to generate accurate and simple tsk 1 fuzzy rules we show the performance of fruler in a problem of h m 0 and p estimation using three buoys in the west coast of the usa california results are discussed in terms of the good interpretability of the obtained rules which allow an intuitive explanation of the wave parameters reconstruction using a reduced number of rules and predictive variables the rest of the paper is organized as follows next section details the calculation of the parameters of interest in ocean wave characterization h m 0 and p in this case section 3 presents the tsk rules which are learned through fruler section 4 briefly describes the main components of fruler rodríguez fernández et al 2016a the instance selection method the multi granularity fuzzy discretization and the evolutionary algorithm section 5 presents the experimental part of the paper where the performance of fruler is tested for h m 0 and p predictions in the western coast of the usa finally section 6 closes the paper with some final conclusions and remarks on this research 2 wave parameters of interest calculation of h m 0 and p the accurate characterization of wave parameters is essential in the evaluation of marine systems specifically in the case of wave energy plants or wave energy converters it is necessary to characterize the amount of wave energy available at a particular location which is given by parameters such as h m 0 and p in order to obtain these parameters it is necessary to focus on the water surface and take into account the framework of the linear wave theory in which the vertical wave elevation η r t at a point r x y on the sea surface at time t can be assumed as a superposition of different monochromatic wave components nieto borge et al 2013 goda 2010 this model is appropriate when the free wave components do not vary appreciably in space and time i e statistical temporal stationarity and spatial homogeneity can be assumed goda 2010 in this model the concept of sea state refers to the sea area and the time interval in which the statistical and spectral characteristics of the wave do not change considerably the parameters of a given sea state are then the combined contribution of all parameters from different sources for example the wind sea occurs when the waves are caused by the energy transferred between the local wind and the free surface of the sea the swell is the situation in which the waves have been generated by winds blowing on another far area for instance by storms and propagate towards the region of observation usually sea states are the composition of these two pure states forming multi modal or mixed seas in a given sea state the wave elevation η r t with respect to the mean ocean level can be assumed as a zero mean gaussian stochastic process with statistical symmetry between wave maxima and minima a buoy deployed at point r b takes samples from this process η r b t j j 1 2 t max generating thus a time series of empirical vertical wave elevations the discrete fourier transform dft of this sequence using the fast fourier transform fft algorithm allows estimating the energy spectral density s f its spectral moments of order n can be computed as follows 1 m n 0 f n s f d f the significant wave height swh is then defined as the average in meters of the highest one third of all the wave heights during a 20 min sampling period and it has been widely researched it can be calculated from moment of order 0 in equation 1 as follows 2 h m 0 4 m 0 1 2 on the other hand the wave energy flux is a first indicator of the amount of wave energy available in a given area of the ocean wave energy flux p or power density per meter of wave crest cahill and lewis 2013 can be computed as 3 p ρ g 2 4 π 0 s f f d f ρ g 2 4 π m 1 ρ g 2 64 π h m 0 2 t e where ρ is the sea water density 1025 kg m3 g the acceleration due to gravity h m 0 4 m 0 is the spectral estimation of the significant wave height and t e t 1 0 m 1 m 0 is an estimation of the mean wave period normally known as the period of energy which is used in the design of turbines for wave energy conversion expression 3 with h m 0 in meters and t e in seconds leads to 4 p 0 49 h m 0 2 t e measured in k w m which helps engineers estimate the amount of wave energy available when planning the deployment of wecs at a given location 3 tsk fuzzy rules the tsk fuzzy rule model was developed by takagi sugeno and kang takagi and sugeno 1985 sugeno and kang 1988 as a mathematical tool to fuzzily describe systems using rules where the antecedent is defined with linguistic variables and the consequent is represented as a polynomial function of the input variables these rules are usually denoted as tsk 0 for polynomials of order 0 tsk 1 for polynomials of order 1 and so on the most common function for the consequent of a tsk rule is a linear combination of the x 1 x p input variables tsk 1 5 if x 1 is a 1 and x 2 is a 2 and and x p is a p then y β 0 x 1 β 1 x 2 β 2 x p β p where x j represents the j th input variable a j is the linguistic fuzzy term for x j β j is the coefficient associated with x j in the consequent part of the rule representing the weight of the importance of each variable in the consequent part and y is the output variable the final output of a tsk fuzzy rule base system with m tsk fuzzy rules can be computed as the weighted average of each outputs y k produced by each rule where the weight corresponds with the matching degree 6 y ˆ k 1 m h k y k k 1 m h k in equation 6 the h k represents the weight applied to each output and it is computed as the matching degree between the antecedent of each rule r k and the inputs x 1 x 2 x p 7 h k t a 1 k x 1 a 2 k x 2 a p k x p where a j k is the linguistic fuzzy term for the j th input variable in the k th rule and t is the t norm conjunctive operator usually the minimum function one of the main advantages of the tsk fuzzy rule systems is that they represent a good trade off between accuracy and interpretability due to full description of the input space using linguistic terms in the antecedent of the rules ability to learn accurate solutions using different well studied statistical methods to optimize the coefficients of the polynomials easy understanding of the relationship between the inputs and outputs using a linear combination of the input variables in the consequent of the rules although the interpretability of tsk fuzzy rules is not as easy a task as in the case of the mamdani approach mamdani and assilian 1975 the use of tsk rules can still bring useful information to many domains 4 fruler fuzzy rule learning through evolution for regression fruler fuzzy rule learning through evolution for regression rodríguez fernández et al 2016a is a genetic fuzzy system that automatically generates accurate tsk 1 fuzzy rules for regression problems 1 1 for a detailed description of fruler please refer to rodríguez fernández et al 2016a the goal of fruler is to generate fuzzy knowledge bases with a high accuracy while keeping a low complexity in the learned rules there is also a scalable distributed version of fruler which is able to solve regression problems for big data rodríguez fernández et al 2016b the main three components of fruler consist of an instance selection method for regression a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables and an evolutionary algorithm that uses elastic net regularization to generate simple and accurate tsk 1 fuzzy rule bases the first two components of fruler are part of a two stage preprocessing step that was included in the algorithm in order to improve the accuracy and simplicity of the fuzzy rules obtained by the evolutionary algorithm 4 1 instance selection the aim of the instance selection method is to reduce the variance of the models by generating rules using the most representative examples the technique is an improvement of the ccisr class conditional instance selection for regression algorithm rodríguez fernández et al 2013 which is an adaptation for regression of the instance selection method for classification ccis class conditional instance selection marchiori 2010 the selection process starts calculating a score for each of the instances based on the distances to similar and different examples then an initial core of instances is selected sorted by the score after this the instance selection method iteratively selects instances and adds them to the set until the error increases finally in order to further improve the number of selected instances the method applies a post processing step to select examples close to the decision boundary 4 2 multi granularity fuzzy discretization in this step the fuzzy linguistic labels are automatically generated from data through fuzzy discretization fig 1 using a multi granularity approach where each variable v a r is divided into i fuzzy labels i e g v a r i a v a r i 1 a v a r i i the generation of the fuzzy linguistic labels consists of a two step process first the variable is discretized to obtain a set of split points c g for each granularity g these split points are generated in an interative way adding a new split point at each step to generate two new intervals which preserves the interpretability between contiguous granularities then the fuzzy labels are defined for each granularity using the selected split points in fruler the discretization process searches for the split point that minimizes the mean squared error when a linear model is applied to each of the resulting intervals 4 3 evolutionary algorithm finally the objective of the evolutionary algorithm is to learn accurate and simple tsk 1 rule bases for a regression problem the integration of the evolutionary algorithm with the preprocessing stage is as follows 1 the instance selection process is executed over the training examples e t r a in order to obtain a subset of representative examples e s 2 the multi granularity fuzzy discretization algorithm obtains the fuzzy partitions for each input variable 3 the evolutionary algorithm searches for the best data base configuration using the obtained fuzzy partitions generates the entire linguistic tsk rule base using e s and evaluates the different rule bases using e t r a the chromosome in the evolutionary algorithm is codified with a double coding scheme c c 1 c 2 in this encoding c 1 represents the granularity of each input variable in turn c 2 represents the lateral displacements of the split points of the input variables fuzzy partitions fruler uses the wang mendel algorithm to create the antecedent part of the rule base for each individual the coefficients of the consequent part of the rules i e the importance weight of each variable in the consequent is automatically learned using the elastic net method zou and hastie 2005 elastic net linearly combines the ℓ 1 lasso regularization and ℓ 2 ridge regularization penalties of the lasso and ridge methods minimizing the following equation 8 β ˆ arg min β y x β 2 2 λ α β 2 2 λ 1 α β 1 where β is the coefficients vector y is the outputs vector x is the inputs matrix λ is the regularization parameter and α represents the trade off between ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 penalization in order to solve the minimization problem of elastic net equation 8 we used stochastic gradient descent sgd the rule base is generated using only those examples in e s this way those examples that are not representative are not taken into account and therefore the method avoids the generation of too specific rules and reduces the time needed to create the rule base the fitness function is 9 fitness mse e tra 1 2 e i 1 e f x i y i 2 where e t r a is the full training dataset and f x i is the output obtained by the knowledge base for input x i using all the examples for evaluation can be seen in some way as a validation process as the rule base was constructed with a subset of them e s 5 experiments and results to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we present some experiments in which we tackle the estimation of the significant wave height and energy flux with fruler we focus on two aspects of the system its interpretability and accuracy furthermore in order to validate that fruler is able to learn interpretable knowledge bases without loss of accuracy we also compare the results against two other accurate but non interpretable state of the art predictive models 5 1 problem description fig 2 and table 1 show the three buoys considered in this study at the western coast of the usa and their main characteristics noaa in this case we consider the reconstruction of buoy 46069 from a number of predictive variables from the other two buoys for this 10 predictive variables measured at each neighbor buoy are considered a total of 20 predictive variables to carry out the reconstruction table 2 shows details on the predictive variables for this problem data for two complete years 1st january 2009 to 31st december 2010 with a hourly time resolution were used note that complete data without missing values in both predictive and objective variables are available for the considered period in the three buoys 5 2 methodology data were divided into training and test sets in such a way that data from the complete year 2009 were used for the training and data from the complete year 2010 were used for the test to estimate how well the proposed approach performs on unseen data we trained each model using the training data set and we measured the performance of the models on the test set in terms of the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ce the coefficient of efficiency ce proposed by nash and sutcliffe is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as 10 c e 1 i 1 n y i f x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i are the true observations and f x i are the predicted values the range of ce lies between inf 1 where a c e 1 indicates a perfect fit and negative values of the coefficient indicates that the model performs arbitrarily worse finally to validate the interpretability of the rules obtained with fruler we analyzed the resulting knowledge bases and we provide an explanation of the different rules that are consistent with the underlying physical processes of the observed phenomena 5 3 results fruler has been applied to the prediction of h m 0 and p from neighbor buoys fig 2 obtaining accurate estimations but also highly interpretable results supported by the underlying physical processes first we compare the root mean square rmse error and the ce coefficient of fruler with the results of the state of the art hybrid algorithms in the same problem specifically we compare the performance of the fruler approach with a hybrid grouping genetic algorithm extreme learning machine gga elm and a support vector regression algorithm gga svr reported in cornejo bueno et al 2016a table 3 shows the obtained results as can be seen fruler performance is competitive in terms of the quality of results obtained with slightly better performance than gga elm and slightly worse results than gga svr both for h m 0 and p predictions although the performance of all the algorithms is similar gga elm and gga svr are black boxes approaches whereas fruler provides fully interpretable results accordingly to the physical characteristics of the prediction problem this is the main advantage of the prediction system proposed in this paper moreover the scatter plots of the predictions are shown in figs 3 and 4 where the reader can appreciate the similarity in the results among the three methods compared regarding the interpretation of the specific solutions found first we analyze the results for the h m 0 prediction case figs 5 7 show the three rules obtained by fruler for the prediction of h m 0 and the most important variables involved in the final prediction the variables on the left side of the figures represent the multi granularity dicretization of the variables in the antecedent part of the rule as automatically learned by fruler in fig 5 variables m w d 46042 and g s t 46025 were selected for the antecedent part and were discretized into two labels we can interpret these labels as low and high in the case of m w d 46042 the definition of low goes from 0 to 342 whereas high is interpreted as values above 221 note that values between 221 6 and 342 have different degrees of membership for low and high labels as for the case of the g s t 46025 low means those values between 0 and 21 2 and high above 5 7 panel on the right shows the weight of each variable in the consequent part i e the coefficient β j of each variable x j these are the values selected by fruler that minimize the expression represented in equation 8 during the learning process following the definition of a tsk rule as described in equation 5 the tsk rule represented in fig 5 can be defined as 11 if m w d 46042 is high and g s t 46025 is low then y 0 07 w s p d 46042 0 08 g s t 46042 0 12 w t m p 46025 as can be seen all the rules are triggered based only on two antecedent variables m w d 46042 and g s t 46025 i e mean ocean waves direction and wind gust and they mainly correspond to two different physical situations of swell rule 1 and rule 3 and wind sea rule 2 recall that swell is defined as those ocean surface waves which are not generated by the immediate local wind but instead by distant weather systems such as storms etc note that swell is opposed to a locally generated wind wave wind sea which is mainly produced by local mechanisms such as wind blowing in particular for rules 1 and 3 we are in a situation of swell in both cases but the difference between them due to variable mwd mean wave direction note that in rule 1 the antecedent m w d 46042 goes from values of 221 6 to 360 whereas in rule 3 m w d 46042 covers a different range of directions from 0 to 342 approximately this affects the influence that the consequent variables have in the prediction of h m 0 for rule 1 we can appreciate the great impact that the following consequent variables have in the prediction w v h t 46042 m w d 46042 p r e s 46042 w v h t 46025 and p r e s 46025 this is corroborated in fig 5 on the other hand in rule 3 the consequent variables that affect the most in the prediction of h m 0 are w v h t 46042 m w d 46042 w v h t 46025 d p d 46025 a p d 46025 m w d 46025 a t m p 46025 and w t m p 46025 note how the value of h m 0 in both neighbor buoys is included in the prediction as expected plus a number of alternative variables to make the prediction more accurate fig 7 shows that in rule 3 the overall influence of the consequent variables belonging to buoy 46025 is much higher than in rule 1 all the variables from buoy 46025 but w s p d 46025 are important for the prediction this seems reasonable since in this case the swell mainly comes from the south where buoy 46025 is located figs 8 and 9 show these two cases of swell in relation with the mwd in buoy 46042 note the clear difference in the swell situation captured by each rule swell from the north west and swell from the south rule 2 shows a completely different scenario this rule takes into account wind sea situations which are characterized by an irregular sea where local meteorological values have more relevance than in the previous case of swell in this case we must highlight the antecedent g s t 46025 because it is decisive to determine if we are in a swell situation or wind sea condition in rule 2 we can see that the values of g s t 46025 go from 5 7 m s to 21 2 m s which are larger values than those in rules 1 and 3 label g s t 46025 has the maximum membership values in the range 0 5 7 m s this fact causes higher wind gusts that produce the physical situation of wind sea captured in rule 2 the variables with a higher influence in the prediction of rule 2 are w s p d 46042 g s t 46042 a t m p 46042 p r e s 46025 a t m p 46025 and w t m p 46025 it is very interesting to check out that the local meteorological variables have more importance in this case as shown in fig 6 regarding the prediction of the wave energy flux p fruler provides 8 rules figs 10 17 triggered based on 4 antecedent variables w s p d 46042 d p d 46042 m w d 46042 and w t m p 46042 note that in this case the antecedent variables only refer to buoy 46042 a more in depth analysis of these antecedent variables shows that wind speed and the dominant wave period value and direction together with the water temperature are the main variables taken into account by the rules learned with fruler the inclusion of the dominant wave period and its direction in this case is significant as it is fully related to the wave energy flux see equation 4 a direct interpretation of the rules in this case is harder since there are 8 rules however it is possible to locate interpretable swell cases in rules 1 6 and 7 i e high values of period low value of local wind the differences are given by the dominant period direction north in the case of rules 1 and 7 and mainly south in the case of rule 6 rules 1 and 7 are different due to the values of temperature in the latter case the higher the temperature the more important are the variables of buoy 46042 in the prediction mainly the significant wave height and the variables related to the wave period as expected the rest of the rules provided by fruler describe situations of wind sea wave and other local events related to the prediction of wave energy flux in summary the rules learned by fruler are able to obtain very accurate and interpretable predictions both for significant wave height and wave energy flux estimations the comparison with the state of the art approaches reflects that there are no significant differences in accuracy between the best method gga svr and fruler 4 in rmse for h m 0 and 3 for p moreover gga svr is a black box approach while the linguistic rules generated by fruler are fully interpretable and the generated knowledge bases have a low number of rules with few antecedent variables 6 conclusions in this paper we have applied fruler in two different problems related to ocean wave energy significant wave height and wave energy flux predictions using data from three buoys in the california coast the fruler approach is based on an evolutionary algorithm to obtain takagi sugeno kant tsk fuzzy rules together with an instance selection method and a multi granularity fuzzy discretization of the input variables we have shown how the proposed system is able to obtain robust and very accurate predictions for both objective variables with a precision very similar to the best state of the art approach moreover the predictions obtained by fruler are fully interpretable in the case of the significant wave height and partially interpretable for the harder case of the energy flux problem acknowledgement this work has been partially supported by projects tin2014 54583 c2 2 r and tin2014 56633 c3 1 r co funded by

china the frequency dependence of the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor sediments was measured in a laboratory by using a probe method at the frequency range of 25 250 khz the standard deviation of repeated sound speed measurement in fresh water is about 2 82 m s repeated measurement of attenuation shows a minimum standard deviation of 0 58 db at 25 khz and a maximum standard deviation of 3 06 db m at 250 khz the measurement results indicate that the sound speeds vary from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediments and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediments the attenuation increases from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediments and from 7 8 to 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediments the measured sound speed dispersion in sandy silt sediment agrees reasonably with the predictions of the biot stoll model the grain shearing model and the effective density fluid model edfm the measured sound speed in clayey silt sediment agrees better with the predictions of the gs model than that of the biot stoll model and the edfm the measured attenuation is more consistent with f1 2 dependence than the f1 dependence and is similar to the predictions of biot stoll model and the edfm keywords sound speed attenuation coefficient frequency dependence marine sediments probe method 1 introduction the acoustic properties of marine sediments are very significant in several fields such as seafloor engineering sediment classification and underwater acoustics jackson and richardson 2007 the seafloor sediments are usually composed of solid particles and pore fluid the acoustic properties of granular water saturated seafloor sediments can be predicted by hamilton s empirical equations hamilton 1980 the biot stoll model biot 1956a 1956b stoll 1977 1989 the effective density fluid model edfm williams 2001 and the grain shearing gs model buckingham 1997 2000 besides model predictions the sound speed and attenuation of seafloor sediments can be measured by in situ experiment techniques gorgas et al 2003 robb et al 2006 liu et al 2013 hou et al 2014 remote sensing techniques zhou et al 2009 laboratory measurement techniques and so on among these techniques laboratory measurements can obtain the geotechnical and acoustic parameters of small scale sediment cores simultaneously many investigators have developed a number of laboratory measurement techniques such as the compressional wave probe system baldwin et al 1981 the full waveform core logger breitzke and spiess 1993 the multi sensor core logger mscl best and gunn 1999 and the temperature and pressure controlled acoustical measurement system zou et al 2014 these laboratory methods mainly consist of axial and crosswise acoustic measurements with a planar transducer or a probe transducer on sectioned or unsectioned sediment cores ultrasonic measurements with two planar transducers may lead to larger errors which are caused by the unidentical coupling between the transducers and the cores when repeated measurements are made using transducers with different central frequencies this makes it difficult to obtain accurate attenuation of sediment buckingham 2005 different from the planar transducer method where two planar transducers are used the probe method uses two probe transducers as receivers which are inserted into the sediment core and stay there during the whole measurement this reduces the time of the transducers emitting and receiving transducers are inserted into core sections so the error caused by the coupling is reduced correspondingly the error caused by coupling between emitting transducers and core sections can also be avoided effectively by using the correlation comparison of waveforms received by the two probes to calculate sound speed and attenuation so the probe method is helpful for obtaining more accurate acoustic properties at different frequencies baldwin et al 1981 the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation has been measured in seafloor sediments by a number of investigators williams et al 2002 hefner and williams 2006 turgut and yamamoto 2008 nosal et al 2008 most of these researchers have measured the variations of sound speed and attenuation with the frequency ranging from a few hundreds of hertz up to a few thousands of kilohertz zimmer et al 2010 where applications of interest include ranges that are sufficiently long to include interactions with the sea bottom lee et al 2007 the sound speed was found with a positive dispersion at frequencies lower than about 300 khz in both laboratory and in situ conditions which can be predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm sessarego et al 2008 turgut and yamamoto 1990 observed that the sound speed at low frequency was at least 5 10 lower than the sound speed at high frequency in the range of 1 30 khz in medium sand sediments by using cross hole measurements and turgut et al 2005 observed weak sound speed dispersion in silty sediments and no sound speed dispersion in muddy sediments from 20 to 100 khz by using a wideband acoustic probe system huang et al 2013 found a very weak sound speed dispersion in sandy sediment in the frequency range of 90 170 khz sessarego et al 2008 found negative dispersion of sound speed at frequencies higher than 500 khz which differs from the prediction of the biot stoll model in the above research most of the measurements of sound speed dispersion agree well with the predictions of the biot stoll model except the measurements at frequencies higher than 500 khz made by sessarego et al 2008 different frequency dependence of attenuation has been found in different studies of the acoustic properties in seafloor sediment hamilton s empirical regression 1980 consistently maintain that the attenuation increases linearly at high frequencies and the gs model indicates that attenuation is almost but not quite linear with frequency buckingham 2005 while the biot stoll model suggests that the attenuation deviates from a first power dependence on frequency and varies with the square root of frequency at high frequency stoll 1989 lee et al 2007 found that the attenuation increases nonlinearly with frequency from 0 3 to 1 0 mhz and sessarego et al 2008 also found nonlinear frequency dependence of measured attenuation which appears to be proportional to f 2 at frequencies higher than 500 khz ohkawa 2006 demonstrated that the deviation of attenuation between the prediction of the biot model and the measured data at high frequency is due to the effect of the scattering from sediment grains therefore there are still some differences about the frequency dependence of measured attenuation and the corresponding acoustic models although measurements of sound speed and attenuation at high frequency are relatively straightforward measurements over a wide frequency range are still difficult due to the limited frequency bandwidth of the individual measurement methods hefner et al 2009 zimmer et al 2010 and the inherent difficulty of measuring attenuation at low frequencies where the acoustic wavelength is larger therefore the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in various sediments need to be studied further and the suitability of the biot stoll model the edfm or the gs model for predicting the variations of sound speed and attenuation over a broad band frequency needs to be verified moreover sediment cores collected from the seafloor are not always well sorted sandy sediments so acoustic measurements of sediment cores for more types of sediments are of significance for the study of the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation the objective of this study is to measure and study the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation for compressional waves in two types of fine grained sediment cores over the frequency range from 25 to 250 khz for the work reported here the sound speed and attenuation were measured by using a probe method for a sandy silt sediment and a clayey silt sediment the measured data were compared with the biot stoll model the gs model and the edfm finally the applicability of the acoustic wave propagation models for the measured frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation were evaluated within the 25 250 khz frequency band 2 materials and measuring methods 2 1 fine grained sediments there were 12 sediment cores collected from the tidal flat of jiaozhou bay near to qingdao city using a gravity sampler and stored in pvc tubes with a diameter of 110 mm the water depths of the sampling sites were 2 17 m and the water temperatures of the sampling sites were about 6 c for this study a sandy silt sediment core and a clayey silt sediment core were selected among the 12 sediment cores for measurement of the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation using the probe method the lengths of the sandy silt core and the clayey silt core were 35 and 60 cm respectively the measured porosities were 0 538 and 0 635 respectively the wet densities were 1790 and 1520 kg m3 respectively the measured grain mass densities were 2690 kg m3 the sand silt clay components and mean grain sizes were measured using a malvern 2000 granulometer the analytical measurement error for the particle size analysis was less than 2 the mean grain diameters ϕ were 3 65 and 5 16 respectively the sorting coefficient is defined by the ratio of the 25 and 75 grain sizes on the cumulative particle diameter curve and was used as a reference for sorting characteristics of the seafloor sediments the sorting coefficient was 2 07 for sandy silt sediments showing poor sorting and indicating that the sediments have complex particle compositions for the clayey silt sediments the sorting coefficient was 1 12 which shows good sorting all the physical properties were measured under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and the temperature range of 20 23 c 2 2 measurements of acoustic properties a probe method was used to obtain the sound wave signals in sediment cores which were stored in pvc tubes the method used two probe transducers as receivers which were inserted into the cores and stayed there during the whole measurement fig 1 the sound speed and attenuation were calculated based on the difference of the travel time and amplitude of the sound wave signals which traveled over different path lengths in the sediment cores and were received by two probe transducers the entire measurement system includes a measuring platform a pulser collecter wsd 3 digital sonic instrument six planar emitting transducers and two broad band receiving transducers the wsd 3 instrument was produced by chongqing benteng digital control technology institute http www cqbtsk com cn english sonic wsd 3 htm wtih a minimum pulse with of 1μs for emission and a maximum sampling rate of 10 mhz for receiving the transducers were designed and made by wuxi hongzhi transducer technology co ltd the central frequencies of the six planar emitting transducers are 25 khz 50 khz 100 khz 150 khz 200 khz and 250 khz respectively during the measurement the sediment core was placed on the measuring platform at first then the planar emitting transducer was pressed onto one side of the sample core section and the two receiving probes were inserted into the sample core with insertion depth exceeding 65 mm a pulse signal was emitted at the central frequency of each emitting transducer after traveling through in the sediment core the sound wave was received by the two receiving probes and recorded by the wsd 3 instrument simultaneously with 0 1 μs sampling interval and 409 6 μs recording duration the waveforms in the sandy silt sediments received by r1 and r2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively when the measurement was finished at one frequency the emitting transducer was replaced by another transducer with a different central frequency while the two receiving probes still remained in the core the same procedure was performed until all six emitting transducers were used to get data spanning the frequency range of 25 250 khz through the correlation between the signals received at probes r1 and r2 the arrival time difference of sound waves between probes r1 and r2 can be obtained and it is denoted as δt for the acoustic signals of 25 150 khz the correlation was done using the full waveform and for the acoustic signals of 200 250 khz the correlation was done using the first two cycles before calculating the attenuation the recorded acoustic signals were done the narrow band filtering the amplitudes at the measurement frequencies in the frequency spectra of the sound waveforms received by probes r1 and r2 in the sediment are denoted by a1 and a2 respectively the amplitudes at the measurement frequencies in the frequency spectra of the sound waveforms received by r1 and r2 in fresh water are denoted by aw1 and aw2 thus the sound speed c p in m s and attenuation coefficient α in db m can be calculated by 1 c p l 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 2 α 20 log 10 a 1 a 2 log 10 a w 1 a w 2 l 2 l 1 where t1 and t2 are the travel time from the emitting transducer t to the receiving probes r1 and r2 l1 and l2 are the distances from the emitting transducer t to the receiving probes r1 and r2 shown in fig 1 l2 l1 is about 5 cm in these measurements 2 3 evaluation of uncertainty of the measurements in order to analyze the uncertainty of the sound speed measurement the probe method was tested in a small tank filled with fresh water with a volume of 30 cm 50 cm 100 cm the waveforms received in water at different frequencies and the frequency spectra are shown in fig 3 the temperature of the water was measured when each measurement was made the measured temperature of the water ranged from 16 2 to 17 0 c and the salinity was 0 the sound speed of sea water c w in m s can be calculated by medwin s equation medwin 1975 3 c w 1449 2 4 6 t 0 055 t 2 0 00029 t 3 1 34 0 010 t s 35 0 016 z where t represents the temperature of water in c s represents the salinity in and z represents the depth of water in meters the calculated sound speed of water using the measured temperature ranged from 1468 1 to 1470 6 m s with the average value of 1469 3 m s the standard deviation of the calculated sound speed is approximately 0 88 m s due to the variation of temperature the travel time measurement for the sound speed of water was repeated six times using the probe method shown in fig 1 and the sound speed was obtained using the travel time difference and the propagation distance with eq 1 table 1 shows the calculated and measured sound speed in water the measured sound speed of water ranged from 1465 7 to 1473 8 m s with the average value of 1469 9 m s the standard deviation of the measured sound speed in water is approximately 2 82 m s in order to obtain the spreading loss of the acoustic wave emitted by transducers at different ranges for use in correcting the acoustic attenuation measured in sediment cores the sound waveforms were received over different probe separations within a pvc tube in a tank for six repeated acoustic measurements in the same location the sound attenuation in water caused by spreading loss for a planar emitting transducer was found with standard deviations of 0 58 1 09 db m at frequencies in the range of 25 150 khz larger standard deviations of 2 11 db m at 200 khz and of 3 06 db m at 250 khz were found which may have been due to the lower receiving sensitivity of the receiving probes at high frequency 3 results and discussion 3 1 the frequency dependence of sound speed the frequency dependence of the measured sound speed is shown in fig 4 which indicates that sound speed increases slowly with frequency from 25 to 250 khz for both types of sediment the measurement results indicate that the sound speeds range approximately from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediments and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediments with a weak positive linear gradient from 25 to 250 khz the sound speeds of the sandy silt sediments are higher than those of the clayey silt sediments these sound speeds are for the temperature range of 20 23 c and the influence of this small change of temperature on sound speed is negligible according to hamilton s empirical relationship between porosity and acoustic properties hamilton 1980 the sound speed of higher porosity sediments is lower than that of the lower porosity sediments which conforms to the acoustic measurement results in this study the solid and dashed lines in fig 4 are the least square fits to the data with very high correlation coefficients indicating a weak linear relationship between sound speed and frequency that can be given as 4 c p 1641 9 0 0637 f r 0 81 sandy silt 5 c p 1548 6 0 0962 f r 0 94 clayey silt where f is frequency in khz and c p is the sound speed in m s for the sandy silt sediments eq 4 and the clayey silt sediments eq 5 where r is the correlation coefficient machin et al 2011 according to these equations the mean rate of increase in sound speed was 0 0637 m s 1 khz 1 for sandy silt sediments and 0 0962 m s 1 khz 1 for clayey silt sediments between 25 and 250 khz the results indicate that the sound speeds in the two types of sediments have weak positive gradients with frequency 3 2 the frequency dependence of attenuation the frequency dependence of measured attenuation is shown in fig 5 the measurement results indicate that the attenuation coefficient ranges from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediment and from 7 8 to 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediment with strong positive gradients from 25 to 250 khz hamilton 1972 consistently maintained that the frequency dependence of attenuation in sediments obeys an f 1 dependence with an attenuation factor k and suggested that the frequency dependence of attenuation measured in decibels per unit length can be given by 6 α k f 1 where α is the attenuation coefficient in db m f is the frequency in khz the attenuation factor k can be obtained from the regression fits to the data and from empirical relationships based on porosity mean grain size or bulk density versus k the solid and dashed lines in fig 5a show linear regression fits to the measured attenuation coefficient α in db m and frequency f in khz and these fits can be given by 7 α 0 225 f 1 r 0 85 sandy silt 8 α 0 137 f 1 r 0 87 clayey silt eq 7 and eq 8 express the relationship in sandy silt sediments and in clayey silt sediments respectively according to the equations the measured attenuation factor k is 0 225 db m 1 khz 1 for sandy silt sediment and is 0 137 db m 1 khz 1 for clayey silt sediments these measured attenuation factors are listed in table 2 table 2 also shows the predicted attenuation factor values using hamilton s jackson and richardson s and buckingham s regression curves hamilton 1980 established empirical f 1 relationships for porosity and mean grain size versus the attenuation factor k jackson and richardson 2007 established empirical relationships for porosity mean grain size and bulk density versus attenuation factor k based on in situ measured data using issams buckingham 2005 established regression curves for mean grain size versus attenuation factor k in table 2 the attenuation factors predicted using hamilton s and buckingham s regression curves are listed in the form of the range of values and the attenuation factors predicted using jackson and richardson s regression equations are listed in the form of the average values the comparisons show that the measured attenuation factors conform well to the predicted attenuation factor versus physical properties of jackson and richardson s and falls within the predicted ranges of buckingham s although the measured attenuation factor of sandy silt sediment is lower than the value predicted by hamilton s empirical equation based on porosity the measured attenuation factors falls well within the value ranges predicted by hamilton s empirical equation based on mean grain size according to the biot stoll model stoll 1989 the attenuation coefficient deviates from a first power dependence on frequency and varies as the square root of frequency at the high frequencies of interest here the f 1 2 frequency dependence fit to the measured attenuation coefficient can be given by 9 α 3 06 f 1 2 r 0 97 sandy silt 10 α 1 84 f 1 2 r 0 96 clayey silt where r is also the correlation coefficient eq 9 and eq 10 express the relationship between attenuation and frequency in sandy silt sediments and in clayey silt sediments respectively both these equations and fig 5b indicate that the gradient of attenuation coefficient with frequency in sandy silt sediment is larger than that in clayey silt sediment compared with the f 1 dependence of attenuation coefficient the f 1 2 dependence has a much better agreement with the measured results which indicates the attenuation coefficient increases nonlinearly with frequency hamilton 1980 compiled attenuation measurements and argued for an f 1 dependence for attenuation over 1 100 khz hovem and ingram 1979 compared the measured data using water saturated glass beads with hamilton s predictions and to the biot stoll model and suggested that the measured data were quite close to f 1 2 dependence at 20 300 khz kibblewhite 1989 concluded that the linear relationship between attenuation and frequency from seismic to ultrasonic frequencies does not appear justified in the biot stoll model acoustic wave attenuation is primarily attributed to viscous losses due to relative motion between the pore fluid and the skeletal frame and the absorption attenuation follows an f 1 2 dependence at high frequencies corresponding to viscous dissipation of the pore fluid ohkawa 2006 found that the frequency dependence of attenuation follows the biot theory at frequencies from 50 to 200 khz and scattering attenuation is dominant at frequencies greater than 200 khz when the mean grain size of sands ranges from 400 μm to 500 μm sessarego et al 2008 concluded that the measured attenuation follows an f 1 2 dependence agreeing with the biot stoll model from 100 to 200 khz and seems to be proportional to f 2 dependence at high frequencies more than 500 khz in the well sorted sand having a mean grain size of 245 μm this study mentioned that the combined effect of the viscous losses and strong scattering by sand particles leads to the f 2 dependence at high frequencies lee et al 2007 also found the attenuation increases nonlinearly at frequencies from 0 3 to 1 0 mhz seifert et al 1999 provided the empirical f 2 dependence of scattering attenuation obtaining by curve fitting to the experimental data for water saturated fine sands in the present study the attenuation of fine grained sediments is in closer accordance with the f 1 2 dependence than the f 1 dependence which is probably due to the viscous dissipation according to biot stoll model and the effects of scattering attenuation are not apparent for the fine grained sediments at frequencies lower than 250 khz the comparisons between measured results and theoretical predictions will be introduced in next section 3 3 comparison between measured data and theoretical models the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model are available geoacoustic propagation models for predicting the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor sediments the biot stoll model for elastic wave propagation in porous media has been applied to water saturated sediments and was modified to the edfm through setting the bulk modulus and shear modulus to be zero by williams 2001 the gs model is another common model for wave propagation in saturated unconsolidated sediments established by buckingham 1997 and assumes the sediment grains are not locked together and the shear rigidity modulus is zero all these models can be used to predict the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation in response to an acoustic excitation the first two models account for the relative motion between pore fluid and the granular skeleton and the third model accounts for relative motion between grains chotiros and isakson 2004 buckingham 2005 the measured sound speed and attenuation are compared with the theoretical predictions of the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model the input physical parameters of the biot stoll model and the edfm are summarized in table 3 the input physical parameters of the gs model are summarized in table 4 the parameters including porosity mean grain diameter mass density of grains and measurement depth were measured directly because permeability tortuosity and pore size were difficult to measure directly we used empirical equations to calculated these parameters according to the physical relationship of kozeny carman holland and brunson 1988 the permeability κ in m2 can be approximated by 11 κ 1 k s 0 2 β 3 1 β 2 where s 0 is the specific surface of the particles in the sediment in m 1 and can be defined as s0 6 μ g where u g is the mean grain diameter in meters shown in table 4 k is an empirical constant approximately equal to 5 and β is the porosity the tortuosity α can be calculated following stoll 1977 12 α 1 35 0 3 0 4125 φ 3 0 φ 4 4 φ 8 φ 8 where ϕ is the mean grain size and is dimensionless φ log 2 u g where u g is the mean grain diameter in millimeters the pore size parameter a in meters can be computed by the following relation from johnson et al 1987 13 a 8 α κ β some parameters were estimated from the literature williams et al 2002 hefner and jackson 2010 jackson and richardson 2007 including the fluid bulk modulus the grain bulk modulus and the dynamic viscosity of pore fluid the frame bulk modulus and the frame shear modulus were calculated by schock s equation schock 2004 in the edfm the frame bulk modulus and the frame shear modulus are set to zero williams 2001 the longitudinal coefficient the shear coefficient and the strain hardening index for the gs model are described in the literature buckingham 2005 and were obtained through fitting the gs dispersion to the measured sound speed and attenuation coefficient at 100 khz the comparison between the measured sound speed and predictions of models in sandy silt sediment is shown in fig 6 the solid the red dashed and the dotted curves in fig 6 represent the sound speeds predicted by the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model respectively over the frequency range from 25 to 250 khz the biot stoll model and edfm predict a slightly positive sound speed dispersion of sandy silt sediments in the trend of f 1 2 and the gs model exhibits an approximately linear dispersion of sound speed the results show that the predictions by the edfm and biot stoll model have almost the same sound speed dispersion characteristics for sandy silt sediment although the sound speed from the edfm being slightly lower than that from biot stoll model the comparison in fig 6 also shows that the measured and predicted sound speeds have similar slightly positive dispersion which indicates that these models are suitable for predicting the dispersion of sound speed in sandy silt sediment from 25 to 250 khz the comparisons between the measured and the predicted attenuation in sandy silt sediment are shown in fig 7 the results shows that the attenuation predicted by the biot stoll and gs models show different frequency dependence the tendency of measured attenuation frequency dependence agrees better with the predictions of the biot stoll model and edfm than that of the gs model for sandy silt sediment this implies that the measured attenuation is in greater agreement with the f 1 2 dependence however the high frequency attenuation data lie essentially parallel to but above the predicted values by the biot stoll model and the edfm using the parameters from table 3 the transition from f 1 2 dependence to an f 1 dependence is not clearly observed for frequencies up to 250 khz for sandy silt sediments while the measured attenuation for medium sands show an approximate f 1 2 dependence that transitions to an f 1 dependence at a frequency of about 100 khz as reported in williams et al 2002 the measured and predicted sound speeds and attenuation of clayey silt sediment are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as seen in fig 8 the measured sound speed has a similar slightly positive dispersion compared with the predictions of the three different models the dispersion gradient of measured sound speed is slightly larger than that of the sound speed predicted by biot stoll model and the edfm but it agrees well with the prediction of the gs model as seen in fig 9 the tendency of measured frequency dependence of attenuation agrees well with the predictions of the biot stoll model and edfm which again indicates that the measured attenuation is in closer agreement with the f1 2 dependence than the f1 dependence in contrast to the sandy silt sediment the measured attenuation coefficient of clayey silt sediment can be well fit with the theoretical values predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm using the parameters from table 3 the results of fitting the frequency dependence of attenuation in sandy silt sediment suggest that the biot stoll model and the edfm can account for the measured attenuation the gs model produces a more rapid increase with frequency than the measured attenuation in both the sandy silt and clayey silt sediments which may suggest that the relaxation mechanism in the gs model may not be fully applicable to fine grained sediments the electrostatic repulsion electrostatic attraction and the adhesion of organic matter in fine grained sediments control the particle to particle interactions and therefore the motion between particles may not be significant and may not cause obvious dissipation for acoustic waves jackson and richardson 2007 in contrast the relative motion between the porefluid and the granular skeleton may be the main dissipation mechanism for the sediments in the frequency range studied although the biot stoll model and edfm can fit the increase trend of measured attenuation with frequency relatively well there are still some differences between the predicted and measured values over the entire frequency range for sandy silt sediment these differences are likely due to the values obtained for the permeability pore size and tortuosity parameters these input parameters have uncertainties which are not really known and have not been provided in the literature for eqs 11 13 in order to understand the offset between measured sound speed and attenuation and prediction based on the biot stoll model and the edfm we changed each parameter to improve the fit between the measured data and the models the best simultaneous data model fit curves of sandy silt sediments obtained by varying permeability tortuosity and pore size are shown in figs 10 and 11 for a best simultaneous data model fit the permeability needs to be changed from 2 56 10 11 m2 to 2 10 10 11 m2 the tortuosity needs to be changed from 1 35 to 1 30 and the pore size needs to be changed from 2 27 10 5 m to 2 03 10 5 m the inconsistency of the calculated permeability tortuosity and pore size to the best fit value may be due to the simplification of porosity and grain size by the models the irregular pore structure of the actual sediment may not permit all of the porosity to contribute to the dispersion mechanisms described by the model which has been verified by other measurements nosal et al 2008 zimmer et al 2010 as a clarification the values of unmeasured physical parameters for prediction models used in this study were determined by fitting to the measured sound speed or calculating using empirical formulas from the literature such as shock s equations however some parameters such as the bulk modulus usually were summarized other results for coarse sandy sediments the general applicability of these physical parameters is an issue worthy of investigation which was not addressed in this study in addition since some input parameters of geoacoustic models are difficult to be measured some empirical and analytical formulas are needed to obtain the parameters for prediction of sound speed and attenuation thus more empirical and analytical formulas with uncertainty bounds for predicting the physical parameters of various sediments need to be established based on further experiments and studies 4 conclusion the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in two types of fine grained sediments have been measured by using a probe method over a frequency range band from 25 to 250 khz the results indicate that the sound speeds range approximately from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediment and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediment with weak linear gradient over the frequency from 25 to 250 khz the attenuation coefficient ranges from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediment and 7 8 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediment with a strong positive gradient in the same frequency band the attenuation coefficient of fine grained sediment is in closer agreement with the f 1 2 dependence than the f 1 dependence and is not clearly observed with a transition from f 1 2 dependence to an f 1 dependence for frequencies up to 250 khz the comparisons between the measured and predicted sound speed show that the measured sound speed in sandy silt sediment agrees reasonably with the theoretical curves predicted by the biot stoll edfm and gs models the measured sound speed in clayey silt sediment agrees better with the theoretical curves predicted by the gs model than that of the biot stoll model and the edfm both the measured attenuation frequency dependence in sandy silt sediment and in clayey silt sediment are more similar to the theoretical curves predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm than that predicted by the gs model in addition this study suggests that more empirical formulas with uncertainty bounds for predicting the input physical parameters of acoustic propagation models for various sediments need to be established based on results from more

china the frequency dependence of the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor sediments was measured in a laboratory by using a probe method at the frequency range of 25 250 khz the standard deviation of repeated sound speed measurement in fresh water is about 2 82 m s repeated measurement of attenuation shows a minimum standard deviation of 0 58 db at 25 khz and a maximum standard deviation of 3 06 db m at 250 khz the measurement results indicate that the sound speeds vary from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediments and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediments the attenuation increases from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediments and from 7 8 to 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediments the measured sound speed dispersion in sandy silt sediment agrees reasonably with the predictions of the biot stoll model the grain shearing model and the effective density fluid model edfm the measured sound speed in clayey silt sediment agrees better with the predictions of the gs model than that of the biot stoll model and the edfm the measured attenuation is more consistent with f1 2 dependence than the f1 dependence and is similar to the predictions of biot stoll model and the edfm keywords sound speed attenuation coefficient frequency dependence marine sediments probe method 1 introduction the acoustic properties of marine sediments are very significant in several fields such as seafloor engineering sediment classification and underwater acoustics jackson and richardson 2007 the seafloor sediments are usually composed of solid particles and pore fluid the acoustic properties of granular water saturated seafloor sediments can be predicted by hamilton s empirical equations hamilton 1980 the biot stoll model biot 1956a 1956b stoll 1977 1989 the effective density fluid model edfm williams 2001 and the grain shearing gs model buckingham 1997 2000 besides model predictions the sound speed and attenuation of seafloor sediments can be measured by in situ experiment techniques gorgas et al 2003 robb et al 2006 liu et al 2013 hou et al 2014 remote sensing techniques zhou et al 2009 laboratory measurement techniques and so on among these techniques laboratory measurements can obtain the geotechnical and acoustic parameters of small scale sediment cores simultaneously many investigators have developed a number of laboratory measurement techniques such as the compressional wave probe system baldwin et al 1981 the full waveform core logger breitzke and spiess 1993 the multi sensor core logger mscl best and gunn 1999 and the temperature and pressure controlled acoustical measurement system zou et al 2014 these laboratory methods mainly consist of axial and crosswise acoustic measurements with a planar transducer or a probe transducer on sectioned or unsectioned sediment cores ultrasonic measurements with two planar transducers may lead to larger errors which are caused by the unidentical coupling between the transducers and the cores when repeated measurements are made using transducers with different central frequencies this makes it difficult to obtain accurate attenuation of sediment buckingham 2005 different from the planar transducer method where two planar transducers are used the probe method uses two probe transducers as receivers which are inserted into the sediment core and stay there during the whole measurement this reduces the time of the transducers emitting and receiving transducers are inserted into core sections so the error caused by the coupling is reduced correspondingly the error caused by coupling between emitting transducers and core sections can also be avoided effectively by using the correlation comparison of waveforms received by the two probes to calculate sound speed and attenuation so the probe method is helpful for obtaining more accurate acoustic properties at different frequencies baldwin et al 1981 the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation has been measured in seafloor sediments by a number of investigators williams et al 2002 hefner and williams 2006 turgut and yamamoto 2008 nosal et al 2008 most of these researchers have measured the variations of sound speed and attenuation with the frequency ranging from a few hundreds of hertz up to a few thousands of kilohertz zimmer et al 2010 where applications of interest include ranges that are sufficiently long to include interactions with the sea bottom lee et al 2007 the sound speed was found with a positive dispersion at frequencies lower than about 300 khz in both laboratory and in situ conditions which can be predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm sessarego et al 2008 turgut and yamamoto 1990 observed that the sound speed at low frequency was at least 5 10 lower than the sound speed at high frequency in the range of 1 30 khz in medium sand sediments by using cross hole measurements and turgut et al 2005 observed weak sound speed dispersion in silty sediments and no sound speed dispersion in muddy sediments from 20 to 100 khz by using a wideband acoustic probe system huang et al 2013 found a very weak sound speed dispersion in sandy sediment in the frequency range of 90 170 khz sessarego et al 2008 found negative dispersion of sound speed at frequencies higher than 500 khz which differs from the prediction of the biot stoll model in the above research most of the measurements of sound speed dispersion agree well with the predictions of the biot stoll model except the measurements at frequencies higher than 500 khz made by sessarego et al 2008 different frequency dependence of attenuation has been found in different studies of the acoustic properties in seafloor sediment hamilton s empirical regression 1980 consistently maintain that the attenuation increases linearly at high frequencies and the gs model indicates that attenuation is almost but not quite linear with frequency buckingham 2005 while the biot stoll model suggests that the attenuation deviates from a first power dependence on frequency and varies with the square root of frequency at high frequency stoll 1989 lee et al 2007 found that the attenuation increases nonlinearly with frequency from 0 3 to 1 0 mhz and sessarego et al 2008 also found nonlinear frequency dependence of measured attenuation which appears to be proportional to f 2 at frequencies higher than 500 khz ohkawa 2006 demonstrated that the deviation of attenuation between the prediction of the biot model and the measured data at high frequency is due to the effect of the scattering from sediment grains therefore there are still some differences about the frequency dependence of measured attenuation and the corresponding acoustic models although measurements of sound speed and attenuation at high frequency are relatively straightforward measurements over a wide frequency range are still difficult due to the limited frequency bandwidth of the individual measurement methods hefner et al 2009 zimmer et al 2010 and the inherent difficulty of measuring attenuation at low frequencies where the acoustic wavelength is larger therefore the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in various sediments need to be studied further and the suitability of the biot stoll model the edfm or the gs model for predicting the variations of sound speed and attenuation over a broad band frequency needs to be verified moreover sediment cores collected from the seafloor are not always well sorted sandy sediments so acoustic measurements of sediment cores for more types of sediments are of significance for the study of the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation the objective of this study is to measure and study the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation for compressional waves in two types of fine grained sediment cores over the frequency range from 25 to 250 khz for the work reported here the sound speed and attenuation were measured by using a probe method for a sandy silt sediment and a clayey silt sediment the measured data were compared with the biot stoll model the gs model and the edfm finally the applicability of the acoustic wave propagation models for the measured frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation were evaluated within the 25 250 khz frequency band 2 materials and measuring methods 2 1 fine grained sediments there were 12 sediment cores collected from the tidal flat of jiaozhou bay near to qingdao city using a gravity sampler and stored in pvc tubes with a diameter of 110 mm the water depths of the sampling sites were 2 17 m and the water temperatures of the sampling sites were about 6 c for this study a sandy silt sediment core and a clayey silt sediment core were selected among the 12 sediment cores for measurement of the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation using the probe method the lengths of the sandy silt core and the clayey silt core were 35 and 60 cm respectively the measured porosities were 0 538 and 0 635 respectively the wet densities were 1790 and 1520 kg m3 respectively the measured grain mass densities were 2690 kg m3 the sand silt clay components and mean grain sizes were measured using a malvern 2000 granulometer the analytical measurement error for the particle size analysis was less than 2 the mean grain diameters ϕ were 3 65 and 5 16 respectively the sorting coefficient is defined by the ratio of the 25 and 75 grain sizes on the cumulative particle diameter curve and was used as a reference for sorting characteristics of the seafloor sediments the sorting coefficient was 2 07 for sandy silt sediments showing poor sorting and indicating that the sediments have complex particle compositions for the clayey silt sediments the sorting coefficient was 1 12 which shows good sorting all the physical properties were measured under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and the temperature range of 20 23 c 2 2 measurements of acoustic properties a probe method was used to obtain the sound wave signals in sediment cores which were stored in pvc tubes the method used two probe transducers as receivers which were inserted into the cores and stayed there during the whole measurement fig 1 the sound speed and attenuation were calculated based on the difference of the travel time and amplitude of the sound wave signals which traveled over different path lengths in the sediment cores and were received by two probe transducers the entire measurement system includes a measuring platform a pulser collecter wsd 3 digital sonic instrument six planar emitting transducers and two broad band receiving transducers the wsd 3 instrument was produced by chongqing benteng digital control technology institute http www cqbtsk com cn english sonic wsd 3 htm wtih a minimum pulse with of 1μs for emission and a maximum sampling rate of 10 mhz for receiving the transducers were designed and made by wuxi hongzhi transducer technology co ltd the central frequencies of the six planar emitting transducers are 25 khz 50 khz 100 khz 150 khz 200 khz and 250 khz respectively during the measurement the sediment core was placed on the measuring platform at first then the planar emitting transducer was pressed onto one side of the sample core section and the two receiving probes were inserted into the sample core with insertion depth exceeding 65 mm a pulse signal was emitted at the central frequency of each emitting transducer after traveling through in the sediment core the sound wave was received by the two receiving probes and recorded by the wsd 3 instrument simultaneously with 0 1 μs sampling interval and 409 6 μs recording duration the waveforms in the sandy silt sediments received by r1 and r2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively when the measurement was finished at one frequency the emitting transducer was replaced by another transducer with a different central frequency while the two receiving probes still remained in the core the same procedure was performed until all six emitting transducers were used to get data spanning the frequency range of 25 250 khz through the correlation between the signals received at probes r1 and r2 the arrival time difference of sound waves between probes r1 and r2 can be obtained and it is denoted as δt for the acoustic signals of 25 150 khz the correlation was done using the full waveform and for the acoustic signals of 200 250 khz the correlation was done using the first two cycles before calculating the attenuation the recorded acoustic signals were done the narrow band filtering the amplitudes at the measurement frequencies in the frequency spectra of the sound waveforms received by probes r1 and r2 in the sediment are denoted by a1 and a2 respectively the amplitudes at the measurement frequencies in the frequency spectra of the sound waveforms received by r1 and r2 in fresh water are denoted by aw1 and aw2 thus the sound speed c p in m s and attenuation coefficient α in db m can be calculated by 1 c p l 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 2 α 20 log 10 a 1 a 2 log 10 a w 1 a w 2 l 2 l 1 where t1 and t2 are the travel time from the emitting transducer t to the receiving probes r1 and r2 l1 and l2 are the distances from the emitting transducer t to the receiving probes r1 and r2 shown in fig 1 l2 l1 is about 5 cm in these measurements 2 3 evaluation of uncertainty of the measurements in order to analyze the uncertainty of the sound speed measurement the probe method was tested in a small tank filled with fresh water with a volume of 30 cm 50 cm 100 cm the waveforms received in water at different frequencies and the frequency spectra are shown in fig 3 the temperature of the water was measured when each measurement was made the measured temperature of the water ranged from 16 2 to 17 0 c and the salinity was 0 the sound speed of sea water c w in m s can be calculated by medwin s equation medwin 1975 3 c w 1449 2 4 6 t 0 055 t 2 0 00029 t 3 1 34 0 010 t s 35 0 016 z where t represents the temperature of water in c s represents the salinity in and z represents the depth of water in meters the calculated sound speed of water using the measured temperature ranged from 1468 1 to 1470 6 m s with the average value of 1469 3 m s the standard deviation of the calculated sound speed is approximately 0 88 m s due to the variation of temperature the travel time measurement for the sound speed of water was repeated six times using the probe method shown in fig 1 and the sound speed was obtained using the travel time difference and the propagation distance with eq 1 table 1 shows the calculated and measured sound speed in water the measured sound speed of water ranged from 1465 7 to 1473 8 m s with the average value of 1469 9 m s the standard deviation of the measured sound speed in water is approximately 2 82 m s in order to obtain the spreading loss of the acoustic wave emitted by transducers at different ranges for use in correcting the acoustic attenuation measured in sediment cores the sound waveforms were received over different probe separations within a pvc tube in a tank for six repeated acoustic measurements in the same location the sound attenuation in water caused by spreading loss for a planar emitting transducer was found with standard deviations of 0 58 1 09 db m at frequencies in the range of 25 150 khz larger standard deviations of 2 11 db m at 200 khz and of 3 06 db m at 250 khz were found which may have been due to the lower receiving sensitivity of the receiving probes at high frequency 3 results and discussion 3 1 the frequency dependence of sound speed the frequency dependence of the measured sound speed is shown in fig 4 which indicates that sound speed increases slowly with frequency from 25 to 250 khz for both types of sediment the measurement results indicate that the sound speeds range approximately from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediments and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediments with a weak positive linear gradient from 25 to 250 khz the sound speeds of the sandy silt sediments are higher than those of the clayey silt sediments these sound speeds are for the temperature range of 20 23 c and the influence of this small change of temperature on sound speed is negligible according to hamilton s empirical relationship between porosity and acoustic properties hamilton 1980 the sound speed of higher porosity sediments is lower than that of the lower porosity sediments which conforms to the acoustic measurement results in this study the solid and dashed lines in fig 4 are the least square fits to the data with very high correlation coefficients indicating a weak linear relationship between sound speed and frequency that can be given as 4 c p 1641 9 0 0637 f r 0 81 sandy silt 5 c p 1548 6 0 0962 f r 0 94 clayey silt where f is frequency in khz and c p is the sound speed in m s for the sandy silt sediments eq 4 and the clayey silt sediments eq 5 where r is the correlation coefficient machin et al 2011 according to these equations the mean rate of increase in sound speed was 0 0637 m s 1 khz 1 for sandy silt sediments and 0 0962 m s 1 khz 1 for clayey silt sediments between 25 and 250 khz the results indicate that the sound speeds in the two types of sediments have weak positive gradients with frequency 3 2 the frequency dependence of attenuation the frequency dependence of measured attenuation is shown in fig 5 the measurement results indicate that the attenuation coefficient ranges from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediment and from 7 8 to 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediment with strong positive gradients from 25 to 250 khz hamilton 1972 consistently maintained that the frequency dependence of attenuation in sediments obeys an f 1 dependence with an attenuation factor k and suggested that the frequency dependence of attenuation measured in decibels per unit length can be given by 6 α k f 1 where α is the attenuation coefficient in db m f is the frequency in khz the attenuation factor k can be obtained from the regression fits to the data and from empirical relationships based on porosity mean grain size or bulk density versus k the solid and dashed lines in fig 5a show linear regression fits to the measured attenuation coefficient α in db m and frequency f in khz and these fits can be given by 7 α 0 225 f 1 r 0 85 sandy silt 8 α 0 137 f 1 r 0 87 clayey silt eq 7 and eq 8 express the relationship in sandy silt sediments and in clayey silt sediments respectively according to the equations the measured attenuation factor k is 0 225 db m 1 khz 1 for sandy silt sediment and is 0 137 db m 1 khz 1 for clayey silt sediments these measured attenuation factors are listed in table 2 table 2 also shows the predicted attenuation factor values using hamilton s jackson and richardson s and buckingham s regression curves hamilton 1980 established empirical f 1 relationships for porosity and mean grain size versus the attenuation factor k jackson and richardson 2007 established empirical relationships for porosity mean grain size and bulk density versus attenuation factor k based on in situ measured data using issams buckingham 2005 established regression curves for mean grain size versus attenuation factor k in table 2 the attenuation factors predicted using hamilton s and buckingham s regression curves are listed in the form of the range of values and the attenuation factors predicted using jackson and richardson s regression equations are listed in the form of the average values the comparisons show that the measured attenuation factors conform well to the predicted attenuation factor versus physical properties of jackson and richardson s and falls within the predicted ranges of buckingham s although the measured attenuation factor of sandy silt sediment is lower than the value predicted by hamilton s empirical equation based on porosity the measured attenuation factors falls well within the value ranges predicted by hamilton s empirical equation based on mean grain size according to the biot stoll model stoll 1989 the attenuation coefficient deviates from a first power dependence on frequency and varies as the square root of frequency at the high frequencies of interest here the f 1 2 frequency dependence fit to the measured attenuation coefficient can be given by 9 α 3 06 f 1 2 r 0 97 sandy silt 10 α 1 84 f 1 2 r 0 96 clayey silt where r is also the correlation coefficient eq 9 and eq 10 express the relationship between attenuation and frequency in sandy silt sediments and in clayey silt sediments respectively both these equations and fig 5b indicate that the gradient of attenuation coefficient with frequency in sandy silt sediment is larger than that in clayey silt sediment compared with the f 1 dependence of attenuation coefficient the f 1 2 dependence has a much better agreement with the measured results which indicates the attenuation coefficient increases nonlinearly with frequency hamilton 1980 compiled attenuation measurements and argued for an f 1 dependence for attenuation over 1 100 khz hovem and ingram 1979 compared the measured data using water saturated glass beads with hamilton s predictions and to the biot stoll model and suggested that the measured data were quite close to f 1 2 dependence at 20 300 khz kibblewhite 1989 concluded that the linear relationship between attenuation and frequency from seismic to ultrasonic frequencies does not appear justified in the biot stoll model acoustic wave attenuation is primarily attributed to viscous losses due to relative motion between the pore fluid and the skeletal frame and the absorption attenuation follows an f 1 2 dependence at high frequencies corresponding to viscous dissipation of the pore fluid ohkawa 2006 found that the frequency dependence of attenuation follows the biot theory at frequencies from 50 to 200 khz and scattering attenuation is dominant at frequencies greater than 200 khz when the mean grain size of sands ranges from 400 μm to 500 μm sessarego et al 2008 concluded that the measured attenuation follows an f 1 2 dependence agreeing with the biot stoll model from 100 to 200 khz and seems to be proportional to f 2 dependence at high frequencies more than 500 khz in the well sorted sand having a mean grain size of 245 μm this study mentioned that the combined effect of the viscous losses and strong scattering by sand particles leads to the f 2 dependence at high frequencies lee et al 2007 also found the attenuation increases nonlinearly at frequencies from 0 3 to 1 0 mhz seifert et al 1999 provided the empirical f 2 dependence of scattering attenuation obtaining by curve fitting to the experimental data for water saturated fine sands in the present study the attenuation of fine grained sediments is in closer accordance with the f 1 2 dependence than the f 1 dependence which is probably due to the viscous dissipation according to biot stoll model and the effects of scattering attenuation are not apparent for the fine grained sediments at frequencies lower than 250 khz the comparisons between measured results and theoretical predictions will be introduced in next section 3 3 comparison between measured data and theoretical models the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model are available geoacoustic propagation models for predicting the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor sediments the biot stoll model for elastic wave propagation in porous media has been applied to water saturated sediments and was modified to the edfm through setting the bulk modulus and shear modulus to be zero by williams 2001 the gs model is another common model for wave propagation in saturated unconsolidated sediments established by buckingham 1997 and assumes the sediment grains are not locked together and the shear rigidity modulus is zero all these models can be used to predict the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation in response to an acoustic excitation the first two models account for the relative motion between pore fluid and the granular skeleton and the third model accounts for relative motion between grains chotiros and isakson 2004 buckingham 2005 the measured sound speed and attenuation are compared with the theoretical predictions of the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model the input physical parameters of the biot stoll model and the edfm are summarized in table 3 the input physical parameters of the gs model are summarized in table 4 the parameters including porosity mean grain diameter mass density of grains and measurement depth were measured directly because permeability tortuosity and pore size were difficult to measure directly we used empirical equations to calculated these parameters according to the physical relationship of kozeny carman holland and brunson 1988 the permeability κ in m2 can be approximated by 11 κ 1 k s 0 2 β 3 1 β 2 where s 0 is the specific surface of the particles in the sediment in m 1 and can be defined as s0 6 μ g where u g is the mean grain diameter in meters shown in table 4 k is an empirical constant approximately equal to 5 and β is the porosity the tortuosity α can be calculated following stoll 1977 12 α 1 35 0 3 0 4125 φ 3 0 φ 4 4 φ 8 φ 8 where ϕ is the mean grain size and is dimensionless φ log 2 u g where u g is the mean grain diameter in millimeters the pore size parameter a in meters can be computed by the following relation from johnson et al 1987 13 a 8 α κ β some parameters were estimated from the literature williams et al 2002 hefner and jackson 2010 jackson and richardson 2007 including the fluid bulk modulus the grain bulk modulus and the dynamic viscosity of pore fluid the frame bulk modulus and the frame shear modulus were calculated by schock s equation schock 2004 in the edfm the frame bulk modulus and the frame shear modulus are set to zero williams 2001 the longitudinal coefficient the shear coefficient and the strain hardening index for the gs model are described in the literature buckingham 2005 and were obtained through fitting the gs dispersion to the measured sound speed and attenuation coefficient at 100 khz the comparison between the measured sound speed and predictions of models in sandy silt sediment is shown in fig 6 the solid the red dashed and the dotted curves in fig 6 represent the sound speeds predicted by the biot stoll model the edfm and the gs model respectively over the frequency range from 25 to 250 khz the biot stoll model and edfm predict a slightly positive sound speed dispersion of sandy silt sediments in the trend of f 1 2 and the gs model exhibits an approximately linear dispersion of sound speed the results show that the predictions by the edfm and biot stoll model have almost the same sound speed dispersion characteristics for sandy silt sediment although the sound speed from the edfm being slightly lower than that from biot stoll model the comparison in fig 6 also shows that the measured and predicted sound speeds have similar slightly positive dispersion which indicates that these models are suitable for predicting the dispersion of sound speed in sandy silt sediment from 25 to 250 khz the comparisons between the measured and the predicted attenuation in sandy silt sediment are shown in fig 7 the results shows that the attenuation predicted by the biot stoll and gs models show different frequency dependence the tendency of measured attenuation frequency dependence agrees better with the predictions of the biot stoll model and edfm than that of the gs model for sandy silt sediment this implies that the measured attenuation is in greater agreement with the f 1 2 dependence however the high frequency attenuation data lie essentially parallel to but above the predicted values by the biot stoll model and the edfm using the parameters from table 3 the transition from f 1 2 dependence to an f 1 dependence is not clearly observed for frequencies up to 250 khz for sandy silt sediments while the measured attenuation for medium sands show an approximate f 1 2 dependence that transitions to an f 1 dependence at a frequency of about 100 khz as reported in williams et al 2002 the measured and predicted sound speeds and attenuation of clayey silt sediment are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as seen in fig 8 the measured sound speed has a similar slightly positive dispersion compared with the predictions of the three different models the dispersion gradient of measured sound speed is slightly larger than that of the sound speed predicted by biot stoll model and the edfm but it agrees well with the prediction of the gs model as seen in fig 9 the tendency of measured frequency dependence of attenuation agrees well with the predictions of the biot stoll model and edfm which again indicates that the measured attenuation is in closer agreement with the f1 2 dependence than the f1 dependence in contrast to the sandy silt sediment the measured attenuation coefficient of clayey silt sediment can be well fit with the theoretical values predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm using the parameters from table 3 the results of fitting the frequency dependence of attenuation in sandy silt sediment suggest that the biot stoll model and the edfm can account for the measured attenuation the gs model produces a more rapid increase with frequency than the measured attenuation in both the sandy silt and clayey silt sediments which may suggest that the relaxation mechanism in the gs model may not be fully applicable to fine grained sediments the electrostatic repulsion electrostatic attraction and the adhesion of organic matter in fine grained sediments control the particle to particle interactions and therefore the motion between particles may not be significant and may not cause obvious dissipation for acoustic waves jackson and richardson 2007 in contrast the relative motion between the porefluid and the granular skeleton may be the main dissipation mechanism for the sediments in the frequency range studied although the biot stoll model and edfm can fit the increase trend of measured attenuation with frequency relatively well there are still some differences between the predicted and measured values over the entire frequency range for sandy silt sediment these differences are likely due to the values obtained for the permeability pore size and tortuosity parameters these input parameters have uncertainties which are not really known and have not been provided in the literature for eqs 11 13 in order to understand the offset between measured sound speed and attenuation and prediction based on the biot stoll model and the edfm we changed each parameter to improve the fit between the measured data and the models the best simultaneous data model fit curves of sandy silt sediments obtained by varying permeability tortuosity and pore size are shown in figs 10 and 11 for a best simultaneous data model fit the permeability needs to be changed from 2 56 10 11 m2 to 2 10 10 11 m2 the tortuosity needs to be changed from 1 35 to 1 30 and the pore size needs to be changed from 2 27 10 5 m to 2 03 10 5 m the inconsistency of the calculated permeability tortuosity and pore size to the best fit value may be due to the simplification of porosity and grain size by the models the irregular pore structure of the actual sediment may not permit all of the porosity to contribute to the dispersion mechanisms described by the model which has been verified by other measurements nosal et al 2008 zimmer et al 2010 as a clarification the values of unmeasured physical parameters for prediction models used in this study were determined by fitting to the measured sound speed or calculating using empirical formulas from the literature such as shock s equations however some parameters such as the bulk modulus usually were summarized other results for coarse sandy sediments the general applicability of these physical parameters is an issue worthy of investigation which was not addressed in this study in addition since some input parameters of geoacoustic models are difficult to be measured some empirical and analytical formulas are needed to obtain the parameters for prediction of sound speed and attenuation thus more empirical and analytical formulas with uncertainty bounds for predicting the physical parameters of various sediments need to be established based on further experiments and studies 4 conclusion the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in two types of fine grained sediments have been measured by using a probe method over a frequency range band from 25 to 250 khz the results indicate that the sound speeds range approximately from 1638 to 1658 m s in sandy silt sediment and from 1548 to 1571 m s in clayey silt sediment with weak linear gradient over the frequency from 25 to 250 khz the attenuation coefficient ranges from 14 2 to 51 9 db m in sandy silt sediment and 7 8 31 7 db m in clayey silt sediment with a strong positive gradient in the same frequency band the attenuation coefficient of fine grained sediment is in closer agreement with the f 1 2 dependence than the f 1 dependence and is not clearly observed with a transition from f 1 2 dependence to an f 1 dependence for frequencies up to 250 khz the comparisons between the measured and predicted sound speed show that the measured sound speed in sandy silt sediment agrees reasonably with the theoretical curves predicted by the biot stoll edfm and gs models the measured sound speed in clayey silt sediment agrees better with the theoretical curves predicted by the gs model than that of the biot stoll model and the edfm both the measured attenuation frequency dependence in sandy silt sediment and in clayey silt sediment are more similar to the theoretical curves predicted by the biot stoll model and the edfm than that predicted by the gs model in addition this study suggests that more empirical formulas with uncertainty bounds for predicting the input physical parameters of acoustic propagation models for various sediments need to be established based on results from more

23323,bird beak square hollow section shs joint is a new type of welded tubular joints that could be used in offshore structures this paper presents a parametric finite element modeling strategy to predict the hot spot stress concentration factors scfs of both diamond and square bird beak shs joints ansys parametric design language apdl was employed by introducing three typical non dimensional parameters i e β 2γ τ of shs joints as main controlling variables and the novel configurations of crown and saddle areas were accurately simulated during the modeling process tetrahedral shaped solid elements were used so that the refined fe meshes generated from the map meshing match the requirements of extrapolation region that have been specified in iiw and cidect fatigue design guides all extrapolating works were automatically implemented by pre coded programs the accuracy of constructed fe models has been validated by comparing with existing experimental data the scf variations with non dimensional parameters were obtained by conducting parametric analysis and the scf comparisons between two types of bird beak joints have been conducted the proposed modeling approaches are applicable to bird beak joints of different shapes and to the joints under various load cases and boundary conditions keywords square hollow section bird beak joint stress concentration factor finite element model parametric study 1 introduction steel circular hollow sections chs have been widely used in the offshore structures such as jacket type oil platforms and jack up rigs these tubular joints containing weld intersections are prone to fatigue damages since the structures are cyclically loaded by sea waves saini et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ahmadi 2016 ahmadi et al 2011 that s the reason why square hollow sections shs whose flat surfaces would collect more lateral fluctuated loads are much less adopted despite that their intersecting lines at welded connections are simpler than chs the new type bird beak shs joint is formed by rotating the members of a conventional shs joint at 45 about their longitudinal axes correspondingly two types of bird beak shs joints that is square bird beak joint with chord rotated only and diamond bird beak joint with chord and brace both rotated are commonly considered fig 1 shows the configurations of four types of tubular joints where the characteristic crown and saddle areas in chs joints are also found in bird beak shs joints such innovative bird beak shs joints are supposed to make the fabrication and welding easier than chs joints and to assist in relieving lateral wave and wind loads and therefore are suitable for the application into ocean engineering the strengths of bird beak joints under static loads have been revealed by researchers including ono et al 1991 1993 1994 ishida et al 1993 davies et al 1996 owen et al 1996 2001 christitsas et al chtistitas et al 2007 lei 2009 and zhu and liu 2012 to be higher than those of conventional joints with same non dimensional parameters regarding the fatigue resistance ishida 1992 first carried out the fatigue tests of bird beak t joints in 1992 by considering the load case of brace axial force keizer et al keizer et al 2003 keizer 2003 investigated the stress concentration factors of diamond bird beak joints under brace axial force recently tong et al 2014 2016 presented an experimental study on stress concentration factors for diamond bird beak t joints under axial force and in plane bending on the brace cheng et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2018 carried out the researches to determine the strain stress concentration factors of square bird beak shs t joints under chord and brace axial forces as one of the most important parameters of fatigue resistance prediction for tubular joints the structural hot spot stresses are commonly determined by using the stress concentration factor scf formulae which have been obtained from numerous parametric study of joints the numerical modeling of bird beak joints is fairly complicated due to the complex configurations around the welding junctions between the chord and the brace especially when the parametric analysis is required therefore this research presents advanced finite element modeling techniques for hot spot stress analysis of bird beak shs joints key aspects including common value ranges of non dimensional parameters geometries of fillet weld specified hot spot locations meshes in extrapolation regions various load cases and boundary conditions as well as automatic parametric calculation will be considered in the modeling 2 bird beak shs joints both diamond and square bird beak t shape joints were employed in this study to illustrate the modeling process of such tubular connections with complicated welding conjunctions as shown in fig 2 the lengths of chord and brace is respectively noted as l 0 and l 1 the sectional width and wall thickness of chord is noted as b 0 and t 0 and the sectional width and wall thickness of brace is noted as b 1 and t 1 three non dimensional parameters are defined as brace chord width ratio β b 1 b 0 chord wall slenderness ratio 2γ b 0 t 0 and brace chord wall thickness ratio τ t 1 t 0 which are identical to the considerations for conventional shs joints the welding junction of a bird beak joint contains the so called crown areas and saddle areas which are very common in circular hollow section chs joints as a result high stress concentrations were certainly expected within these areas by referring to the recommendations by tong et al 2014 2016 and cheng et al 2014 2015a six saddle hot spots lines i e sa b sa c and sa d on chord and sa e sa f and sa a on brace and six crown hot spots lines i e cr b cr c and cr d on chord and cr e cr f and cr a on brace were selected for either diamond or square bird beak joints as shown in fig 2 the meshes of the model should be exactly consistent with these hot lines 3 aims and principles of modeling 3 1 modeling aims the fe modeling described in this paper is supposed to satisfy the aims as the following i bird beak configurations including the saddle and crown geometries the sectional corners as well as the weld dimensions around the brace to chord junction can be accurately simulated in the model ii the stress components perpendicular to weld toes within the extrapolation region at specified critical locations i e hot spots can be obtained from the model so that the structural hot spot stresses at weld toes can be mathematically calculated iii typical load cases at member ends including axial force in plane bending and out of plane bending can be properly considered iv parametric calculation considering common value ranges of three non dimensional parameters i e β 2γ τ can be efficiently conducted and stress outputs at specified locations can be automatically read from the fe models according to prescribed rules and then be automatically processed by mathematical softwares 3 2 modeling principles based on the aims the following principles are adopted in the modeling i the general finite element software ansys ansys 2016 is employed and the ansys parametric design language apdl is used for the convenience of parametric analysis ii three typical non dimensional parameters i e brace chord width ratio β chord wall slenderness ratio 2γ and brace chord wall thickness ratio τ are considered as the major controllable variables and the other dimensional parameters are mainly determined by them corresponding to engineering applications the value ranges of three non dimensional parameters are taken as 0 3 β 1 0 diamond bird beak 0 3 β 1 3 square bird beak 10 2γ 25 and 0 3 τ 1 0 in all finite element models the chord wall thickness t 0 is originally defined as 10 mm and subsequently other geometric dimensions i e chord width b 0 brace width b 1 and brace wall thickness t 1 are determined by varying non dimensional parameters i e b 0 2γ t 0 b 1 β b 0 t 1 τ t 0 iii solid95 elements each containing 20 nodes are used and nonlinear printout at each integration point are pre defined the solid elements are efficient in constructing the complex geometries of shs walls and fillet welds especially for the crown and saddle areas where numerous spatial curves and spatial surfaces exist iv extrapolation regions near weld toes should be defined in strict accordance with the regulations in iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 and cidect zhao et al 2000 fatigue design guides that is the distance from the welding toe to the start of the extrapolation region is equal to the lager value of 0 4t and 4 mm and the extrapolation region have a length of t where t represents the wall thickness of the member on which the stresses were extrapolated in this work the extrapolation region was uniformly set to start from 4 mm away from the weld toe since both chord and brace wall thicknesses are not greater than 10 mm v map meshing instead of free meshing is commonly suggested since the nodes in the specified hot lines are required to be exactly consistent with the characteristic points within the extrapolation regions so that the hot spot stresses at weld toes can be extrapolated directly from the nodal stress components vi batch parametric analysis and data processing are automatically carried out by using the third party programs tools or plugins to connect the fe software and the mathematical software 4 procedure of modeling 4 1 general information t shape bird beak joints were typically used in this section to demonstrate the modeling procedures of such type of tubular joints the whole joint was first divided into two zones i e core zone and non core zone where the core zone represents the parts around the weld junctions with fine meshes and the non core zone includes the remaining parts with coarse meshes in the core zone the parts away from the welds were further defined as the extrapolation region and the transition region as shown in fig 3 only a quarter joint was representatively modeled due to the symmetry in the quarter model four crown spots i e cr a cr b cr c cr f and four saddle spots i e sa c sa d sa e sa f were considered for diamond bird beak joints while four crown spots i e cr a cr b cr c cr f and six saddle spots i e sa a sa b sa c sa d sa e sa f were considered for square bird beak joints the specified hot lines were required to be perpendicular to the weld toes 4 2 modeling of diamond bird beak joints 4 2 1 geometry of joint core zone the geometries of joint core zone were constructed by successively building the brace parts and the chord parts 4 3 step i building the brace parts the top surface of the chord including the curved surfaces at sectional corners was first established by taking the center of the chord section as the origin of the coordinates the area of the brace section at the core zone boundary was subsequently built and then extruded along the downward direction of brace axis so that a brace volume was formed this brace volume will be further divided by the previous chord s top surface and the brace parts below the surface as well as the surface itself will be deleted at the end of this step no more divisions were required for the brace volume since the hot lines on the brace are parallel to the brace s longitudinal axis fig 4 demonstrates the three building stages of brace parts in this step that is extrusion division and partition 4 4 step ii building the chord parts the chord modeling is much more complex than the brace because some oblique hot lines should be specially considered especially for spots sa d and cr b where the hot lines were neither parallel nor perpendicular to the member s axis further divisions should be made to the volumes before meshing in order to ensure that the fem nodes in these hot lines can be generated according to the pre specified distances so that the nodal stress components can be directly used for the extrapolations the following three sub steps were implemented during this stage sub step 1 building the flat parts of the chord s top flange several key points e g a b c a b c were first generated by translating the key points e g a b c away from the brace to chord intersections in prescribed distances from their original locations and the boundaries of weld regions i e line a b c and extrapolation regions i e line a b c were then constructed as shown in fig 5 the distances between parallel lines a b c and a b c equal to the length of extrapolation region i e wall thickness t lines a a and b b respectively represents the hot lines sa c and sa d the volumes were formed by extruding these flat surfaces along the wall thickness direction in this sub step the work plane was transferred to the inclined plane of the brace section that has been produced by the division using chord s top surface in step i sub step 2 building the curved parts of the chord s top corner the chord s corner section at the brace to chord intersection which consists of two straight lines and two curved lines was first built and then extruded along the longitudinal direction of the chord so that the crown part was generated the weld region the extrapolation region and the transition region were further identified from the created part according to the prescribed dimensions as a result key points e e e f f f d and d were generated as shown in fig 6 by introducing a plane running through the key point d and perpendicular to the weld edge e f the hot line cr b was represented by the curved line d d where key point d was the intersection point between the introduced plane and the straight line b c next deleting and merging of the overlapped volumes around the crown zone were performed by which all essential crown parts shown in fig 6 were finally created the curved line d d which exactly represents the hot line cr b was unchanged since its first appearance sub step 3 building the remaining parts of the chord that is the bottom flange the bottom corner as well as the lateral corner these parts were generated by simply extruding the corresponding sectional areas of the chord along the longitudinal direction the sectional areas should be properly divided in prior to the extruding so that the subsequent map meshing can be conducted as shown in fig 7 note that all the areas generated are the quadrilaterals each of which is composed of four straight or curved lines the chord parts inside the brace tube were simultaneously constructed in sub steps 1 and 2 4 4 1 meshing of joint core zone the meshing of joint core zone was carried out after the construction of their geometric parts map meshing was implemented after the edges of each quadrilateral area having been divided into several equal sized segments and as a result tetrahedral shaped solid elements instead of pyramid shaped solid elements were generated the element sizes within weld regions and extrapolation regions were as small as 2 mm which was convinced to cover the most cases of shs wall thicknesses and to be consistent with the distances between the basic elements of the strip gauges which have been commonly used in test to record the strains at several continuous positions cheng et al 2014 2015a the meshes within the transition regions were twice coarser i e element size of 4 mm than those in extrapolation regions all sectional walls were divided into four element mesh layers in their thickness directions the adopted meshes were considered to be both accurate and time saving after the comparative analysis of mesh controlling parameters and if necessary the meshes can be refined or coarsened by merely adjusting the values of those parameters 4 4 2 modeling of joint non core zones the non core zones of the joint both geometries and meshes were constructed by extruding the chord s and brace s sectional meshes at the boundaries of the core zone the element sizes in the longitudinal direction of the member were set to be four times i e 16 mm the length of elements in transition regions since the concerned nodal stresses within extrapolation regions will be hardly influenced by the non core zone meshes which are far away from the welds 4 4 3 modeling of welds the fillet welds commonly as the strengthening of partial penetration groove welds at brace to chord intersections should also be simulated in the model since their geometries significantly affect the stresses around the weld toes in this modeling an area of fillet weld section was first constructed by introducing an arc line at the symmetry plane of the whole joint and was then extruded along the intersections between brace and chord until the geometries of fillet welds were finally constructed the mapped meshes of the welds were highly consistent with the existing nodes in the weld regions that have been previously specified on the chord and brace surfaces the geometries of welds in junction areas were determined according to aws code american welding society aws 2010 that is for the crown areas the weld lengths projected on the chord equal to t 1 2 and the weld lengths projected on the brace equal to t 1 for the saddle areas the weld lengths projected on the chord equal to 2 t 1 2 and the weld lengths projected on the brace equal to 2 t 1 the final meshes of joint core zone are shown in fig 8 4 5 modeling of square bird beak joints the modeling procedures of square bird beak joint are totally the same as those of diamond bird beak one and therefore the strategies and techniques adopted are very similar the major differences between two types of bird beak configurations lie in the modeling of saddle and crown parts where the meshes are required to be consistent with the specified hot line locations for the quarter square bird beak joint 1 one more hot line on the brace saddle i e sa a and one more hot line on the chord saddle i e sa b should be considered which indicates that more partitions of saddle areas are expected 2 during the modeling of curved parts of chord s top corner the procedures in sub step 2 are expected to be more simple because the hot line cr b which has been specified as perpendicular to the weld toe is also parallel to the longitudinal axis of the chord concretely no more operations are required after the crown parts including weld regions extrapolation regions as well as transition regions have been generated by simply extruding the chord s top corner section along the longitudinal direction of the chord the generated parts in core zone of square bird beak joint are shown in fig 9 similar mesh controlling parameters were used for square bird beak joint and the meshes in core zone are shown in fig 10 the subsequent procedures of modeling the non core zones and the fillet welds are exactly identical to those presented for diamond bird beak joint 4 6 load cases and boundary conditions for each member end all nodal dofs in the member end section were coupled to a referenced node that has been previously created at the center of the section in this way various load cases such as axial force in plane bending and out of plane bending can be applied to the member end by simply applying a concentrated force moment corresponding to unit nominal stress to the referenced node at section center the boundary conditions were also applied to the joint in the same way the influence analysis of member length were also carried out and results show that in case of brace axial force the scfs of t joints will not be changed if chord and brace are respectively longer than 18 and 3 times its sectional width in this research the lengths of chord and brace are selected as l 0 24b 0 and l 1 3b 1 so that the boundary effects of member ends on the joint core zone will be virtually eliminated 4 7 data processing the compiled apdl files were organized by introducing practical extraction and report language perl online perl documentation so that the batch analysis can be performed and all the ansys output files were combined into one again by perl so that the mathematical functions provided in matlab matlab 2017 or microsoft excel software can be called to run the extrapolating calculation automatically 5 results of modeling 5 1 stress concentrations by employing the t joint with non dimensional parameters of β 0 7 2γ 20 and τ 0 7 the stress concentrations at specified hot spots of diamond and square bird beak joints under brace axial forces were plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 where scf was calculated as the nodal stress component perpendicular to weld toe divided by the nominal stress on brace section it can be found from the figures that except for two saddle spots i e sa d and sa f in diamond bird beak joint non linear variations of scfs towards the weld toe are obvious for most spots in bird beak joint therefore quadratic functions are commonly required for the numerical fitting in order to ensure the accuracy of scf extrapolations in this study the least square method was introduced for the quadratic extrapolations and the derived scfs were used for the analysis 5 2 model validation in order to validate the accuracy of modeling seven diamond bird beak t joints whose scfs under brace axial forces have been experimentally measured by tong et al 2014 were numerically analyzed by using the presented approaches comparisons of scf data at various hot spots are shown in table 1 and fig 13 it can be seen that the numerical scfs from the present analysis could be either greater or smaller than those obtained from the test the average value of scffem scftest ratios goes to 0 97 and 1 07 respectively for chord spots and brace spots nine square bird beak t joints tested by cheng et al 2014 have also been employed for the validation and the comparisons in fig 14 show that the average value of scffem scftest ratios goes to 1 15 and 1 07 respectively for chord spot sa c and brace spot sa a considering the weld geometry differences including weld sizes and weld toe shapes between specimens and fe models as well as the unavoidable measurement errors for gauge elements within extrapolation regions such scf deviations at investigated spots could be acceptable the fe models established in this research could be regarded as accurate enough 5 3 parametric study as the ultimate goal of the modeling work and as the greatest challenge in apdl compiling parametric study was successfully carried out by considering common value ranges of three non dimensional parameters both diamond and square bird beak t joints under brace axial forces were employed for the analysis fig 15 shows the scf variations of diamond bird beak t joints respectively as the functions of non dimensional parameter β 2γ and τ it can be seen that 1 in case of variable β fig 15 a b both crown and saddle scfs are enlarged as β is increased from 0 4 to 0 75 and approximate linear variations between scf and β are evident 2 in case of variable 2γ fig 15 c d the scfs could either increase or decrease as 2γ is increased from 12 5 to 22 5 the influences of 2γ are comparatively insignificant since the scf variations are usually within 50 of the original values 3 in case of variable τ fig 15 e f increases in both crown and saddle scfs with enlarging τ are also evident despite the possible functions of curves e g linear parabolic and power could be different for various spot locations 4 in case of identical non dimensional parameters the scfs on the chord could be either greater or smaller than those on the brace and comparable scfs are found at crown and saddle areas comparatively spots cr c and cr f provide the highest scfs within the crown area and spots sa c sa d and sa f provide the highest scfs within the saddle area the scfs at spots cr a and sa f are observed to be the smallest respectively within the crown area and the saddle area the influences of non dimensional parameters on the scfs of square bird beak t joints are demonstrated in fig 16 the following can be concluded 1 in case of variable β fig 16 a b increasing of β always enhance the scfs on the chord crown area and could either enhance or depress the scfs on the brace crown area the scfs at the saddle area first increase and then decrease as β grows from 0 4 to 1 3 and the peak points respectively correspond to β 0 9 for chord spots and β 1 1 for brace spots 2 in case of variable 2γ fig 16 c d the scfs curves of crown spots first decline and then ascend with increasing 2γ while for the saddle spots the scfs are always improved as 2γ is enhanced from 12 5 to 25 with the rates of increase being slowed down gradually 3 in case of variable τ fig 16 e f except for the saddle spots on the brace the scfs are all enhanced by τ increases where several types of functions such as linear parabolic and power functions could be used to describe the curve variations the influences of τ on the scfs of brace saddle spots i e sa e sa f sa a are fairly invisible 4 in case of identical non dimensional parameters the scfs on the chord are always much greater than those on the brace within the considered value ranges of non dimensional parameters the highest reachable scfs at the saddle area are obviously larger than those at the crown area comparatively chord spots sa b and sa c whose scf values are very close to each other provide the highest scfs within the saddle area and similar findings are real for crown spots cr b and cr c 5 4 comparisons between square and diamond bird beak joints in order to provide more references for the engineering applications comparisons of scfs between square and diamond bird beak t joints under brace axial forces were carried out by utilizing parametric analysis data fig 17 demonstrates the scf ratios of two types of bird beak joints respectively for the maximal scf in the chord brace and whole joint the influences of varying β 2γ and τ are also investigated it can be seen that all scfdbbj scfsbbj ratios of chord are below 1 which means the maximal chord scfs of diamond bird beak joints are always smaller than those of square bird beak joints in case of same non dimensional parameters as for the brace spots diamond bird beak joints could provide greater scfs than square bird beak joints especially when β or 2γ is relatively small however since the maximal scfs within the whole bird beak joints are more likely to occur in the chord instead of in the brace diamond bird beak joints are expected to be better

non dimensional parameters were obtained by conducting parametric analysis and the scf comparisons between two types of bird beak joints have been conducted the proposed modeling approaches are applicable to bird beak joints of different shapes and to the joints under various load cases and boundary conditions keywords square hollow section bird beak joint stress concentration factor finite element model parametric study 1 introduction steel circular hollow sections chs have been widely used in the offshore structures such as jacket type oil platforms and jack up rigs these tubular joints containing weld intersections are prone to fatigue damages since the structures are cyclically loaded by sea waves saini et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ahmadi 2016 ahmadi et al 2011 that s the reason why square hollow sections shs whose flat surfaces would collect more lateral fluctuated loads are much less adopted despite that their intersecting lines at welded connections are simpler than chs the new type bird beak shs joint is formed by rotating the members of a conventional shs joint at 45 about their longitudinal axes correspondingly two types of bird beak shs joints that is square bird beak joint with chord rotated only and diamond bird beak joint with chord and brace both rotated are commonly considered fig 1 shows the configurations of four types of tubular joints where the characteristic crown and saddle areas in chs joints are also found in bird beak shs joints such innovative bird beak shs joints are supposed to make the fabrication and welding easier than chs joints and to assist in relieving lateral wave and wind loads and therefore are suitable for the application into ocean engineering the strengths of bird beak joints under static loads have been revealed by researchers including ono et al 1991 1993 1994 ishida et al 1993 davies et al 1996 owen et al 1996 2001 christitsas et al chtistitas et al 2007 lei 2009 and zhu and liu 2012 to be higher than those of conventional joints with same non dimensional parameters regarding the fatigue resistance ishida 1992 first carried out the fatigue tests of bird beak t joints in 1992 by considering the load case of brace axial force keizer et al keizer et al 2003 keizer 2003 investigated the stress concentration factors of diamond bird beak joints under brace axial force recently tong et al 2014 2016 presented an experimental study on stress concentration factors for diamond bird beak t joints under axial force and in plane bending on the brace cheng et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2018 carried out the researches to determine the strain stress concentration factors of square bird beak shs t joints under chord and brace axial forces as one of the most important parameters of fatigue resistance prediction for tubular joints the structural hot spot stresses are commonly determined by using the stress concentration factor scf formulae which have been obtained from numerous parametric study of joints the numerical modeling of bird beak joints is fairly complicated due to the complex configurations around the welding junctions between the chord and the brace especially when the parametric analysis is required therefore this research presents advanced finite element modeling techniques for hot spot stress analysis of bird beak shs joints key aspects including common value ranges of non dimensional parameters geometries of fillet weld specified hot spot locations meshes in extrapolation regions various load cases and boundary conditions as well as automatic parametric calculation will be considered in the modeling 2 bird beak shs joints both diamond and square bird beak t shape joints were employed in this study to illustrate the modeling process of such tubular connections with complicated welding conjunctions as shown in fig 2 the lengths of chord and brace is respectively noted as l 0 and l 1 the sectional width and wall thickness of chord is noted as b 0 and t 0 and the sectional width and wall thickness of brace is noted as b 1 and t 1 three non dimensional parameters are defined as brace chord width ratio β b 1 b 0 chord wall slenderness ratio 2γ b 0 t 0 and brace chord wall thickness ratio τ t 1 t 0 which are identical to the considerations for conventional shs joints the welding junction of a bird beak joint contains the so called crown areas and saddle areas which are very common in circular hollow section chs joints as a result high stress concentrations were certainly expected within these areas by referring to the recommendations by tong et al 2014 2016 and cheng et al 2014 2015a six saddle hot spots lines i e sa b sa c and sa d on chord and sa e sa f and sa a on brace and six crown hot spots lines i e cr b cr c and cr d on chord and cr e cr f and cr a on brace were selected for either diamond or square bird beak joints as shown in fig 2 the meshes of the model should be exactly consistent with these hot lines 3 aims and principles of modeling 3 1 modeling aims the fe modeling described in this paper is supposed to satisfy the aims as the following i bird beak configurations including the saddle and crown geometries the sectional corners as well as the weld dimensions around the brace to chord junction can be accurately simulated in the model ii the stress components perpendicular to weld toes within the extrapolation region at specified critical locations i e hot spots can be obtained from the model so that the structural hot spot stresses at weld toes can be mathematically calculated iii typical load cases at member ends including axial force in plane bending and out of plane bending can be properly considered iv parametric calculation considering common value ranges of three non dimensional parameters i e β 2γ τ can be efficiently conducted and stress outputs at specified locations can be automatically read from the fe models according to prescribed rules and then be automatically processed by mathematical softwares 3 2 modeling principles based on the aims the following principles are adopted in the modeling i the general finite element software ansys ansys 2016 is employed and the ansys parametric design language apdl is used for the convenience of parametric analysis ii three typical non dimensional parameters i e brace chord width ratio β chord wall slenderness ratio 2γ and brace chord wall thickness ratio τ are considered as the major controllable variables and the other dimensional parameters are mainly determined by them corresponding to engineering applications the value ranges of three non dimensional parameters are taken as 0 3 β 1 0 diamond bird beak 0 3 β 1 3 square bird beak 10 2γ 25 and 0 3 τ 1 0 in all finite element models the chord wall thickness t 0 is originally defined as 10 mm and subsequently other geometric dimensions i e chord width b 0 brace width b 1 and brace wall thickness t 1 are determined by varying non dimensional parameters i e b 0 2γ t 0 b 1 β b 0 t 1 τ t 0 iii solid95 elements each containing 20 nodes are used and nonlinear printout at each integration point are pre defined the solid elements are efficient in constructing the complex geometries of shs walls and fillet welds especially for the crown and saddle areas where numerous spatial curves and spatial surfaces exist iv extrapolation regions near weld toes should be defined in strict accordance with the regulations in iiw international institute of welding iiw 2008 and cidect zhao et al 2000 fatigue design guides that is the distance from the welding toe to the start of the extrapolation region is equal to the lager value of 0 4t and 4 mm and the extrapolation region have a length of t where t represents the wall thickness of the member on which the stresses were extrapolated in this work the extrapolation region was uniformly set to start from 4 mm away from the weld toe since both chord and brace wall thicknesses are not greater than 10 mm v map meshing instead of free meshing is commonly suggested since the nodes in the specified hot lines are required to be exactly consistent with the characteristic points within the extrapolation regions so that the hot spot stresses at weld toes can be extrapolated directly from the nodal stress components vi batch parametric analysis and data processing are automatically carried out by using the third party programs tools or plugins to connect the fe software and the mathematical software 4 procedure of modeling 4 1 general information t shape bird beak joints were typically used in this section to demonstrate the modeling procedures of such type of tubular joints the whole joint was first divided into two zones i e core zone and non core zone where the core zone represents the parts around the weld junctions with fine meshes and the non core zone includes the remaining parts with coarse meshes in the core zone the parts away from the welds were further defined as the extrapolation region and the transition region as shown in fig 3 only a quarter joint was representatively modeled due to the symmetry in the quarter model four crown spots i e cr a cr b cr c cr f and four saddle spots i e sa c sa d sa e sa f were considered for diamond bird beak joints while four crown spots i e cr a cr b cr c cr f and six saddle spots i e sa a sa b sa c sa d sa e sa f were considered for square bird beak joints the specified hot lines were required to be perpendicular to the weld toes 4 2 modeling of diamond bird beak joints 4 2 1 geometry of joint core zone the geometries of joint core zone were constructed by successively building the brace parts and the chord parts 4 3 step i building the brace parts the top surface of the chord including the curved surfaces at sectional corners was first established by taking the center of the chord section as the origin of the coordinates the area of the brace section at the core zone boundary was subsequently built and then extruded along the downward direction of brace axis so that a brace volume was formed this brace volume will be further divided by the previous chord s top surface and the brace parts below the surface as well as the surface itself will be deleted at the end of this step no more divisions were required for the brace volume since the hot lines on the brace are parallel to the brace s longitudinal axis fig 4 demonstrates the three building stages of brace parts in this step that is extrusion division and partition 4 4 step ii building the chord parts the chord modeling is much more complex than the brace because some oblique hot lines should be specially considered especially for spots sa d and cr b where the hot lines were neither parallel nor perpendicular to the member s axis further divisions should be made to the volumes before meshing in order to ensure that the fem nodes in these hot lines can be generated according to the pre specified distances so that the nodal stress components can be directly used for the extrapolations the following three sub steps were implemented during this stage sub step 1 building the flat parts of the chord s top flange several key points e g a b c a b c were first generated by translating the key points e g a b c away from the brace to chord intersections in prescribed distances from their original locations and the boundaries of weld regions i e line a b c and extrapolation regions i e line a b c were then constructed as shown in fig 5 the distances between parallel lines a b c and a b c equal to the length of extrapolation region i e wall thickness t lines a a and b b respectively represents the hot lines sa c and sa d the volumes were formed by extruding these flat surfaces along the wall thickness direction in this sub step the work plane was transferred to the inclined plane of the brace section that has been produced by the division using chord s top surface in step i sub step 2 building the curved parts of the chord s top corner the chord s corner section at the brace to chord intersection which consists of two straight lines and two curved lines was first built and then extruded along the longitudinal direction of the chord so that the crown part was generated the weld region the extrapolation region and the transition region were further identified from the created part according to the prescribed dimensions as a result key points e e e f f f d and d were generated as shown in fig 6 by introducing a plane running through the key point d and perpendicular to the weld edge e f the hot line cr b was represented by the curved line d d where key point d was the intersection point between the introduced plane and the straight line b c next deleting and merging of the overlapped volumes around the crown zone were performed by which all essential crown parts shown in fig 6 were finally created the curved line d d which exactly represents the hot line cr b was unchanged since its first appearance sub step 3 building the remaining parts of the chord that is the bottom flange the bottom corner as well as the lateral corner these parts were generated by simply extruding the corresponding sectional areas of the chord along the longitudinal direction the sectional areas should be properly divided in prior to the extruding so that the subsequent map meshing can be conducted as shown in fig 7 note that all the areas generated are the quadrilaterals each of which is composed of four straight or curved lines the chord parts inside the brace tube were simultaneously constructed in sub steps 1 and 2 4 4 1 meshing of joint core zone the meshing of joint core zone was carried out after the construction of their geometric parts map meshing was implemented after the edges of each quadrilateral area having been divided into several equal sized segments and as a result tetrahedral shaped solid elements instead of pyramid shaped solid elements were generated the element sizes within weld regions and extrapolation regions were as small as 2 mm which was convinced to cover the most cases of shs wall thicknesses and to be consistent with the distances between the basic elements of the strip gauges which have been commonly used in test to record the strains at several continuous positions cheng et al 2014 2015a the meshes within the transition regions were twice coarser i e element size of 4 mm than those in extrapolation regions all sectional walls were divided into four element mesh layers in their thickness directions the adopted meshes were considered to be both accurate and time saving after the comparative analysis of mesh controlling parameters and if necessary the meshes can be refined or coarsened by merely adjusting the values of those parameters 4 4 2 modeling of joint non core zones the non core zones of the joint both geometries and meshes were constructed by extruding the chord s and brace s sectional meshes at the boundaries of the core zone the element sizes in the longitudinal direction of the member were set to be four times i e 16 mm the length of elements in transition regions since the concerned nodal stresses within extrapolation regions will be hardly influenced by the non core zone meshes which are far away from the welds 4 4 3 modeling of welds the fillet welds commonly as the strengthening of partial penetration groove welds at brace to chord intersections should also be simulated in the model since their geometries significantly affect the stresses around the weld toes in this modeling an area of fillet weld section was first constructed by introducing an arc line at the symmetry plane of the whole joint and was then extruded along the intersections between brace and chord until the geometries of fillet welds were finally constructed the mapped meshes of the welds were highly consistent with the existing nodes in the weld regions that have been previously specified on the chord and brace surfaces the geometries of welds in junction areas were determined according to aws code american welding society aws 2010 that is for the crown areas the weld lengths projected on the chord equal to t 1 2 and the weld lengths projected on the brace equal to t 1 for the saddle areas the weld lengths projected on the chord equal to 2 t 1 2 and the weld lengths projected on the brace equal to 2 t 1 the final meshes of joint core zone are shown in fig 8 4 5 modeling of square bird beak joints the modeling procedures of square bird beak joint are totally the same as those of diamond bird beak one and therefore the strategies and techniques adopted are very similar the major differences between two types of bird beak configurations lie in the modeling of saddle and crown parts where the meshes are required to be consistent with the specified hot line locations for the quarter square bird beak joint 1 one more hot line on the brace saddle i e sa a and one more hot line on the chord saddle i e sa b should be considered which indicates that more partitions of saddle areas are expected 2 during the modeling of curved parts of chord s top corner the procedures in sub step 2 are expected to be more simple because the hot line cr b which has been specified as perpendicular to the weld toe is also parallel to the longitudinal axis of the chord concretely no more operations are required after the crown parts including weld regions extrapolation regions as well as transition regions have been generated by simply extruding the chord s top corner section along the longitudinal direction of the chord the generated parts in core zone of square bird beak joint are shown in fig 9 similar mesh controlling parameters were used for square bird beak joint and the meshes in core zone are shown in fig 10 the subsequent procedures of modeling the non core zones and the fillet welds are exactly identical to those presented for diamond bird beak joint 4 6 load cases and boundary conditions for each member end all nodal dofs in the member end section were coupled to a referenced node that has been previously created at the center of the section in this way various load cases such as axial force in plane bending and out of plane bending can be applied to the member end by simply applying a concentrated force moment corresponding to unit nominal stress to the referenced node at section center the boundary conditions were also applied to the joint in the same way the influence analysis of member length were also carried out and results show that in case of brace axial force the scfs of t joints will not be changed if chord and brace are respectively longer than 18 and 3 times its sectional width in this research the lengths of chord and brace are selected as l 0 24b 0 and l 1 3b 1 so that the boundary effects of member ends on the joint core zone will be virtually eliminated 4 7 data processing the compiled apdl files were organized by introducing practical extraction and report language perl online perl documentation so that the batch analysis can be performed and all the ansys output files were combined into one again by perl so that the mathematical functions provided in matlab matlab 2017 or microsoft excel software can be called to run the extrapolating calculation automatically 5 results of modeling 5 1 stress concentrations by employing the t joint with non dimensional parameters of β 0 7 2γ 20 and τ 0 7 the stress concentrations at specified hot spots of diamond and square bird beak joints under brace axial forces were plotted in fig 11 and fig 12 where scf was calculated as the nodal stress component perpendicular to weld toe divided by the nominal stress on brace section it can be found from the figures that except for two saddle spots i e sa d and sa f in diamond bird beak joint non linear variations of scfs towards the weld toe are obvious for most spots in bird beak joint therefore quadratic functions are commonly required for the numerical fitting in order to ensure the accuracy of scf extrapolations in this study the least square method was introduced for the quadratic extrapolations and the derived scfs were used for the analysis 5 2 model validation in order to validate the accuracy of modeling seven diamond bird beak t joints whose scfs under brace axial forces have been experimentally measured by tong et al 2014 were numerically analyzed by using the presented approaches comparisons of scf data at various hot spots are shown in table 1 and fig 13 it can be seen that the numerical scfs from the present analysis could be either greater or smaller than those obtained from the test the average value of scffem scftest ratios goes to 0 97 and 1 07 respectively for chord spots and brace spots nine square bird beak t joints tested by cheng et al 2014 have also been employed for the validation and the comparisons in fig 14 show that the average value of scffem scftest ratios goes to 1 15 and 1 07 respectively for chord spot sa c and brace spot sa a considering the weld geometry differences including weld sizes and weld toe shapes between specimens and fe models as well as the unavoidable measurement errors for gauge elements within extrapolation regions such scf deviations at investigated spots could be acceptable the fe models established in this research could be regarded as accurate enough 5 3 parametric study as the ultimate goal of the modeling work and as the greatest challenge in apdl compiling parametric study was successfully carried out by considering common value ranges of three non dimensional parameters both diamond and square bird beak t joints under brace axial forces were employed for the analysis fig 15 shows the scf variations of diamond bird beak t joints respectively as the functions of non dimensional parameter β 2γ and τ it can be seen that 1 in case of variable β fig 15 a b both crown and saddle scfs are enlarged as β is increased from 0 4 to 0 75 and approximate linear variations between scf and β are evident 2 in case of variable 2γ fig 15 c d the scfs could either increase or decrease as 2γ is increased from 12 5 to 22 5 the influences of 2γ are comparatively insignificant since the scf variations are usually within 50 of the original values 3 in case of variable τ fig 15 e f increases in both crown and saddle scfs with enlarging τ are also evident despite the possible functions of curves e g linear parabolic and power could be different for various spot locations 4 in case of identical non dimensional parameters the scfs on the chord could be either greater or smaller than those on the brace and comparable scfs are found at crown and saddle areas comparatively spots cr c and cr f provide the highest scfs within the crown area and spots sa c sa d and sa f provide the highest scfs within the saddle area the scfs at spots cr a and sa f are observed to be the smallest respectively within the crown area and the saddle area the influences of non dimensional parameters on the scfs of square bird beak t joints are demonstrated in fig 16 the following can be concluded 1 in case of variable β fig 16 a b increasing of β always enhance the scfs on the chord crown area and could either enhance or depress the scfs on the brace crown area the scfs at the saddle area first increase and then decrease as β grows from 0 4 to 1 3 and the peak points respectively correspond to β 0 9 for chord spots and β 1 1 for brace spots 2 in case of variable 2γ fig 16 c d the scfs curves of crown spots first decline and then ascend with increasing 2γ while for the saddle spots the scfs are always improved as 2γ is enhanced from 12 5 to 25 with the rates of increase being slowed down gradually 3 in case of variable τ fig 16 e f except for the saddle spots on the brace the scfs are all enhanced by τ increases where several types of functions such as linear parabolic and power functions could be used to describe the curve variations the influences of τ on the scfs of brace saddle spots i e sa e sa f sa a are fairly invisible 4 in case of identical non dimensional parameters the scfs on the chord are always much greater than those on the brace within the considered value ranges of non dimensional parameters the highest reachable scfs at the saddle area are obviously larger than those at the crown area comparatively chord spots sa b and sa c whose scf values are very close to each other provide the highest scfs within the saddle area and similar findings are real for crown spots cr b and cr c 5 4 comparisons between square and diamond bird beak joints in order to provide more references for the engineering applications comparisons of scfs between square and diamond bird beak t joints under brace axial forces were carried out by utilizing parametric analysis data fig 17 demonstrates the scf ratios of two types of bird beak joints respectively for the maximal scf in the chord brace and whole joint the influences of varying β 2γ and τ are also investigated it can be seen that all scfdbbj scfsbbj ratios of chord are below 1 which means the maximal chord scfs of diamond bird beak joints are always smaller than those of square bird beak joints in case of same non dimensional parameters as for the brace spots diamond bird beak joints could provide greater scfs than square bird beak joints especially when β or 2γ is relatively small however since the maximal scfs within the whole bird beak joints are more likely to occur in the chord instead of in the brace diamond bird beak joints are expected to be better in relieving stress concentrations than square bird beak joints in case of identical non dimensional parameters 6 conclusions finite element modeling techniques based on ansys parametric design language were presented for the hot spot stress analysis of both diamond and square bird beak shs joints in offshore structures the novel configurations including crown and saddle areas as well as the geometries of fillet welds were accurately simulated by introducing tetrahedral shaped solid elements the refined meshes at hot spot locations were strictly consistent with the requirements of

23324,autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are advanced near bottom platforms that can be used for magnetometric analysis of the seafloor however the vehicle itself can cause interference with the magnetic measurements which need to be corrected here we derive a functional relation between the magnetic measurements and auv s heading that is based on the composition and causes of an auv s near bottom magnetic anomaly we set up a method to correct tri axial magnetometer interference caused by the auv magnetic induction intensity is removed using magnetic data collected during the spinning of the auv connatural magnetic field of the auv is collected and subtracted by using portable magnetometer the method performs very well during qianlongii auv experimental tests performed on land and in lake the method also corrects magnetic data by an autonomous benthic explorer abe auv and yields good results the effects of main components of qianlongii auv on the magnetic measurement results are analyzed and make sure dominating interference produced by the batteries that is mitigated using a probe extension pole furthermore excellent survey data and satisfactory correction results are obtained during the auv sea trials this verifies the efficacy of the proposed method for correcting tri axial magnetometer interference caused by auv keywords autonomous underwater vehicle three component magnetometer near bottom magnetic data heading correction magnetic interference 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are a type of deep submergence vehicles blidberg 2001 generally they can be readily mobilized for use as a stand alone vehicle on a wide range of research vessels they can also be used very effectively in tandem with the mothership or with other remotely operated vehicles to improve the efficiency of deep submergence investigations auvs can operate in extreme terrains including volcano calderas and scarps they are equipped with a standard suite of engineering sensors such as the phins inertial navigation system forward looking sonars and attitude sensors they can also be mounted with scientific sensors such as multibeam mapping sonars sidescan sonars ctd optical backscatter sensors and seafloor photography cameras rothenbeck et al 2013 yoerger et al 2006 2007 blidberg 2001 multibeam bathymetry and sidescan sonars provide maps and images of seafloor and can cover large geographical areas however they only provide surface and shallow crust information in contrast geophysical methods offer a means of acquiring data over large areas of seafloor and can collect subsurface structural information williams 2007 magnetometer is one of the most widely used geophysical equipment used on auv platforms it can acquire near bottom data which can be used to study geologic structure basement type ridge expansion rate and other seafloor characteristics caratori tontini et al 2012 tivey and dyment 2010 tominaga et al 2008 fujii et al 2015 2016 however magnetometers are prone to magnetic disturbances from the surrounding environment such as interferences caused in the presence of ferromagnetic materials and strong electric currents emanating from the auv itself and its associated equipment traditional proton or optical pumping magnetometers lenz and edelstein 2006 do not work well in the presence of large interferences caused by the auv itself instead fluxgate magnetometers primdahl 1979 ripka and kaspar 1998 auster et al 2009 which have high sensitivity stability and lineation can acquire three component and gradient magnetic information in the presence of large interferences or weak magnetic environmental interferences lenz and edelstein 2006 currently three component fluxgate magnetometers are used to collect magnetic data in many auvs such as abyss auv szitkar et al 2015 asterx auv szitkar et al 2016 autosub6000 auv mcphail et al 2010 and the autonomous benthic explorer abe auv tivey et al 1997 german et al 2008 when using auv near bottom platform information regarding effective magnetic anomalies can only be obtained after correcting for magnetic interferences and then completing the routine processing work for example abe auv produces a field effect on the order of 1100 nt during a spin however this field may still vary by up to 300 nt after correction which is not sufficient enough to obtain accurate data ftp ftp whoi edu pub users mtivey mfiles therefore further study of the nature of magnetic anomalies and the associated potential magnetic interferences is required to obtain adequate three component magnetic data 2 components of raw near bottom magnetic data 2 1 outside magnetic interference the magnetic field at any point on or outward from the earth s surface comprises magnetic field originating from the earth s core and crust along with contributions from external field the external magnetic field is generally affected only by magnetic diurnal variation which typically has a daily amplitude variation of approximately 30 nt lee et al 1996 though it may sometimes reach 40 60 nt luo et al 2015 during marine magnetic surveys the daily variation is usually ignored as it is difficult to set up an appropriate observation station and the variation is typically well below that of the typical magnetic field anomalies generated by crustal sources the diurnal variation can also be reduced using data from a nearby geomagnetic station or if possible by installing a station on a mooring system magnetic storm events can temporarily affect every place on the planet as well as affect the auroral and equatorial electrojets which are more localized external disturbances these disturbances can interfere with data collection during research as magnetic data would not be available during a magnetic storm the effect of magnetic field of the earth s core is corrected by calculating a correction factor from a function the most representative function is the international geomagnetic reference field igrf and the independent variables are chosen to be the point location parameters the crustal magnetic field including the target geomagnetic anomalies also include the field of various geological bodies therefore it is difficult to separately obtain the target anomalies nevertheless we can perform an up downward continuation and reduce the curved surface into a horizontal plane to lessen the effect of non target objects during processing of the magnetic data certainly with magnetic anomaly data and magnetization of rocks we can invert the distribution of magnetization and infer or explain the geomagnetic structure of the targets by combining other available survey data 2 2 platform influence auvs themselves also contribute to magnetic distortions which can affect the acquisition of useable magnetic anomaly data these distortions can be divided into permanent and induced magnetic field effects caused by the vehicle leliak 1961 the permanent magnetization effect is simply the additive magnetic field produced by permanent magnets or electrical currents routine reduction of the permanent magnetization effect involves the introduction of an offset in each direction of the three channels of the magnetometer to minimize the deviation between the observations and the corresponding igrf bronner et al 2013 the magnetization effect is induced by materials that generate their own magnetic field and cause a distortion in the underlying magnetic field in both intensity and orientation the usual correction method is performed by finding a suitable functional relation between the field intensity and heading angle caruso 2000 tivey 1996 for example the induction field correction equation 2π periodic function of heading for the induced magnetization in abe auv is 1 h i h i h m cos h d where h i is the magnetic induction intensity h i is the variation of h i with heading h and is a function of the multiplication factor m h and declination d williams 2007 we have developed a 4500 m auv named qianlongii auv which contains integrated technologies including hydrothermal anomaly detection microtopography measurement video and photographic recording and magnetic surveying equipment therefore it can be a practical system for deep sea exploration of mineral resources such as polymetallic sulfides preliminarily we attempted to correct the magnetic interferences from our auv using typical methods but did not obtain good results for this reason we began with a theoretical analysis to perform a systematic study of the magnetic interferences caused by the auv we then amended the original correction method and performed trials on land in a lake and at sea to determine whether the new correction method could be used to obtain satisfactory correction results 3 correction methods 3 1 interference correction using auv heading when auv platform moves it cuts magnetic induction lines and produces induced electromotive forces which are represented by equation 2 changes in the induced electromotive force result from both changes in the magnetic flux as it passes through a closed electric circuit and those in the effective area swept by the magnetic induction lines auv is essentially a closed electric circuit and a charged conductor which induces changes in the magnetic flux and magnetic induction lines 2 e k h i t h s ω h l v where e is the induced electromotive force k is a constant that is equivalent to coil turns in the original definition h i is the induced magnetic field h is the geomagnetic field and its corresponding intensity is a known parameter that we can calculate or inquire according to the corresponding geo location information thereinto e is perpendicular to h and obey the right hand screw rule h i is parallel to h t s is time s is the effective area of the geomagnetic field swept ω is the angular frequency while auv is rotating l is the effective length of the conductor and v is its velocity cutting magnetic induction line thereinto ω can take a h with respect to t represented as a derivative see equation 3 3 ω d h d t where as s l and v are related to the size parameters and h of auv as follows respectively auv s pitch and roll generally vary only slightly during navigation so we assume that the vertical magnetic flux is constant and is affected only by the horizontal flux when calculating the effective sweep area of the magnetic induction lines induced by the closed electric circuit to analyze the magnetic flux as shown in fig 1 a the auv is simplified and represented as a regular hexahedron the effective sweep area s v of the four faces is made parallel to vertical direction z when the auv heading changes as shown in fig 1b this relation is described as follows 4 s v s a b b a s d c c d s b c c b s a d d a 2 b c sin h d 2 ac cos h d where s a b b a s d c c d s b c c b and s a d d a correlate with the effective sweep area obtained from the surfaces a b b a d c c d b c c b and a d d a of the hexahedron respectively a b and c are defined to be the size parameters of the hexahedron and d is the geomagnetic declination it is worth noting that the auv is simplified as a regular hexahedron just for convenience while derive the correction formulae even though the auv actually has not regular face we also can divide the auv face into series of effectively small closed electric rectangles whose faces are parallel to a b b a or are parallel to b c c b if so expressions on effective sweep area of these rectangles have the same period but different amplitudes and phases and can combine into the same cos sin function as equation 4 with different amplitude and phase but the period remains the same the flux of the two faces perpendicular to z is zero as the faces are parallel to h however the auv can also be considered as a conducting stick as it produces electric current during operation fig 1c it cuts the magnetic induction lines in both horizontal and vertical directions when the auv is seen as a conductor therefore the module of h l v can be defined as follows 5 h l v h h a sin h d d a 1 cos h d d t h v a 2 h 2 d h d t h h a 2 sin 2 h d d h d t h v a 2 h 2 d h d t where h h and h v are the horizontal and vertical intensities of the geomagnetic field respectively by incorporating equations 3 5 into equation 2 we obtain the module of h i t as following 6 h i t h h k 2 b c cos h d 2 a c sin h d a 2 sin 2 h d d h d t h v a 2 h 2 k d h d t 7 h i h h k 2 b c cos h d 2 a c sin h d a 2 sin 2 h d h h v a 2 h 2 k h the derivative of h is calculated from equation 8 8 h i h h h k 2 b c sin h d 2 a c cos h d a 2 sin 2 h d h v a 2 2 k this relation is then simplified to equation 9 h i h is the variation of h i and can be noted as h i k a b and c are constants and h h h v and d can also be regarded as constants as the survey area is relatively small 9 h i a 1 cos h d a 2 a 3 cos 2 h 2 d a 4 a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 in equation 9 indicates the fitting parameters obtained by fitting the magnetic data from each heading after the auv reaches its working depth and is driven in circles h i the variation in auv heading interference can be reduced using equation 9 3 2 inherent field correction the raw magnetic data are incorporated in equation 10 to obtain the actual local magnetic field from the measured data as shown in equation 11 the variation caused by the auv heading interference the igrf values and the intrinsic magnetic field produced by the auv are removed 10 h r a w i h i g r f i h i i h a u v h g e

heading h i and h i g r f i is the igrf obtained from a reference table to obtain the h a u v value we use the auv platform and a portable magnetometer to collect magnetic data from the same position in the experimental region the difference between the fitting value a 5 and h c o n where h c o n represents the data from the portable magnetometer is approximately equal to h a u v if the magnetic moment of the auv is known the magnetic induction of the magnetometer can also be calculated according to its installation position moreover the magnetic moment can be inversed using the auv s magnetic field distribution which can be collected by the portable magnetometer used during the test phase 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 correction test on land we selected one empty area where the magnetic environment was steady and hence there were less disturbances that might interfere with the examination of the detection ability of the magnetometer mounted on qianlongii auv two gsm19t series magnetometers were used one to collect diurnal observation data and another to compare with the data collected by the auv s magnetometer to calculate the auv s intrinsic magnetic field we obtained magnetic anomaly distributions under two conditions with the auv present in the experiment area auv present and with the auv absent in the experiment area auv absent to reduce the interference caused by the auv heading we collected magnetic data emanating from different directions using the auv platform to facilitate comparison we regarded the background magnetic field as a constant and did not remove the igrf the parameters in equation 9 were fitted with the magnetic data obtained from different directions and a 5 adding igrf was 56 294 nt table 1 the background magnetic intensity was measured by a gsm19t magnetometer and was approximately 53 972 nt fig 2 a combined with the a 5 parameter we obtained an h a u v value of approximately 2322 nt magnetic induction varied with changes in the magnetometer mounting position on the auv but the magnetic intensity could be easily calculated in arbitrary places when the intrinsic magnetic moment of the auv was known as shown in fig 1a the auv was regarded as a cuboid with uniform magnetization intensity its magnetic anomaly distribution was obtained under the auv present and auv absent conditions fig 2 then the intrinsic magnetic moment of the auv was inversed to approximately 7 2 a m2 this produced approximately 2333 nt of intrinsic magnetic intensity at the mounting position of the magnetometer which was fairly close to the fitting result fitting parameters of equation 11 in table 1 was used to acquire correction results for the magnetic data obtained from driving the auv around in circles during experimental tests performed on land the results in fig 3 show that the data accuracy was within 50 nt fig 3b and the original amplitude was as high as 5000 nt with a heading change fig 3a curves of the magnetic anomaly of a strong magnet were also collected by maintaining the auv at four attitudes as the auv platform was cumbersome to move we obtained the line data by moving the magnet along the survey line under the same conditions the red dots in fig 2b are corresponding to the observation points as shown in fig 4 a d though the baseline values were different the curve characteristics were very similar after correction the magnetic anomalies in all directions fig 4e corresponded with each other there were still some differences from the results measured by the gsm19t magnetometer which was located further away from the auv these differences may have been caused by the auv magnetometer s relatively low accuracy nearer to the auv the bias had a larger difference as the auv s center position had a bias when changing its attitude under limited test conditions moreover the decay rate of magnetic induction was inversely proportional to the cube of the distance between the magnet and the measurement point 4 2 correction test in a lake after the test on land we performed system and debugging testing in a lake to verify the effectiveness of the near bottom magnetic data correction by our auv platform first a g882 marine magnetometer was used to collect the background magnetic field of the test area as shown in fig 5 the background difference was approximately 40 nt in the presence of a strong magnetic anomaly observed in the northwest region of the testing area magnetic data were then collected along the black lines using the auv platform and the corresponding anomalous character was generally consistent with the results obtained by the g882 magnetometer however the morphology was rough fig 5b therefore the auv magnetometer s accuracy was low and significant noise was present to study our auv s ability to detect magnetic anomalies we searched for a location in our study area with a steady magnetic field we then placed a set of strong magnets on the lake bottom and designed the survey lines shown as pink lines in fig 5a the auv was kept at an attitude of approximately 20 m and the distribution of the magnetic anomaly was obtained after correction as shown in fig 5c a low magnetic anomaly was detected on top of the magnets the anomaly was seen as a small circle because the magnets can be regarded as a point source and the magnetic intensity attenuates sharply with distance 4 3 analysis of heading correction results initially the auv platform was not analyzed to determine how to cut the magnetic field and produce magnetic induction based on the magnetic data obtained from driving the auv in circles equation 1 only considered the effect with a period of 2π applied to reduce the heading interference however the interference was not completely removed and continued to exist with an observable undulation of period π fig 6 to correct this a functional relation between the magnetic measurements and auv heading was derived what s worth mentioning is that we collected near bottom magnetic data with abe auv during the second leg of the chinese cruise dy115 19 on board r v dayangyihao in 2007 heading interference from abe auv was then corrected using equations 1 and 9 denoted as first and second methods respectively fig 7 shows that the difference in magnetic readings in all orientations was as great as 10 000 nt after correcting the data with the two correction functions the undulations were effectively removed furthermore the range of correction results obtained using equation 9 was within those obtained using equation 1 this indicated that our correction method was appropriate for correcting magnetometer interferences from the auv as the results compared well with the predicted results from equation 1 we simplified our auv to derive the correction formula but this did not affect our correction results we also attempted to correct the three component data with equation 9 and the correction results were consistent with the direct correction obtained using the total field fig 8 thus if the three component position relative to the auv platform is known we can correct and use the three component information 4 4 effect of auv main components on measured results using our correction method we could obtain valid magnetic data however the accuracy of the data still required improvement thus we investigated the contribution of each of the main components of qianlongii auv magnetic induction to develop additional measures to reduce the corresponding interference the running motor could have affected the measurements during auv operation we specifically tested the motor s influence on the measured results at the hangzhou geomagnetic station the results shown in fig 9 a indicate that the effect of the motor could be greatly decreased as long as the distance between the motor and the magnetometer was sufficiently large all motors in the auv were far from the magnetometer approximately 1 m away and thus were expected to have minimal influence magnetometer readings were analyzed after changing the operative modes of the motors at the stem and stern fig 9b shows the magnetic field when the speed of the stern motors was fixed at 200 r min and that of the stem motors was varied a regular change of 40 nt was observed once all motors were shut off with an additional 20 nt undulation during changes in the working conditions of the stem motors while the stern motors were kept at the constant rate of 200 r min as the observed undulation range was small and the motors typically worked in a relatively steady state the interference from the motors was not considered to be an important factor the battery compartment contained dry or rechargeable batteries which supplied power to the auv these batteries produced alternating current with dozens of amperes which inevitably produced strong interference we measured the interference from both dry batteries and a rechargeable battery during a lake trial on an island near the survey area the measured results with the magnetometer close to the batteries showed that the magnetometer readings were heavy influenced by the battery compartment with observed undulations of up to 15 000 with dry batteries and 20 000 nt with rechargeable batteries to correct the interference we designed a 1 3 m long extension mount fig 10 to increase the distance between the magnetic probe and the vehicle and especially to increase the distance to the battery compartment after the mount was installed on the auv s stern the difference in the magnetic readings was reduced to only 400 nt and the accuracy was within 30 nt 3σ where σ is the standard deviation after correction fig 11 a and b this was an improvement compared to the accuracy obtained from the original probe location we again collected background magnetic data at 20 m equidepth spacing along the back lines fig 5a using the new probe location the corresponding magnetic anomaly fig 11c was consistent with the previous measurements fig 5b though more detailed anomalies were observed excellent magnetic measurement results and satisfactory correction results were obtained during the auv sea trials in the south china sea fig 11 dillustrates that our magnetometer readings in the auv were steady and had only minor jump points at each survey line the discontinuity of lines in the opposite direction mainly caused by heading interference was corrected well by this method finally we obtained precise near bottom magnetic data using this auv method and the corresponding correction method as shown in fig 11e 5 conclusion auv platforms are highly promising devices that can be used to further enhance near bottom marine geophysical exploration the key to obtaining adequate measured data involves maintaining good coordination and cooperation between the prospecting equipment and auv in the case of our near bottom magnetometer mounted on qianlongii auv after the derivation of a correction function the establishment of a proper correction method and the perfection of our equipment and methodology we obtained excellent magnetic measurement results our results provide an effective method for detailed studies of magnetic anomalies geological structures and geomagnetic boundaries qianlongii auv was recently used to

23324,autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are advanced near bottom platforms that can be used for magnetometric analysis of the seafloor however the vehicle itself can cause interference with the magnetic measurements which need to be corrected here we derive a functional relation between the magnetic measurements and auv s heading that is based on the composition and causes of an auv s near bottom magnetic anomaly we set up a method to correct tri axial magnetometer interference caused by the auv magnetic induction intensity is removed using magnetic data collected during the spinning of the auv connatural magnetic field of the auv is collected and subtracted by using portable magnetometer the method performs very well during qianlongii auv experimental tests performed on land and in lake the method also corrects magnetic data by an autonomous benthic explorer abe auv and yields good results the effects of main components of qianlongii auv on the magnetic measurement results are analyzed and make sure dominating interference produced by the batteries that is mitigated using a probe extension pole furthermore excellent survey data and satisfactory correction results are obtained during the auv sea trials this verifies the efficacy of the proposed method for correcting tri axial magnetometer interference caused by auv keywords autonomous underwater vehicle three component magnetometer near bottom magnetic data heading correction magnetic interference 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are a type of deep submergence vehicles blidberg 2001 generally they can be readily mobilized for use as a stand alone vehicle on a wide range of research vessels they can also be used very effectively in tandem with the mothership or with other remotely operated vehicles to improve the efficiency of deep submergence investigations auvs can operate in extreme terrains including volcano calderas and scarps they are equipped with a standard suite of engineering sensors such as the phins inertial navigation system forward looking sonars and attitude sensors they can also be mounted with scientific sensors such as multibeam mapping sonars sidescan sonars ctd optical backscatter sensors and seafloor photography cameras rothenbeck et al 2013 yoerger et al 2006 2007 blidberg 2001 multibeam bathymetry and sidescan sonars provide maps and images of seafloor and can cover large geographical areas however they only provide surface and shallow crust information in contrast geophysical methods offer a means of acquiring data over large areas of seafloor and can collect subsurface structural information williams 2007 magnetometer is one of the most widely used geophysical equipment used on auv platforms it can acquire near bottom data which can be used to study geologic structure basement type ridge expansion rate and other seafloor characteristics caratori tontini et al 2012 tivey and dyment 2010 tominaga et al 2008 fujii et al 2015 2016 however magnetometers are prone to magnetic disturbances from the surrounding environment such as interferences caused in the presence of ferromagnetic materials and strong electric currents emanating from the auv itself and its associated equipment traditional proton or optical pumping magnetometers lenz and edelstein 2006 do not work well in the presence of large interferences caused by the auv itself instead fluxgate magnetometers primdahl 1979 ripka and kaspar 1998 auster et al 2009 which have high sensitivity stability and lineation can acquire three component and gradient magnetic information in the presence of large interferences or weak magnetic environmental interferences lenz and edelstein 2006 currently three component fluxgate magnetometers are used to collect magnetic data in many auvs such as abyss auv szitkar et al 2015 asterx auv szitkar et al 2016 autosub6000 auv mcphail et al 2010 and the autonomous benthic explorer abe auv tivey et al 1997 german et al 2008 when using auv near bottom platform information regarding effective magnetic anomalies can only be obtained after correcting for magnetic interferences and then completing the routine processing work for example abe auv produces a field effect on the order of 1100 nt during a spin however this field may still vary by up to 300 nt after correction which is not sufficient enough to obtain accurate data ftp ftp whoi edu pub users mtivey mfiles therefore further study of the nature of magnetic anomalies and the associated potential magnetic interferences is required to obtain adequate three component magnetic data 2 components of raw near bottom magnetic data 2 1 outside magnetic interference the magnetic field at any point on or outward from the earth s surface comprises magnetic field originating from the earth s core and crust along with contributions from external field the external magnetic field is generally affected only by magnetic diurnal variation which typically has a daily amplitude variation of approximately 30 nt lee et al 1996 though it may sometimes reach 40 60 nt luo et al 2015 during marine magnetic surveys the daily variation is usually ignored as it is difficult to set up an appropriate observation station and the variation is typically well below that of the typical magnetic field anomalies generated by crustal sources the diurnal variation can also be reduced using data from a nearby geomagnetic station or if possible by installing a station on a mooring system magnetic storm events can temporarily affect every place on the planet as well as affect the auroral and equatorial electrojets which are more localized external disturbances these disturbances can interfere with data collection during research as magnetic data would not be available during a magnetic storm the effect of magnetic field of the earth s core is corrected by calculating a correction factor from a function the most representative function is the international geomagnetic reference field igrf and the independent variables are chosen to be the point location parameters the crustal magnetic field including the target geomagnetic anomalies also include the field of various geological bodies therefore it is difficult to separately obtain the target anomalies nevertheless we can perform an up downward continuation and reduce the curved surface into a horizontal plane to lessen the effect of non target objects during processing of the magnetic data certainly with magnetic anomaly data and magnetization of rocks we can invert the distribution of magnetization and infer or explain the geomagnetic structure of the targets by combining other available survey data 2 2 platform influence auvs themselves also contribute to magnetic distortions which can affect the acquisition of useable magnetic anomaly data these distortions can be divided into permanent and induced magnetic field effects caused by the vehicle leliak 1961 the permanent magnetization effect is simply the additive magnetic field produced by permanent magnets or electrical currents routine reduction of the permanent magnetization effect involves the introduction of an offset in each direction of the three channels of the magnetometer to minimize the deviation between the observations and the corresponding igrf bronner et al 2013 the magnetization effect is induced by materials that generate their own magnetic field and cause a distortion in the underlying magnetic field in both intensity and orientation the usual correction method is performed by finding a suitable functional relation between the field intensity and heading angle caruso 2000 tivey 1996 for example the induction field correction equation 2π periodic function of heading for the induced magnetization in abe auv is 1 h i h i h m cos h d where h i is the magnetic induction intensity h i is the variation of h i with heading h and is a function of the multiplication factor m h and declination d williams 2007 we have developed a 4500 m auv named qianlongii auv which contains integrated technologies including hydrothermal anomaly detection microtopography measurement video and photographic recording and magnetic surveying equipment therefore it can be a practical system for deep sea exploration of mineral resources such as polymetallic sulfides preliminarily we attempted to correct the magnetic interferences from our auv using typical methods but did not obtain good results for this reason we began with a theoretical analysis to perform a systematic study of the magnetic interferences caused by the auv we then amended the original correction method and performed trials on land in a lake and at sea to determine whether the new correction method could be used to obtain satisfactory correction results 3 correction methods 3 1 interference correction using auv heading when auv platform moves it cuts magnetic induction lines and produces induced electromotive forces which are represented by equation 2 changes in the induced electromotive force result from both changes in the magnetic flux as it passes through a closed electric circuit and those in the effective area swept by the magnetic induction lines auv is essentially a closed electric circuit and a charged conductor which induces changes in the magnetic flux and magnetic induction lines 2 e k h i t h s ω h l v where e is the induced electromotive force k is a constant that is equivalent to coil turns in the original definition h i is the induced magnetic field h is the geomagnetic field and its corresponding intensity is a known parameter that we can calculate or inquire according to the corresponding geo location information thereinto e is perpendicular to h and obey the right hand screw rule h i is parallel to h t s is time s is the effective area of the geomagnetic field swept ω is the angular frequency while auv is rotating l is the effective length of the conductor and v is its velocity cutting magnetic induction line thereinto ω can take a h with respect to t represented as a derivative see equation 3 3 ω d h d t where as s l and v are related to the size parameters and h of auv as follows respectively auv s pitch and roll generally vary only slightly during navigation so we assume that the vertical magnetic flux is constant and is affected only by the horizontal flux when calculating the effective sweep area of the magnetic induction lines induced by the closed electric circuit to analyze the magnetic flux as shown in fig 1 a the auv is simplified and represented as a regular hexahedron the effective sweep area s v of the four faces is made parallel to vertical direction z when the auv heading changes as shown in fig 1b this relation is described as follows 4 s v s a b b a s d c c d s b c c b s a d d a 2 b c sin h d 2 ac cos h d where s a b b a s d c c d s b c c b and s a d d a correlate with the effective sweep area obtained from the surfaces a b b a d c c d b c c b and a d d a of the hexahedron respectively a b and c are defined to be the size parameters of the hexahedron and d is the geomagnetic declination it is worth noting that the auv is simplified as a regular hexahedron just for convenience while derive the correction formulae even though the auv actually has not regular face we also can divide the auv face into series of effectively small closed electric rectangles whose faces are parallel to a b b a or are parallel to b c c b if so expressions on effective sweep area of these rectangles have the same period but different amplitudes and phases and can combine into the same cos sin function as equation 4 with different amplitude and phase but the period remains the same the flux of the two faces perpendicular to z is zero as the faces are parallel to h however the auv can also be considered as a conducting stick as it produces electric current during operation fig 1c it cuts the magnetic induction lines in both horizontal and vertical directions when the auv is seen as a conductor therefore the module of h l v can be defined as follows 5 h l v h h a sin h d d a 1 cos h d d t h v a 2 h 2 d h d t h h a 2 sin 2 h d d h d t h v a 2 h 2 d h d t where h h and h v are the horizontal and vertical intensities of the geomagnetic field respectively by incorporating equations 3 5 into equation 2 we obtain the module of h i t as following 6 h i t h h k 2 b c cos h d 2 a c sin h d a 2 sin 2 h d d h d t h v a 2 h 2 k d h d t 7 h i h h k 2 b c cos h d 2 a c sin h d a 2 sin 2 h d h h v a 2 h 2 k h the derivative of h is calculated from equation 8 8 h i h h h k 2 b c sin h d 2 a c cos h d a 2 sin 2 h d h v a 2 2 k this relation is then simplified to equation 9 h i h is the variation of h i and can be noted as h i k a b and c are constants and h h h v and d can also be regarded as constants as the survey area is relatively small 9 h i a 1 cos h d a 2 a 3 cos 2 h 2 d a 4 a 5 where a i i 1 2 3 4 5 in equation 9 indicates the fitting parameters obtained by fitting the magnetic data from each heading after the auv reaches its working depth and is driven in circles h i the variation in auv heading interference can be reduced using equation 9 3 2 inherent field correction the raw magnetic data are incorporated in equation 10 to obtain the actual local magnetic field from the measured data as shown in equation 11 the variation caused by the auv heading interference the igrf values and the intrinsic magnetic field produced by the auv are removed 10 h r a w i h i g r f i h i i h a u v h g e

batteries and a rechargeable battery during a lake trial on an island near the survey area the measured results with the magnetometer close to the batteries showed that the magnetometer readings were heavy influenced by the battery compartment with observed undulations of up to 15 000 with dry batteries and 20 000 nt with rechargeable batteries to correct the interference we designed a 1 3 m long extension mount fig 10 to increase the distance between the magnetic probe and the vehicle and especially to increase the distance to the battery compartment after the mount was installed on the auv s stern the difference in the magnetic readings was reduced to only 400 nt and the accuracy was within 30 nt 3σ where σ is the standard deviation after correction fig 11 a and b this was an improvement compared to the accuracy obtained from the original probe location we again collected background magnetic data at 20 m equidepth spacing along the back lines fig 5a using the new probe location the corresponding magnetic anomaly fig 11c was consistent with the previous measurements fig 5b though more detailed anomalies were observed excellent magnetic measurement results and satisfactory correction results were obtained during the auv sea trials in the south china sea fig 11 dillustrates that our magnetometer readings in the auv were steady and had only minor jump points at each survey line the discontinuity of lines in the opposite direction mainly caused by heading interference was corrected well by this method finally we obtained precise near bottom magnetic data using this auv method and the corresponding correction method as shown in fig 11e 5 conclusion auv platforms are highly promising devices that can be used to further enhance near bottom marine geophysical exploration the key to obtaining adequate measured data involves maintaining good coordination and cooperation between the prospecting equipment and auv in the case of our near bottom magnetometer mounted on qianlongii auv after the derivation of a correction function the establishment of a proper correction method and the perfection of our equipment and methodology we obtained excellent magnetic measurement results our results provide an effective method for detailed studies of magnetic anomalies geological structures and geomagnetic boundaries qianlongii auv was recently used to prospect the seafloor of hydrothermal fields in the southwest india ridge it precisely measured parameters including topography near bottom magnetic data conductivity temperature depth ctd data and
