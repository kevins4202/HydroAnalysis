organic composite is an outstanding strategy that enhances the properties of both inorganic materials such as thermal and mechanical stability and organic material including flexibility and processability of the membranes therefore the surface wettability of the membranes is vital for pollutants separation here the high hydrophobic behavior of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes is altered to superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity via single step coating this pvdf membrane has high molecular separation due to the ultrathin thickness and good controllable interlayer in this study the pvdf membrane was by interfacial polymerization coated with a polyamide pam layer modified alumina nanoparticles al nps aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes and folic acid fa through a chemical grafting reaction the influence of the pam and al aptes fa content on the morphology structure antifouling and superhydrophilicity of the pvdf g pam al aptes fa membrane has been investigated which has enhanced the oil and salt rejection as well as filtration performance fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy showed the specific functional groups from the obtained

permeate flux over 90 salt rejection and almost 100 hydrocarbons and heavy metal ions rejection owing to membrane surface changes hydrophilicity and roughness this research will provide new insights on porous surface transformation to improve the separation and antifouling properties of pvdf membranes used in water purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords filtration process pvdf membrane nanomaterial superhydrophilic purification antifouling hydrocarbons metal ions and salts data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water has been always an essential substance in daily life for the world s social growth such as in industrial and agricultural applications its supply should be sustainable and cost effective to maintain the usable water in the world which is only 3 in comparison to the whole water resources worldwide 1 thus the treatment and utilization of the water were strongly required to resolve such global crisis nowadays membrane technologies can be effectively used for the substances transport between two and more components with using a semipermeable layer this kind of technology is less energy needed without using heat in comparison to the conventional one such as distillation one of the examples is the filtration method used pressure driven membrane technology approach 2 the contaminants can be removed from water with effective separation using various membranes synthesized from different materials and nanomaterials 3 8 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is extensively utilized for all water filtration applications because of its outstanding performance good processability and good mechanical features nevertheless the hydrophobic behavior of pvdf and the big pore size lead to the serious fouling problem for the membrane filtration containing inorganic organic and biological substances 9 pristine pvdf membrane also exhibited the low surface energy material with poor membrane wettability aggravating the sorption of organic and inorganic foulants on its surface 10 therefore to enhance the pvdf membrane surface energy generating hydrophilic behavior as well as tiny pore membrane size is becoming a crucial step for membrane ultrafiltration in the application of water treatment 11 in recent years some emerging technologies for water separation and purification methods were attracted much attention such as nanocomposite membranes coating blending inorganic nanoparticles with membrane materials and membrane surface modification by different means such as uv photo irradiation plasma and high energy irradiation 12 these innovative methods can be effective for mitigating membrane fouling enhancing water permeation and oil repellence and increasing ion rejection from salts as contaminant the compatibility between polymer matrix and inorganic nano filler is a big issue hindering the performance and stability of mixed matrix membranes 13 14 so it is required to have good synthesis methods in order to have good crosslink between the nanoparticles and the membrane components 15 16 surface modification thin film interfacial polymerization of the pristine pvdf membrane such as coating thin film interfacial polymerization grafting or nanomaterial incorporation aims to produce the hydrophilic part providing mechanical and thermal support with a low resistance to transport leading to the high water permeate flux and oil solute rejection 17 furthermore the small addition of the polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp is also extensively used in preparing membranes to be applied to membrane filtration which can adjust pore size and the wettability of the pvdf membrane 18 it is mainly combined with pvdf matrix polymer to prepare membranes for water purification after increasing membrane permeability producing hydrophilicity and preventing membrane fouling 19 polyamide pam membranes are hydrophilic in nature and have been widely utilized in filtration owing to their superior performance in terms of lowering energy consumption in comparison to other methods however pam is still prone to fouling by colloids microorganisms as well as mineral scale 20 more importantly utilizing pam and nanoparticles for pvdf membrane surface incorporation will provide good ability for controlling the fouling and enhancing the separation typical inorganic particles such as alumina silica zirconia zinc titania and iron will act as an adsorbent for different kinds of pollutants toxic and non toxic materials 21 23 the nanoparticles have good catalytic features as a result membrane fouling resistance can be improved and oxidative functioning can be improved resulting in improved water permeate quality 24 in this study the interesting route to modify the composite material was utilizing alumina nanoparticles attached with both powerful superhydrophylic agents which are 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes and folic acid fa respectively in particular silanization insertions were affluently used to generate optimal 3d hierarchical and rough architectures for high resolution observation 25 the simplicity of the aptes and fa attachment containing amine carboxylic and hydroxylic functional groups can control the quality of the highly superhydrophilic composite material by enhancing the surface energy the overall superhydrophilic properties of the materials based on the external stimuli responsiveness have been denoted from the obtained material 15 26 30 in short we have successfully prepared the pvdf membrane modified with superhydrophilic al aptes fa composite membrane and evaluated its efficiency for water treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials chemical used in this work were acquired from sigma aldrich including n hexane c6h14 m phenylenediamine

an additive was purchased from merck a real time milli q ultrapure unit produces deionized di water millipore usa 2 2 experimental work 2 2 1 synthesis of modified alumina nanoparticles al aptes fa high quality alumina nanoparticles were prepared to create the modified nanocomposite 31 32 typically 0 2 g al2o3 nanopowder was prepared and immersed into 40 ml methanol on a bottom flask for 6 h at room temperature during this period 0 2 m sodium hydroxide naoh was drop wisely poured to make a basic condition and initiate the hydroxyl formation to produce al oh 3 the reaction mixture was gradually stirred then left to form a white solution upon aging then the obtained al nps were incorporated with 2 ml aptes followed by 3 h of ultrasonic treatment and refluxing at 70 c afterward the mixture was allowed to dry at 80 c to obtain the white al aptes powder for further modification the obtained al aptes powder was then reacted with 2 g folic acid fa using 30 ml ethanol solvent under acidic condition h2so4 drop wise a small amount of dcc and nitrogen n2 gas inlet for 5 min to remove any water droplets after incorporation the reaction mixture was gradually stirred at 90 c for 12 h to let organic branch linked to the alumina nanoparticles as a host molecule finally the modified nanocomposite was dried overnight at 50 c to form al aptes fa composite as result to be deeply studied the overall reactions were illustrated in fig 1 2 2 2 pvdf membrane preparation the pvdf casting solution was prepared by dissolving around 2 0 g of pvdf and 0 2 g of pvp as additive in 20 ml dmf as solvent the isothermal immersion precipitation process was used to make the membranes 18 33 stirring for 12 h produced homogeneous solution comprising the pvdf polymer and 4 wt additives pvp in solvent using a casting knife a sufficient quantity of a dope solution was homogeneously dispersed onto a glass plate to induce pvdf precipitation this was directly immersed in the non solvent bath without evaporation to eliminate residual solvents the produced membrane was rinsed with deionized water and maintained in water for a day fig 2a the wet membranes were kept to dry in a vacuum oven at 35 c as the final step 10 mbar the same process was used to prepare the modified membrane with a pa membrane without nps coating for comparison the initial results showed better performance with the presence of nps 2 2 3 modified pvdf membrane preparation a segment of microporous polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf support layer from fig 2a with an area of 36 cm2 was prepared and soaked in nitric acid solution 1 m for 24 h to thoroughly activate the entire support surface and wet all of its pores after that it was allowed to dry the pvdf substrate was immersed for 2 min in an n2 purged media of 1 5 wt the phenylenediamine mpd and 0 2 wt al aptes fa composite at room temperature allowing just the upper portion of the pvdf substrate to take the solution then it was extracted from the media and twisted in various directions to equally disperse the solution on the surface and a rubbery roller was used to remove any excess then it was kept to dry for 30 min before being dipped in a 0 3 wt trimesoyl chloride tmc n hexane for 5 min to induce the polymerization process and form the active layer after that the membrane was taken from the tmc solution and agitated for about 5 min to evenly distribute the solution across the entire surface and eliminate any surplus tmc solution after that the membrane was heated at 65 c for 3 min to cure the polymer before being dried in the air for about 30 min lastly the membrane was cleaned with distilled water and stored in a glass plate till needed these steps were followed to make various membranes for filtration testing and characterization which was shown in fig 2b 2 3 characterization several techniques were used for the characterization of the prepared nanocomposite membrane for water purification tests field emission scanning electron microscope fesem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx was used to obtain information on the morphology and elemental composition of the membranes for sem analysis the specimen should be coated with conductive layer of gold moreover hydrophilicity oleophilicity and surface wettability of the developed membrane were evaluated by water oil contact angle wca oca measurement using attension theta optical tensiometer about 5 μl droplet of distilled water was pipetted and deposited on the material surface at room temperature the crystalline phase and average crystalline size of the modified materials were generated using x ray diffractometer model d8 advance bruker at germany with cu kα radiation at a scanning rate of 3 min 1 and a continuous scanning mode 40 kv 40 ma and λ 0 15418 nm afm atomic force microscope techniques were also conducted to observe the surface morphology roughness and membrane elemental adsorption in the sample test afm images were recorded from fiber lite mi 150 high intensity illuminator from dolan jenner industries fourier transform infrared ftir smart itr nicolet is10 was used to collect the ir spectra of the prepared materials with a resolution of 32 cm 1 and 64 scans and wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 4 permeability and separation capacity tests the parameters including permeability and the rejection of inorganic salts organic pollutants and heavy metals table 1 were evaluated by a custom made setup cross flow cell sterlitech membrane area 36 cm2 fig 3 the filtration test was performed at ambient temperature with a pressure of 10 bars the membrane was compressed with distilled water before the testing measurements were taken di for around 3 h until reaching a steady state using a chiller the pressure was maintained at 10 bars at 25 c during the filtering experiment the manufactured membranes had a 36 cm2 effective area and were treated at the ph of the feed solution with the analysis of the components in the permeated water the performance of the membranes was investigated using mgso4 cacl2 metal ions pentane decane isooctane toluene and hexadecane as listed in table 1 the concentration changes of the permeate flux was used to calculate the retention of the metal ions organic compounds and salts ion chromatography model metrohm 850 professional ic switzerland inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry model plasmaquant analytik jena and gas chromatography mass spectrometer model agilent 6890 were used to determine the concentrations of salts heavy metals and oil components the membranes permeability was computed by eq 1 1 j w v w a m t where jw refers to permeate flux in a unit as lm 2 h 1 or lmh vw refers to volume changes of the permeate water in l am refers to membrane active area in m2 t refers to time of gathering the permeated water in h the rejection was computed by eq 2 2 r c feed c permeate c feed 100 where cfeed and cpermeate refer to concentration of the components in the feed and permeated solution in ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 material coating surface the construction of the modified pvdf membrane by approaching with polyamide pa and al aptes fa composite was depicted in fig 4 the surface of the pristine pvdf membrane was coated with this material to get more hydrophilic properties in general surface wettability roughness and surface energy are the three main factors for superwettable surface modification 34 more importantly the developed membrane possesses great superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity behaviors since they have many hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface the most common active sites are displaying a high surface wettability toward water like oh coo nh2 nh3 oso3 oso3h and many other ionizable functional groups 35 in this functionalization folic acid fa and aptes can be attached with al nps due to the esterification and amidation process between hydroxyl amine groups and carboxyl groups under acid conditions furthermore the as prepared al aptes fa can also react with pa due to the hydrogen bond interaction which produces a dope solution pam al aptes fa to produce the thin layer on the top pvdf membrane when these typical functional groups were created on the membrane the surface energy would increase specifically the special wettability was mainly related to the hydroxyl amine and carboxylic groups of the obtained material surface the superhydrophilic behavior was mainly shown in the air whereas superoleophobicity was experimentally investigated in underwater conditions after pre wetted membrane treatment 3 2 membrane characterization results ftir analysis was performed to study the nanocomposite and membrane preparation with functional groups appearances as can be observed ftir spectra from the al aptes fa composite preparation were displayed in fig 5a alumina nanoparticle showed the broad absorption of the hydroxyl oh stretching vibration was ascribed at 3390 cm 1 as well as alo stretching vibration at 1115 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 36 for al aptes one peak was broadly appeared at 3420 cm 1 for nh2 oh stretching vibrations coming from aptes and al nps which contains amine and unreacted hydroxylic groups furthermore the absorption band at 2920 cm 1 was attributed to ch2 stretching vibration mode of the aptes chain 37 the other peaks are relatively weak absorption band at 1420 cm 1 for co cn stretching vibration at 1080 cm 1 for cc stretching vibration and 580 cm 1 for sic due to the silane reaction 32 additionally an extra peak was observed from al aptes fa at 1635 cm 1 for co cn stretching vibrations coming from folic acid which contains many carboxylic groups fig 5b depicted the modified pvdf membrane results which have six main peaks after incorporation with the composite material interestingly the absorption bands of ch2 stretching vibration at 2920 cm 1 were constantly strong due to the pvdf chain additionally one extra peak was detected for cf stretching vibration mode produced from the pvdf raw membrane the absorption bands of al aptes fa composites have been analyzed with similar peaks as the modified membrane confirming the chemical reaction of composite material onto the membrane surface as a result these spectra showed quite similar absorption bands to the al aptes fa composites indicating the successful composite incorporation into the membrane pvdf surface for producing superhydrophilic behavior to confirm the crystallinity of the modified al aptes fa composite x ray diffractometer xrd was conducted fig 6 the xrd patterns of the alumina nanoparticles appeared at the 2θ around 23 6 012 31 8 104 34 4 110 43 5 113 52 5 024 and 59 1 116 these results revealed that the alumina nanoparticles have a polycrystalline and rhombohedral structure and high specific surface area which follow the international center of diffraction data icdd for alumina 38 for the modified alumina nanoparticles pattern the overall crystalline phase of the material was observed without any broad peak investigation the xrd results confirmed that the alumina nanoparticles phase in the modified composite is of crystaline phase that is attributed to the successful alumina dispersion on the material 39 sem and edx images of the composite material and the modified membrane were displayed in fig 7 in fig 7a sem images showed that the crystalline alumina nanoparticles granule as a host material have homogeneous sizes ranging from 400 to 500 nm after being functionalized by aptes and fa the al aptes fa composite was observed with a greater heterogeneous altered shapes spherical as well as semi spherical size distribution ranging from 10 to 20 μm fig 7b c furthermore the pristine pvdf membrane modified pvdf membrane before and after the filtration test were also analyzed by sem analysis the morphology surface of pristine pvdf was observed as an asymmetric surface structure composed of a dense layer microporous support layers fig 7d 40 it was clear from edx spectra that the main elements f and c peaks appeared in a high percentage around 50 9 and 46 8 respectively fig 7g after coating with the pam al aptes fa composite the new layer was investigated on the pvdf membrane surface with the small composite granule and make the surface of the membrane denser with grainy structures fig 7e 41 42 from edx spectra the extra elements from the composite deposition were detected on the membrane surface indicating the additional presence of n 13 9 o 13 8 cl 2 5 si 1 8 al 0 8 na 0 8 ca 0 2 and k 0 2 as shown in fig 7h interestingly the f atom percentage was extremely decreased from 50 9 to 7 1 due to the atom replacement with the n and o atoms after the reaction 40 43 after the filtration test the modified membrane surface was then analyzed confirming the highly rough structure and salt particles appearances fig 7f from the edx result some additional heavy metal atoms from the salts ionization were investigated with small percentages such as pb cu cd ni s mg and cr fig 7i these results demonstrated the successful membrane synthesis which was identified from these percentages increment it is also important to note the successful preparation of the modified nanoalumina as a newly developed composite for pvdf membrane functionalization in water purification application pores are randomly distributed over the pvdf membrane s surface due to its high porosity using polyamide layer made the pores distribution more uniform and the porosity of pvdf membrane was evidently reduced as well the modified alumina nanoparticles were blended into the pa layer to further reduce pores due to the absence of obvious agglomeration the nanoparticles incorporated into the membrane exhibited excellent dispersion across the membrane surface in this study modified alumina nanoparticles were embedded on the top surface of the membrane hence adding nanoparticles to the membrane top surface can significantly improve the wettability and separation efficiency due to the presence of highly hydrophilic functional groups and the measured reduction in porosity for topography and surface roughness analysis of the membrane afm has been conducted to study the pristine pvdf modified pvdf before and after filtration performance up to nanometer scale for 2 d two dimensions and 3 d three dimensions 15 the 2 d and 3 d afm image results for these three different samples were shown and analyzed in fig 8 the membrane sample was touched by the mechanical probe to evaluate the surface roughness resulting in generating average roughness ra for deviation in height value root means square roughness rq for the standard deviation of surface height value and maximum profile valley depth rv summarized in table 2 15 28 for the pristine pvdf the slightly smooth surface roughness was observed fig 8a resulting from the uncoated membrane the ra rq and rv values for the original pvdf were significantly smaller than the prepared membranes before and after the separation test on the other hand the presence of numerous mountain like shapes appearing on the modified pvdf membrane surface led to giving the ra rq and rv values greater than the pristine pvdf because of the al aptes fa composite layer deposition fig 8b even after the membrane test for water purification the membrane surface roughness was almost stable as indicated by those three parameter values fig 8c the enhancement of the rough surface and average roughness values were displayed after interacting with the salty medium containing a huge amount of cations and anions from feed water these data ensured the layer formation of the composite deposition and also the atom blockage on the modified pvdf membrane which avoid penetrating the membrane filtration 3 3 membrane surface wettability the significant effect of pam al aptes fa composite deposition on the pvdf membrane was studied with water contact angle on the modified pvdf membrane the results were obtained after allowing about 5 μl of water droplet to settle on the pristine pvdf and modified membrane films as displayed in fig 9a the initial water contact angle for the original pvdf membrane was investigated at 95 indicating the hydrophobic feature of the pure pvdf after modification the water droplet was again poured on the surface showing the contact angle was about 35 which represented the wettability transformation to be more hydrophilic than the initial membrane interestingly the water droplet was absorbed rapidly into the modified membrane surface after a few seconds resulting in the decrease of the water contact angle until reaching 0 this initial superhydrophobic behavior was performed by the pristine pvdf composition such as the high density of c and f atoms which are hydrophobic 44 45 contrariwise the water contact angle was declined to 0 after coating with pam al aptes fa composite exhibiting that the membrane wettability was greatly enhanced as can be seen in fig 9b d accordingly it can be concluded from both wettability mechanisms that when the water contact angle θ 90 the δp must be higher than 0 displaying the hydrophobic surface thus the pvdf membrane can bear a certain pressure of the water droplet fig 9e 46 on the contrary when the water contact angle θ 90 the δp is 0 this condition indicated the superhydrophilic surface which means the modified pvdf membrane was not able to support water pressure fig 9f hence the water droplet will rapidly permeate the membrane 47 moreover the oil droplets were also poured onto a modified membrane indicating the superoleophobicity oca 140 which remains stable spherical shapes on the surface fig 9g at the same time a 5 μl droplet of oil was tested for measuring interfacial tension between droplet and membrane surface area underwater treatment surprisingly the oil droplets were rejected to interact with the membrane surface after pressing treatment and returned to the pipette mouth while the size and shape of the oil droplet remained unchanged fig 9h from the mechanism the oil contact angle θ 90 was produced because the δp was higher than 0 resulting in the underwater superoleophobic surface thus the pvdf membrane can bear a certain pressure of the oil droplet for a longer time fig 9i these results illustrated that the water and oil contact angle on the membrane surface after interacting with the modified composite can produce superhydrophilicity and superoleophobicity on the membrane surface to enhance the negative charge leading to easily absorbing the water attracting with salts cations and anions and repelling the oil content it revealed that the modified pvdf membrane was effective in mitigating the salts and oil permeation leading to easily absorbing the freshwater 3 4 filtration test from the experimental setup the filtration tests were conducted by using pristine pvdf membrane and modified pvdf membrane for analyzing the water content and the water permeates flux of the two comparisons in fig 10a the pressure driven test was carried out for pvdf membrane giving poor results for the water filtration the big pore size and the unprotected layer of the pvdf allowed some oil droplets pentane isooctane decane and toluene and cation heavy metal and anion salts no3 so4 2 cl mg2 cd2 ca2 cu2 pb2 and k leading to highly contaminant water 48 in contrast after coating with the superhydrophilic material on the membrane pvdf surface this semipermeable membrane will only allow fresh and highly pure water to penetrate and reject all the oil and salts composition which come from the feed solution fig 10b 49 3 5 water flux evaluation of the modified pvdf membrane the modified pvdf membrane s permeability or flux efficiency was shown in fig 11 the permeability achieved was good after that the membrane flux performance dramatically reduced to 66 m 2 h 1 approximately 30 min before stabilizing around 4 h before the filtration operation ends the performance of the synthesized membrane flux was shown to be steady throughout time and the obtained stable flux value was about 53 l m 2 h 1 the high membrane stability as a major factor for the steady flux was confirmed by sem and afm data previously the porosity elemental content and the membrane roughness were somehow stable after treatment this phenomenon supports and explains the outstanding results of the produced alumina based membranes furthermore as indicated by water contact angle analysis the increased permeability could be linked with the low thickness of polyamide layer and better hydrophilicity acquired after inserting functionalized alumina this is due to the incorporated nanomaterials enriched the membrane s surface with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and altered its surface charges to become more negative the membrane s hydrophilicity and charges are two of the few factors that influence flux performance 50 54 3 6 separation efficiency the efficiency of the modified pvdf membrane in the rejection of metal ions organic pollutants and salts from synthetic water was evaluated the results of the membrane efficiency against desalination heavy metal rejection and organic pollutants separation through the filtration experiment were shown in fig 12 during 3 h and 30 min the membrane had eliminated 93 44 96 89 97 78 and 97 89 of mg ca so4 and cl respectively and the rejection trend had changed these observations are in agreement with donnan phenomenon stated as divalent ions are easily eliminated than the monovalent ions 36 55 57 the separation efficiency against the inorganic salts displayed a marginal drop with time while the breakthrough point was investigated to be largely dependent on the atomic ionic size of the tested species it was in this order cl mg 2 ca 2 so4 2 the rejection of salts ions started to decrease after 3 h and half hour 4 h and 5 h and 5 h for cl 0 99 å mg 1 60 å ca 1 97 å and then so4 2 58 å respectively furthermore the synthesized membrane eliminated completely the metal ions including ni pb cr cd for 5 h after that the rejection behavior showed a slight decline through the remaining time of the experiment furthermore the prepared membrane showed 100 rejection against the organic pollutants within 6 h and 30 min after the efficiency was slightly reduced versus time the obtained performance of the membrane behaves in this trend hexadecane pentane decane toluene isooctane a comparison of the removal behavior toward the target pollutants including inorganic salts metal ions and organic pollutants was performed at 6 h and 8 h which was represented in fig 13a b the separation of the organic species has a better efficiency compared to salts and heavy metals furthermore after 6 h of filtration testing the membrane retained 90 of all tested pollutants then after one hour filtration the final breakthrough of the contaminants could be attributed to the constant build up of ionic pressure from the removed solutes and pollutants aggregating on the surface of the membrane in addition constantly applying pressure to a membrane can change its porosity properties 58 these remarkable results illustrate the membrane s efficiency in eliminating a wide range of contaminants seen in real water 3 7 water filtration mechanism the membrane filtration mechanism of the feed water to generate freshwater repel oil content and block the salt ions was shown in fig 14 generally the main terminal functional group that has been attached to the pvdf membrane due to the pam al aptes fa deposition are amine nh2 carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh as can be seen on the scheme these typical functional groups tend to make the membrane surface more hydrophilic in air and oleophobic underwater than pristine pvdf which can produce the negative charge due to the lone pair existence in each functional group 27 from fig 14a the pure water can easily interact with the functional groups producing hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions whereas the oil droplets were stuck on the surface due to the different wettability behavior between oil and water hydrophilic functional groups fig 14b 59 additionally the cations heavy metals and anions from the salts ionization can also be blocked on the modified membrane surface due to the ionic bonding 60 the obtained negative charge and lone pairs can easily react with the cations salts whereas the anion salts can also connect to the h from the hydration reaction underwater fig 14c d it should be noted that the bonding should be rapidly saturated and the electrostatic effect contributes more to the ion rejection for longer time filtration the negative charges are possibly not favorable for cation rejection thus the extensive performance of the oil and salts rejection by the membrane s surface is the most critical parameter in membrane filtration to get fresh water 4 conclusion this report displayed the adhesive deposition of the hydrophilic material pam al aptes fa onto the pvdf membranes which were prepared by interfacial polymerization with coating method the introduction of alumina nanoparticles on the composite through coordination and redox reactions can help the organic and inorganic branches to be incorporated into the polymer the single step coating strategy transformed pvdf membrane from high hydrophobicity to great hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity with micro nanostructural surface via layering the pristine membranes with pam al aptes fa solution ftir and xrd characterization confirmed the composite crystallinity and the alumina nanoparticles on the membrane surface sem edx and afm revealed the surface morphology of the al aptes fa composite and the increase of roughness after depositing the nanoparticles in addition the water contact angle showed a good improvement in wettability to be superhydrophilic after introducing pam al aptes fa in the membrane filtration performance displayed at high pressure 10 bar giving significant enhancement after embedding pam al aptes fa composites for the salt rejection heavy metal and hydrocarbons rejection as well as water permeability results the optimum permeate flux was 53 lmh l m 2 h 1 over 90 salt rejection with 100 heavy metals and organic pollutants rejection these remarkable results were generated due to the huge amount of negative charge on the membrane surface after modification all in all this study can pave a facile and prospective way to fabricate high performance pvdf supported pa membranes in the water purification field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12715,for water treatment membrane based separation methods are very essential owing to long term efficiency high mechanical stability and durability the filtration process with polymer inorganic and organic composite is an outstanding strategy that enhances the properties of both inorganic materials such as thermal and mechanical stability and organic material including flexibility and processability of the membranes therefore the surface wettability of the membranes is vital for pollutants separation here the high hydrophobic behavior of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes is altered to superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity via single step coating this pvdf membrane has high molecular separation due to the ultrathin thickness and good controllable interlayer in this study the pvdf membrane was by interfacial polymerization coated with a polyamide pam layer modified alumina nanoparticles al nps aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes and folic acid fa through a chemical grafting reaction the influence of the pam and al aptes fa content on the morphology structure antifouling and superhydrophilicity of the pvdf g pam al aptes fa membrane has been investigated which has enhanced the oil and salt rejection as well as filtration performance fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy showed the specific functional groups from the obtained results indicating the successful preparation scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx and afm atomic force microscope techniques were conducted to observe the membrane surface morphology roughness and elemental adsorption after the filtration process furthermore this modified pvdf membrane exhibited an excellent superoleophobicity with underwater oil contact angle oca 145 and superhydrophilic visualization with water contact angle wca 0 after being functionalized additionally the parameters of membrane performance such as permeate flux heavy metal ions oil and salts rejection were assessed the modified material on the pvdf membrane enhanced the membrane efficiency under high operating pressure of 10 bar with 53 lmh l m 2 h 1 while it is 0 for pvdf membrane permeate flux over 90 salt rejection and almost 100 hydrocarbons and heavy metal ions rejection owing to membrane surface changes hydrophilicity and roughness this research will provide new insights on porous surface transformation to improve the separation and antifouling properties of pvdf membranes used in water purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords filtration process pvdf membrane nanomaterial superhydrophilic purification antifouling hydrocarbons metal ions and salts data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water has been always an essential substance in daily life for the world s social growth such as in industrial and agricultural applications its supply should be sustainable and cost effective to maintain the usable water in the world which is only 3 in comparison to the whole water resources worldwide 1 thus the treatment and utilization of the water were strongly required to resolve such global crisis nowadays membrane technologies can be effectively used for the substances transport between two and more components with using a semipermeable layer this kind of technology is less energy needed without using heat in comparison to the conventional one such as distillation one of the examples is the filtration method used pressure driven membrane technology approach 2 the contaminants can be removed from water with effective separation using various membranes synthesized from different materials and nanomaterials 3 8 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is extensively utilized for all water filtration applications because of its outstanding performance good processability and good mechanical features nevertheless the hydrophobic behavior of pvdf and the big pore size lead to the serious fouling problem for the membrane filtration containing inorganic organic and biological substances 9 pristine pvdf membrane also exhibited the low surface energy material with poor membrane wettability aggravating the sorption of organic and inorganic foulants on its surface 10 therefore to enhance the pvdf membrane surface energy generating hydrophilic behavior as well as tiny pore membrane size is becoming a crucial step for membrane ultrafiltration in the application of water treatment 11 in recent years some emerging technologies for water separation and purification methods were attracted much attention such as nanocomposite membranes coating blending inorganic nanoparticles with membrane materials and membrane surface modification by different means such as uv photo irradiation plasma and high energy irradiation 12 these innovative methods can be effective for mitigating membrane fouling enhancing water permeation and oil repellence and increasing ion rejection from salts as contaminant the compatibility between polymer matrix and inorganic nano filler is a big issue hindering the performance and stability of mixed matrix membranes 13 14 so it is required to have good synthesis methods in order to have good crosslink between the nanoparticles and the membrane components 15 16 surface modification thin film interfacial polymerization of the pristine pvdf membrane such as coating thin film interfacial polymerization grafting or nanomaterial incorporation aims to produce the hydrophilic part providing mechanical and thermal support with a low resistance to transport leading to the high water permeate flux and oil solute rejection 17 furthermore the small addition of the polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp is also extensively used in preparing membranes to be applied to membrane filtration which can adjust pore size and the wettability of the pvdf membrane 18 it is mainly combined with pvdf matrix polymer to prepare membranes for water purification after increasing membrane permeability producing hydrophilicity and preventing membrane fouling 19 polyamide pam membranes are hydrophilic in nature and have been widely utilized in filtration owing to their superior performance in terms of lowering energy consumption in comparison to other methods however pam is still prone to fouling by colloids microorganisms as well as mineral scale 20 more importantly utilizing pam and nanoparticles for pvdf membrane surface incorporation will provide good ability for controlling the fouling and enhancing the separation typical inorganic particles such as alumina silica zirconia zinc titania and iron will act as an adsorbent for different kinds of pollutants toxic and non toxic materials 21 23 the nanoparticles have good catalytic features as a result membrane fouling resistance can be improved and oxidative functioning can be improved resulting in improved water permeate quality 24 in this study the interesting route to modify the composite material was utilizing alumina nanoparticles attached with both powerful superhydrophylic agents which are 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes and folic acid fa respectively in particular silanization insertions were affluently used to generate optimal 3d hierarchical and rough architectures for high resolution observation 25 the simplicity of the aptes and fa attachment containing amine carboxylic and hydroxylic functional groups can control the quality of the highly superhydrophilic composite material by enhancing the surface energy the overall superhydrophilic properties of the materials based on the external stimuli responsiveness have been denoted from the obtained material 15 26 30 in short we have successfully prepared the pvdf membrane modified with superhydrophilic al aptes fa composite membrane and evaluated its efficiency for water treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials chemical used in this work were acquired from sigma aldrich including n hexane c6h14 m phenylenediamine

an additive was purchased from merck a real time milli q ultrapure unit produces deionized di water millipore usa 2 2 experimental work 2 2 1 synthesis of modified alumina nanoparticles al aptes fa high quality alumina nanoparticles were prepared to create the modified nanocomposite 31 32 typically 0 2 g al2o3 nanopowder was prepared and immersed into 40 ml methanol on a bottom flask for 6 h at room temperature during this period 0 2 m sodium hydroxide naoh was drop wisely poured to make a basic condition and initiate the hydroxyl formation to produce al oh 3 the reaction mixture was gradually stirred then left to form a white solution upon aging then the obtained al nps were incorporated with 2 ml aptes followed by 3 h of ultrasonic treatment and refluxing at 70 c afterward the mixture was allowed to dry at 80 c to obtain the white al aptes powder for further modification the obtained al aptes powder was then reacted with 2 g folic acid fa using 30 ml ethanol solvent under acidic condition h2so4 drop wise a small amount of dcc and nitrogen n2 gas inlet for 5 min to remove any water droplets after incorporation the reaction mixture was gradually stirred at 90 c for 12 h to let organic branch linked to the alumina nanoparticles as a host molecule finally the modified nanocomposite was dried overnight at 50 c to form al aptes fa composite as result to be deeply studied the overall reactions were illustrated in fig 1 2 2 2 pvdf membrane preparation the pvdf casting solution was prepared by dissolving around 2 0 g of pvdf and 0 2 g of pvp as additive in 20 ml dmf as solvent the isothermal immersion precipitation process was used to make the membranes 18 33 stirring for 12 h produced homogeneous solution comprising the pvdf polymer and 4 wt additives pvp in solvent using a casting knife a sufficient quantity of a dope solution was homogeneously dispersed onto a glass plate to induce pvdf precipitation this was directly immersed in the non solvent bath without evaporation to eliminate residual solvents the produced membrane was rinsed with deionized water and maintained in water for a day fig 2a the wet membranes were kept to dry in a vacuum oven at 35 c as the final step 10 mbar the same process was used to prepare the modified membrane with a pa membrane without nps coating for comparison the initial results showed better performance with the presence of nps 2 2 3 modified pvdf membrane preparation a segment of microporous polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf support layer from fig 2a with an area of 36 cm2 was prepared and soaked in nitric acid solution 1 m for 24 h to thoroughly activate the entire support surface and wet all of its pores after that it was allowed to dry the pvdf substrate was immersed for 2 min in an n2 purged media of 1 5 wt the phenylenediamine mpd and 0 2 wt al aptes fa composite at room temperature allowing just the upper portion of the pvdf substrate to take the solution then it was extracted from the media and twisted in various directions to equally disperse the solution on the surface and a rubbery roller was used to remove any excess then it was kept to dry for 30 min before being dipped in a 0 3 wt trimesoyl chloride tmc n hexane for 5 min to induce the polymerization process and form the active layer after that the membrane was taken from the tmc solution and agitated for about 5 min to evenly distribute the solution across the entire surface and eliminate any surplus tmc solution after that the membrane was heated at 65 c for 3 min to cure the polymer before being dried in the air for about 30 min lastly the membrane was cleaned with distilled water and stored in a glass plate till needed these steps were followed to make various membranes for filtration testing and characterization which was shown in fig 2b 2 3 characterization several techniques were used for the characterization of the prepared nanocomposite membrane for water purification tests field emission scanning electron microscope fesem coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx was used to obtain information on the morphology and elemental composition of the membranes for sem analysis the specimen should be coated with conductive layer of gold moreover hydrophilicity oleophilicity and surface wettability of the developed membrane were evaluated by water oil contact angle wca oca measurement using attension theta optical tensiometer about 5 μl droplet of distilled water was pipetted and deposited on the material surface at room temperature the crystalline phase and average crystalline size of the modified materials were generated using x ray diffractometer model d8 advance bruker at germany with cu kα radiation at a scanning rate of 3 min 1 and a continuous scanning mode 40 kv 40 ma and λ 0 15418 nm afm atomic force microscope techniques were also conducted to observe the surface morphology roughness and membrane elemental adsorption in the sample test afm images were recorded from fiber lite mi 150 high intensity illuminator from dolan jenner industries fourier transform infrared ftir smart itr nicolet is10 was used to collect the ir spectra of the prepared materials with a resolution of 32 cm 1 and 64 scans and wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 2 4 permeability and separation capacity tests the parameters including permeability and the rejection of inorganic salts organic pollutants and heavy metals table 1 were evaluated by a custom made setup cross flow cell sterlitech membrane area 36 cm2 fig 3 the filtration test was performed at ambient temperature with a pressure of 10 bars the membrane was compressed with distilled water before the testing measurements were taken di for around 3 h until reaching a steady state using a chiller the pressure was maintained at 10 bars at 25 c during the filtering experiment the manufactured membranes had a 36 cm2 effective area and were treated at the ph of the feed solution with the analysis of the components in the permeated water the performance of the membranes was investigated using mgso4 cacl2 metal ions pentane decane isooctane toluene and hexadecane as listed in table 1 the concentration changes of the permeate flux was used to calculate the retention of the metal ions organic compounds and salts ion chromatography model metrohm 850 professional ic switzerland inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry model plasmaquant analytik jena and gas chromatography mass spectrometer model agilent 6890 were used to determine the concentrations of salts heavy metals and oil components the membranes permeability was computed by eq 1 1 j w v w a m t where jw refers to permeate flux in a unit as lm 2 h 1 or lmh vw refers to volume changes of the permeate water in l am refers to membrane active area in m2 t refers to time of gathering the permeated water in h the rejection was computed by eq 2 2 r c feed c permeate c feed 100 where cfeed and cpermeate refer to concentration of the components in the feed and permeated solution in ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 material coating surface the construction of the modified pvdf membrane by approaching with polyamide pa and al aptes fa composite was depicted in fig 4 the surface of the pristine pvdf membrane was coated with this material to get more hydrophilic properties in general surface wettability roughness and surface energy are the three main factors for superwettable surface modification 34 more importantly the developed membrane possesses great superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity behaviors since they have many hydrophilic functional groups on the membrane surface the most common active sites are displaying a high surface wettability toward water like oh coo nh2 nh3 oso3 oso3h and many other ionizable functional groups 35 in this functionalization folic acid fa and aptes can be attached with al nps due to the esterification and amidation process between hydroxyl amine groups and carboxyl groups under acid conditions furthermore the as prepared al aptes fa can also react with pa due to the hydrogen bond interaction which produces a dope solution pam al aptes fa to produce the thin layer on the top pvdf membrane when these typical functional groups were created on the membrane the surface energy would increase specifically the special wettability was mainly related to the hydroxyl amine and carboxylic groups of the obtained material surface the superhydrophilic behavior was mainly shown in the air whereas superoleophobicity was experimentally investigated in underwater conditions after pre wetted membrane treatment 3 2 membrane characterization results ftir analysis was performed to study the nanocomposite and membrane preparation with functional groups appearances as can be observed ftir spectra from the al aptes fa composite preparation were displayed in fig 5a alumina nanoparticle showed the broad absorption of the hydroxyl oh stretching vibration was ascribed at 3390 cm 1 as well as alo stretching vibration at 1115 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 36 for al aptes one peak was broadly appeared at 3420 cm 1 for nh2 oh stretching vibrations coming from aptes and al nps which contains amine and unreacted hydroxylic groups furthermore the absorption band at 2920 cm 1 was attributed to ch2 stretching vibration mode of the aptes chain 37 the other peaks are relatively weak absorption band at 1420 cm 1 for co cn stretching vibration at 1080 cm 1 for cc stretching vibration and 580 cm 1 for sic due to the silane reaction 32 additionally an extra peak was observed from al aptes fa at 1635 cm 1 for co cn stretching vibrations coming from folic acid which contains many carboxylic groups fig 5b depicted the modified pvdf membrane results which have six main peaks after incorporation with the composite material interestingly the absorption bands of ch2 stretching vibration at 2920 cm 1 were constantly strong due to the pvdf chain additionally one extra peak was detected for cf stretching vibration mode produced from the pvdf raw membrane the absorption bands of al aptes fa composites have been analyzed with similar peaks as the modified membrane confirming the chemical reaction of composite material onto the membrane surface as a result these spectra showed quite similar absorption bands to the al aptes fa composites indicating the successful composite incorporation into the membrane pvdf surface for producing superhydrophilic behavior to confirm the crystallinity of the modified al aptes fa composite x ray diffractometer xrd was conducted fig 6 the xrd patterns of the alumina nanoparticles appeared at the 2θ around 23 6 012 31 8 104 34 4 110 43 5 113 52 5 024 and 59 1 116 these results revealed that the alumina nanoparticles have a polycrystalline and rhombohedral structure and high specific surface area which follow the international center of diffraction data icdd for alumina 38 for the modified alumina nanoparticles pattern the overall crystalline phase of the material was observed without any broad peak investigation the xrd results confirmed that the alumina nanoparticles phase in the modified composite is of crystaline phase that is attributed to the successful alumina dispersion on the material 39 sem and edx images of the composite material and the modified membrane were displayed in fig 7 in fig 7a sem images showed that the crystalline alumina nanoparticles granule as a host material have homogeneous sizes ranging from 400 to 500 nm after being functionalized by aptes and fa the al aptes fa composite was observed with a greater heterogeneous altered shapes spherical as well as semi spherical size distribution ranging from 10 to 20 μm fig 7b c furthermore the pristine pvdf membrane modified pvdf membrane before and after the filtration test were also analyzed by sem analysis the morphology surface of pristine pvdf was observed as an asymmetric surface structure composed of a dense layer microporous support layers fig 7d 40 it was clear from edx spectra that the main elements f and c peaks appeared in a high percentage around 50 9 and 46 8 respectively fig 7g after coating with the pam al aptes fa composite the new layer was investigated on the pvdf membrane surface with the small composite granule and make the surface of the membrane denser with grainy structures fig 7e 41 42 from edx spectra the extra elements from the composite deposition were detected on the membrane surface indicating the additional presence of n 13 9 o 13 8 cl 2 5 si 1 8 al 0 8 na 0 8 ca 0 2 and k 0 2 as shown in fig 7h interestingly the f atom percentage was extremely decreased from 50 9 to 7 1 due to the atom replacement with the n and o atoms after the reaction 40 43 after the filtration test the modified membrane surface was then analyzed confirming the highly rough structure and salt particles appearances fig 7f from the edx result some additional heavy metal atoms from the salts ionization were investigated with small percentages such as pb cu cd ni s mg and cr fig 7i these results demonstrated the successful membrane synthesis which was identified from these percentages increment it is also important to note the successful preparation of the modified nanoalumina as a newly developed composite for pvdf membrane functionalization in water purification application pores are randomly distributed over the pvdf membrane s surface due to its high porosity using polyamide layer made the pores distribution more uniform and the porosity of pvdf membrane was evidently reduced as well the modified alumina nanoparticles were blended into the pa layer to further reduce pores due to the absence of obvious agglomeration the nanoparticles incorporated into the membrane exhibited excellent dispersion across the membrane surface in this study modified alumina nanoparticles were embedded on the top surface of the membrane hence adding nanoparticles to the membrane top surface can significantly improve the wettability and separation efficiency due to the presence of highly hydrophilic functional groups and the measured reduction in porosity for topography and surface roughness analysis of the membrane afm has been conducted to study the pristine pvdf modified pvdf before and after filtration performance up to nanometer scale for 2 d two dimensions and 3 d three dimensions 15 the 2 d and 3 d afm image results for these three different samples were shown and analyzed in fig 8 the membrane sample was touched by the mechanical probe to evaluate the surface roughness resulting in generating average roughness ra for deviation in height value root means square roughness rq for the standard deviation of surface height value and maximum profile valley depth rv summarized in table 2 15 28 for the pristine pvdf the slightly smooth surface roughness was observed fig 8a resulting from the uncoated membrane the ra rq and rv values for the original pvdf were significantly smaller than the prepared membranes before and after the separation test on the other hand the presence of numerous mountain like shapes appearing on the modified pvdf membrane surface led to giving the ra rq and rv values greater than the pristine pvdf because of the al aptes fa composite layer deposition fig 8b even after the membrane test for water purification the membrane surface roughness was almost stable as indicated by those three parameter values fig 8c the enhancement of the rough surface and average roughness values were displayed after interacting with the salty medium containing a huge amount of cations and anions from feed water these data ensured the layer formation of the composite deposition and also the atom blockage on the modified pvdf membrane which avoid penetrating the membrane filtration 3 3 membrane surface wettability the significant effect of pam al aptes fa composite deposition on the pvdf membrane was studied with water contact angle on the modified pvdf membrane the results were obtained after allowing about 5 μl of water droplet to settle on the pristine pvdf and modified membrane films as displayed in fig 9a the initial water contact angle for the original pvdf membrane was investigated at 95 indicating the hydrophobic feature of the pure pvdf after modification the water droplet was again poured on the surface showing the contact angle was about 35 which represented the wettability transformation to be more hydrophilic than the initial membrane interestingly the water droplet was absorbed rapidly into the modified membrane surface after a few seconds resulting in the decrease of the water contact angle until reaching 0 this initial superhydrophobic behavior was performed by the pristine pvdf composition such as the high density of c and f atoms which are hydrophobic 44 45 contrariwise the water contact angle was declined to 0 after coating with pam al aptes fa composite exhibiting that the membrane wettability was greatly enhanced as can be seen in fig 9b d accordingly it can be concluded from both wettability mechanisms that when the water contact angle θ 90 the δp must be higher than 0 displaying the hydrophobic surface thus the pvdf membrane can bear a certain pressure of the water droplet fig 9e 46 on the contrary when the water contact angle θ 90 the δp is 0 this condition indicated the superhydrophilic surface which means the modified pvdf membrane was not able to support water pressure fig 9f hence the water droplet will rapidly permeate the membrane 47 moreover the oil droplets were also poured onto a modified membrane indicating the superoleophobicity oca 140 which remains stable spherical shapes on the surface fig 9g at the same time a 5 μl droplet of oil was tested for measuring interfacial tension between droplet and membrane surface area underwater treatment surprisingly the oil droplets were rejected to interact with the membrane surface after pressing treatment and returned to the pipette mouth while the size and shape of the oil droplet remained unchanged fig 9h from the mechanism the oil contact angle θ 90 was produced because the δp was higher than 0 resulting in the underwater superoleophobic surface thus the pvdf membrane can bear a certain pressure of the oil droplet for a longer time fig 9i these results illustrated that the water and oil contact angle on the membrane surface after interacting with the modified composite can produce superhydrophilicity and superoleophobicity on the membrane surface to enhance the negative charge leading to easily absorbing the water attracting with salts cations and anions and repelling the oil content it revealed that the modified pvdf membrane was effective in mitigating the salts and oil permeation leading to easily absorbing the freshwater 3 4 filtration test from the experimental setup the filtration tests were conducted by using pristine pvdf membrane and modified pvdf membrane for analyzing the water content and the water permeates flux of the two comparisons in fig 10a the pressure driven test was carried out for pvdf membrane giving poor results for the water filtration the big pore size and the unprotected layer of the pvdf allowed some oil droplets pentane isooctane decane and toluene and cation heavy metal and anion salts no3 so4 2 cl mg2 cd2 ca2 cu2 pb2 and k leading to highly contaminant water 48 in contrast after coating with the superhydrophilic material on the membrane pvdf surface this semipermeable membrane will only allow fresh and highly pure water to penetrate and reject all the oil and salts composition which come from the feed solution fig 10b 49 3 5 water flux evaluation of the modified pvdf membrane the modified pvdf membrane s permeability or flux efficiency was shown in fig 11 the permeability achieved was good after that the membrane flux performance dramatically reduced to 66 m 2 h 1 approximately 30 min before stabilizing around 4 h before the filtration operation ends the performance of the synthesized membrane flux was shown to be steady throughout time and the obtained stable flux value was about 53 l m 2 h 1 the high membrane stability as a major factor for the steady flux was confirmed by sem and afm data previously the porosity elemental content and the membrane roughness were somehow stable after treatment this phenomenon supports and explains the outstanding results of the produced alumina based membranes furthermore as indicated by water contact angle analysis the increased permeability could be linked with the low thickness of polyamide layer and better hydrophilicity acquired after inserting functionalized alumina this is due to the incorporated nanomaterials enriched the membrane s surface with numerous hydrophilic functional groups and altered its surface charges to become more negative the membrane s hydrophilicity and charges are two of the few factors that influence flux performance 50 54 3 6 separation efficiency the efficiency of the modified pvdf membrane in the rejection of metal ions organic pollutants and salts from synthetic water was evaluated the results of the membrane efficiency against desalination heavy metal rejection and organic pollutants separation through the filtration experiment were shown in fig 12 during 3 h and 30 min the membrane had eliminated 93 44 96 89 97 78 and 97 89 of mg ca so4 and cl respectively and the rejection trend had changed these observations are in agreement with donnan phenomenon stated as divalent ions are easily eliminated than the monovalent ions 36 55 57 the separation efficiency against the inorganic salts displayed a marginal drop with time while the breakthrough point was investigated to be largely dependent on the atomic ionic size of the tested species it was in this order cl mg 2 ca 2 so4 2 the rejection of salts ions started to decrease after 3 h and half hour 4 h and 5 h and 5 h for cl 0 99 å mg 1 60 å ca 1 97 å and then so4 2 58 å respectively furthermore the synthesized membrane eliminated completely the metal ions including ni pb cr cd for 5 h after that the rejection behavior showed a slight decline through the remaining time of the experiment furthermore the prepared membrane showed 100 rejection against the organic pollutants within 6 h and 30 min after the efficiency was slightly reduced versus time the obtained performance of the membrane behaves in this trend hexadecane pentane decane toluene isooctane a comparison of the removal behavior toward the target pollutants including inorganic salts metal ions and organic pollutants was performed at 6 h and 8 h which was represented in fig 13a b the separation of the organic species has a better efficiency compared to salts and heavy metals furthermore after 6 h of filtration testing the membrane retained 90 of all tested pollutants then after one hour filtration the final breakthrough of the contaminants could be attributed to the constant build up of ionic pressure from the removed solutes and pollutants aggregating on the surface of the membrane in addition constantly applying pressure to a membrane can change its porosity properties 58 these remarkable results illustrate the membrane s efficiency in eliminating a wide range of contaminants seen in real water 3 7 water filtration mechanism the membrane filtration mechanism of the feed water to generate freshwater repel oil content and block the salt ions was shown in fig 14 generally the main terminal functional group that has been attached to the pvdf membrane due to the pam al aptes fa deposition are amine nh2 carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl oh as can be seen on the scheme these typical functional groups tend to make the membrane surface more hydrophilic in air and oleophobic underwater than pristine pvdf which can produce the negative charge due to the lone pair existence in each functional group 27 from fig 14a the pure water can easily interact with the functional groups producing hydrogen bonding intermolecular interactions whereas the oil droplets were stuck on the surface due to the different wettability behavior between oil and water hydrophilic functional groups fig 14b 59 additionally the cations heavy metals and anions from the salts ionization can also be blocked on the modified membrane surface due to the ionic bonding 60 the obtained negative charge and lone pairs can easily react with the cations salts whereas the anion salts can also connect to the h from the hydration reaction underwater fig 14c d it should be noted that the bonding should be rapidly saturated and the electrostatic effect contributes more to the ion rejection for longer time filtration the negative charges are possibly not favorable for cation rejection thus the extensive performance of the oil and salts rejection by the membrane s surface is the most critical parameter in membrane filtration to get fresh water 4 conclusion this report displayed the adhesive deposition of the hydrophilic material pam al aptes fa onto the pvdf membranes which were prepared by interfacial polymerization with coating method the introduction of alumina nanoparticles on the composite through coordination and redox reactions can help the organic and inorganic branches to be incorporated into the polymer the single step coating strategy transformed pvdf membrane from high hydrophobicity to great hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity with micro nanostructural surface via layering the pristine membranes with pam al aptes fa solution ftir and xrd characterization confirmed the composite crystallinity and the alumina nanoparticles on the membrane surface sem edx and afm revealed the surface morphology of the al aptes fa composite and the increase of roughness after depositing the nanoparticles in addition the water contact angle showed a good improvement in wettability to be superhydrophilic after introducing pam al aptes fa in the membrane filtration performance displayed at high pressure 10 bar giving significant enhancement after embedding pam al aptes fa composites for the salt rejection heavy metal and hydrocarbons rejection as well as water permeability results the optimum permeate flux was 53 lmh l m 2 h 1 over 90 salt rejection with 100 heavy metals and organic pollutants rejection these remarkable results were generated due to the huge amount of negative charge on the membrane surface after modification all in all this study can pave a facile and prospective way to fabricate high performance pvdf supported pa membranes in the water purification field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12716,aiming at the practical problem of rural wastewater and excess sludge treatment difficulties micro pressure swirl reactor mpsr was employed to carry out the experiment on the treatment of sewage under five different biomass concentration mlss concentration conditions 4 14 6 05 7 98 11 45 14 46 g l the results showed that the nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction performance of the system showed an increase and then a decrease with increasing mlss concentration and 7 98 11 45 g l was the optimal mlss concentration range in addition parameters related to in situ sludge reduction were further examined and the extracellular polymeric substance content and sludge dehydrogenase activity were negatively and positively correlated with sludge reduction respectively according to the microbial analysis at suitable mlss concentration beneficial microorganisms tetrasphaera aeromonas candidatus competibacter were enriched in the mpsr to facilitate the nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction of the system in addition the potential gene nirk norb nosz functions of the microorganisms were positively regulated the increase in the expression abundance ratio of dissimilatory and anabolic nitrate reduction genes played a positive role in denitrification and sludge reduction of the system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micro pressure swirl reactor mixed liquid suspended solids sludge reduction wastewater treatment microbial community potential gene functions data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rural revitalization strategy is a key development strategy in china in recent years with the development of the rural economy rural living standards have gradually improved and the amount of rural sewage discharge has become increasingly large 1 however most rural areas have inadequate drainage channels and sewage treatment facilities 2 according to the yearbook data on rural sewage treatment in 2014 2019 although the rate of rural sewage treatment in china is on the rise it is still below 35 3 the uncontrolled and direct discharge of rural sewage has become the main source of non point source pollution 4 agricultural wastewater and domestic sewage are the principal sources of non point source pollution and the nitrogen and phosphorus in these effluents are not only responsible for the eutrophication of water bodies but a threat to the health of local residents 5 therefore development of effective rural wastewater treatment technologies is a critical issue that needs to be addressed rural sewage is characterized by wide distribution large pollution range small amount of sewage intermittent discharge 6 therefore the technology with low investment small equipment size simple management and stable operation should be considered first when choosing the rural domestic sewage treatment process and treatment facilities activated sludge process as a high efficiency and low cost wastewater treatment process has been widely used in wastewater treatment plants in addition the integrated treatment technology which has the advantages of easy transportation simple on site installation and small footprint is the hot spot of rural domestic wastewater treatment technology research at this stage integrated treatment technology is a kind of wastewater treatment process obtained by optimizing the design and combination of each functional module of traditional wastewater treatment process at present many activated sludge processes such as aao mbr sbr etc have been applied to rural wastewater treatment by combining integrated treatment technology however among these activated sludge processes only a few effluents from mbr and aao processes comply with the discharge standards 7 in the aao process the wastewater is purified by going through three stages phosphorus release in the anaerobic zone denitrification in the anoxic zone as well as phosphorus removal and nitrification in the aerobic zone however the aao process has high operating costs complex operation and large floor space so it is not suitable for rural areas where expertise and intelligent controls are lacking 8 mbr process is a kind of wastewater treatment technology with organic combination of membrane separation and biofilm treatment which has the advantages of small footprint a large treatment load good dispersion and easy construction but the disadvantages of mbr technology such as high energy consumption and membrane contamination hinder its wide application 9 to address the shortcomings of existing combined wastewater treatment facilities bian et al developed a micro pressure cyclone reactor mpsr based on a conventional sequencing batch reactor 10 mpsr inherited the advantages of a simple process easy operation and small footprint of sbr in addition the mud water mixture inside the mpsr was driven to form a circular flow through the aeration and there was no mechanical structure inside the reactor which facilitated the maintenance of the unit during aeration an effective anoxic anaerobic zone in the biochemical zone of the mpsr could be established by modulating the aeration thus nitrogen and phosphorus were removed simultaneously and compared with sbr the dissolved oxygen dissolution efficiency was significantly improved 10 in addition good contaminant removal performance was maintained in the mpsr even under unfriendly conditions e g low temperatures temperature fluctuations 11 12 in summary mpsr has great potential for biological nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and is an effective technology for creating a variety of environments and one of the effective alternatives to traditional activated sludge treatment processes in rural wastewater treatment noteworthy the water quality of rural wastewater varies seasonally in the actual treatment of rural wastewater 13 nutrient loading in wastewater treatment facilities is altered due to changes in water quality which affects sludge performance and nutrient removal enhancing the stability of nutrient loading by increasing the mlss concentration seems to be an effective solution to this problem however activated sludge that was discarded during mlss concentration control is an undesirable by product with an unpleasant odor and a huge volume currently there are two main methods to reduce waste activated sludge was either by treating was separately after wastewater treatment or by achieving in situ sludge reduction during the wastewater treatment process yet post treatment operations are complex and costly and are not suitable for use in rural areas so the amount of sludge generated during wastewater treatment should be minimized previous studies had showed that sludge production could be effectively reduced by increasing the mlss concentration of the system 14 15 in addition in our previous study it was found that mpsr might be a suitable wastewater treatment facility for operation at high mlss concentration 12 therefore it is necessary to have a better understanding of the performance of mpsr under different mlss concentration conditions in this study firstly we monitored the dissolved oxygen do in the reactor at different mlss concentration to gain a preliminary understanding of the biochemical environment within mpsr secondly the mlss concentration of mpsr was optimized based on the performance of in situ sludge reduction and nutrient removal aiming to provide guidance to alleviate the pressure of rural sewage and was treatment difficulties finally the sludge reduction mechanism and enhanced nutrient removal mechanism of mpsr were analyzed and discussed in depth by sludge characterization and microbial community detection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental equipment and operating conditions the structure diagram of the mpsr is shown in fig 1 the reactor with a working volume of 40 l and was composed of plexiglass plate the liquid level lifting zone was set in the upper part which was a hollow cuboid with a height of 400 mm and the lower part was a horizontal cylinder with an inner diameter of 900 mm and a height of 90 mm the aerator pipe was set at an angle of 45 between the bottom of the reactor and the vertical direction of the center of the circle the air compressor aco 318 hailea china glass rotameter lzb 6wb xiangjin flow meter factory china and aeration tube were connected sequentially through the rubber tube to provide aeration for the reactor the operation period of the reactor was 720 min each cycle included 10 min of inlet water 480 min of aeration 180 min of precipitation 10 min of drainage 40 min of idle the drainage rate was set to 50 for each cycle the mpsr operation was divided into five phases p1 to p5 according to the mlss concentration the different mlss concentration were adjusted by controlling the mixture discharge volume the mixture discharge operation was performed 10 min before the end of the first cycle of aeration each day the volume of mixed discharge was fixed for each phase the specific discharge volumes and the mean mlss concentration for each smooth period are shown in table 1 sampling ports were evenly distributed on the reactor points a b and c were responsible

colorimetry and coomassie bright blue method respectively 18 the dehydrogenase activity dha of the microorganisms was measured using colorimetry at 485 nm 19 the particle size of the sludge was

project the total dna was extracted from the activated sludge samples using the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega the purity and concentration of the dna were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis universal primers 341f 805r were utilized to amplify v3 v4 miseq sequencing platform pcr primers compatible illumina were introduced for the second round of pcr amplification raw

functional units for samples with only colony marker gene sequencing data 2 5 calculation of sludge apparent yield coefficient in this study the ratio between the cumulative amount of sludge discharged by the system and the total amount of cod removed by accumulation was used to represent the sludge apparent yield coefficient yobs of the system refer to he et al for the calculation method

discharge g x o represents the average cod concentration of the influent water g l x e represents the average cod concentration of the effluent water g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in do during the operation cycle of the mpsr the variations of do in a typical cycle of the mpsr system at different mlss concentration are shown in fig 2 here only the do at points a and c was monitored under the test conditions the do concentration at point c was always higher than the do concentration at point a the main reason for the difference in do was that the peripheral dissolved oxygen was consumed by the substrate and had difficulty reaching the central part of the mpsr in addition there was a significant increase in do concentration at point c before the end of each cycle of aeration this phenomenon marked the basic completion of nitrification unlike p1 and p2 the do concentrations at point a of p3 p5 were stabilized at lower levels during aeration this might be related to the low oxygen transfer rate due to the high biomass concentration 21 it is worth noting that for conventional activated sludge processes the impact of larger mlss on the oxygen transfer coefficient should be avoided as much as possible however larger mlss concentration in mpsr facilitated the formation of a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone the above results indicated that different do regions were formed in the mpsr by aeration which provided macroscopic conditions for snd and phosphorus removal the biochemical environment within the mpsr was optimized and a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone was established by improving the mlss concentration and these changes could further enhance the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the system 3 2 nutrient removal performances of mpsr at different mlss concentration 3 2 1 cod removal the cod removal effects of mpsr system under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3a during the test the cod concentration of p1 p5 in the influent ranged from 331 7 to 514 36 mg l the average cod concentrations of the effluent were 47 88 28 72 20 06 26 02 30 93 mg l and the average removal rates of cod were 88 20 92 58 95 30 93 94 93 00 it could be seen that cod was effectively removed in the mpsr the average cod values of the system effluent at different mlss concentration were below 50 mg l as the mlss concentration rose the removal efficiency of mpsr for cod first increased and then decreased in p1 the effluent cod concentration of the system was higher than other phases and the effluent cod value was highly fluctuating with the highest effluent cod concentration reaching 63 mg l the high sludge load caused by low mlss concentration led to an unstable cod removal rate in the system compared to the p1 in p2 p4 the effluent cod concentration was stable and the cod removal efficiency was improved on the one hand reduction of organic load facilitated the stable removal of organic matter on the other hand an anaerobic anoxic zone was established by increasing the mlss concentration in the mpsr with a longer maintenance time which promoted more organic matter to be used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the average effluent cod values were increased for p4 and p5 compared to p3 this was because the number of apoptotic microorganisms in the system would increase with the decrease of sludge load and the non degradable organic matter in the system would be accumulated due to the lack of effective removal resulting in the increase of effluent cod concentration 3 2 2 tp removal the tp removal effects of the mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 b during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent tp concentration ranged from 2 02 to 4 40 mg l the average tp concentrations of the effluent were 0 13 0 07 0 07 0 07 0 47 mg l and the average removal rates of tp were 95 93 97 51 98 20 97 72 88 49 similar to the removal efficiency of cod by mpsr the removal efficiency of tp by mpsr first increased and then decreased as the mlss concentration increased the effluent tp concentrations of p1 and p5 fluctuated widely in p1 the high fluctuation of effluent tp concentration was due to the incomplete utilization of cod as the mlss concentration increased in p2 p4 the effluent tp concentration was low and stable the main reason for the improved phosphorus removal was that the oxygen environment inside the mpsr was optimized by improving the mlss concentration and phosphorus was removed through the synergistic effect of multiple bacterial populations in p5 on the one hand the low load led to the apoptosis of some phosphorus removal functional bacteria on the other hand the long sludge residence time srt was not conducive to the growth of phosphorus removal bacteria resulting in unstable phosphorus removal the variations of tp concentration in a typical cycle of mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 c the tp concentration was increased during the first 60 min of aeration in each stage this phenomenon occurred because a large amount of do was consumed early in the aeration and thus a large amount of phosphorus was released in the low do environment according to the analysis of phosphorus absorption efficiency the aeration times required for the mpsr system to complete phosphorus absorption 1 mg l were 390 180 210 180 and 300 min at different mlss concentration the phosphorus uptake rates of mpsr systems at different mlss concentration were 0 051 0 106 0 140 0 137 0 059 mg l 1 min 1 the results of phosphorus uptake rate indicated that the mpsr systems of p3 and p4 showed faster phosphorus uptake rates and more efficient utilization of cod 3 2 3 nitrogen removal the nh4 n removal effects of the mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 d during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent nh4 n concentration ranged from 22 16 to 36 47 mg l the average nh4 n concentrations of the effluent were 0 77 0 51 0 58 0 44 0 57 mg l and the average removal rates of nh4 n were 97 29 98 26 97 94 98 47 97 99 due to the presence of a good do environment in the system the nh4 n was efficiently processed within the mpsr in p1 unstable removal of nh4 n was caused by the larger nitrogen load as the mlss concentration improved the shock resistance of the system gradually improved at the same time the reduction of organic load reduced the do utilization of heterotrophic bacteria which facilitated nitrification since the mpsr system could establish a stable anaerobic anoxic zone in the central area by aeration denitrifying bacteria could use organic matter to complete denitrification in the anaerobic anoxic zone meanwhile nitrifying bacteria could use do in the peripheral aerobic zone to complete nitrification therefore simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd could occur in the mpsr the effects of tn removal by mpsr at different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 e during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent tn concentration ranged from 38 34 to 52 33 mg l the average tn concentrations of the effluent were 10 90 11 12 4 26 7 23 5 24 mg l and the average removal rates of tn were 75 40 76 04 89 91 83 71 88 23 as could be seen from the figure the tn removal effect increased to different degrees as the mlss concentration increased in p1 and p2 the effluent tn concentration fluctuated between 10 00 and 15 00 mg l and the tn removal effects in p3 p5 were excellent the above results indicated that the nitrogen removal capacity of the system was enhanced through a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone different forms of nitrogen at point a were examined to investigate the effect of different mlss concentration on nitrogen removal by mpsr as showed in fig 4 with the increased aeration time the nh4 n concentrations in the system at different mlss concentration showed a decreasing trend the aeration times required for the mpsr system to remove ammonia nitrogen to below 1 mg l in p1 p5 were 390 150 300 180 and 210 min respectively this phenomenon indicated that nh4 n could be removed rapidly in p3 p5 from the variation of no2 n and no3 n concentrations it could be seen that the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the initial stage of aeration were kept at a low level in the system the low levels of no2 n and no3 n concentrations indicated that the mpsr possessed a strong simultaneous nitrification denitrification capability the accumulation of no2 n was found in all typical cycles of p1 p5 and no2 n was removed before the end of aeration compared with p1 and p2 the accumulation of no2 n was less in p3 p5 and the duration of no2 n accumulation was shortened these phenomena suggested that improving the mlss concentration not only facilitated the full utilization of do but prolonged the stabilization time of the oxygen environment in the mpsr system and provided good conditions for snd action the accumulation of no3 n was later than that of no2 n due to the limitation of insufficient carbon source the accumulation of no3 n occurred in the late stage of aeration the continuous decrease of tn concentration was limited by the denitrification process 3 2 4 distribution of nitrogen containing pollutants in the reactor the mechanism of nitrogen removal in mpsr could be further revealed by studying the distribution of nitrogen containing pollutants in the reactor the degradation processes of nitrogen containing pollutants at points a b and c during typical time periods were examined as showed in fig 5 only p3 was explored here as a representative zone i was represented by points a and b and zone ii was represented by points c during 0 to 90 min nitrification was slow do was mainly used to remove some cod and ammoniated organic nitrogen and low do concentration was the main reason to limit nitrification at the same time the nh4 n concentrations at the three points showed a gradient with the smallest nh4 n concentration at point c and the largest nh4 n concentration at point a this phenomenon indicated that nitrification mainly occurred in zone ii the decrease of nh4 n concentration at points a and b lagged due to mass transfer nh4 n concentration at point c was the first to reach the lowest level after 360 min and d o concentration at point c started to increase although the effluent contained a large amount of nox n the concentration of nox n in the system was very low from 0 to 180 min due to the slow decrease of nh4 n concentration and the presence of both strong nitrification and denitrification in the mpsr after 180 min the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly and the no2 n concentration started to increase the change of no2 n accumulation and accumulation time showed that point c had the shortest accumulation time and the least accumulation and the accumulation of no2 n at points a and b was lagged which indicated the fastest nitrification rate in zone ii after 240 min the no3 n concentrations started to rise with the slowest rise and lowest peak at point a and the fastest rise and highest peak at point c there were two main reasons for this phenomenon one was that nitrification occurred in zone ii with high do concentration and the other was that denitrification occurred in zone i with low do concentration during 450 to 480 min the no3 n concentration reached the highest point at points a b and c with the increased of aeration time the no3 n concentration at point a increased slightly and the no3 n concentration at point c decreased slightly the appearance of the highest no3 n concentration meant that the organic matter in the system was depleted after that the water quality was mixed as the aeration process continued the presence of different functional zones was the main reason why the mpsr with a single tank structure was able to remove nitrogen effectively 3 3 reduction of excess sludge 3 3 1 characteristics of activated sludge the variation of mlss svi and average particle size of sludge are shown in fig 6 a during the test the average mlss concentration of p1 p5 were 4146 5319 8150 13 257 14 458 mg l and the average svi were 191 135 109 69 65 ml g the sludge volume index svi value was an important index to evaluate the settling performance of activated sludge when the svi value was 150 ml g there was a possibility of sludge expansion in the system 22 23 this situation could lead to a lower sludge settling rate and a looser sludge structure which in turn affect the efficacy of wastewater treatment as can be seen from fig 6 a the svi of activated sludge showed a decreasing change with the increased of mlss concentration at p1 and p2 the sludge load was high and the microorganisms were in the logarithmic growth phase in this case the microorganisms were relatively dispersed rather than forming flocs 24 this was also evidenced in fig 6 b meanwhile the loose sludge structure and poor sludge settling properties also affected the efficacy of mpsr for wastewater treatment in p3 p5 the settling performance of sludge within the mpsr was improved at hight mlss concentration as shown in fig 6 b the mean sludge particle size of p1 p5 were 73 62 85 99 94 69 91 14 83 62μm during the test the mean sludge particle size changed with the increased of mlss concentration showing an increase followed by a decrease the variation of the oxygen environment in p1 p3 might be the main reason why the sludge particle size got grown in p4 and p5 high mlss concentration or long srt led to lower sludge load and then endogenous respiration of microorganisms was enhanced in the oligotrophic state which in turn affected the mean sludge particle size the above results showed that the sludge settling performance was improved by elevating the mlss concentration which provided a stable operation of the reaction facility in addition the particle size of the sludge increased by increasing the mlss concentration but too long srt could enhance the endogenous respiration of microorganisms and lead to particle size reduction the growth of sludge particle size facilitated the formation of an anaerobic anoxic microenvironment in the sludge which provided the conditions for the occurrence of snd 3 3 2 in situ reduction and dha of activated sludge the yobs values of p1 p5 were obtained by calculating the cumulative generated biomass versus cumulative consumed substrate as showed in fig 6 c the yobs value decreased and then increased as the mlss concentration increased the highest yobs of 0 48 g ss g cod was observed in p1 the lowest yobs of 0 28 g ss g cod was observed in p3 compared to the yobs values of p1 p5 it was found that the sludge reduction efficiency was further improved by increasing the mlss concentration compared with p1 the yobs of p2 p5 reduced by 13 27 21 and 18 the above observed results could be attributed to the fact that mlss concentration had an important role in sludge performance i e eps microbial related enzyme activity i e dha and related microbial abundance e g hydrolytic bacteria and thus in situ sludge reduction could be achieved in mpsr however it had been shown that increasing the mlss concentration or prolonging the srt would increase the energy consumption to sustain microbial metabolism and thus reduce the biomass production of biomass 25 this was inconsistent with the results for p1 to p5 so it was speculated that there might be other sludge reduction mechanisms to support more sludge reduction in p3 and p4 dha serves as an indicator of microbiological redox systems and was considered as an important indicator of microbial oxidative activities the variation of the dha of activated sludge in p1 p5 was used to further evaluate the effect of mlss concentration on the sludge reduction of mpsr fig 6 c the dha at points a and c were examined to determine the sludge activity in different regions of the mpsr the dha value detected at point a was consistently higher than the dha value at point c similar result reported by sang et al 26 that the dha values in the anaerobic anoxic zone were higher than the dha values in the aerobic zone this phenomenon might be related to the decomposition of a large amount of organic matter in the anaerobic anoxic zone furthermore by compared the yobs values and dha values of p1 p5 it was found that dha decreased with decreasing yobs values therefore correlation analysis was performed fig 6 d the results showed a high correlation between the above two this means that microbial activity could be increased by increasing the mlss concentration dehydrogenase is an extracellular and intracellular enzyme that plays an important role in catalyzing the oxidation of organic matter so dha can respond to the degree of metabolic activity of heterotrophic microorganisms 27 the higher dha in p3 p5 helped to improve the contaminant removal by mpsr meanwhile the significant increase of sludge dha content in mpsr was also related to the maintenance and repair metabolism of microorganisms which was one of the reasons for sludge reduction 28 on the other hand dha values were positively correlated with cell lysis rates 29 and higher cell lysis rates resulted in more metabolites e g proteins and polysaccharides being produced by the sludge which contributed to microbial activity and enzyme synthesis hence the higher activity of the metabolic enzyme i e dehydrogenase in mpsr provided more oppor tunity on eps release to enhance in situ sludge reduction interestingly from p3 to p5 the dha values showed a decreasing trend which might be due to the decrease in sludge particle size the decrease in sludge particle size allowed more microorganisms to be exposed to the hyperoxic environment which promoted the evolution of parthenogenic anaerobic bacteria to aerobic bacteria and led to a decrease in the relative abundance of functional bacteria used for nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction 30 3 3 3 extracellular polymeric substance concentrations eps has a significant impact on the properties and performance of sludge protein and polysaccharides as the two main components of eps were used as surrogate indicators to assess the reduction of excess sludge fig 6 e during the operational period a significant decrease in protein concentration and a relative stabilization of polysaccharide concentration were observed by increasing mlss concentration therefore the trend of pn ps was similar to that of pn pn and pn ps values were the smallest at p3 with 45 05 mg g vss and 3 44 the relatively low pn ps in p3 p5 suggested that the improvement of the settling performance of the sludge floc in mpsr could be achieved by adjusting the mlss concentration 31 in addition the lower eps of p3 p5 compared to the other phases suggests that more eps was released as soluble microbial products smps which were later broken down by fermentative and hydrolytic bacteria into simple organic matter for biosynthesis or nitrogen and phosphorus removal providing more opportunities for in situ sludge reduction during mpsr 32 furthermore an increasing trend of eps was observed in p3 to p5 which might be related to the biochemical behavior of the microorganisms where the excess smp was no longer used for nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal but was converted to eps and stored outside the cells 3 4 microbial community composition 3 4 1 diversity and richness of microbial species the richness and diversity of the microorganisms in the activated sludge obtained from the p1 p5 are provided in table 3 the good s coverage for the five samples ranged from 0 977 to 0 996 and the number of otus ranged from 1939 to 2685 this indicated that the constructed sequence library was representative and could adequately cover the microbial communities in the samples the observed species and chao 1 dissimilarity 3 indices were applied to characterize the species richness of microorganisms which were positively correlated with the richness of microorganisms 34 during the whole operation period the observed species richness in the mpsr was obtained as p3 3469 p5 3395 p4 2926 p2 2804 p1 2612 and chao 1 richness as p3 3825 p5 3664 p4 3143 p2 2942 p1 2624 the shannon and simpson indices were used to identify microbial diversity a higher shannon index or lower simpson index represents higher microbial diversity 33 during the whole operation period the shannon values in the mpsr was obtained as p3 8 299 p5 8 272 p2 8 065 p4 8 02 p1 7 933 and simpson values as p1 0 056 p5 0 037 p2 0 031 p4 0 028 p3 0 021 the above results indicated that the establishment of stable anaerobic anoxic zones facilitated the increase of microbial species richness and diversity in the mpsr system these microbial changes were considered to contribute to the efficiency of nutrient removal by biochemical systems and to reduce the production of excess sludge 35 3 4 2 identification of microbial taxonomy the type and percentage of microorganisms in the system affects not only the effluent treatment efficiency of the bioreactor but also the amount of in situ sludge reduction the composition of microbial communities in bioreactors at the phylum and genus level are shown in fig 7 a and table 4 the bacteria of the activated sludge in this reactor were grouped into 11 different types of gates the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria patescibacteria and chloroflexi which were consistent with previous study on mpsr 36 previous studies had shown that proteobacteria had a high microbial metabolic diversity associated with the degradation of biodegradable compounds e g phenol that bacteroidetes had the ability to degrade epss i e proteins and polysaccharides associated with the compressibility and settleability of activated sludge 37 and that chloroflexi was identified as the main microorganism that degrades carbohydrates and cellular material 38 in addition proteobacteria bacteroidetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi were reported to be closely associated with nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the system 39 40 although the composition of the bacterial communities was approximately the same at different phases there were significant differences in the relative abundance of certain phyla during mpsr operation relative abundances of proteobacteria were p1 29 7 p2 27 9 p3 53 7 p4 40 2 p5 24 0 bacteroidetes p1 9 3 p2 8 8 p3 10 7 p4 13 2 p5 44 0 actinobacteria p1 23 5 p2 16 0 p3 17 2 p4 11 1 p5 3 9 patescibacteria p1 26 1 p2 18 6 p3 5 6 p4 13 9 p5 5 9 chloroflexi p1 5 0 p2 5 2 p3 8 3 p4 13 6 p5 13 2 the results showed that the abundance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the bioreactor was higher at p3 p5 these changes were directly related to the performance of the mpsr process in terms of organic matter and nutrient removal and residual sludge reduction in particular proteobacteria whose abundance correlated well with the performance of mpsr for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as well as sludge reduction table 4 shows the main functional bacteria responsible for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as well as sludge reduction at the genus level during p1 to p5 to analyze the functions of microbial population dynamics effectively bacterial populations associated with biotrophic removal could be classified at the generic level into four categories nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospira nitrosomonas denitrifying bacteria denitratisoma zoogloea phosphorus accumulating organisms aeromonas denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms tetrasphaera during the experiment a more stable anaerobic zone was established in the central region of the mpsr by increasing the mlss concentration and this change provided conditions for the growth of some microorganisms among the above bacteria aeromonas p1 0 77 p2 0 58 p3 1 10 p4 1 87 p5 0 04 and tetrasphaera p1 3 17 p2 4 30 p3 8 15 p4 4 98 p5 1 87 were the major phosphorus removing genera in p1 to p5 the relative abundance of these genera corresponded to the tp removal results also tetrasphaera has denitrification capacity and it was the dominant denitrifying genus of the system candidatus competibacter contributed to reduce nitrate to nitrite thus supporting the anoxic activity of pao which facilitated the nitrogen and phosphorus removal the other genera zoogloea 5 43 denitratisoma 0 91 nitrospira 1 28 nitrosomonas 0 77 associated with nitrogen removal had the highest relative abundance at p5 these genera guarantee the denitrification performance of p5 from the perspective of sludge reduction sludge reduction in mpsr was achieved by enriching microorganisms with hydrolytic fermentative slow growing and predatory functions among them tetrasphaera and denitratisoma were the dominant slow growing bacteria candidatus competibacter phaeodactylibacte and zoogloea were the dominant hydrolytic bacteria and tetrasphaera was the dominant fermentative bacteria a strong correlation between the relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria and sludge reduction was observed therefore in addition to the additional energy consumption caused by the hight mlss concentration cryptogenic growth might be the main reason for the higher sludge reduction in p3 and p4 because the dissolution of biomass and hydrolysis of particulate organic matter pom are rate limiting steps in the dissolution cryptogenic growth process and the increased efficiency of pom conversion to the dissolved form can lead to an overall reduction in sludge production 49 this was confirmed by the higher relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria spp in p3 and p4 3 4 3 potential role of functional genes and metabolic pathways in activated sludge processes nutrient removal and sludge reduction are closely related to microbial metabolism previous studies had shown that intracellular material could be completely metabolized to water and carbon dioxide through endogenous metabolic processes which reduces biomass production 50 during denitrification genes associated with denitrification e g nirk norb and nosz were closely associated with organic metabolism and nutrient removal as well as in situ sludge reduction and their presence promoted a relatively complete endogenous denitrification process in the system leading to more efficient uptake of substrates released by cell lysis thus the denitrification metabolic pathways of the bacterial communities in p1 to p5 were analyzed based on the kegg database the abundance of nitrite reductase gene nirk nitric oxide reductase gene norb and nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz is shown in fig 7 b the abundance of nirk norb and nosz in p3 nirk 110 norb 293 nosz 67 p4 nirk 114 norb 223 nosz 87 and p5 nirk 167 norb 90 nosz 168 was significantly higher than that in other periods p1 nirk 89 norb 67 nosz 62 p2 nirk 96 norb 88 nosz 55 this result was consistent with the excellent nitrogen removal and sludge reduction performance of the system during p3 p5 furthermore balancing microbial growth and nutrient removal through endogenous metabolism is important in the wastewater treatment process 51 in the nitrate reduction process nitrate reduction could be divided into anabolic nitrate reduction anr and dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnr 52 fig 7 c illustrates the nitrogen metabolic pathway in the mpsr the functional genes associated with dnr narghi napab nirbd nrfa and anr nasa narb nira under different mlss concentration were quantified and compared fig 7 d the total abundance of dnr was significantly greater compared to anr suggesting that dnr was the main denitrification pathway for mpsr in addition as the mlss concentration increased the abundance ratio of dnr anr showed an increase followed by a decrease p1 8 76 p2 11 17 p3 26 20 p3 19 64 p5 13 25 the increased ratio meant that more nitrogen was removed through the metabolic pathway of the dnr rather than being used for cell synthesis in conclusion appropriate mlss concentrations provided additional opportunities for in situ sludge reduction by affecting the positive regulation of potential gene function and increased abundance of gene expression 4 conclusion in the experiment five groups of mpsr systems with different mlss concentration controls were used to treat the simulated wastewater the mean values of mlss concentration were 4 14 6 05 7 98 11 45 and 14 46 g l p1 p5 the main conclusions of the experiment are as follows 1 a more stable anoxic aerobic zone was established in the central region of the mpsr by increasing the biomass concentration which contributed to improved microbial activity and organic matter metabolism for more efficient nitrogen removal and sludge reduction 2 7 98 11 45 g l was the optimum mlss concentration for mpsr at the average mlss concentrations of 7 98 g l and 11 45 g l the tp and tn removal efficiencies were improved by 2 27 and 14 51 and 1 79 and 8 31 respectively and the remaining sludge volume was reduced by 27 and 21 respectively 3 the value of dehydrogenase activity was positively correlated with sludge reduction and higher dehydrogenase activity facilitated the hydrolysis of eps which in turn contributed to sludge reduction 4 microbial species analysis showed that the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria spp candidatus competibacter phaeodactylibacte zoogloea was the key to further sludge reduction and the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria zoogloea denitratisoma and phosphorus accumulating organisms tetrasphaera aeromonas was the key to improve the denitrification and phosphorus removal performance of the system 5 analysis of the denitrification metabolic pathway showed that the abundance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes as a percentage of total nitrate reduction genes was increasedfor more efficient sludge reduction by optimizing the

12716,aiming at the practical problem of rural wastewater and excess sludge treatment difficulties micro pressure swirl reactor mpsr was employed to carry out the experiment on the treatment of sewage under five different biomass concentration mlss concentration conditions 4 14 6 05 7 98 11 45 14 46 g l the results showed that the nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction performance of the system showed an increase and then a decrease with increasing mlss concentration and 7 98 11 45 g l was the optimal mlss concentration range in addition parameters related to in situ sludge reduction were further examined and the extracellular polymeric substance content and sludge dehydrogenase activity were negatively and positively correlated with sludge reduction respectively according to the microbial analysis at suitable mlss concentration beneficial microorganisms tetrasphaera aeromonas candidatus competibacter were enriched in the mpsr to facilitate the nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction of the system in addition the potential gene nirk norb nosz functions of the microorganisms were positively regulated the increase in the expression abundance ratio of dissimilatory and anabolic nitrate reduction genes played a positive role in denitrification and sludge reduction of the system graphical abstract unlabelled image

permission to share data 1 introduction rural revitalization strategy is a key development strategy in china in recent years with the development of the rural economy rural living standards have gradually improved and the amount of rural sewage discharge has become increasingly large 1 however most rural areas have inadequate drainage channels and sewage treatment facilities 2 according to the yearbook data on rural sewage treatment in 2014 2019 although the rate of rural sewage treatment in china is on the rise it is still below 35 3 the uncontrolled and direct discharge of rural sewage has become the main source of non point source pollution 4 agricultural wastewater and domestic sewage are the principal sources of non point source pollution and the nitrogen and phosphorus in these effluents are not only responsible for the eutrophication of water bodies but a threat to the health of local residents 5 therefore development of effective rural wastewater treatment technologies is a critical issue that needs to be addressed rural sewage is characterized by wide distribution large pollution range small amount of sewage intermittent discharge 6 therefore the technology with low investment small equipment size simple management and stable operation should be considered first when choosing the rural domestic sewage treatment process and treatment facilities activated sludge process as a high efficiency and low cost wastewater treatment process has been widely used in wastewater treatment plants in addition the integrated treatment technology which has the advantages of easy transportation simple on site installation and small footprint is the hot spot of rural domestic wastewater treatment technology research at this stage integrated treatment technology is a kind of wastewater treatment process obtained by optimizing the design and combination of each functional module of traditional wastewater treatment process at present many activated sludge processes such as aao mbr sbr etc have been applied to rural wastewater treatment by combining integrated treatment technology however among these activated sludge processes only a few effluents from mbr and aao processes comply with the discharge standards 7 in the aao process the wastewater is purified by going through three stages phosphorus release in the anaerobic zone denitrification in the anoxic zone as well as phosphorus removal and nitrification in the aerobic zone however the aao process has high operating costs complex operation and large floor space so it is not suitable for rural areas where expertise and intelligent controls are lacking 8 mbr process is a kind of wastewater treatment technology with organic combination of membrane separation and biofilm treatment which has the advantages of small footprint a large treatment load good dispersion and easy construction but the disadvantages of mbr technology such as high energy consumption and membrane contamination hinder its wide application 9 to address the shortcomings of existing combined wastewater treatment facilities bian et al developed a micro pressure cyclone reactor mpsr based on a conventional sequencing batch reactor 10 mpsr inherited the advantages of a simple process easy operation and small footprint of sbr in addition the mud water mixture inside the mpsr was driven to form a circular flow through the aeration and there was no mechanical structure inside the reactor which facilitated the maintenance of the unit during aeration an effective anoxic anaerobic zone in the biochemical zone of the mpsr could be established by modulating the aeration thus nitrogen and phosphorus were removed simultaneously and compared with sbr the dissolved oxygen dissolution efficiency was significantly improved 10 in addition good contaminant removal performance was maintained in the mpsr even under unfriendly conditions e g low temperatures temperature fluctuations 11 12 in summary mpsr has great potential for biological nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and is an effective technology for creating a variety of environments and one of the effective alternatives to traditional activated sludge treatment processes in rural wastewater treatment noteworthy the water quality of rural wastewater varies seasonally in the actual treatment of rural wastewater 13 nutrient loading in wastewater treatment facilities is altered due to changes in water quality which affects sludge performance and nutrient removal enhancing the stability of nutrient loading by increasing the mlss concentration seems to be an effective solution to this problem however activated sludge that was discarded during mlss concentration control is an undesirable by product with an unpleasant odor and a huge volume currently there are two main methods to reduce waste activated sludge was either by treating was separately after wastewater treatment or by achieving in situ sludge reduction during the wastewater treatment process yet post treatment operations are complex and costly and are not suitable for use in rural areas so the amount of sludge generated during wastewater treatment should be minimized previous studies had showed that sludge production could be effectively reduced by increasing the mlss concentration of the system 14 15 in addition in our previous study it was found that mpsr might be a suitable wastewater treatment facility for operation at high mlss concentration 12 therefore it is necessary to have a better understanding of the performance of mpsr under different mlss concentration conditions in this study firstly we monitored the dissolved oxygen do in the reactor at different mlss concentration to gain a preliminary understanding of the biochemical environment within mpsr secondly the mlss concentration of mpsr was optimized based on the performance of in situ sludge reduction and nutrient removal aiming to provide guidance to alleviate the pressure of rural sewage and was treatment difficulties finally the sludge reduction mechanism and enhanced nutrient removal mechanism of mpsr were analyzed and discussed in depth by sludge characterization and microbial community detection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental equipment and operating conditions the structure diagram of the mpsr is shown in fig 1 the reactor with a working volume of 40 l and was composed of plexiglass plate the liquid level lifting zone was set in the upper part which was a hollow cuboid with a height of 400 mm and the lower part was a horizontal cylinder with an inner diameter of 900 mm and a height of 90 mm the aerator pipe was set at an angle of 45 between the bottom of the reactor and the vertical direction of the center of the circle the air compressor aco 318 hailea china glass rotameter lzb 6wb xiangjin flow meter factory china and aeration tube were connected sequentially through the rubber tube to provide aeration for the reactor the operation period of the reactor was 720 min each cycle included 10 min of inlet water 480 min of aeration 180 min of precipitation 10 min of drainage 40 min of idle the drainage rate was set to 50 for each cycle the mpsr operation was divided into five phases p1 to p5 according to the mlss concentration the different mlss concentration were adjusted by controlling the mixture discharge volume the mixture discharge operation was performed 10 min before the end of the first cycle of aeration each day the volume of mixed discharge was fixed for each phase the specific discharge volumes and the mean mlss concentration for each smooth period are shown in table 1 sampling ports were evenly distributed on the reactor points a b and c were responsible for drainage test samples and mixture drainage 2 2 test water quality and inoculated sludge the synthetic wastewater was made up of starch naoh naac nh 4 cl kh 2 po 4 beef extract and peptone naoh was utilized to adjust the ph of water beef extracts and peptone were responsible for providing trace elements the ph of the influent water was controlled between 7 8 and 8 2 the influent water quality during the test is shown in table 2 the experimental sludge came from the aerobic tank of a sewage treatment plant in changchun china after sieving and filtering activated sludge was inoculated into the reaction facility and the initial inoculation concentration was controlled at about 4000 mg l 2 3 analytical methods cod tn nh4 n tp mlss and svi were measured according to standard methods 16 nitrates and nitrites were detected by ion chromatography 881compact ic pro metrohm switzerland do was detected by portable dissolved oxygen analyzer multi 3510 ids wtw germany and ph was detected by ph meter phsj 4a lei ci shanghai china the extraction of extracellular polymeric substances was performed with reference to li and yang 17 ps and pn were determined by anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetry and coomassie bright blue method respectively 18 the dehydrogenase activity dha of the microorganisms was measured using colorimetry at 485 nm 19 the particle size of the sludge was determined by laser diffraction eyetech laser ankersmid netherlands 2 4 microbial community detection during the stabilization runs from p1 to p5 activated sludge samples obtained from the sampling points were deposited into centrifuge tubes for microbiological testing the samples were stored in an ultra low temperature refrigerator at 80 c for the analysis of the microbial community in this project the total dna was extracted from the activated sludge samples using the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega the purity and concentration of the dna were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis universal primers 341f 805r were utilized to amplify v3 v4 miseq sequencing platform pcr primers compatible illumina were introduced for the second round of pcr amplification raw sequence data were demultiplexed using the demux plugin following by primers cutting with cutadapt plugin sequences were then quality filtered denoised merged and chimera removed using the dada2 plugin non singleton amplicon sequence variants asvs were aligned with mafft and used to construct a phylogeny with fasttree2 alpha diversity metrics chao1 observed species shannon simpson and good s coverage were estimated using the diversity plugin microbiome bioinformatics were mainly performed with qiime2 2019 4 the specific composition of the microbial community in each sample in the phylum and genus was obtained by counting the asv otu tables after flattening analysis with reference to known microbial genomic data picrust2 software was used to predict the composition of colony genes or functional units for samples with only colony marker gene sequencing data 2 5 calculation of sludge apparent yield coefficient in this study the ratio between the cumulative amount of sludge discharged by the system and the total amount of cod removed by accumulation was used to represent the sludge apparent yield coefficient yobs of the system refer to he et al for the calculation method of yobs 20 formula was as follows 1 y obs s a n v e x o x e n represents the number of cycles per day ve represents the system effluent volume in each cycle l s a represents the average sludge discharge g x o represents the average cod concentration of the influent water g l x e represents the average cod concentration of the effluent water g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in do during the operation cycle of the mpsr the variations of do in a typical cycle of the mpsr system at different mlss concentration are shown in fig 2 here only the do at points a and c was monitored under the test conditions the do concentration at point c was always higher than the do concentration at point a the main reason for the difference in do was that the peripheral dissolved oxygen was consumed by the substrate and had difficulty reaching the central part of the mpsr in addition there was a significant increase in do concentration at point c before the end of each cycle of aeration this phenomenon marked the basic completion of nitrification unlike p1 and p2 the do concentrations at point a of p3 p5 were stabilized at lower levels during aeration this might be related to the low oxygen transfer rate due to the high biomass concentration 21 it is worth noting that for conventional activated sludge processes the impact of larger mlss on the oxygen transfer coefficient should be avoided as much as possible however larger mlss concentration in mpsr facilitated the formation of a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone the above results indicated that different do regions were formed in the mpsr by aeration which provided macroscopic conditions for snd and phosphorus removal the biochemical environment within the mpsr was optimized and a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone was established by improving the mlss concentration and these changes could further enhance the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance of the system 3 2 nutrient removal performances of mpsr at different mlss concentration 3 2 1 cod removal the cod removal effects of mpsr system under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3a during the test the cod concentration of p1 p5 in the influent ranged from 331 7 to 514 36 mg l the average cod concentrations of the effluent were 47 88 28 72 20 06 26 02 30 93 mg l and the average removal rates of cod were 88 20 92 58 95 30 93 94 93 00 it could be seen that cod was effectively removed in the mpsr the average cod values of the system effluent at different mlss concentration were below 50 mg l as the mlss concentration rose the removal efficiency of mpsr for cod first increased and then decreased in p1 the effluent cod concentration of the system was higher than other phases and the effluent cod value was highly fluctuating with the highest effluent cod concentration reaching 63 mg l the high sludge load caused by low mlss concentration led to an unstable cod removal rate in the system compared to the p1 in p2 p4 the effluent cod concentration was stable and the cod removal efficiency was improved on the one hand reduction of organic load facilitated the stable removal of organic matter on the other hand an anaerobic anoxic zone was established by increasing the mlss concentration in the mpsr with a longer maintenance time which promoted more organic matter to be used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the average effluent cod values were increased for p4 and p5 compared to p3 this was because the number of apoptotic microorganisms in the system would increase with the decrease of sludge load and the non degradable organic matter in the system would be accumulated due to the lack of effective removal resulting in the increase of effluent cod concentration 3 2 2 tp removal the tp removal effects of the mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 b during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent tp concentration ranged from 2 02 to 4 40 mg l the average tp concentrations of the effluent were 0 13 0 07 0 07 0 07 0 47 mg l and the average removal rates of tp were 95 93 97 51 98 20 97 72 88 49 similar to the removal efficiency of cod by mpsr the removal efficiency of tp by mpsr first increased and then decreased as the mlss concentration increased the effluent tp concentrations of p1 and p5 fluctuated widely in p1 the high fluctuation of effluent tp concentration was due to the incomplete utilization of cod as the mlss concentration increased in p2 p4 the effluent tp concentration was low and stable the main reason for the improved phosphorus removal was that the oxygen environment inside the mpsr was optimized by improving the mlss concentration and phosphorus was removed through the synergistic effect of multiple bacterial populations in p5 on the one hand the low load led to the apoptosis of some phosphorus removal functional bacteria on the other hand the long sludge residence time srt was not conducive to the growth of phosphorus removal bacteria resulting in unstable phosphorus removal the variations of tp concentration in a typical cycle of mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 c the tp concentration was increased during the first 60 min of aeration in each stage this phenomenon occurred because a large amount of do was consumed early in the aeration and thus a large amount of phosphorus was released in the low do environment according to the analysis of phosphorus absorption efficiency the aeration times required for the mpsr system to complete phosphorus absorption 1 mg l were 390 180 210 180 and 300 min at different mlss concentration the phosphorus uptake rates of mpsr systems at different mlss concentration were 0 051 0 106 0 140 0 137 0 059 mg l 1 min 1 the results of phosphorus uptake rate indicated that the mpsr systems of p3 and p4 showed faster phosphorus uptake rates and more efficient utilization of cod 3 2 3 nitrogen removal the nh4 n removal effects of the mpsr under different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 d during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent nh4 n concentration ranged from 22 16 to 36 47 mg l the average nh4 n concentrations of the effluent were 0 77 0 51 0 58 0 44 0 57 mg l and the average removal rates of nh4 n were 97 29 98 26 97 94 98 47 97 99 due to the presence of a good do environment in the system the nh4 n was efficiently processed within the mpsr in p1 unstable removal of nh4 n was caused by the larger nitrogen load as the mlss concentration improved the shock resistance of the system gradually improved at the same time the reduction of organic load reduced the do utilization of heterotrophic bacteria which facilitated nitrification since the mpsr system could establish a stable anaerobic anoxic zone in the central area by aeration denitrifying bacteria could use organic matter to complete denitrification in the anaerobic anoxic zone meanwhile nitrifying bacteria could use do in the peripheral aerobic zone to complete nitrification therefore simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd could occur in the mpsr the effects of tn removal by mpsr at different mlss concentration are shown in fig 3 e during p1 to p5 under the conditions that the influent tn concentration ranged from 38 34 to 52 33 mg l the average tn concentrations of the effluent were 10 90 11 12 4 26 7 23 5 24 mg l and the average removal rates of tn were 75 40 76 04 89 91 83 71 88 23 as could be seen from the figure the tn removal effect increased to different degrees as the mlss concentration increased in p1 and p2 the effluent tn concentration fluctuated between 10 00 and 15 00 mg l and the tn removal effects in p3 p5 were excellent the above results indicated that the nitrogen removal capacity of the system was enhanced through a more stable anaerobic anoxic zone different forms of nitrogen at point a were examined to investigate the effect of different mlss concentration on nitrogen removal by mpsr as showed in fig 4 with the increased aeration time the nh4 n concentrations in the system at different mlss concentration showed a decreasing trend the aeration times required for the mpsr system to remove ammonia nitrogen to below 1 mg l in p1 p5 were 390 150 300 180 and 210 min respectively this phenomenon indicated that nh4 n could be removed rapidly in p3 p5 from the variation of no2 n and no3 n concentrations it could be seen that the no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the initial stage of aeration were kept at a low level in the system the low levels of no2 n and no3 n concentrations indicated that the mpsr possessed a strong simultaneous nitrification denitrification capability the accumulation of no2 n was found in all typical cycles of p1 p5 and no2 n was removed before the end of aeration compared with p1 and p2 the accumulation of no2 n was less in p3 p5 and the duration of no2 n accumulation was shortened these phenomena suggested that improving the mlss concentration not only facilitated the full utilization of do but prolonged the stabilization time of the oxygen environment in the mpsr system and provided good conditions for snd action the accumulation of no3 n was later than that of no2 n due to the limitation of insufficient carbon source the accumulation of no3 n occurred in the late stage of aeration the continuous decrease of tn concentration was limited by the denitrification process 3 2 4 distribution of nitrogen containing pollutants in the reactor the mechanism of nitrogen removal in mpsr could be further revealed by studying the distribution of nitrogen containing pollutants in the reactor the degradation processes of nitrogen containing pollutants at points a b and c during typical time periods were examined as showed in fig 5 only p3 was explored here as a representative zone i was represented by points a and b and zone ii was represented by points c during 0 to 90 min nitrification was slow do was mainly used to remove some cod and ammoniated organic nitrogen and low do concentration was the main reason to limit nitrification at the same time the nh4 n concentrations at the three points showed a gradient with the smallest nh4 n concentration at point c and the largest nh4 n concentration at point a this phenomenon indicated that nitrification mainly occurred in zone ii the decrease of nh4 n concentration at points a and b lagged due to mass transfer nh4 n concentration at point c was the first to reach the lowest level after 360 min and d o concentration at point c started to increase although the effluent contained a large amount of nox n the concentration of nox n in the system was very low from 0 to 180 min due to the slow decrease of nh4 n concentration and the presence of both strong nitrification and denitrification in the mpsr after 180 min the nh4 n concentration decreased rapidly and the no2 n concentration started to increase the change of no2 n accumulation and accumulation time showed that point c had the shortest accumulation time and the least accumulation and the accumulation of no2 n at points a and b was lagged which indicated the fastest nitrification rate in zone ii after 240 min the no3 n concentrations started to rise with the slowest rise and lowest peak at point a and the fastest rise and highest peak at point c there were two main reasons for this phenomenon one was that nitrification occurred in zone ii with high do concentration and the other was that denitrification occurred in zone i with low do concentration during 450 to 480 min the no3 n concentration reached the highest point at points a b and c with the increased of aeration time the no3 n concentration at point a increased slightly and the no3 n concentration at point c decreased slightly the appearance of the highest no3 n concentration meant that the organic matter in the system was depleted after that the water quality was mixed as the aeration process continued the presence of different functional zones was the main reason why the mpsr with a single tank structure was able to remove nitrogen effectively 3 3 reduction of excess sludge 3 3 1 characteristics of activated sludge the variation of mlss svi and average particle size of sludge are shown in fig 6 a during the test the average mlss concentration of p1 p5 were 4146 5319 8150 13 257 14 458 mg l and the average svi were 191 135 109 69 65 ml g the sludge volume index svi value was an important index to evaluate the settling performance of activated sludge when the svi value was 150 ml g there was a possibility of sludge expansion in the system 22 23 this situation could lead to a lower sludge settling rate and a looser sludge structure which in turn affect the efficacy of wastewater treatment as can be seen from fig 6 a the svi of activated sludge showed a decreasing change with the increased of mlss concentration at p1 and p2 the sludge load was high and the microorganisms were in the logarithmic growth phase in this case the microorganisms were relatively dispersed rather than forming flocs 24 this was also evidenced in fig 6 b meanwhile the loose sludge structure and poor sludge settling properties also affected the efficacy of mpsr for wastewater treatment in p3 p5 the settling performance of sludge within the mpsr was improved at hight mlss concentration as shown in fig 6 b the mean sludge particle size of p1 p5 were 73 62 85 99 94 69 91 14 83 62μm during the test the mean sludge particle size changed with the increased of mlss concentration showing an increase followed by a decrease the variation of the oxygen environment in p1 p3 might be the main reason why the sludge particle size got grown in p4 and p5 high mlss concentration or long srt led to lower sludge load and then endogenous respiration of microorganisms was enhanced in the oligotrophic state which in turn affected the mean sludge particle size the above results showed that the sludge settling performance was improved by elevating the mlss concentration which provided a stable operation of the reaction facility in addition the particle size of the sludge increased by increasing the mlss concentration but too long srt could enhance the endogenous respiration of microorganisms and lead to particle size reduction the growth of sludge particle size facilitated the formation of an anaerobic anoxic microenvironment in the sludge which provided the conditions for the occurrence of snd 3 3 2 in situ reduction and dha of activated sludge the yobs values of p1 p5 were obtained by calculating the cumulative generated biomass versus cumulative consumed substrate as showed in fig 6 c the yobs value decreased and then increased as the mlss concentration increased the highest yobs of 0 48 g ss g cod was observed in p1 the lowest yobs of 0 28 g ss g cod was observed in p3 compared to the yobs values of p1 p5 it was found that the sludge reduction efficiency was further improved by increasing the mlss concentration compared with p1 the yobs of p2 p5 reduced by 13 27 21 and 18 the above observed results could be attributed to the fact that mlss concentration had an important role in sludge performance i e eps microbial related enzyme activity i e dha and related microbial abundance e g hydrolytic bacteria and thus in situ sludge reduction could be achieved in mpsr however it had been shown that increasing the mlss concentration or prolonging the srt would increase the energy consumption to sustain microbial metabolism and thus reduce the biomass production of biomass 25 this was inconsistent with the results for p1 to p5 so it was speculated that there might be other sludge reduction mechanisms to support more sludge reduction in p3 and p4 dha serves as an indicator of microbiological redox systems and was considered as an important indicator of microbial oxidative activities the variation of the dha of activated sludge in p1 p5 was used to further evaluate the effect of mlss concentration on the sludge reduction of mpsr fig 6 c the dha at points a and c were examined to determine the sludge activity in different regions of the mpsr the dha value detected at point a was consistently higher than the dha value at point c similar result reported by sang et al 26 that the dha values in the anaerobic anoxic zone were higher than the dha values in the aerobic zone this phenomenon might be related to the decomposition of a large amount of organic matter in the anaerobic anoxic zone furthermore by compared the yobs values and dha values of p1 p5 it was found that dha decreased with decreasing yobs values therefore correlation analysis was performed fig 6 d the results showed a high correlation between the above two this means that microbial activity could be increased by increasing the mlss concentration dehydrogenase is an extracellular and intracellular enzyme that plays an important role in catalyzing the oxidation of organic matter so dha can respond to the degree of metabolic activity of heterotrophic microorganisms 27 the higher dha in p3 p5 helped to improve the contaminant removal by mpsr meanwhile the significant increase of sludge dha content in mpsr was also related to the maintenance and repair metabolism of microorganisms which was one of the reasons for sludge reduction 28 on the other hand dha values were positively correlated with cell lysis rates 29 and higher cell lysis rates resulted in more metabolites e g proteins and polysaccharides being produced by the sludge which contributed to microbial activity and enzyme synthesis hence the higher activity of the metabolic enzyme i e dehydrogenase in mpsr provided more oppor tunity on eps release to enhance in situ sludge reduction interestingly from p3 to p5 the dha values showed a decreasing trend which might be due to the decrease in sludge particle size the decrease in sludge particle size allowed more microorganisms to be exposed to the hyperoxic environment which promoted the evolution of parthenogenic anaerobic bacteria to aerobic bacteria and led to a decrease in the relative abundance of functional bacteria used for nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction 30 3 3 3 extracellular polymeric substance concentrations eps has a significant impact on the properties and performance of sludge protein and polysaccharides as the two main components of eps were used as surrogate indicators to assess the reduction of excess sludge fig 6 e during the operational period a significant decrease in protein concentration and a relative stabilization of polysaccharide concentration were observed by increasing mlss concentration therefore the trend of pn ps was similar to that of pn pn and pn ps values were the smallest at p3 with 45 05 mg g vss and 3 44 the relatively low pn ps in p3 p5 suggested that the improvement of the settling performance of the sludge floc in mpsr could be achieved by adjusting the mlss concentration 31 in addition the lower eps of p3 p5 compared to the other phases suggests that more eps was released as soluble microbial products smps which were later broken down by fermentative and hydrolytic bacteria into simple organic matter for biosynthesis or nitrogen and phosphorus removal providing more opportunities for in situ sludge reduction during mpsr 32 furthermore an increasing trend of eps was observed in p3 to p5 which might be related to the biochemical behavior of the microorganisms where the excess smp was no longer used for nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal but was converted to eps and stored outside the cells 3 4 microbial community composition 3 4 1 diversity and richness of microbial species the richness and diversity of the microorganisms in the activated sludge obtained from the p1 p5 are provided in table 3 the good s coverage for the five samples ranged from 0 977 to 0 996 and the number of otus ranged from 1939 to 2685 this indicated that the constructed sequence library was representative and could adequately cover the microbial communities in the samples the observed species and chao 1 dissimilarity 3 indices were applied to characterize the species richness of microorganisms which were positively correlated with the richness of microorganisms 34 during the whole operation period the observed species richness in the mpsr was obtained as p3 3469 p5 3395 p4 2926 p2 2804 p1 2612 and chao 1 richness as p3 3825 p5 3664 p4 3143 p2 2942 p1 2624 the shannon and simpson indices were used to identify microbial diversity a higher shannon index or lower simpson index represents higher microbial diversity 33 during the whole operation period the shannon values in the mpsr was obtained as p3 8 299 p5 8 272 p2 8 065 p4 8 02 p1 7 933 and simpson values as p1 0 056 p5 0 037 p2 0 031 p4 0 028 p3 0 021 the above results indicated that the establishment of stable anaerobic anoxic zones facilitated the increase of microbial species richness and diversity in the mpsr system these microbial changes were considered to contribute to the efficiency of nutrient removal by biochemical systems and to reduce the production of excess sludge 35 3 4 2 identification of microbial taxonomy the type and percentage of microorganisms in the system affects not only the effluent treatment efficiency of the bioreactor but also the amount of in situ sludge reduction the composition of microbial communities in bioreactors at the phylum and genus level are shown in fig 7 a and table 4 the bacteria of the activated sludge in this reactor were grouped into 11 different types of gates the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria patescibacteria and chloroflexi which were consistent with previous study on mpsr 36 previous studies had shown that proteobacteria had a high microbial metabolic diversity associated with the degradation of biodegradable compounds e g phenol that bacteroidetes had the ability to degrade epss i e proteins and polysaccharides associated with the compressibility and settleability of activated sludge 37 and that chloroflexi was identified as the main microorganism that degrades carbohydrates and cellular material 38 in addition proteobacteria bacteroidetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi were reported to be closely associated with nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the system 39 40 although the composition of the bacterial communities was approximately the same at different phases there were significant differences in the relative abundance of certain phyla during mpsr operation relative abundances of proteobacteria were p1 29 7 p2 27 9 p3 53 7 p4 40 2 p5 24 0 bacteroidetes p1 9 3 p2 8 8 p3 10 7 p4 13 2 p5 44 0 actinobacteria p1 23 5 p2 16 0 p3 17 2 p4 11 1 p5 3 9 patescibacteria p1 26 1 p2 18 6 p3 5 6 p4 13 9 p5 5 9 chloroflexi p1 5 0 p2 5 2 p3 8 3 p4 13 6 p5 13 2 the results showed that the abundance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the bioreactor was higher at p3 p5 these changes were directly related to the performance of the mpsr process in terms of organic matter and nutrient removal and residual sludge reduction in particular proteobacteria whose abundance correlated well with the performance of mpsr for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as well as sludge reduction table 4 shows the main functional bacteria responsible for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as well as sludge reduction at the genus level during p1 to p5 to analyze the functions of microbial population dynamics effectively bacterial populations associated with biotrophic removal could be classified at the generic level into four categories nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospira nitrosomonas denitrifying bacteria denitratisoma zoogloea phosphorus accumulating organisms aeromonas denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms tetrasphaera during the experiment a more stable anaerobic zone was established in the central region of the mpsr by increasing the mlss concentration and this change provided conditions for the growth of some microorganisms among the above bacteria aeromonas p1 0 77 p2 0 58 p3 1 10 p4 1 87 p5 0 04 and tetrasphaera p1 3 17 p2 4 30 p3 8 15 p4 4 98 p5 1 87 were the major phosphorus removing genera in p1 to p5 the relative abundance of these genera corresponded to the tp removal results also tetrasphaera has denitrification capacity and it was the dominant denitrifying genus of the system candidatus competibacter contributed to reduce nitrate to nitrite thus supporting the anoxic activity of pao which facilitated the nitrogen and phosphorus removal the other genera zoogloea 5 43 denitratisoma 0 91 nitrospira 1 28 nitrosomonas 0 77 associated with nitrogen removal had the highest relative abundance at p5 these genera guarantee the denitrification performance of p5 from the perspective of sludge reduction sludge reduction in mpsr was achieved by enriching microorganisms with hydrolytic fermentative slow growing and predatory functions among them tetrasphaera and denitratisoma were the dominant slow growing bacteria candidatus competibacter phaeodactylibacte and zoogloea were the dominant hydrolytic bacteria and tetrasphaera was the dominant fermentative bacteria a strong correlation between the relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria and sludge reduction was observed therefore in addition to the additional energy consumption caused by the hight mlss concentration cryptogenic growth might be the main reason for the higher sludge reduction in p3 and p4 because the dissolution of biomass and hydrolysis of particulate organic matter pom are rate limiting steps in the dissolution cryptogenic growth process and the increased efficiency of pom conversion to the dissolved form can lead to an overall reduction in sludge production 49 this was confirmed by the higher relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria spp in p3 and p4 3 4 3 potential role of functional genes and metabolic pathways in activated sludge processes nutrient removal and sludge reduction are closely related to microbial metabolism previous studies had shown that intracellular material could be completely metabolized to water and carbon dioxide through endogenous metabolic processes which reduces biomass production 50 during denitrification genes associated with denitrification e g nirk norb and nosz were closely associated with organic metabolism and nutrient removal as well as in situ sludge reduction and their presence promoted a relatively complete endogenous denitrification process in the system leading to more efficient uptake of substrates released by cell lysis thus the denitrification metabolic pathways of the bacterial communities in p1 to p5 were analyzed based on the kegg database the abundance of nitrite reductase gene nirk nitric oxide reductase gene norb and nitrous oxide reductase gene nosz is shown in fig 7 b the abundance of

removal through endogenous metabolism is important in the wastewater treatment process 51 in the nitrate reduction process nitrate reduction could be divided into anabolic nitrate reduction anr and dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnr 52 fig 7 c illustrates the nitrogen metabolic pathway in the mpsr the functional genes associated with dnr narghi napab nirbd nrfa and anr nasa narb nira under different mlss concentration were quantified and compared fig 7 d the total abundance of dnr was significantly greater compared to anr suggesting that dnr was the main denitrification pathway for mpsr

nitrogen was removed through the metabolic pathway of the dnr rather than being used for cell synthesis in conclusion appropriate mlss concentrations provided additional opportunities for in situ sludge reduction by affecting the positive regulation of potential gene function and increased abundance of gene expression 4 conclusion in the experiment five groups of mpsr systems with different mlss concentration controls were used to treat the simulated wastewater the mean values of mlss concentration were 4 14 6 05 7 98 11 45 and 14 46 g l p1 p5 the main conclusions of the experiment are as follows 1 a more stable anoxic aerobic zone was established in the central region of the mpsr by increasing the biomass concentration which contributed to improved microbial activity and organic matter metabolism for more efficient nitrogen removal and sludge reduction 2 7 98 11 45 g l was the optimum mlss concentration for mpsr at the average mlss concentrations of 7 98 g l and 11 45 g l the tp and tn removal efficiencies were improved by 2 27 and 14 51 and 1 79 and 8 31 respectively and the remaining sludge volume was reduced by 27 and 21 respectively 3 the value of dehydrogenase activity was positively correlated with sludge reduction and higher dehydrogenase activity facilitated the hydrolysis of eps which in turn contributed to sludge reduction 4 microbial species analysis showed that the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria spp candidatus competibacter phaeodactylibacte zoogloea was the key to further sludge reduction and the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria zoogloea denitratisoma and phosphorus accumulating organisms tetrasphaera aeromonas was the key to improve the denitrification and phosphorus removal performance of the system 5 analysis of the denitrification metabolic pathway showed that the abundance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes as a percentage of total nitrate reduction genes was increasedfor more efficient sludge reduction by optimizing the

12717,this work developed and applied a cuo impregnated bauxite hollow fibre membrane bhfm using hydrothermal method for bisphenol a bpa photodegradation bhfm was synthesized through a phase inversion method at optimum sintering at 1300 c subsequently the physico chemical properties of cuo coated bhfm were characterized while its performance for the bpa degradation was investigated at varying time of hydrothermal exposure and compared to ceramic hollow fibre membrane from alumina ahfm as control and commercial membranes oxidation by products resulting from bpa photodegradation were identified and after treatment the saturated membrane was regenerated to sustain its cost effectiveness as compared to the pristine bhfm membrane we found that functionalizating bhfm surface with cuo significantly improved its mechanical strength by 130 from 18 5 to 42 5 mpa the removal of bpa was enhanced with the increasing hydrothermal time to 5 h due to the even distribution of cuo impregnated bhmf on its membrane surface 97 of bpa removal with 10 mg l concentration was substantially attained by the same cuo impregnated bhfm under visible light vis irradiation treated effluents resulting from the bpa photocatalysis could meet the required effluent limit of 20 mg l set by national legislation the possible oxidation by products cover 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol and dihydroxybenzene with 25 of efficiency the saturated cuo impregnated bhmf was subsequently regenerated for consecutive five cycles this implies that functionalizing bhmf surface with cuo enabled it to possess outstanding stability and removal performance for treatment of bpa laden wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane filtration photocatalysis physico chemical treatment xenobiotics recalcitrant compound data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past years water pollution due to xenobiotic such as bisphenol a bpa has become one of the most serious environmental problems worldwide its trace concentration ranges from 0 01 to 13 μg l as the xenobiotic possesses serious hazards to aquatic environment bpa laden contaminated water needs to be treated using state of the art of environmental technologies recently scientists have tested environmental technologies such as coagulation and flocculation cf 1 and adsorption 2 to treat bpa contaminated water each has its own limitations despite cf is cost effective to treat the contaminated wastewater its application has drawbacks due to the additional operational cost caused by sludge generation 3 in spite of its applicability adsorption treatment could not generate treated effluents that meet the requirement of discharge standard limit 4 therefore there is a growing need to deal with the remediation of bpa contaminated wastewater while contributing to the 2030 un sustainable development goals no 6 clean water and sanitation 5 to mitigate undesirable impacts on the aquatic environment recent advances in materials sciences have further promoted interests among water scientists in functional materials for water treatment 6 their applications for advanced oxidation process aop based water treatment facilitate the degradation of target pollutant in aqueous solutions through the formation of oh 7 the radicals indiscriminately mineralize the pollutant rapidly into smaller and more biodegradable oxidation by products 8 to optimize wastewater treatment using ceramic membranes the search for various raw materials from non conventional sources has intensified recently to promote circular economy ce in wastewater treatment industrial waste such as bauxite fly ash or mud from cyclone laundries has been explored to valorize the unused waste into value added composites functional hollow fibre membrane derived from bauxite represent integrated parts of sustainability solutions to protect the environment the bhfm pristine exhibits outstanding stability under highly acidic and basic environment its unique characteristics could give an anti fouling resistance toward micro organisms the presence of cuo in the bauxite strengthens its ability for self cleaning morphologically the macrostructure of bhfm consists of two void structures that are sponge like as they undergo through a phase inversion process 9 according to ismail et al 10 fabricated bhfm possessed crystalline phase of mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 00 005 0143 with minor traces of fe2o3 11 the existence of fe2o3 in the bauxite was beneficial to photocatalysis esham et al 2019 a study undertaken by li et al 12 reported that the calcination of bauxite at high temperature altered its composition al2o3 81 fe2o3 3 respectively the ftir spectra indicated that the fe o peak was present in the sintered bhfm as fe2o3 was a major component in bauxite 13 15 to reflect the technological value of the work hybridization strategies that incorporate ceramic membrane and catalytic oxidation have been explored to decrease treatment cost and to enhance treatment efficiency the two key issues in the industrial application of ceramic membranes to make them ceramic highly efficient and economically attractive for treatment of contaminated water laden with trace pollutants their surface needs to be impregnated with metal oxide such as cuo due to its outstanding oxidation ability 16 and high surface area 17 cuo was selected as an ideal metal doping to modify the physico chemical properties of the bhfm for photocatalytic degradation under uv vis irradiation shao et al 2018 because of the difference between their conduction band c b and valence band v b this transferred photo generated electron and hole on the cuo of c b an increasing content of cuo in the bhfm may decrease the electron hole recombination rate 18 and shift absorption to a longer wavelength 19 convenience in changing its oxidation state makes the cuo play roles in redox through catalytic mechanisms under visible light the metal oxide may act as electron hole trappers by creating energy levels in the band gap and increasing the charge carrier lifetimes while avoiding recombination enhancing the treatment performance of the adsorbent 20 because of the presence of unpaired electrons the cu2 reacts with ho2 and o2 while keeping its surface functionality remains we uncover the novelty of cuo impregnated bhfm by adding technological values to it for photocatalytic degradation of bpa in aqueous solutions in spite of its promising performance for wastewater treatment to the best of our knowledge no study has studied the effects of impregnating bhfm with cuo on its membrane surface in this study we developed and applied cuo impregnated bauxite hollow fibre membrane bhfm using hydrothermal method for bisphenol a bpa photodegradation by choosing this material we intent to develop photocatalytic ceramic membrane which able to undergo photocatalysis under visible light to fulfill the goal the characterization of cuo bhfm synthesized at different hydrothermal exposure time and the performance of bpa using the fabricated membrane were carried out this fabricated membrane possessed hybrid function where the removal of bpa can be achieved through photocatalysis and microfiltration simultaneously by using a unit of membrane in addition a comparative study with respect to the degradation rate of bpa between this study and previous studies was conducted the mechanism of bpa photodegradation by cuo bhfm and its oxidation by product were presented and identified it is expected that treated effluents resulting from the photocatalytic degradation of bpa would meet the requirement of effluent limit set by national legislation eventually this work promotes ce applications in water treatment by minimizing the disposal of unused non organic waste such as bauxite into local landfills and contributes to global climate change mitigation through resource recovery that reduces greenhouse gas ghg emission into the atmosphere 2 material and methods 2 1 materials sieved bauxite powder of 50 μm n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp polyethersulfone pes and arlacel p135 were supplied by aras kuasa merck solvay advanced polymers and uniqema respectively they were used as ceramic particle solvent binder and dispersant respectively distilled water was used as coagulant during ceramic extrusion for hydrothermal reactions cu no3 2 3h2o and naoh were obtained from sigma aldrich bpa was selected as a model of endocrine disruptor compound edc for photocatalytic degradation 2 2 methods 2 2 1 fabrication of hollow fibre membrane bhfm bhfm and ahfm 50 w w were produced by homogenously mixing bauxite powder for bhfm alumina powder for ahfm nmp 42 75 w w pes 6 25 w w and arlacel p135 1 w w to form a bauxite suspension the degassed suspension was then extruded through a phase inversion technique at 9 ml min of flow rate while it was also extruded at 10 ml min for internal coagulant via tube in orifice spinneret with internal diameter id of 1 2 mm and outer diameter od of 2 8 mm directly into an external coagulant bath with 5 cm of air gap the bhfm precursor was subsequently immersed in the external coagulation bath overnight to complete the phase inversion process before drying at ambient temperature before further modification both the bhfm and ahfm precursors were subjected to a sintering process at 1300 c in a tubular furnace magna value xl 1700 using the same sintering profile from the previous work 21 2 2 2 cuo synthesis and its impregnation on the surface of bhfm cuo nanoparticles nps were synthesized based on a hydrothermal route in presence of naoh initially 0 2 m cu no3 2 3h2o and copper precursor solution were mixed in a reactor after adding 0 2 m naoh into the mixture under continuous stirring the solution was transferred into a 60 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave about 15 cm of bhfm was transferred into the solution and underwent a hydrothermal process at varying time 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h the autoclave was maintained at 150 c for 2 5 h to 7 5 h and then cooled to ambient temperature the obtained precipitate on the surface of bhfm was repeatedly washed with double distilled water before being washed ethanol to remove any impurities without affecting the cuo loading all the samples of cuo bhfm were preserved in a desiccator for further use 2 2 3 characterization of cuo bhfm composite the morphology of cuo nanoparticles on the outer membrane surface of the bhfm support were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem model hitachi tm 3000 japan at varying magnifications cuo bhfm was cut neatly to obtain its cross section and placed on metal holder before being sputter coated with gold under vacuum for 3 min the distribution of the same sample was analyzed using energy dispersive x ray edx whereas the atomic force microscope afm model se 100 park system us was applied to observe the roughness of the cuo bhfm s surface the presence of the crystalline phase of cuo on the outer surface of cuo bhfm was detected by x ray diffractometer xrd model rigaku smartlan x ray japan the wettability of cuo bhfm was also characterized by a contact angle measurement based on sessile drop method dataphysics oca 15ec and deionized water was used as its contact droplet the average contact angle was calculated based on ten measurements obtained from different spots of the membrane ultrafiltration uf system in the cross flow filtration mode was used to determine water permeability of cuo bhfm with a length ranging from 3 to 4 cm at 3 bar of pressure under ambient temperature before undertaking any measurement it is vital to ensure that the reading was stable before compacting the cuo bhfm with water as the feed at 1 5 bar for about 30 min the water permeation of the cuo bhfm was calculated based on the eq 1 1 l p v a m t p where lp and δv are the water permeation l m2 h bar and the volume of water permeated through the membrane l respectively while am and δt represent the effective membrane area m2 and the permeation time h and δp is the transmembrane pressure bar the average water permeation was measured from three measurements for each membrane sample 2 2 4 bpa photodegradation using cuo bhfm a batch submerged ceramic photocatalytic membrane reactor was used to evaluate the efficiency of bpa photodegradation under ambient temperature fig 1 the submerged system consisted of membrane modules fitted in a photoreactor system and a beaker a 10 l perspex tank which served as the body of the submerged system was covered with aluminium foil to prevent the uv irradiation from interfering the visible light bulb led flood light model ip65 100 w was turned on to initiate photocatalysis aeration was provided using an air compressor with 2 l min of air bubble flow rate bpa was used as a model compound for evaluating the technical applicability of photocatalysis by cuo bhfm under visible irradiation varying bpa concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 mg l were studied ten units of the cuo bhfm with 10 15 cm of length were pot in the membrane reservoir prior to bpa photocatalysis using a submerged system periodically the samples were collected from a feed tank permeation rate was evaluated every 30 min for permeation of the feed a peristaltic pump model masterflex l s cole palmer instruments was used to create 15 cm hg vacuum pressure at the permeate end of membrane module with 0 1 l min before undergoing tests bpa was oxygenated in the dark situation for 2 h to attain adsorption desorption equilibrium about 10 ml of aliquot was collected as a blank sample prior to visible light irradiation subsequently the remaining solution was irradiated under visible light for 30 min the lamp was placed in the middle of the reactor about 10 ml of treated aliquot was collected periodically throughout the experiment for chemical analysis of the remaining bpa concentration using hplc model agilent technologies 1260 usa coupled with a uv detector the mobile phase used was acetonitrile a hplc grade water b in gradient mode the column was maintained at room temperature the sample injection volume was injected in triplicate and peak measurement was done at ambient temperature using identifying intermediate compounds at 278 nm 2 2 5 regeneration of cuo bhfm the antifouling performance and reusability test of bhfm were investigated using spmr to sustain its cost effectiveness the cuo bhmf was regenerated for bpa photodegradation freshly prepared bpa solution was used in every cycle to maintain the concentration of feed tank each cycles lasted up to 300 min where samples were collected periodically the length of membrane module was set at 10 cm the fabricated membranes were fitted into pvc modules and potted using epoxy resin epoxy resin was used to prevent water leakage at the permeate end the feed was allowed to be adsorbed on membrane for 30 min after the adsorption time has lapsed during regeneration the membranes were repeatedly washed for 30 min without applying pressure after the membranes were used for bpa photodegradation the rejection rate was determined based on the eq 2 2 f r f i f w 100 where fr is the flux recovery rate while fi and fw are the initial and final bpa flux ml 2 2 6 toxicity analysis microtox tests were conducted using the basic text method which is intended for use with materials of low to medium toxicity the response of toxicity is assessed as a change in luminescence of the bacterium vibrio fischeri the vials containing bpa synthetic wastewater had microtox acute reagent with bacteria added to them to obtain toxicity blank values initial measurements were made using just bacteria the toxicity of the samples was connected with the measured light and information was generated to calculate the ec50 values both after 5 min and after 15 min all samples were subjected to a screening test in the initial phase undiluted samples were tested for toxicity according to the presumption the sample is considered non toxic when the toxic effect pe is 20 when compared to the control 2 2 7 leaching compound detection copper leaching analysis of the degraded bpa water sample using cuo bhfm was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission icp oes spectrometry model 710 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa bpa permeate was used as test ample to ensure that there was no copper leaching was occurred during the photocatalysis of bpa using cuo bhfm all selected spectral lines for icp oes were free of interference the sample and calibration solutions were prepared in the same media which reduced background emission 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cuo bhfm the morphology of cuo nanoparticles on the surface bhfm was analyzed using sem fig 2 as compared to the pristine membrane the surface of the bhfm was covered with a layer of cuo particles homogeneous defect was observed with average thickness of coating layer for 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h of hydrothermal exposure was 0 2 0 7 and 1 2 μm respectively a strong affinity of cuo particle toward ceramic support after hydrothermal treatment was observed 22 since the substrate is highly porous in nature and fall in the microfiltration range thus there is possibility of cuo nanoparticles penetrate into the pores of the substrate the elemental composition on the outer surface of cuo bhfm was analyzed using edx fig 3 the chemical composition of the cuo bhfm is presented in table 1 the elements on the outer membrane surface of cuo bhfm were al and fe for membrane while cu and o were for the nanoparticles at 2 5 h of hydrothermal exposure only a small amount of cuo nanorods grow on the bhfm surface however the thickness of the nanorods increased with the increasing hydrothermal time as the reaction time increased to 5 0 h the fraction of cuo nanorods indicating an increasing nanorods loading resulted in the proper distribution of cuo on the membrane a good distribution of cuo on the top layer of membrane was crucial as they were consistently exposed to the vis during the photo degradation of bpa the xrd patterns of the cuo bhfm 5 0 h and the pristine bhfm presented in fig 4 confirmed the crystallinity of the membrane after hydrothermal exposure the decorated cuo bhfm exhibited sharp and firm peaks with a higher peak intensity than the bauxite support this finding was in agreement to that of yoo et al 23 who found that different peaks existed because of the d spacing values of cuo originated from alumina support tube diffraction pattern also confirmed the crystallinity of the cuo bhfm that encompassed a monoclinic crystalline phase the diffractions were in agreement with the formation of the cuo bhfm and matched with the jcpds file no 45 0937 24 the pattern revealed the mixed phase of cuo at a peak of 2θ 58 2 however a low cuo intensity was observed this might be due to the disruption of crystal symmetry by cuo contents which minimized the differences between the diffraction pattern of cuo and other elements shen et al 2005 the contact angle mechanical strength and water flux of pristine membrane and cuo bhfm were measured table 2 the contact angle of cuo bhfm increased slightly increasing trends of 52 3 62 9 and 72 0 were observed with increasing hydrothermal exposure from 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h respectively a similar trend was reported by hubadillah et al 25 who found that the increasing angle of water droplet was attributed to the agglomerate nanoparticles on the membrane s surface this resulted from the combination of nano micro hierarchical and re entrant structures on the cuo bhfm surfaces with the increasing time of hydrothermal exposure 26 the mechanical strength of the cuo bhfm increased from 18 5 34 6 38 8 and 42 5 mpa for cuo bhfm synthesized at hydrothermal exposure of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h respectively with the 7 5 h having the highest mechanical strength in addition the water flux of the cuo bhfm decreased with the increasing hydrothermal exposure on the membrane surface this was attributed to the fact that the cuo layer significantly reduced the pore size of the ceramic membrane although a membrane with the highest mechanical strength value was desirable a thicker membrane gave a low flux gitis and rothenberg 27 reported that a thicker membrane not only was strong and stable but also resistant to transmembrane flow about 5 0 h of hydrothermal exposure was the optimum reaction time for bhfm modification as the particles were evenly distributed on the membrane surface for this reason the performance of cuo bhfm at 5 0 h of hydrothermal exposure was selected for photocatalytic degradation of bpa at varying concentrations 3 2 photodegradation of bpa using cuo bhfm among the semiconductor materials cuo nanostructure has unique magnetic and superhydrophobic properties furthermore these nanostructures showed promising applications in heterogeneous catalysis in the complete conversion of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide cuo crystal has a monoclinic structure and belongs to the c6 2h symmetry cuo has four formula units per cell unit the coordination number of the copper atom is 4 which it is connected to four neighboring oxygen atoms in a plane configuration approximately rectangular on the plane 110 in all crystallized solids the divalent copper environment is always highly distorted by the strong john teller effect which often leads to more stable rectangular groups the o atoms coordinate into four cu atoms in the form of a distorted tetrahedron it is generally accepted that cuo has a mixture of ionic and covalent bonds although the oxidation state of cu in cuo is undoubtedly cu2 the schematic diagram on the how photocatalysis reaction of cuo took place is per fig 5 the illustration of interfacing between desorbed species on the surface of semiconductor and charge carrier above can be explained as a series of complex reactions reactions 1 1 1 12 this reaction is called heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction as it involves the application of semiconductor photocatalyst in the reaction reaction 1 1 represents the formation of the charge carriers upon the illumination of cuo if these generated charge carriers are not involved

a ads cuo a ads bpa has been the subject of considerable aquatic toxicity testing in recent years and its concentration ranged from 10 to 30 mg l and correlated with the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs of bpa in asia 28 was used in this study since the aquatic environment could receive discharges of bpa from production processing and sewage treatment plant effluents most research on toxicity to wildlife has focused on aquatic organisms in comparison to the allowable standard the finding based species sensitivity distribution ssd based no effect concentration for aquatic communities was used to evaluate the risk assessments 29 the toxicity study of bpa was tabulated as in supplementary table t1 thus comprehensive understanding the cuo particle s adverse effects and the mechanisms of their action are of great importance to assess the environmental risk of this material the degradation of bpa was conducted using 5 0 h cuo bhfm for 6 h under vis irradiation the finding was compared to the pristine bhfm as a control set and alumina hollow fibre membrane ahfm a representative for commercial ceramic hollow fibre membrane under visible light irradiation cuo bhfm controlled the degradation rate as cuo particles had a narrow band gap this allowed the cuo bhfm to perform under vis irradiation fig 6 shows that 93 of bpa degradation was achieved by cuo bhfm with initial bpa concentration of 10 mg l the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased with the increasing bpa concentration a comparison of bpa removal was made between these pristine bhfm cuo bhfm and cuo ahfm this reveals that cuo bhfm controlled the bpa degradation after 6 h under vis irradiation of which cuo ahfm attained the lowest bpa degradation the addition of cuo on the surface of bhfm facilitated the formation of reactive oxygenated species ros enhancing the bpa degradation by the cuo bhfm fig 7 shows that the cuo impregnated bhfm exhibited excellent bpa degradation as this modified membrane could remove 93 of bpa while the pristine ahfm had the lowest degradation rate of 16 under the same optimized conditions the lowest bpa removal using ahfm corresponded to the existing membrane which main component was alumina that did not possess photocatalytic features on the other hand the presence of cu in the bauxite facilitated the fabricated cuo bhfm to have outstanding photocatalytic property the addition of decorated cuo on the surface enhanced the capability of the cuo bhfm for photocatalysis purposes previous study done by ismail et al 10 showed that low degradation of 10 mg l bpa approximately 62 was observed when the photocatalysis was conducted under visible light as the bpa concentration increase gradually up to 30 mg l the degradation percentage becomes lower than 62 similar pattern on bpa concentration versus rate of degradation was displayed when the activity was conducted under uv light irradiation however the findings clearly indicated that fabricated bhfm was preferable to uv light irradiation as high removal of bpa was attributed to the presence of the mixed anatase rutile crystalline phase 30 the degradation of bpa using bhfm can be improved through membrane s surface modification to enhance the capability of bhfm as novel photocatalytic ceramic hollow fibre membrane to ensure that the bpa degradation was occurred due to photocatalysis the degradation test was done using both cuo ahfm and cuo bhfm in the dark condition was carried out as in supplementary figure fig s1 all batch experiments were performed triplicate and the means of three data sets were reported in order to ensure the accuracy dependability and repeatability of the obtained data since the relative standard deviation was 1 0 almost always the data s accuracy was quite good the data were ignored when the relative error went beyond this threshold and a third experiment was run until the relative error was within acceptable bounds thus it can be concluded that the degradation of bpa in this study was most contributed through photocatalysis and less significant on other reaction such as catalysis or adsorption 3 3 identification of intermediate compounds the generation of reactive oxygen species ros through electron s photoexcitation during photocatalysis has contributed to the bpa removal and formation of intermediate compound such as phenolic and carboxylic intermediates which might be more toxic than the starting compound their presence was analyzed by hplc according to their retention times and uv spectra the hplc chromatogram for bpa degradation in aqueous solution under degradation conditions of 10 mg l of bpa for 360 min under visible light has been carried out in this study and the data is illustrated in fig 8 based on the finding it can be seen that there are several common peaks at the retention times of 2 25 min 2 61 min 3 09 min and 6 34 min there were four possible by product detected namely 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol dihydroxybenzene and parent bpa as reported by neamţu and frimmel 31 these peaks represent the formation of by products of bpa these products also decreased with time due to the decomposition to co2 and h2o and this was attributed to the fast adsorption and further degradation of the intermediates on the catalyst surface 32 3 4 reusability of saturated cuo bhfm cuo bhfm was subjected to dynamic photocatalytic filtration for 5 different cycles with visible light exposure between the intervals this was conducted to study the recyclability of membrane and its anti fouling capabilities the membranes were exposed under visible light irradiation for 30 min between every cycle interval fig 9 shows the flux of cuo bhfm for photocatalytic filtration after 5 different cycles under visible light irradiation when membrane technology is applied in treatment of effluent laden with organic pollutant a persistent problem that hinders membrane usability is fouling fouling occurs when foreign molecules attach on membrane surface and pores which compromise membrane rejection and permeability over time it is showed that there was a significant drop in membrane flux during each cycle each cycle exhibited a flux drop of 28 7 17 7 35 9 and 18 6 respectively however when membrane was exposed under visible light it was able to recover its flux for the subsequent four cycles since cuo bhfm exhibited good hydrophilic properties based on contact angle results the attachment of foulants can be mitigated by visible light treatment for some periods furthermore by preventing the buildup of a cake layer on the membrane surface the photocatalytic activity that occurs on the membrane surface as a result of the presence of the photocatalyst may also reduce fouling the non selective oxidation and reduction of bpa bound to membrane surfaces is made possible by the highly reactive electron hole pair on the photocatalyst surface which also causes surface redox reaction the flux recovery is consistent with previous studies that found that incorporating photocatalysis to membranes at the surface of bhfm can provide them self cleaning capabilities as was also observed in this work 33 this surface redox also affects the entire rejection characteristics of the membrane fig 10 displays the cuo bhfm s 5 cycle rejection performance when exposed to visible light the membrane showed a slight improvement in membrane rejection over time during dynamic photocatalytic filtration for cycles 1 2 3 and 4 the increase in rejection between 0 and 360 s is 10 0 16 7 8 37 and 21 8 respectively continuous contact between the photocatalyst in the membrane and the feed solution occurs when dynamic photocatalytic filtration is used and this can cause photocatalytic degradation additionally in the continuous degradation experiment this rise could be explained by the feed solution s ability to permeate through the membrane which increased the interaction between the photocatalyst and pollutant the results indicate that the membrane can exhibit consistent rejection performance under four different dynamic filtration cycles which parallel to the fact that the membrane flux did not exhibit a significant drop 3 5 ecotoxicological by products it is well recognized that the principal disadvantage of oxidation technologies is the potential for the production of unintended chemicals that may be even more harmful than the parent molecules although certain organic by products have also been identified earlier research on the removal of bpa using cuo bhfm indicates that the main danger is the production of inorganic by products the development of by products following this edc elimination however has not been widely described in the first stage of the sorption materials and their mixtures analysis was used screening test the ph of all samples was adjusted to neutral value samples of bpa wastewater characterized pe value below 20 fig 11 which they were considered as non toxic table 3 since only samples showing the effect of toxic pe 20 were subjected to further analysis of basic test 2 thus no further analysis on this test was conducted 3 6 leaching test the leaching of copper element from the membrane into the treated bpa water sample was investigated during the treatment process there was almost none significant trace of copper in the water sample as per table 4 indicating that there is no copper leaching from the membrane it is important to mitigate copper leaching in order to avoid disrupting ecosystem balance and to ensure that the membrane could work ideally without losing any photocatalyst particles that could impact its photocatalytic activity copper leaching is common for cuo zno matrices 34 however in this study there was no zinc compound was used thus the leaching of copper was not detected hence the cuo bhfm is an safe and ideal membrane to be used for further application in the environment 4 conclusion this study has demonstrated the technical feasibility of cuo bhfm for bpa photodegradation as compared to the pristine bhfm membrane we found that functionalizating bhfm surface with cuo significantly improved its mechanical strength by 130 from 18 5 to 42 5 mpa the removal of bpa was enhanced with the increasing hydrothermal time to 5 h due to the even distribution of cuo impregnated bhmf on its membrane surface at optimized conditions ph 7 0 dose 5 0 g l about 97 of bpa removal with 10 mg l of its initial concentration was substantially attained by the same cuo impregnated bhfm under visible light vis irradiation treated effluents resulting from the bpa photocatalysis could meet the required effluent limit of 20 mg l set by national legislation possible oxidation by products cover 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol and dihydroxybenzene with 25 of efficiency the saturated cuo impregnated bhmf was subsequently regenerated for consecutive five cycles this implies that functionalizing bhmf surface with cuo enabled it to possess outstanding stability and removal performance for treatment of bpa laden

12717,this work developed and applied a cuo impregnated bauxite hollow fibre membrane bhfm using hydrothermal method for bisphenol a bpa photodegradation bhfm was synthesized through a phase inversion method at optimum sintering at 1300 c subsequently the physico chemical properties of cuo coated bhfm were characterized while its performance for the bpa degradation was investigated at varying time of hydrothermal exposure and compared to ceramic hollow fibre membrane from alumina ahfm as control and commercial membranes oxidation by products resulting from bpa photodegradation were identified and after treatment the saturated membrane was regenerated to sustain its cost effectiveness as compared to the pristine bhfm membrane we found that functionalizating bhfm surface with cuo significantly improved its mechanical strength by 130 from 18 5 to 42 5 mpa the removal of bpa was enhanced with the increasing hydrothermal time to 5 h due to the even distribution of cuo impregnated bhmf on its membrane surface 97 of bpa removal with 10 mg l concentration was substantially attained by the same cuo impregnated bhfm under visible light vis irradiation treated effluents resulting from the bpa photocatalysis could meet the required effluent limit of 20 mg l set by national legislation the possible oxidation by products cover 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol and dihydroxybenzene with 25 of efficiency the saturated cuo impregnated bhmf was subsequently regenerated for consecutive five cycles this implies that functionalizing bhmf surface with cuo enabled it to possess outstanding stability and removal performance for treatment of bpa laden wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords membrane filtration photocatalysis physico chemical treatment xenobiotics recalcitrant compound data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the past years water pollution due to xenobiotic such as bisphenol a bpa has become one of the most serious environmental problems worldwide its trace concentration ranges from 0 01 to 13 μg l as the xenobiotic possesses serious hazards to aquatic environment bpa laden contaminated water needs to be treated using state of the art of environmental technologies recently scientists have tested environmental technologies such as coagulation and flocculation cf 1 and adsorption 2 to treat bpa contaminated water each has its own limitations despite cf is cost effective to treat the contaminated wastewater its application has drawbacks due to the additional operational cost caused by sludge generation 3 in spite of its applicability adsorption treatment could not generate treated effluents that meet the requirement of discharge standard limit 4 therefore there is a growing need to deal with the remediation of bpa contaminated wastewater while contributing to the 2030 un sustainable development goals no 6 clean water and sanitation 5 to mitigate undesirable impacts on the aquatic environment recent advances in materials sciences have further promoted interests among water scientists in functional materials for water treatment 6 their applications for advanced oxidation process aop based water treatment facilitate the degradation of target pollutant in aqueous solutions through the formation of oh 7 the radicals indiscriminately mineralize the pollutant rapidly into smaller and more biodegradable oxidation by products 8 to optimize wastewater treatment using ceramic membranes the search for various raw materials from non conventional sources has intensified recently to promote circular economy ce in wastewater treatment industrial waste such as bauxite fly ash or mud from cyclone laundries has been explored to valorize the unused waste into value added composites functional hollow fibre membrane derived from bauxite represent integrated parts of sustainability solutions to protect the environment the bhfm pristine exhibits outstanding stability under highly acidic and basic environment its unique characteristics could give an anti fouling resistance toward micro organisms the presence of cuo in the bauxite strengthens its ability for self cleaning morphologically the macrostructure of bhfm consists of two void structures that are sponge like as they undergo through a phase inversion process 9 according to ismail et al 10 fabricated bhfm possessed crystalline phase of mullite 3al2o3 2sio2 00 005 0143 with minor traces of fe2o3 11 the existence of fe2o3 in the bauxite was beneficial to photocatalysis esham et al 2019 a study undertaken by li et al 12 reported that the calcination of bauxite at high temperature altered its composition al2o3 81 fe2o3 3 respectively the ftir spectra indicated that the fe o peak was present in the sintered bhfm as fe2o3 was a major component in bauxite 13 15 to reflect the technological value of the work hybridization strategies that incorporate ceramic membrane and catalytic oxidation have been explored to decrease treatment cost and to enhance treatment efficiency the two key issues in the industrial application of ceramic membranes to make them ceramic highly efficient and economically attractive for treatment of contaminated water laden with trace pollutants their surface needs to be impregnated with metal oxide such as cuo due to its outstanding oxidation ability 16 and high surface area 17 cuo was selected as an ideal metal doping to modify the physico chemical properties of the bhfm for photocatalytic degradation under uv vis irradiation shao et al 2018 because of the difference between their conduction band c b and valence band v b this transferred photo generated electron and hole on the cuo of c b an increasing content of cuo in the bhfm may decrease the electron hole recombination rate 18 and shift absorption to a longer wavelength 19 convenience in changing its oxidation state makes the cuo play roles in redox through catalytic mechanisms under visible light the metal oxide may act as electron hole trappers by creating energy levels in the band gap and increasing the charge carrier lifetimes while avoiding recombination enhancing the treatment performance of the adsorbent 20 because of the presence of unpaired electrons the cu2 reacts with ho2 and o2 while keeping its surface functionality remains we uncover the novelty of cuo impregnated bhfm by adding technological values to it for photocatalytic degradation of bpa in aqueous solutions in spite of its promising performance for wastewater treatment to the best of our knowledge no study has studied the effects of impregnating bhfm with cuo on its membrane surface in this study we developed and applied cuo impregnated bauxite hollow fibre membrane bhfm using hydrothermal method for bisphenol a bpa photodegradation by choosing this material we intent to develop photocatalytic ceramic membrane which able to undergo photocatalysis under visible light to fulfill the goal the characterization of cuo bhfm synthesized at different hydrothermal exposure time and the performance of bpa using the fabricated membrane were carried out this fabricated membrane possessed hybrid function where the removal of bpa can be achieved through photocatalysis and microfiltration simultaneously by using a unit of membrane in addition a comparative study with respect to the degradation rate of bpa between this study and previous studies was conducted the mechanism of bpa photodegradation by cuo bhfm and its oxidation by product were presented and identified it is expected that treated effluents resulting from the photocatalytic degradation of bpa would meet the requirement of effluent limit set by national legislation eventually this work promotes ce applications in water treatment by minimizing the disposal of unused non organic waste such as bauxite into local landfills and contributes to global climate change mitigation through resource recovery that reduces greenhouse gas ghg emission into the atmosphere 2 material and methods 2 1 materials sieved bauxite powder of 50 μm n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp polyethersulfone pes and arlacel p135 were supplied by aras kuasa merck solvay advanced polymers and uniqema respectively they were used as ceramic particle solvent binder and dispersant respectively distilled water was used as coagulant during ceramic extrusion for hydrothermal reactions cu no3 2 3h2o and naoh were obtained from sigma aldrich bpa was selected as a model of endocrine disruptor compound edc for photocatalytic degradation 2 2 methods 2 2 1 fabrication of hollow fibre membrane bhfm bhfm and ahfm 50 w w were produced by homogenously mixing bauxite powder for bhfm alumina powder for ahfm nmp 42 75 w w pes 6 25 w w and arlacel p135 1 w w to form a bauxite suspension the degassed suspension was then extruded through a phase inversion technique at 9 ml min of flow rate while it was also extruded at 10 ml min for internal coagulant via tube in orifice spinneret with internal diameter id of 1 2 mm and outer diameter od of 2 8 mm directly into an external coagulant bath with 5 cm of air gap the bhfm precursor was subsequently immersed in the external coagulation bath overnight to complete the phase inversion process before drying at ambient temperature before further modification both the bhfm and ahfm precursors were subjected to a sintering process at 1300 c in a tubular furnace magna value xl 1700 using the same sintering profile from the previous work 21 2 2 2 cuo synthesis and its impregnation on the surface of bhfm cuo nanoparticles nps were synthesized based on a hydrothermal route in presence of naoh initially 0 2 m cu no3 2 3h2o and copper precursor solution were mixed in a reactor after adding 0 2 m naoh into the mixture under continuous stirring the solution was transferred into a 60 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave about 15 cm of bhfm was transferred into the solution and underwent a hydrothermal process at varying time 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h the autoclave was maintained at 150 c for 2 5 h to 7 5 h and then cooled to ambient temperature the obtained precipitate on the surface of bhfm was repeatedly washed with double distilled water before being washed ethanol to remove any impurities without affecting the cuo loading all the samples of cuo bhfm were preserved in a desiccator for further use 2 2 3 characterization of cuo bhfm composite the morphology of cuo nanoparticles on the outer membrane surface of the bhfm support were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope sem model hitachi tm 3000 japan at varying magnifications cuo bhfm was cut neatly to obtain its cross section and placed on metal holder before being sputter coated with gold under vacuum for 3 min the distribution of the same sample was analyzed using energy dispersive x ray edx whereas the atomic force microscope afm model se 100 park system us was applied to observe the roughness of the cuo bhfm s surface the presence of the crystalline phase of cuo on the outer surface of cuo bhfm was detected by x ray diffractometer xrd model rigaku smartlan x ray japan the wettability of cuo bhfm was also characterized by a contact angle measurement based on sessile drop method dataphysics oca 15ec and deionized water was used as its contact droplet the average contact angle was calculated based on ten measurements obtained from different spots of the membrane ultrafiltration uf system in the cross flow filtration mode was used to determine water permeability of cuo bhfm with a length ranging from 3 to 4 cm at 3 bar of pressure under ambient temperature before undertaking any measurement it is vital to ensure that the reading was stable before compacting the cuo bhfm with water as the feed at 1 5 bar for about 30 min the water permeation of the cuo bhfm was calculated based on the eq 1 1 l p v a m t p where lp and δv are the water permeation l m2 h bar and the volume of water permeated through the membrane l respectively while am and δt represent the effective membrane area m2 and the permeation time h and δp is the transmembrane pressure bar the average water permeation was measured from three measurements for each membrane sample 2 2 4 bpa photodegradation using cuo bhfm a batch submerged ceramic photocatalytic membrane reactor was used to evaluate the efficiency of bpa photodegradation under ambient temperature fig 1 the submerged system consisted of membrane modules fitted in a photoreactor system and a beaker a 10 l perspex tank which served as the body of the submerged system was covered with aluminium foil to prevent the uv irradiation from interfering the visible light bulb led flood light model ip65 100 w was turned on to initiate photocatalysis aeration was provided using an air compressor with 2 l min of air bubble flow rate bpa was used as a model compound for evaluating the technical applicability of photocatalysis by cuo bhfm under visible irradiation varying bpa concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 mg l were studied ten units of the cuo bhfm with 10 15 cm of length were pot in the membrane reservoir prior to bpa photocatalysis using a submerged system periodically the samples were collected from a feed tank permeation rate was evaluated every 30 min for permeation of the feed a peristaltic pump model masterflex l s cole palmer instruments was used to create 15 cm hg vacuum pressure at the permeate end of membrane module with 0 1 l min before undergoing tests bpa was oxygenated in the dark situation for 2 h to attain adsorption desorption equilibrium about 10 ml of aliquot was collected as a blank sample prior to visible light irradiation subsequently the remaining solution was irradiated under visible light for 30 min the lamp was placed in the middle of the reactor about 10 ml of treated aliquot was collected periodically throughout the experiment for chemical analysis of the remaining bpa concentration using hplc model agilent technologies 1260 usa coupled with a uv detector the mobile phase used was acetonitrile a hplc grade water b in gradient mode the column was maintained at room temperature the sample injection volume was injected in triplicate and peak measurement was done at ambient temperature using identifying intermediate compounds at 278 nm 2 2 5 regeneration of cuo bhfm the antifouling performance and reusability test of bhfm were investigated using spmr to sustain its cost effectiveness the cuo bhmf was regenerated for bpa photodegradation freshly prepared bpa solution was used in every cycle to maintain the concentration of feed tank each cycles lasted up to 300 min where samples were collected periodically the length of membrane module was set at 10 cm the fabricated membranes were fitted into pvc modules and potted using epoxy resin epoxy resin was used to prevent water leakage at the permeate end the feed was allowed to be adsorbed on membrane for 30 min after the adsorption time has lapsed during regeneration the membranes were repeatedly washed for 30 min without applying pressure after the membranes were used for bpa photodegradation the rejection rate was determined based on the eq 2 2 f r f i f w 100 where fr is the flux recovery rate while fi and fw are the initial and final bpa flux ml 2 2 6 toxicity analysis microtox tests were conducted using the basic text method which is intended for use with materials of low to medium toxicity the response of toxicity is assessed as a change in luminescence of the bacterium vibrio fischeri the vials containing bpa synthetic wastewater had microtox acute reagent with bacteria added to them to obtain toxicity blank values initial measurements were made using just bacteria the toxicity of the samples was connected with the measured light and information was generated to calculate the ec50 values both after 5 min and after 15 min all samples were subjected to a screening test in the initial phase undiluted samples were tested for toxicity according to the presumption the sample is considered non toxic when the toxic effect pe is 20 when compared to the control 2 2 7 leaching compound detection copper leaching analysis of the degraded bpa water sample using cuo bhfm was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission icp oes spectrometry model 710 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa bpa permeate was used as test ample to ensure that there was no copper leaching was occurred during the photocatalysis of bpa using cuo bhfm all selected spectral lines for icp oes were free of interference the sample and calibration solutions were prepared in the same media which reduced background emission 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cuo bhfm the morphology of cuo nanoparticles on the surface bhfm was analyzed using sem fig 2 as compared to the pristine membrane the surface of the bhfm was covered with a layer of cuo particles homogeneous defect was observed with average thickness of coating layer for 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h of hydrothermal exposure was 0 2 0 7 and 1 2 μm respectively a strong affinity of cuo particle toward ceramic support after hydrothermal treatment was observed 22 since the substrate is highly porous in nature and fall in the microfiltration range thus there is possibility of cuo nanoparticles penetrate into the pores of the substrate the elemental composition on the outer surface of cuo bhfm was analyzed using edx fig 3 the chemical composition of the cuo bhfm is presented in table 1 the elements on the outer membrane surface of cuo bhfm were al and fe for membrane while cu and o were for the nanoparticles at 2 5 h of hydrothermal exposure only a small amount of cuo nanorods grow on the bhfm surface however the thickness of the nanorods increased with the increasing hydrothermal time as the reaction time increased to 5 0 h the fraction of cuo nanorods indicating an increasing nanorods loading resulted in the proper distribution of cuo on the membrane a good distribution of cuo on the top layer of membrane was crucial as they were consistently exposed to the vis during the photo degradation of bpa the xrd patterns of the cuo bhfm 5 0 h and the pristine bhfm presented in fig 4 confirmed the crystallinity of the membrane after hydrothermal exposure the decorated cuo bhfm exhibited sharp and firm peaks with a higher peak intensity than the bauxite support this finding was in agreement to that of yoo et al 23 who found that different peaks existed because of the d spacing values of cuo originated from alumina support tube diffraction pattern also confirmed the crystallinity of the cuo bhfm that encompassed a monoclinic crystalline phase the diffractions were in agreement with the formation of the cuo bhfm and matched with the jcpds file no 45 0937 24 the pattern revealed the mixed phase of cuo at a peak of 2θ 58 2 however a low cuo intensity was observed this might be due to the disruption of crystal symmetry by cuo contents which minimized the differences between the diffraction pattern of cuo and other elements shen et al 2005 the contact angle mechanical strength and water flux of pristine membrane and cuo bhfm were measured table 2 the contact angle of cuo bhfm increased slightly increasing trends of 52 3 62 9 and 72 0 were observed with increasing hydrothermal exposure from 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h respectively a similar trend was reported by hubadillah et al 25 who found that the increasing angle of water droplet was attributed to the agglomerate nanoparticles on the membrane s surface this resulted from the combination of nano micro hierarchical and re entrant structures on the cuo bhfm surfaces with the increasing time of hydrothermal exposure 26 the mechanical strength of the cuo bhfm increased from 18 5 34 6 38 8 and 42 5 mpa for cuo bhfm synthesized at hydrothermal exposure of 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 h respectively with the 7 5 h having the highest mechanical strength in addition the water flux of the cuo bhfm decreased with the increasing hydrothermal exposure on the membrane surface this was attributed to the fact that the cuo layer significantly reduced the pore size of the ceramic membrane although a membrane with the highest mechanical strength value was desirable a thicker membrane gave a low flux gitis and rothenberg 27 reported that a thicker membrane not only was strong and stable but also resistant to transmembrane flow about 5 0 h of hydrothermal exposure was the optimum reaction time for bhfm modification as the particles were evenly distributed on the membrane surface for this reason the performance of cuo bhfm at 5 0 h of hydrothermal exposure was selected for photocatalytic degradation of bpa at varying concentrations 3 2 photodegradation of bpa using cuo bhfm among the semiconductor materials cuo nanostructure has unique magnetic and superhydrophobic properties furthermore these nanostructures showed promising applications in heterogeneous catalysis in the complete conversion of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide cuo crystal has a monoclinic structure and belongs to the c6 2h symmetry cuo has four formula units per cell unit the coordination number of the copper atom is 4 which it is connected to four neighboring oxygen atoms in a plane configuration approximately rectangular on the plane 110 in all crystallized solids the divalent copper environment is always highly distorted by the strong john teller effect which often leads to more stable rectangular groups the o atoms coordinate into four cu atoms in the form of a distorted tetrahedron it is generally accepted that cuo has a mixture of ionic and covalent bonds although the oxidation state of cu in cuo is undoubtedly cu2 the schematic diagram on the how photocatalysis reaction of cuo took place is per fig 5 the illustration of interfacing between desorbed species on the surface of semiconductor and charge carrier above can be explained as a series of complex reactions reactions 1 1 1 12 this reaction is called heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction as it involves the application of semiconductor photocatalyst in the reaction reaction 1 1 represents the formation of the charge carriers upon the illumination of cuo if these generated charge carriers are not involved

a ads cuo a ads bpa has been the subject of considerable aquatic toxicity testing in recent years and its concentration ranged from 10 to 30 mg l and correlated with the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs of bpa in asia 28 was used in this study since the aquatic environment could receive discharges of bpa from production processing and sewage treatment plant effluents most research on toxicity to wildlife has focused on aquatic organisms in comparison to the allowable standard the finding based species sensitivity distribution ssd based no effect concentration for aquatic communities was used to evaluate the risk assessments 29 the toxicity study of bpa was tabulated as in supplementary table t1 thus comprehensive understanding the cuo particle s adverse effects and the mechanisms of their action are of great importance to assess the environmental risk of this material the degradation of bpa was conducted using 5 0 h cuo bhfm for 6 h under vis irradiation the finding was compared to the pristine bhfm as a control set and alumina hollow fibre membrane ahfm a representative for commercial ceramic hollow fibre membrane under visible light irradiation cuo bhfm controlled the degradation rate as cuo particles had a narrow band gap this allowed the cuo bhfm to perform under vis irradiation fig 6 shows that 93 of bpa degradation was achieved by cuo bhfm with initial bpa concentration of 10 mg l the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased with the increasing bpa concentration a comparison of bpa removal was made between these pristine bhfm cuo bhfm and cuo ahfm this reveals that cuo bhfm controlled the bpa degradation after 6 h under vis irradiation of which cuo ahfm attained the lowest bpa degradation the addition of cuo on the surface of bhfm facilitated the formation of reactive oxygenated species ros enhancing the bpa degradation by the cuo bhfm fig 7 shows that the cuo impregnated bhfm exhibited excellent bpa degradation as this modified membrane could remove 93 of bpa while the pristine ahfm had the lowest degradation rate of 16 under the same optimized conditions the lowest bpa removal using ahfm corresponded to the existing membrane which main component was alumina that did not possess photocatalytic features on the other hand the presence of cu in the bauxite facilitated the fabricated cuo bhfm to have outstanding photocatalytic property the addition of decorated cuo on the surface enhanced the capability of the cuo bhfm for photocatalysis purposes previous study done by ismail et al 10 showed that low degradation of 10 mg l bpa approximately 62 was observed when the photocatalysis was conducted under visible light as the bpa concentration increase gradually up to 30 mg l the degradation percentage becomes lower than 62 similar pattern on bpa concentration versus rate of degradation was displayed when the activity was conducted under uv light irradiation however the findings clearly indicated that fabricated bhfm was preferable to uv light irradiation as high removal of bpa was attributed to the presence of the mixed anatase rutile crystalline phase 30 the degradation of bpa using bhfm can be improved through membrane s surface modification to enhance the capability of bhfm as novel photocatalytic ceramic hollow fibre membrane to ensure that the bpa degradation was occurred due to photocatalysis the degradation test was done using both cuo ahfm and cuo bhfm in the dark condition was carried out as in supplementary figure fig s1 all batch experiments were performed triplicate and the means of three data sets were reported in order to ensure the accuracy dependability and repeatability of the obtained data since the relative standard deviation was 1 0 almost always the data s accuracy was quite good the data were ignored when the relative error went beyond this threshold and a third experiment was run until the relative error was within acceptable bounds thus it can be concluded that the degradation of bpa in this study was most contributed through photocatalysis and less significant on other reaction such as catalysis or adsorption 3 3 identification of intermediate compounds the generation of reactive oxygen species ros through electron s photoexcitation during photocatalysis has contributed to the bpa removal and formation of intermediate compound such as phenolic and carboxylic intermediates which might be more toxic than the starting compound their presence was analyzed by hplc according to their retention times and uv spectra the hplc chromatogram for bpa degradation in aqueous solution under degradation conditions of 10 mg l of bpa for 360 min under visible light has been carried out in this study and the data is illustrated in fig 8 based on the finding it can be seen that there are several common peaks at the retention times of 2 25 min 2 61 min 3 09 min and 6 34 min there were four possible by product detected namely 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol dihydroxybenzene and parent bpa as reported by neamţu and frimmel 31 these peaks represent the formation of by products of bpa these products also decreased with time due to the decomposition to co2 and h2o and this was attributed to the fast adsorption and further degradation of the intermediates on the catalyst surface 32 3 4 reusability of saturated cuo bhfm cuo bhfm was subjected to dynamic photocatalytic filtration for 5 different cycles with visible light exposure between the intervals this was conducted to study the recyclability of membrane and its anti fouling capabilities the membranes were exposed under visible light irradiation for 30 min between every cycle interval fig 9 shows the flux of cuo bhfm for photocatalytic filtration after 5 different cycles under visible light irradiation when membrane technology is applied in treatment of effluent laden with organic pollutant a persistent problem that hinders membrane usability is fouling fouling occurs when foreign molecules attach on membrane surface and pores which compromise membrane rejection and permeability over time it is showed that there was a significant drop in membrane flux during each cycle each cycle exhibited a flux drop of 28 7 17 7 35 9 and 18 6 respectively however when membrane was exposed under visible light it was able to recover its flux for the subsequent four cycles since cuo bhfm exhibited good hydrophilic properties based on contact angle results the attachment of foulants can be mitigated by visible light treatment for some periods furthermore by preventing the buildup of a cake layer on the membrane surface the photocatalytic activity that occurs on the membrane surface as a result of the presence of the photocatalyst may also reduce fouling the non selective oxidation and reduction of bpa bound to membrane surfaces is made possible by the highly reactive electron hole pair on the photocatalyst surface which also causes surface redox reaction the flux recovery is consistent with previous studies that found that incorporating photocatalysis to membranes at the surface of bhfm can provide them self cleaning capabilities as was also observed in this work 33 this surface redox also affects the entire rejection characteristics of the membrane fig 10 displays the cuo bhfm s 5 cycle rejection performance when exposed to visible light the membrane showed a slight improvement in membrane rejection over time during dynamic photocatalytic filtration for cycles 1 2 3 and 4 the increase in rejection between 0 and 360 s is 10 0 16 7 8 37 and 21 8 respectively continuous contact between the photocatalyst in the membrane and the feed solution occurs when dynamic photocatalytic filtration is used and this can cause photocatalytic degradation additionally in the continuous degradation experiment this rise could be explained by the feed solution s ability to permeate through the membrane which increased the interaction between the photocatalyst and pollutant the results indicate that the membrane can exhibit consistent rejection performance under four different dynamic filtration cycles which parallel to the fact that the membrane flux did not exhibit a significant drop 3 5 ecotoxicological by products it is well recognized that the principal disadvantage of oxidation technologies is the potential for the production of unintended chemicals that may be even more harmful than the parent molecules although certain organic by products have also been identified earlier research on the removal of bpa using cuo bhfm indicates that the main danger is the production of inorganic by products the development of by products following this edc elimination however has not been widely described in the first stage of the sorption materials and their mixtures analysis was used screening test the ph of all samples was adjusted to neutral value samples of bpa wastewater characterized pe value below 20 fig 11 which they were considered as non toxic table 3 since only samples showing the effect of toxic pe 20 were subjected to further analysis of basic test 2 thus no further analysis on this test was conducted 3 6 leaching test the leaching of copper element from the membrane into the treated bpa water sample was investigated during the treatment process there was almost none significant trace of copper in the water sample as per table 4 indicating that there is no copper leaching from the membrane it is important to mitigate copper leaching in order to avoid disrupting ecosystem balance and to ensure that the membrane could work ideally without losing any photocatalyst particles that could impact its photocatalytic activity copper leaching is common for cuo zno matrices 34 however in this study there was no zinc compound was used thus the leaching of copper was not detected hence the cuo bhfm is an safe and ideal membrane to be used for further application in the environment 4 conclusion this study has demonstrated the technical feasibility of cuo bhfm for bpa photodegradation as compared to the pristine bhfm membrane we found that functionalizating bhfm surface with cuo significantly improved its mechanical strength by 130 from 18 5 to 42 5 mpa the removal of bpa was enhanced with the increasing hydrothermal time to 5 h due to the even distribution of cuo impregnated bhmf on its membrane surface at optimized conditions ph 7 0 dose 5 0 g l about 97 of bpa removal with 10 mg l of its initial concentration was substantially attained by the same cuo impregnated bhfm under visible light vis irradiation treated effluents resulting from the bpa photocatalysis could meet the required effluent limit of 20 mg l set by national legislation possible oxidation by products cover 4 2 hydroxy 2 propanol phenol 4 isopropylphenol and dihydroxybenzene with 25 of efficiency the saturated cuo impregnated bhmf was subsequently regenerated for consecutive five cycles this implies that functionalizing bhmf surface with cuo enabled it to possess outstanding stability and removal performance for treatment of bpa laden

12718,as it is well known that wastewater treatment is becoming a global concern the search for advanced intensive oxidation processes with minimal waste generation for wastewater treatment remains a major challenge in the present work the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin cip was studied using the dielectric barrier discharge dbd process the effect of some operating parameters such as cip initial concentration from 1 to 6 mg l air flow rate from 0 to 240 l h and frequency from 350 to 600 hz on dbd performance in term of cip degradation efficiency d has been investigated here as a major result the cip degradation efficiency and the mineralization yield m reached 99 and 49 respectively during 60 min under the obtained optimum experimental conditions an initial concentration of 1 mg l an air flow rate of 100 l h a voltage of 18 kv and a frequency of 350 hz it can be concluded that the dbd process exhibits an eco friendly and great potential for aqueous cip degradation moreover the mechanisms involved in the degradation process by dbd were explained the scavengers study revealed that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals were the basic reactive oxygen species ros in cip degradation process results show that in addition to ros the reactive nitrogen species rns also play a key role in the cip removal process in order to get closer to the real conditions dbd experiments were also carried out in other water matrices tap water tw and synthetic pharmaceutical water sw significant inhibition of cip degradation d and mineralization m was observed in tw d 76 m 33 and sw d 60 m 10 with reference to the cip degradation and mineralization in ultra pure water upw d 99 m 54 after 90 min irradiation it showed that the presence of organic and inorganic molecules in tw and sw lowered the cip degradation efficiency thus the combined plasma photocatalysis system using luminous textile as photocatalyst was performed for the cip degradation in sw in order to get closer to the real conditions leading to 99 of d and 64 of m moreover the use of combined dbd plasma photocatalysis process significantly enhanced the cip degradation performance if compared to each process considered separately overall the combination of dbd and photocatalysis may be a promising technology for economical efficient and environmentally friendly removal of pollutants in wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non thermal plasma photocatalysis combined system wastewater reactive oxygen species reactive nitrogen species data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction current studies prove that pharmaceutical effluents are a lingering type of contaminant in the aquatic environment with increasing health and environmental concerns with their extensive use antibiotics have been detected in the aquatic environment 1 it was pointed out that the residual antibiotics could enhance the bacterial resistance of environmental organisms and was toxic to human health 2 3 therefore the problem of antibiotics pollution has attracted considerable attention the ciprofloxacin cip is one of the most detected antibiotics in water sources and soils 4 therefore several technologies such as membrane filtration 5 electrolysis 6 biotechnology 7 adsorption 8 9 coagulation flocculation flotation 10 reverse osmosis 11 ion exchange 12 and photocatalysis 13 were performed to remove antibiotics from wastewater as was reported these traditional methods could cause some problems low removal efficiency toxic by products and secondary pollution 14 hence there is a need to find an economical and high efficient technology to remove antibiotics cold atmospheric plasma cap method is a suitable oxidation process for the remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater 15 during the cap process highly reactive species were generated which are exceedingly effective in the degradation and the mineralization of organic toxic molecules therefore cap was considered as an attractive sustainable and eco friendly treatment technique recently different types of cap techniques have been used for the degradation of organic pollutants in water 16 17 among all types of cap pulsed corona discharge pcd and cold atmospheric ac driven dielectric barrier discharge dbd have been extensively used in remediation of antibiotics leading to a high treatment efficiency 16 18 additionally recent works concerning antibiotics removal from water were carried out in ac dbd reactors 19 21 but more intense research studies are required in this context because of its efficiency less chemical requirements low sludge production and higher performance compared to other degradation systems 20 in aqueous phase the dbd discharge is more advantageous than other plasma discharge techniques as it allows the production of much powerful plasma and active species in situ such as hydroxyl radicals hydrogen radicals hydrated electrons hydrogen peroxide and ozone 20 in addition the gas liquid dbd reactors have many advantages it leads to the generation of the reactive species initially in the gas phase and subsequently they are transferred in the liquid phase leading to an effective degradation mechanism 22 in this work non thermal plasma especially dielectric barrier discharge dbd was used for water treatment due to its highly effective and non selective generation of active species during the discharge organic compounds degradation occurs through physical and chemical processes simultaneously 23 24 the physical process involves shock waves strong electric field and ultraviolet light whereas the chemical process mainly includes free radicals and active molecules production 25 26 the active species generated by the dbd plasma are non selective and effective for the degradation of organic pollutants and harmless to the environment 27 29 the first aim of this paper was to study the effect of some operating parameters such as pollutant concentration air flow rate and input energy on the cip degradation mechanism only few studies have been published regarding the cip degradation using non thermal plasma and if that is the case they were focusing mainly on soil treatment 30 combined dbd mno2 nanocrystals 21 or enrofloxacin degradation 31 secondly the addition of radical s scavengers and contributions of active species generated during the dbd process were investigated to discuss the degradation mechanisms the third objective of the study was to investigate the cip degradation in tap water and synthetic water under the optimum plasma operating parameters to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study that has evaluated the depollution of different water matrices ultrapure water tap water and synthetic hospital wastewater using a dbd plasma process recently the combination of plasma with catalysts has been also investigated in order to achieve both lower energy costs and higher contaminant degradation 32 34 in general the catalysts were used to enhance the generation of reactive species which play a key role in the degradation possess tio2 is likely the most broadly used catalyst for the combined dbd photocatalysis approach in water treatment 35 even though luminous textile catalyst can have a substantial impact on the final result studies concerning the combination of plasma with luminous textile catalyst for the remediation of wastewater systems polluted by antibiotics are still rare the luminous photocatalytic textile optimizes the contact between the photocatalyst support and the transmitted light and it consumes less energy using optimized led 36 moreover due to the fast response from the plasma and the effective radical species production from photocatalysis the combined plasma catalysis was performed in order to improve pollutants degradation in this work a tio2 luminous textile catalyst was introduced into the discharge system to enhance the cip degradation tio2 has not only high photocatalytic activity but also has chemical resistance and good stability it is non toxic and inexpensive the luminous textile is more advantageous than other photocatalytic reactor due to the optimized contact between the pollutant the catalyst and the light and the reduced energy consumption by using led 37 consequently the fourth goal of this study was to improve cip degradation in synthetic water by using the combined plasma photocatalysis system to our knowledge no study has investigated the combination of a dbd with a luminous textile photocatalysis process for the cip degradation in synthetic water 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals ciprofloxacin cip c17h18fn3o3 purity 98 was purchased from merck ultra pure water obtained from a millipore milli q system was used for solutions preparation isopropanol isop c3h8o purity 99 9 1 4 benzoquinone bq c6h4o2 were also obtained from merck sodium chloride nacl purity 99 5 citric acid c₆h₈o₇ h2o purity 99 7 sodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 saccharose c₁₂h₂₂o₁₁ and ascorbic acid c6h8o6 were purchased from merck the luminous textile was purchased from brochier technologies company uvtex it consists of a textile woven from both photocatalytically and luminous active fibers photocatalytic fibers are textile fibers imbued with tio2 eg 3 2 ev and the luminous fibers consist of led type optical fibers the preparation of finished light textile was already fully described in our previous investigations 37 2 2 photodegradation experiments fig 1 shows the experimental setup diagram the plasma equipment included a dbd reactor and a high voltage power supply the used dbd plasma reactor consisted of two electrodes to engender the dbd plasma a copper rod which was the inner electrode ground electrode was placed in a glass tube and was immerged in the reactor at a distance of 10 mm from the surface of the solution to be treated the outer electrode high voltage electrode was made from a continuous aluminum helix it was attached to the reactor wall using aluminum adhesive tape the high voltage wire has been connected in the aluminum helix using a metal clip to ensure a good electrical connection the thickness of the dielectric medium the reactor wall was 4 mm the applied high electric voltage was a sine wave of about 30 000 v 40 ma indeed a high voltage amplifier trek 30 kv model 30 20a 8 usa coupled with a voltage generator bfi optilas france was performed to generate the high voltage plasma dbd is obtained by submitting the electrodes to a sinusoidal high voltage of 18 kv peak to peak at different frequencies the applied voltage delivered by the generator reaches 10 v it was then amplified by the amplifier to achieve 18 kv in order to display the used high voltage and the voltage across the capacity a digital oscilloscope lecroy wave surfer 24 xs 200 mhz was used indirect discharge consists of plasma generated in the gas phase and contact with water vapor using both excited species energies and plasma electrons an electric arc formed between the two electrodes raised to a voltage difference this arc is pushed back from the ignition point by the feeding gas flow scans the maximum length of the electrode gap and forms a non thermal plasma zone then a new arc appears and expands according to the same procedure the resulting plasma is quenched at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure the active species diffusion in the liquid phase is enhanced by conversion in the solution owing to the magnetic stirring and the airflow the air pump was used to generate the airflow it supplied the air in the reactor through a polyurethane hose that passes through the rubber plug of the reactor the scavenging experiments were carried out using 100 mm of isopropanol isop and 40 μm of 1 4 benzoquinone bq to determine the contributions of so 4 oh and ho 2 o 2 in the cip degradation 38 39 the synthetic wastewater composed of 1 g l nacl 30 mg l of ascorbic acid 50 mg l of citric acid 230 mg l of na2hpo4 and 100 mg l of saccharose was prepared in tap water this synthetic wastewater simulated the composition of hospital wastewater 40 the characteristics of ultra pure water upw tap water tw and simulating pharmaceutical wastewater sw 40 are mentioned in table 1 2 3 analytical determination the cip quantification in solutions was carried out using an uv vis spectrophotometry cary 50 probe varian at 273 nm the degradation efficiency of cip d was calculated using eq 1 1 d c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the cip initial concentration mg l and ct is the concentration of cip at time t mg l the quantification of total organic carbon suspensions was performed using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu a 200 tokyo japan the mineralization percentage of m was estimated using eq 2 2 m toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where toc0 and toct are the organic matter mg l in the initial state and at time t respectively conductivity and ph measurements were performed using a conductivity meter hanna instruments model hi98192 and a ph meter model 913 metrohm switzerland respectively the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the reaction system was determined by spectrophotometry using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method 41 the concentration of ozone in water was also obtained by spectrophotometer using the indigo method 42 43 ion chromatography dionex as 50 autosampler dx120 was used to quantify the no 2 no 3 cl and so 4 2 concentrations 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of the key operating parameters 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration on cip degradation the effect of the cip initial concentration on the degradation efficiency in dbd system was studied at a peak voltage of 18 kv a frequency of 350 hz and an air flow rate of 240 l h the result is displayed in fig 2 it showed that the degradation efficiency is reduced when the initial concentration of cip is increased the lower cip degradation rate at a higher initial concentration can be explained as follows a certain amount of active species n o no no 2 oh h 2 o 2 o3 induced by plasma is transferred into the solution to react with the contaminant at a given operating dbd conditions indeed the increase of initial cip concentration would result in a lesser ratio of active species pollutant molecules and thus lower degradation efficiencies at a given energy input in summary the degradation efficiency is reduced with increasing initial cip concentration in solution 3 1 2 effect of air flow rate on cip degradation the air flow rate effect on the cip degradation was performed by comparing dbd plasma experiments at various air flow rates no flow 100 l h and 240 l h as shown in fig 3 after 30 min of dbd plasma treatment time the cip degradation percentage under no air flow was 46 2 and increased to 90 4 and 71 3 at air flow rates of 100 and 240 l h respectively in the same way the cip degradation efficiency reached a maximum at air flow rate of 100 l h after 70 min of dbd treatment time where cip degradation percentages were 99 at both 240 l h and 100 l h and 67 3 in absence of gas flow respectively to better compare these results the degradation rates were calculated for each air flow rate they were found to be 0 0174 min 1 0 1392 min 1 and 0 0538 min 1 at air flow rate of 0 l h 100 l h 240 l h respectively in conclusion the cip degradation percentage showed a maximum at 100 l h air flow rate the increase in cip degradation with an increase in gas flow rates can be related to an enhanced provision of oxygen and nitrogen molecular species responsible for the plasma reactive species formation and an improved penetration of the reactive species into the solution facilitating their reaction with contaminants 46 47 at higher gas flow rates cip degradation efficiency decreased proving the results reported by c a aggelopoulos et al 2020 for the treatment of cip in soil using nanosecond pulsed dbd when the air flow rate exceeds the optimum value the cip degradation is reduced because the residence time of the active species especially ozone is shortened as they are evacuated from the reactor faster which limits the reaction time needed to decompose ozone into ros and then degrade cip 48 49 3 1 3 effect of input energy on cip degradation in order to examine the effect of the input energy on cip degradation dbd plasma experiments were carried out at three different conditions of power via increasing the applied frequency 350 hz 18 kv 450 hz 18 kv and 600 hz 18 kv the cip degradation percentage as a function of dbd plasma treatment time at various applied energies is illustrated in fig 4 it is clear that the degradation efficiency of cip was an increasing function of the applied power as a function of the dbd plasma treatment time in addition at 70 min the cip degradation percentages were similar for all applied frequencies thus one can say that the used frequency affects the initial rates of degradation as was previously reported as the higher input power is introduced in the bbd plasma system the electrons accumulation is accelerated resulting in higher current density and then a higher concentration of active species in conclusion the degradation efficiency of cip increased with an increase in power because more energy was introduced in the plasma and then more active species were formed this observation corroborates with previous findings which confirmed that the high injected voltage improves the formation of active species in the dbd system 46 48 3 2 ph conductivity and total organic carbon measurements 3 2 1 change in ph and conductivity the production of radicals and or other species in solution by dbd plasma treatment affects directly the values of ph and conductivity during the experiment the variation of both parameters regardless of dbd plasma treatment time at the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate are given in fig 5 as can be seen ph dropped sharply from 6 8 to 4 0 in the first 5 min of dbd plasma treatment time followed by a small further decrease the conductivity increased gradually from 8 6 to 99 8 μs cm during 70 min the ph and conductivity end values after 70 min were found to be different from the initial ones this difference can be explained by the generation of nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 in the treated solution through the dissolution of nitrogen oxides nox produced in the plasma by reactions of dissociated diazote n2 and dioxygen o2 in other words the significant change in the solution ph during the discharges may be due to the nitric and nitrous acids formation the used experiment was an indirect system having the same principle as n singhanatkaisi and m kandiah 2017 51 and n shainsky et al 2012 52 experiments indirect plasma system generates plasma in a distant or near location but not directly in the sample to be treated therefore the main source of the ph change in the liquid is the generation of hno3 hno2 by the plasma in the air the mentioned chemical substances are then reaching the solution and becoming dissolved there the detection of nitric nitrous acids was confirmed by n singhanatkaisi and m kandiah 2017 n shainsky et al 2012 g m rogli et al 2011 51 53 and c a aggelopoulos et al 2020 31 studies atmospheric plasma generates chemical change by causing some chemical reactions in the air such as ozone creation nitrogen oxidation and then dissolution in water although the formation of nitric nitrous acid in water was proved the acidity remains low ph 3 the details on the acids formation in the air are well detailed with our previous investigations briefly this phenomenon can be explained by the following reactions 54 56 r1 n 2 e 2 n e r2 o 2 e 2 o e r3 n o no r4 no o no 2 r5 no 2 oh hno 3 r6 2 no 2 h 2 o hno 2 hno 3 additionally we note the formation of h ions in the liquid phase as detailed by the following reactions 57 r7 no 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2 h r8 no no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 2 h 3 2 2 mineralization of cip the change in cip mineralization regardless plasma treatment time at the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate is given in fig 6 the toc degradation efficiency increased with an increase in the treatment time in addition the toc degradation efficiency was slower than that of the antibiotic after 70 min over 99 of cip degradation was reached whereas the toc degradation percentage was only 52 3 suggesting the generation of intermediates during the cip degradation the oxidation process gives rise to the progressive decomposition of the carbon skeleton of the organic compound into shorter chain molecules of carbon the toc amount of the oxidation product mixture decreases by liberation of carbon oxides mineralization and gaseous intermediates 54 3 3 degradation mechanism of cip 3 3 1 effect of radical scavengers the radical scavenger s effects on cip degradation efficiency were investigated to evaluate the role of radicals in the cip degradation process indeed isopropanol and 1 4 benzoquinone were added to the cip solution the effects of free radical trapping agents on the degradation process of cip are illustrated in fig 7 the results showed that the presence of scavenger isop or bq strongly inhibited the degradation reaction rate these observations confirmed that the isop and bq scavengers play an inhibitory effect in the cip degradation mechanism similar findings were obtained in other studies reported on the degradation of levofloxacin by non thermal plasma 58 the removal of fluoroquinolones 39 the oxidative degradation of fluoroquinolones 59 and the electro fenton removal of clopyralid 60 since the isop was added the cip degradation percentage clearly drops from 99 to 1 at 70 min discharge time which indicates that oh radicals are fundamental in the plasma discharge time in the presence of bq about 6 1 of cip degradation was still noticed whereas 94 1 of degradation of cip was inhibited with reference to the degradation of cip without scavengers the difference noticed in cip degradation when the bq scavenger was used must be attributed to the contribution of ho 2 and o 2 radicals as was previously reported isop was used to quench generated oh considering the second order rate constants of kisopr oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 at high scavenger concentration 100 mm 38 61 in addition bq kbq ho2 o2 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 an effective trap to avert the radical couple hydroperoxyl radical ho 2 superoxide radical anion o 2 formation 39 62 63 the oh radicals seem to be the most involved radical species formed in solution indeed since the addition of isop the cip removal was completely inhibited further scavenger studies using isop and bq molecules demonstrated that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals were the basic active species in cip degradation during the plasma discharge oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons oh radicals react with oxygen o2 and o3 formed by air flow to produce ho 2 and o 2 radicals in solution 58 3 3 2 contribution of active species generation of o3 and h2o2 during the plasma discharge the degradation process of pollutants in the dbd plasma system involves various oxidants which are generated in the gas liquid interface and then diffuse into the solution the interface plasma liquid discharge which means the discharge in vapor bubbles on the liquid surface is characterized by a large contact surface area 64 discharge plasma in the gas liquid interface is highly effective to diffuse gaseous species inside the liquid moreover compared to direct discharge in the liquid the discharge in the gas liquid interface required less energy to produce the plasma also reactive species which could be produced at the liquid gas interface would give rise to the degradation of the target contaminants 65 66 ozone o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were formed during high energy electron bombardment in the dbd discharge system o3 is formed by the o production the h2o2 formation is performed through the hydroxyl radical recombination in the liquid the gas or at the interface more than that in atmospheric discharge plasma an electron massive flow is colliding at the air water interface giving rise to highly reactive interfacial dissolved electrons in high concentration 67 thus a significant amount of radicals are generated near the interface reactions r9 r13 expressed the generation process of o3 and h2o2 35 53 54 68 r9 e o 2 2 o e r10 e h 2 o h oh e r11 o 2 o o 3 r12 o h 2 o oh oh r13 oh oh h 2 o 2 experiments were performed under the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate and the o3 and h2o2 concentrations in solution are measured the obtained findings are shown in fig 8 the concentration of o3 increased quickly in the first 20 min and then progressively stabilized ozone can be decomposed by water molecules to produce oh radicals and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals are produced by reactions between ozone and h2o2 the o3 decomposition can be described as follows reactions r14 r17 54 68 r14 3 o 3 h 2 o oh oh 4 o 2 r15 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh oh 3 o 2 r16 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 ho 2 r17 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 r18 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 fig 8 shows that the h2o2 concentration in the solution decreased almost linearly reaching 0 30 0 01 mg l and then stabilized after 20 min reaction after 45 min of reaction time the h2o2 concentration in solution decreased the main reasons for h2o2 decrease are the generation of oh caused by hydrogen peroxide reactions r15 r16 and r18 and the consumption by the cip molecules and their degradation by products 58 3 3 3 contribution of active species generation of no 2 and no 3 during the plasma discharge experiments were carried out under the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate and the concentrations of no 2 and no 3 in solution were monitored the obtained findings are shown in fig 9 measurement of nitrate and nitrite production fig 9 showed an increase in the aqueous medium in addition to reactive oxygen species ros reactive nitrogen species rns such as nitrite no 2 nitrate no 3 nitric oxide radical no and nitrogen dioxide radical no 2 are also generated when the plasma discharge is performed in the air in contact with liquid 29 69 indirect discharge is the plasma generated in the gas phase and contact with water vapor it creates a large number of rns such as nitrite nitrate and no radicals 70 in gas phase the molecular nitrogen dissociation leads to the atomic nitrogen generation which in turn leads to the nitrogen oxides production as shown in reactions r19 r24 55 r19 n 2 e 2 n e r20 o 2 e 2 o e r21 n o no r22 no o no 2 r23 2 no o 2 2 no 2 r24 no o 3 no 2 o 2 then nitrite and nitrate are produced through further nitrogen oxides dissolution in the liquid phase as shown in reactions r25 and r26 71 r25 no 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2 h r26 no no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 2 h 3 3 4 effect of different water matrices on cip degradation the cip removal kinetics in different water matrices ultra pure water upw tap water tw and synthetic water sw see table 1 for physico chemical properties and compositions were performed under the optimum experimental conditions cip concentration 1 mg l voltage 18 kv frequency 350 hz air flow rate 100 l h the corresponding mineralization yields after 90 min irradiation and the cip degradation efficiency are shown in fig 10 degradation and mineralization efficiencies decreased with tw degradation efficiency 76 mineralization yield 33 compared to upw degradation efficiency 99 mineralization yield 54 which can be related to the matrix composition inorganic ions such as nitrate sulfate and chlorides have a negative impact on cip degradation by dbd plasma leading to a decrease in the degradation efficiency the most significant quenching effect can be attributed to the presence of chlorides and nitrates anions above 36 3 1 8 mg l and 8 6 0 4 mg l respectively according to table 1 indeed the decline of degradation activity may be also related to the role of nitrates and chlorides anions as radicals scavenging in the liquid phase reactions r27 r31 35 37 72 r27 no 3 oh no 3 oh r28 cl oh cl oh r29 cl oh hocl r30 cl cl cl 2 r31 cl cl cl 2 2 e in addition bicarbonate salts contained in tw is known to scavenge oh radicals 73 as shown in reaction r32 r32 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o it is well known that oh radicals are involved in the oxidation of the organic molecule in non thermal plasma but their quenching reaction with bicarbonates is expected to give an unfavorable impact on the cip degradation rate nevertheless the radical anion co 3 produced in reaction r29 presents a good oxidant activity for organic molecules 74 though less efficient than the oh radical 73 in the case of sw significant inhibition of cip degradation 60 and mineralization 10 was observed with reference to cip degradation and mineralization in upw and tw on the one hand this finding may be due to the presence of nitrate and sulfate anions above 8 2 0 4 mg l and 6 4 0 3 mg l respectively as shown in table 1 in sw on the other hand the decrease in degradation behavior in sw can be probably related to the competition and the scavenging effects of organic and inorganic components of synthetic wastewater during the plasma treatment in tw and sw the ph and conductivity values did not change significantly table 3 the ph of the solution remained in the range of 7 9 8 6 and 7 3 7 6 for tw and sw respectively while the conductivity slightly increased from 490 5 to 521 2 μs cm and from 2423 to 2828 μs cm for tw and sw respectively contrarily when using upw substantial variations in ph and conductivity values were registered as was reported in previous works 54 57 generally when using ultra pure distilled water ph decreases and conductivity increases rapidly under dbd plasma treatment towards tw and sw inorganic salts play the role of a buffer for ph change and neutralize organic and nitric acids produced during the decomposition of organic molecules tw and sw were used in this work in order to represent the antibiotic actual conditions in wastewater it is well known that tw and sw contain little amounts of inorganic salts such as ca mg na as well as chlorides nitrates sulfates and hydrocarbonates with ph between 7 and 8 however ph values about 7 8 can improve the ho 2 and o 2 radicals formation owing to the reaction of o3 with oh ion in alkaline solutions 75 r33 o 3 oh ho 2 o 2 as mentioned in table 1 the ph of upw tw and sw were found to be 5 8 7 8 and 7 6 respectively the decrease in the cip degradation efficiency in tw and sw may be caused by the effect of ph indeed various studies investigating the cip degradation by non thermal plasma confirm the decrease in the degradation efficiency with rising solution ph 76 indeed cip was characterized by pka values of 5 90 0 15 and 8 89 0 11 it can exist in cationic form ph 5 9 neutral form 5 9 ph 8 89 or anionic form ph 8 9 depending on the solution ph at the alkaline ph values the lower cip degradation efficiency can be explained by the deprotonation of the cip molecule cip deprotonation can result in bond length contraction and increase stability of the molecular structure moreover the production of oh radicals would be destroyed by oh anions at higher ph conditions restraining then the cip degradation 77 3 3 5 cip degradation mechanism fig 11 shows the probable degradation mechanisms of cip using dbd process according to the radical scavenger studies it seems that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals play an important role in the cip degradation during the plasma discharge oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons oh radicals react with oxygen to produce ho 2 and o 2 radicals in solution in addition during the plasma discharge various oxidants are generated in the gas liquid interface and then diffuse into the solution which would give rise to the degradation of the cip o3 and h2o2 oxidants were formed by the o production and through the hydroxyl radical recombination respectively ozone can be decomposed by water molecules to produce oh radicals and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals are produced by reactions between ozone and h2o2 the produced radicals would be consumed by the cip molecules and their degradation by products in addition to ros rns no 2 no 3 no no 2 are also generated when the plasma discharge is performed in the air in contact with liquid in gas phase the molecular nitrogen dissociation leads to the atomic nitrogen generation which in turn leads to the nitrogen oxides production then nitrite and nitrate are produced through further nitrogen oxides dissolution in the liquid phase the same mechanism can take place for the cip degradation in tw and sw however the inorganic ions nitrate sulfate and chlorides present in tw and sw can react as radical scavengers in the liquid phase 3 4 combined plasma photocatalysis process in order to improve the cip removal efficiency three processes were assessed plasma photocatalysis using the luminous textile as photocatalyst and combined plasma photocatalysis these photocatalytic experiments were carried out in sw so as to get closer to the real conditions the results of cip degradation efficiencies and degradation rate constants considering the various processes are illustrated in fig 12 cip degradation efficiencies increased with combined plasma photocatalysis compared to plasma alone and photocatalysis alone the obtained photodegradation rate constants were 0 07 0 01 and 0 002 min 1 for the combined dbd photocatalysis dbd plasma and photocatalysis respectively compared to photocatalysis or plasma considered separately the combined system was found to be more effective and hence enhanced significantly the oxidation performances in the one hand for dbd plasma the hydroxyl radical s generation can occur by electron dissociation of h2o molecules moreover dimerization of oh radicals leads to the generation of hydrogen peroxide in addition during the dbd plasma experiment oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons the production of oh radicals can be also enhanced by decomposition of ozone and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by reactions between ozone and h2o2 in addition to oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals as ros no 2 no 3 species as rns are also generated when the dbd plasma discharge is performed 29 the generation of different ros and rns can perform the oxidation process by dbd plasma in the other hand the photocatalysis process is based on the excitation of electrons on the catalyst surface to the conductive band under irradiation light then oh radicals are formed by reaction between h holes and electron donors as described in the following reactions r34 tio 2 h ʋ e h r35 h h 2 o ads tio 2 oh ads h r36 h oh ads tio 2 oh ads moreover the interaction between the electrons and the dioxygen can form ho 2 and o 2 radicals as follows r37 o 2 e o 2 r38 o 2 h ho 2 r39 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 r40 h 2 o 2 e oh oh r41 h 2 o 2 hʋ oh oh the combined dbd photocatalysis process gathers therefore the advantages of each process dbd and photocatalysis are considered separately leading to a significant enhancement of the cip degradation the same behavior was reported in previous works for the removal of triclocarban in water by dbd plasma combined with tio2 activated carbon fibers 78 the reactive yellow 176 degradation by dbd plasma combined with tio2 nano particles 79 and the styrene degradation using dbd plasma combined with sol gel prepared tio2 coated c al2o3 80 table 2 summarizes the results reported in previous works for the antibiotic degradation by a plasma system and compares them to the findings obtained in this study it shows that the degradation efficiency of cip was higher than the results obtained by using other plasma experimental methods this would present this plasma method as a relevant technique for cip degradation specifically only this study discussed upw tw and sw containing a low concentration of cip as well as the combined plasma luminous textile process 4 conclusions in this work a dbd plasma reactor was used for the treatment of cip polluted water the influence of several key operating parameters such as cip initial concentration air flow rate and frequency on dbd performance in terms of cip degradation efficiency d was studied indeed increasing the initial cip concentration in solution resulted in a lower ratio of active species pollutant molecule and then lowered the degradation efficiency moreover the cip degradation efficiency increased with an increase in gas flow rates and achieved a maximum value at a 100 l h air flow rate more than that the results showed that the degradation efficiency of cip was an increasing function of the applied power because more energy was introduced in the plasma and then more active species were formed at higher frequency complete cip degradation was achieved at a cip concentration of 1 mg l an air flow rate of 100 l h a voltage of 18 kv and a frequency of 350 hz after 60 min of dbd plasma treatment time in summary cip in ultrapure water can be effectively removed by dbd plasma besides the cip degradation mechanisms were discussed by studying the effect of radical scavengers the contribution of active species the effect of different water matrices and the effect of the combined plasma photocatalysis process on cip degradation results indicated that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals played an important role in cip degradation in addition to ros rns also play a key role in the cip removal process in order to get closer to the real conditions dbd experiments were also carried out in other water matrices tw and sw significant inhibition of cip degradation and mineralization was observed in tw and sw with reference to cip degradation and mineralization in upw after 90 min irradiation it showed that the presence of organic and inorganic molecules in tw and sw lowered the cip degradation efficiency therefore the application of combined plasma photocatalysis system using luminous textile as photocatalyst was investigated for cip degradation in sw and high removal efficiency of 99 and mineralization yield of 64 were obtained the uses of combined dbd photocatalysis process significantly increased the cip mineralization efficiency and enhanced the oxidation performance in summary the combination of dbd and photocatalysis using luminous textile as photocatalyst may be a promising method for economical efficient and environmentally friendly removal of antibiotics in

12718,as it is well known that wastewater treatment is becoming a global concern the search for advanced intensive oxidation processes with minimal waste generation for wastewater treatment remains a major challenge in the present work the photodegradation of ciprofloxacin cip was studied using the dielectric barrier discharge dbd process the effect of some operating parameters such as cip initial concentration from 1 to 6 mg l air flow rate from 0 to 240 l h and frequency from 350 to 600 hz on dbd performance in term of cip degradation efficiency d has been investigated here as a major result the cip degradation efficiency and the mineralization yield m reached 99 and 49 respectively during 60 min under the obtained optimum experimental conditions an initial concentration of 1 mg l an air flow rate of 100 l h a voltage of 18 kv and a frequency of 350 hz it can be concluded that the dbd process exhibits an eco friendly and great potential for aqueous cip degradation moreover the mechanisms involved in the degradation process by dbd were explained the scavengers study revealed that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals were the basic reactive oxygen species ros in cip degradation process results show that in addition to ros the reactive nitrogen species rns also play a key role in the cip removal process in order to get closer to the real conditions dbd experiments were also carried out in other water matrices tap water tw and synthetic pharmaceutical water sw significant inhibition of cip degradation d and mineralization m was observed in tw d 76 m 33 and sw d 60 m 10 with reference to the cip degradation and mineralization in ultra pure water upw d 99 m 54 after 90 min irradiation it showed that the presence of organic and inorganic molecules in tw and sw lowered the cip degradation efficiency thus the combined plasma photocatalysis system using luminous textile as photocatalyst was performed for the cip degradation in sw in order to get closer to the real conditions leading to 99 of d and 64 of m moreover the use of combined dbd plasma photocatalysis process significantly enhanced the cip degradation performance if compared to each process considered separately overall the combination of dbd and photocatalysis may be a promising technology for economical efficient and environmentally friendly removal of pollutants in wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non thermal plasma photocatalysis combined system wastewater reactive oxygen species reactive nitrogen species data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction current studies prove that pharmaceutical effluents are a lingering type of contaminant in the aquatic environment with increasing health and environmental concerns with their extensive use antibiotics have been detected in the aquatic environment 1 it was pointed out that the residual antibiotics could enhance the bacterial resistance of environmental organisms and was toxic to human health 2 3 therefore the problem of antibiotics pollution has attracted considerable attention the ciprofloxacin cip is one of the most detected antibiotics in water sources and soils 4 therefore several technologies such as membrane filtration 5 electrolysis 6 biotechnology 7 adsorption 8 9 coagulation flocculation flotation 10 reverse osmosis 11 ion exchange 12 and photocatalysis 13 were performed to remove antibiotics from wastewater as was reported these traditional methods could cause some problems low removal efficiency toxic by products and secondary pollution 14 hence there is a need to find an economical and high efficient technology to remove antibiotics cold atmospheric plasma cap method is a suitable oxidation process for the remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater 15 during the cap process highly reactive species were generated which are exceedingly effective in the degradation and the mineralization of organic toxic molecules therefore cap was considered as an attractive sustainable and eco friendly treatment technique recently different types of cap techniques have been used for the degradation of organic pollutants in water 16 17 among all types of cap pulsed corona discharge pcd and cold atmospheric ac driven dielectric barrier discharge dbd have been extensively used in remediation of antibiotics leading to a high treatment efficiency 16 18 additionally recent works concerning antibiotics removal from water were carried out in ac dbd reactors 19 21 but more intense research studies are required in this context because of its efficiency less chemical requirements low sludge production and higher performance compared to other degradation systems 20 in aqueous phase the dbd discharge is more advantageous than other plasma discharge techniques as it allows the production of much powerful plasma and active species in situ such as hydroxyl radicals hydrogen radicals hydrated electrons hydrogen peroxide and ozone 20 in addition the gas liquid dbd reactors have many advantages it leads to the generation of the reactive species initially in the gas phase and subsequently they are transferred in the liquid phase leading to an effective degradation mechanism 22 in this work non thermal plasma especially dielectric barrier discharge dbd was used for water treatment due to its highly effective and non selective generation of active species during the discharge organic compounds degradation occurs through physical and chemical processes simultaneously 23 24 the physical process involves shock waves strong electric field and ultraviolet light whereas the chemical process mainly includes free radicals and active molecules production 25 26 the active species generated by the dbd plasma are non selective and effective for the degradation of organic pollutants and harmless to the environment 27 29 the first aim of this paper was to study the effect of some operating parameters such as pollutant concentration air flow rate and input energy on the cip degradation mechanism only few studies have been published regarding the cip degradation using non thermal plasma and if that is the case they were focusing mainly on soil treatment 30 combined dbd mno2 nanocrystals 21 or enrofloxacin degradation 31 secondly the addition of radical s scavengers and contributions of active species generated during the dbd process were investigated to discuss the degradation mechanisms the third objective of the study was to investigate the cip degradation in tap water and synthetic water under the optimum plasma operating parameters to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study that has evaluated the depollution of different water matrices ultrapure water tap water and synthetic hospital wastewater using a dbd plasma process recently the combination of plasma with catalysts has been also investigated in order to achieve both lower energy costs and higher contaminant degradation 32 34 in general the catalysts were used to enhance the generation of reactive species which play a key role in the degradation possess tio2 is likely the most broadly used catalyst for the combined dbd photocatalysis approach in water treatment 35 even though luminous textile catalyst can have a substantial impact on the final result studies concerning the combination of plasma with luminous textile catalyst for the remediation of wastewater systems polluted by antibiotics are still rare the luminous photocatalytic textile optimizes the contact between the photocatalyst support and the transmitted light and it consumes less energy using optimized led 36 moreover due to the fast response from the plasma and the effective radical species production from photocatalysis the combined plasma catalysis was performed in order to improve pollutants degradation in this work a tio2 luminous textile catalyst was introduced into the discharge system to enhance the cip degradation tio2 has not only high photocatalytic activity but also has chemical resistance and good stability it is non toxic and inexpensive the luminous textile is more advantageous than other photocatalytic reactor due to the optimized contact between the pollutant the catalyst and the light and the reduced energy consumption by using led 37 consequently the fourth goal of this study was to improve cip degradation in synthetic water by using the combined plasma photocatalysis system to our knowledge no study has investigated the combination of a dbd with a luminous textile photocatalysis process for the cip degradation in synthetic water 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals ciprofloxacin cip c17h18fn3o3 purity 98 was purchased from merck ultra pure water obtained from a millipore milli q system was used for solutions preparation isopropanol isop c3h8o purity 99 9 1 4 benzoquinone bq c6h4o2 were also obtained from merck sodium chloride nacl purity 99 5 citric acid c₆h₈o₇ h2o purity 99 7 sodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 saccharose c₁₂h₂₂o₁₁ and ascorbic acid c6h8o6 were purchased from merck the luminous textile was purchased from brochier technologies company uvtex it consists of a textile woven from both photocatalytically and luminous active fibers photocatalytic fibers are textile fibers imbued with tio2 eg 3 2 ev and the luminous fibers consist of led type optical fibers the preparation of finished light textile was already fully described in our previous investigations 37 2 2 photodegradation experiments fig 1 shows the experimental setup diagram the plasma equipment included a dbd reactor and a high voltage power supply the used dbd plasma reactor consisted of two electrodes to engender the dbd plasma a copper rod which was the inner electrode ground electrode was placed in a glass tube and was immerged in the reactor at a distance of 10 mm from the surface of the solution to be treated the outer electrode high voltage electrode was made from a continuous aluminum helix it was attached to the reactor wall using aluminum adhesive tape the high voltage wire has been connected in the aluminum helix using a metal clip to ensure a good electrical connection the thickness of the dielectric medium the reactor wall was 4 mm the applied high electric voltage was a sine wave of about 30 000 v 40 ma indeed a high voltage amplifier trek 30 kv model 30 20a 8 usa coupled with a voltage generator bfi optilas france was performed to generate the high voltage plasma dbd is obtained by submitting the electrodes to a sinusoidal high voltage of 18 kv peak to peak at different frequencies the applied voltage delivered by the generator reaches 10 v it was then amplified by the amplifier to achieve 18 kv in order to display the used high voltage and the voltage across the capacity a digital oscilloscope lecroy wave surfer 24 xs 200 mhz was used indirect discharge consists of plasma generated in the gas phase and contact with water vapor using both excited species energies and plasma electrons an electric arc formed between the two electrodes raised to a voltage difference this arc is pushed back from the ignition point by the feeding gas flow scans the maximum length of the electrode gap and forms a non thermal plasma zone then a new arc appears and expands according to the same procedure the resulting plasma is quenched at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure the active species diffusion in the liquid phase is enhanced by conversion in the solution owing to the magnetic stirring and the airflow the air pump was used to generate the airflow it supplied the air in the reactor through a polyurethane hose that passes through the rubber plug of the reactor the scavenging experiments were carried out using 100 mm of isopropanol isop and 40 μm of 1 4 benzoquinone bq to determine the contributions of so 4 oh and ho 2 o 2 in the cip degradation 38 39 the synthetic wastewater composed of 1 g l nacl 30 mg l of ascorbic acid 50 mg l of citric acid 230 mg l of na2hpo4 and 100 mg l of saccharose was prepared in tap water this synthetic wastewater simulated the composition of hospital wastewater 40 the characteristics of ultra pure water upw tap water tw and simulating pharmaceutical wastewater sw 40 are mentioned in table 1 2 3 analytical determination the cip quantification in solutions was carried out using an uv vis spectrophotometry cary 50 probe varian at 273 nm the degradation efficiency of cip d was calculated using eq 1 1 d c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the cip initial concentration mg l and ct is the concentration of cip at time t mg l the quantification of total organic carbon suspensions was performed using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu a 200 tokyo japan the mineralization percentage of m was estimated using eq 2 2 m toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where toc0 and toct are the organic matter mg l in the initial state and at time t respectively conductivity and ph measurements were performed using a conductivity meter hanna instruments model hi98192 and a ph meter model 913 metrohm switzerland respectively the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the reaction system was determined by spectrophotometry using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method 41 the concentration of ozone in water was also obtained by spectrophotometer using the indigo method 42 43 ion chromatography dionex as 50 autosampler dx120 was used to quantify the no 2 no 3 cl and so 4 2 concentrations 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of the key operating parameters 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration on cip degradation the effect of the cip initial concentration on the degradation efficiency in dbd system was studied at a peak voltage of 18 kv a frequency of 350 hz and an air flow rate of 240 l h the result is displayed in fig 2 it showed that the degradation efficiency is reduced when the initial concentration of cip is increased the lower cip degradation rate at a higher initial concentration can be explained as follows a certain amount of active species n o no no 2 oh h 2 o 2 o3 induced by plasma is transferred into the solution to react with the contaminant at a given operating dbd conditions indeed the increase of initial cip concentration would result in a lesser ratio of active species pollutant molecules and thus lower degradation efficiencies at a given energy input in summary the degradation efficiency is reduced with increasing initial cip concentration in solution 3 1 2 effect of air flow rate on cip degradation the air flow rate effect on the cip degradation was performed by comparing dbd plasma experiments at various air flow rates no flow 100 l h and 240 l h as shown in fig 3 after 30 min of dbd plasma treatment time the cip degradation percentage under no air flow was 46 2 and increased to 90 4 and 71 3 at air flow rates of 100 and 240 l h respectively in the same way the cip degradation efficiency reached a maximum at air flow rate of 100 l h after 70 min of dbd treatment time where cip degradation percentages were 99 at both 240 l h and 100 l h and 67 3 in absence of gas flow respectively to better compare these results the degradation rates were calculated for each air flow rate they were found to be 0 0174 min 1 0 1392 min 1 and 0 0538 min 1 at air flow rate of 0 l h 100 l h 240 l h respectively in conclusion the cip degradation percentage showed a maximum at 100 l h air flow rate the increase in cip degradation with an increase in gas flow rates can be related to an enhanced provision of oxygen and nitrogen molecular species responsible for the plasma reactive species formation and an improved penetration of the reactive species into the solution facilitating their reaction with contaminants 46 47 at higher gas flow rates cip degradation efficiency decreased proving the results reported by c a aggelopoulos et al 2020 for the treatment of cip in soil using nanosecond pulsed dbd when the air flow rate exceeds the optimum value the cip degradation is reduced because the residence time of the active species especially ozone is shortened as they are evacuated from the reactor faster which limits the reaction time needed to decompose ozone into ros and then degrade cip 48 49 3 1 3 effect of input energy on cip degradation in order to examine the effect of the input energy on cip degradation dbd plasma experiments were carried out at three different conditions of power via increasing the applied frequency 350 hz 18 kv 450 hz 18 kv and 600 hz 18 kv the cip degradation percentage as a function of dbd plasma treatment time at various applied energies is illustrated in fig 4 it is clear that the degradation efficiency of cip was an increasing function of the applied power as a function of the dbd plasma treatment time in addition at 70 min the cip degradation percentages were similar for all applied frequencies thus one can say that the used frequency affects the initial rates of degradation as was previously reported as the higher input power is introduced in the bbd plasma system the electrons accumulation is accelerated resulting in higher current density and then a higher concentration of active species in conclusion the degradation efficiency of cip increased with an increase in power because more energy was introduced in the plasma and then more active species were formed this observation corroborates with previous findings which confirmed that the high injected voltage improves the formation of active species in the dbd system 46 48 3 2 ph conductivity and total organic carbon measurements 3 2 1 change in ph and conductivity the production of radicals and or other species in solution by dbd plasma treatment affects directly the values of ph and conductivity during the experiment the variation of both parameters regardless of dbd plasma treatment time at the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate are given in fig 5 as can be seen ph dropped sharply from 6 8 to 4 0 in the first 5 min of dbd plasma treatment time followed by a small further decrease the conductivity increased gradually from 8 6 to 99 8 μs cm during 70 min the ph and conductivity end values after 70 min were found to be different from the initial ones this difference can be explained by the generation of nitrites no2 and nitrates no3 in the treated solution through the dissolution of nitrogen oxides nox produced in the plasma by reactions of dissociated diazote n2 and dioxygen o2 in other words the significant change in the solution ph during the discharges may be due to the nitric and nitrous acids formation the used experiment was an indirect system having the same principle as n singhanatkaisi and m kandiah 2017 51 and n shainsky et al 2012 52 experiments indirect plasma system generates plasma in a distant or near location but not directly in the sample to be treated therefore the main source of the ph change in the liquid is the generation of hno3 hno2 by the plasma in the air the mentioned chemical substances are then reaching the solution and becoming dissolved there the detection of nitric nitrous acids was confirmed by n singhanatkaisi and m kandiah 2017 n shainsky et al 2012 g m rogli et al 2011 51 53 and c a aggelopoulos et al 2020 31 studies atmospheric plasma generates chemical change by causing some chemical reactions in the air such as ozone creation nitrogen oxidation and then dissolution in water although the formation of nitric nitrous acid in water was proved the acidity remains low ph 3 the details on the acids formation in the air are well detailed with our previous investigations briefly this phenomenon can be explained by the following reactions 54 56 r1 n 2 e 2 n e r2 o 2 e 2 o e r3 n o no r4 no o no 2 r5 no 2 oh hno 3 r6 2 no 2 h 2 o hno 2 hno 3 additionally we note the formation of h ions in the liquid phase as detailed by the following reactions 57 r7 no 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2 h r8 no no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 2 h 3 2 2 mineralization of cip the change in cip mineralization regardless plasma treatment time at the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate is given in fig 6 the toc degradation efficiency increased with an increase in the treatment time in addition the toc degradation efficiency was slower than that of the antibiotic after 70 min over 99 of cip degradation was reached whereas the toc degradation percentage was only 52 3 suggesting the generation of intermediates during the cip degradation the oxidation process gives rise to the progressive decomposition of the carbon skeleton of the organic compound into shorter chain molecules of carbon the toc amount of the oxidation product mixture decreases by liberation of carbon oxides mineralization and gaseous intermediates 54 3 3 degradation mechanism of cip 3 3 1 effect of radical scavengers the radical scavenger s effects on cip degradation efficiency were investigated to evaluate the role of radicals in the cip degradation process indeed isopropanol and 1 4 benzoquinone were added to the cip solution the effects of free radical trapping agents on the degradation process of cip are illustrated in fig 7 the results showed that the presence of scavenger isop or bq strongly inhibited the degradation reaction rate these observations confirmed that the isop and bq scavengers play an inhibitory effect in the cip degradation mechanism similar findings were obtained in other studies reported on the degradation of levofloxacin by non thermal plasma 58 the removal of fluoroquinolones 39 the oxidative degradation of fluoroquinolones 59 and the electro fenton removal of clopyralid 60 since the isop was added the cip degradation percentage clearly drops from 99 to 1 at 70 min discharge time which indicates that oh radicals are fundamental in the plasma discharge time in the presence of bq about 6 1 of cip degradation was still noticed whereas 94 1 of degradation of cip was inhibited with reference to the degradation of cip without scavengers the difference noticed in cip degradation when the bq scavenger was used must be attributed to the contribution of ho 2 and o 2 radicals as was previously reported isop was used to quench generated oh considering the second order rate constants of kisopr oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 at high scavenger concentration 100 mm 38 61 in addition bq kbq ho2 o2 9 6 108 m 1 s 1 an effective trap to avert the radical couple hydroperoxyl radical ho 2 superoxide radical anion o 2 formation 39 62 63 the oh radicals seem to be the most involved radical species formed in solution indeed since the addition of isop the cip removal was completely inhibited further scavenger studies using isop and bq molecules demonstrated that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals were the basic active species in cip degradation during the plasma discharge oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons oh radicals react with oxygen o2 and o3 formed by air flow to produce ho 2 and o 2 radicals in solution 58 3 3 2 contribution of active species generation of o3 and h2o2 during the plasma discharge the degradation process of pollutants in the dbd plasma system involves various oxidants which are generated in the gas liquid interface and then diffuse into the solution the interface plasma liquid discharge which means the discharge in vapor bubbles on the liquid surface is characterized by a large contact surface area 64 discharge plasma in the gas liquid interface is highly effective to diffuse gaseous species inside the liquid moreover compared to direct discharge in the liquid the discharge in the gas liquid interface required less energy to produce the plasma also reactive species which could be produced at the liquid gas interface would give rise to the degradation of the target contaminants 65 66 ozone o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were formed during high energy electron bombardment in the dbd discharge system o3 is formed by the o production the h2o2 formation is performed through the hydroxyl radical recombination in the liquid the gas or at the interface more than that in atmospheric discharge plasma an electron massive flow is colliding at the air water interface giving rise to highly reactive interfacial dissolved electrons in high concentration 67 thus a significant amount of radicals are generated near the interface reactions r9 r13 expressed the generation process of o3 and h2o2 35 53 54 68 r9 e o 2 2 o e r10 e h 2 o h oh e r11 o 2 o o 3 r12 o h 2 o oh oh r13 oh oh h 2 o 2 experiments were performed under the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate and the o3 and h2o2 concentrations in solution are measured the obtained findings are shown in fig 8 the concentration of o3 increased quickly in the first 20 min and then progressively stabilized ozone can be decomposed by water molecules to produce oh radicals and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals are produced by reactions between ozone and h2o2 the o3 decomposition can be described as follows reactions r14 r17 54 68 r14 3 o 3 h 2 o oh oh 4 o 2 r15 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh oh 3 o 2 r16 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 ho 2 r17 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 r18 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 fig 8 shows that the h2o2 concentration in the solution decreased almost linearly reaching 0 30 0 01 mg l and then stabilized after 20 min reaction after 45 min of reaction time the h2o2 concentration in solution decreased the main reasons for h2o2 decrease are the generation of oh caused by hydrogen peroxide reactions r15 r16 and r18 and the consumption by the cip molecules and their degradation by products 58 3 3 3 contribution of active species generation of no 2 and no 3 during the plasma discharge experiments were carried out under the determined optimum conditions of cip concentration input energy and air flow rate and the concentrations of no 2 and no 3 in solution were monitored the obtained findings are shown in fig 9 measurement of nitrate and nitrite production fig 9 showed an increase in the aqueous medium in addition to reactive oxygen species ros reactive nitrogen species rns such as nitrite no 2 nitrate no 3 nitric oxide radical no and nitrogen dioxide radical no 2 are also generated when the plasma discharge is performed in the air in contact with liquid 29 69 indirect discharge is the plasma generated in the gas phase and contact with water vapor it creates a large number of rns such as nitrite nitrate and no radicals 70 in gas phase the molecular nitrogen dissociation leads to the atomic nitrogen generation which in turn leads to the nitrogen oxides production as shown in reactions r19 r24 55 r19 n 2 e 2 n e r20 o 2 e 2 o e r21 n o no r22 no o no 2 r23 2 no o 2 2 no 2 r24 no o 3 no 2 o 2 then nitrite and nitrate are produced through further nitrogen oxides dissolution in the liquid phase as shown in reactions r25 and r26 71 r25 no 2 no 2 h 2 o no 2 no 3 2 h r26 no no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 2 h 3 3 4 effect of different water matrices on cip degradation the cip removal kinetics in different water matrices ultra pure water upw tap water tw and synthetic water sw see table 1 for physico chemical properties and compositions were performed under the optimum experimental conditions cip concentration 1 mg l voltage 18 kv frequency 350 hz air flow rate 100 l h the corresponding mineralization yields after 90 min irradiation and the cip degradation efficiency are shown in fig 10 degradation and mineralization efficiencies decreased with tw degradation efficiency 76 mineralization yield 33 compared to upw degradation efficiency 99 mineralization yield 54 which can be related to the matrix composition inorganic ions such as nitrate sulfate and chlorides have a negative impact on cip degradation by dbd plasma leading to a decrease in the degradation efficiency the most significant quenching effect can be attributed to the presence of chlorides and nitrates anions above 36 3 1 8 mg l and 8 6 0 4 mg l respectively according to table 1 indeed the decline of degradation activity may be also related to the role of nitrates and chlorides anions as radicals scavenging in the liquid phase reactions r27 r31 35 37 72 r27 no 3 oh no 3 oh r28 cl oh cl oh r29 cl oh hocl r30 cl cl cl 2 r31 cl cl cl 2 2 e in addition bicarbonate salts contained in tw is known to scavenge oh radicals 73 as shown in reaction r32 r32 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o it is well known that oh radicals are involved in the oxidation of the organic molecule in non thermal plasma but their quenching reaction with bicarbonates is expected to give an unfavorable impact on the cip degradation rate nevertheless the radical anion co 3 produced in reaction r29 presents a good oxidant activity for organic molecules 74 though less efficient than the oh radical 73 in the case of sw significant inhibition of cip degradation 60 and mineralization 10 was observed with reference to cip degradation and mineralization in upw and tw on the one hand this finding may be due to the presence of nitrate and sulfate anions above 8 2 0 4 mg l and 6 4 0 3 mg l respectively as shown in table 1 in sw on the other hand the decrease in degradation behavior in sw can be probably related to the competition and the scavenging effects of organic and inorganic components of synthetic wastewater during the plasma treatment in tw and sw the ph and conductivity values did not change significantly table 3 the ph of the solution remained in the range of 7 9 8 6 and 7 3 7 6 for tw and sw respectively while the conductivity slightly increased from 490 5 to 521 2 μs cm and from 2423 to 2828 μs cm for tw and sw respectively contrarily when using upw substantial variations in ph and conductivity values were registered as was reported in previous works 54 57 generally when using ultra pure distilled water ph decreases and conductivity increases rapidly under dbd plasma treatment towards tw and sw inorganic salts play the role of a buffer for ph change and neutralize organic and nitric acids produced during the decomposition of organic molecules tw and sw were used in this work in order to represent the antibiotic actual conditions in wastewater it is well known that tw and sw contain little amounts of inorganic salts such as ca mg na as well as chlorides nitrates sulfates and hydrocarbonates with ph between 7 and 8 however ph values about 7 8 can improve the ho 2 and o 2 radicals formation owing to the reaction of o3 with oh ion in alkaline solutions 75 r33 o 3 oh ho 2 o 2 as mentioned in table 1 the ph of upw tw and sw were found to be 5 8 7 8 and 7 6 respectively the decrease in the cip degradation efficiency in tw and sw may be caused by the effect of ph indeed various studies investigating the cip degradation by non thermal plasma confirm the decrease in the degradation efficiency with rising solution ph 76 indeed cip was characterized by pka values of 5 90 0 15 and 8 89 0 11 it can exist in cationic form ph 5 9 neutral form 5 9 ph 8 89 or anionic form ph 8 9 depending on the solution ph at the alkaline ph values the lower cip degradation efficiency can be explained by the deprotonation of the cip molecule cip deprotonation can result in bond length contraction and increase stability of the molecular structure moreover the production of oh radicals would be destroyed by oh anions at higher ph conditions restraining then the cip degradation 77 3 3 5 cip degradation mechanism fig 11 shows the probable degradation mechanisms of cip using dbd process according to the radical scavenger studies it seems that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals play an important role in the cip degradation during the plasma discharge oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons oh radicals react with oxygen to produce ho 2 and o 2 radicals in solution in addition during the plasma discharge various oxidants are generated in the gas liquid interface and then diffuse into the solution which would give rise to the degradation of the cip o3 and h2o2 oxidants were formed by the o production and through the hydroxyl radical recombination respectively ozone can be decomposed by water molecules to produce oh radicals and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals are produced by reactions between ozone and h2o2 the produced radicals would be consumed by the cip molecules and their degradation by products in addition to ros rns no 2 no 3 no no 2 are also generated when the plasma discharge is performed in the air in contact with liquid in gas phase the molecular nitrogen dissociation leads to the atomic nitrogen generation which in turn leads to the nitrogen oxides production then nitrite and nitrate are produced through further nitrogen oxides dissolution in the liquid phase the same mechanism can take place for the cip degradation in tw and sw however the inorganic ions nitrate sulfate and chlorides present in tw and sw can react as radical scavengers in the liquid phase 3 4 combined plasma photocatalysis process in order to improve the cip removal efficiency three processes were assessed plasma photocatalysis using the luminous textile as photocatalyst and combined plasma photocatalysis these photocatalytic experiments were carried out in sw so as to get closer to the real conditions the results of cip degradation efficiencies and degradation rate constants considering the various processes are illustrated in fig 12 cip degradation efficiencies increased with combined plasma photocatalysis compared to plasma alone and photocatalysis alone the obtained photodegradation rate constants were 0 07 0 01 and 0 002 min 1 for the combined dbd photocatalysis dbd plasma and photocatalysis respectively compared to photocatalysis or plasma considered separately the combined system was found to be more effective and hence enhanced significantly the oxidation performances in the one hand for dbd plasma the hydroxyl radical s generation can occur by electron dissociation of h2o molecules moreover dimerization of oh radicals leads to the generation of hydrogen peroxide in addition during the dbd plasma experiment oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by the decomposition of water molecules bombarded by high energy electrons the production of oh radicals can be also enhanced by decomposition of ozone and then ho 2 and o 2 radicals can be generated by reactions between ozone and h2o2 in addition to oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals as ros no 2 no 3 species as rns are also generated when the dbd plasma discharge is performed 29 the generation of different ros and rns can perform the oxidation process by dbd plasma in the other hand the photocatalysis process is based on the excitation of electrons on the catalyst surface to the conductive band under irradiation light then oh radicals are formed by reaction between h holes and electron donors as described in the following reactions r34 tio 2 h ʋ e h r35 h h 2 o ads tio 2 oh ads h r36 h oh ads tio 2 oh ads moreover the interaction between the electrons and the dioxygen can form ho 2 and o 2 radicals as follows r37 o 2 e o 2 r38 o 2 h ho 2 r39 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 r40 h 2 o 2 e oh oh r41 h 2 o 2 hʋ oh oh the combined dbd photocatalysis process gathers therefore the advantages of each process dbd and photocatalysis are considered separately leading to a significant enhancement of the cip degradation the same behavior was reported in previous works for the removal of triclocarban in water by dbd plasma combined with tio2 activated carbon fibers 78 the reactive yellow 176 degradation by dbd plasma combined with tio2 nano particles 79 and the styrene degradation using dbd plasma combined with sol gel prepared tio2 coated c al2o3 80 table 2 summarizes the results reported in previous works for the antibiotic degradation by a plasma system and compares them to the findings obtained in this study it shows that the degradation efficiency of cip was higher than the results obtained by using other plasma experimental methods this would present this plasma method as a relevant technique for cip degradation specifically only this study discussed upw tw and sw containing a low concentration of cip as well as the combined plasma luminous textile process 4 conclusions in this work a dbd plasma reactor was used for the treatment of cip polluted water the influence of several key operating parameters such as cip initial concentration air flow rate and frequency on dbd performance in terms of cip degradation efficiency d was studied indeed increasing the initial cip concentration in solution resulted in a lower ratio of active species pollutant molecule and then lowered the degradation efficiency moreover the cip degradation efficiency increased with an increase in gas flow rates and achieved a maximum value at a 100 l h air flow rate more than that the results showed that the degradation efficiency of cip was an increasing function of the applied power because more energy was introduced in the plasma and then more active species were formed at higher frequency complete cip degradation was achieved at a cip concentration of 1 mg l an air flow rate of 100 l h a voltage of 18 kv and a frequency of 350 hz after 60 min of dbd plasma treatment time in summary cip in ultrapure water can be effectively removed by dbd plasma besides the cip degradation mechanisms were discussed by studying the effect of radical scavengers the contribution of active species the effect of different water matrices and the effect of the combined plasma photocatalysis process on cip degradation results indicated that oh ho 2 and o 2 radicals played an important role in cip degradation in addition to ros rns also play a key role in the cip removal process in order to get closer to the real conditions dbd experiments were also carried out in other water matrices tw and sw significant inhibition of cip degradation and mineralization was observed in tw and sw with reference to cip degradation and mineralization in upw after 90 min irradiation it showed that the presence of organic and inorganic molecules in tw and sw lowered the cip degradation efficiency therefore the application of combined plasma photocatalysis system using luminous textile as photocatalyst was investigated for cip degradation in sw and high removal efficiency of 99 and mineralization yield of 64 were obtained the uses of combined dbd photocatalysis process significantly increased the cip mineralization efficiency and enhanced the oxidation performance in summary the combination of dbd and photocatalysis using luminous textile as photocatalyst may be a promising method for economical efficient and environmentally friendly removal of antibiotics in

12719,toxic organic pollutants including dyes and phenols in effluent have not be treated efficiently by traditional wastewater methods herein a novel nanotubular material was prepared successfully via supramolecular self assembly of n n n 3 methylpyridine benzenetriamide tmpta and further modified with dibenzo 18 crown 6 groups to obtain crown ether functionalized nanotubes tmpta ce the crown ether based tmpta ce shows a unique cavity structure positively charged pyridinium groups and especially favorite crown ether cation host guest interactions the crown ether based material as an adsorbent exhibits superior synergistic adsorption ability towards anionic dyes and phenols the maximum adsorption capacities of mo bpa and pnp for tmpta ce reached 802 23 105 69 and 98 03 mg g respectively with the removal efficiency of 99 the existence of k ions can improve the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively notably no significant change in adsorption efficiency was observed after 5 repeated adsorption desorption cycles mechanism studies shows that synergistic effect of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction played a significant role for the adsorption of anionic dyes and phenols the results shows that the as synthesized tmpta ce adsorbent with a simple efficient and low cost synthetic process has potential application in practical wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic nanotubes crown ether adsorption dyes phenols data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is one of the world s most important substances on earth with the rapid development of chemical activities water contamination by various toxic pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pharmaceuticals and other aromatic compounds has attracted wide attention 1 4 among these pollutants organic dyes are the most widely used ones due to their extensive applications in textile printing wood cosmetics plastics and leather industries 5 6 in recent decades 100 000 commercial dyes are available in the market about 1 million tons are produced every year of which textile dyes are about 50 and 2 of these dyes are left in wastewater and discharged into water environment 7 among the organic dyes most of them are teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic to human health due to the presence of aromatic rings in their structure if not treated properly from industrial wastewater the cationic dyes in the environment may cause significantly potential hazard to environment and public health even at very low concentrations for example they can cause serious damage to human beings such as liver brain dysfunction of the kidney reproductive system and central nervous system 8 10 dyes in the aqueous solution can also reduce the penetration of sunlight disrupting the biological processes 11 12 in addition dyes and heavy metal ions usually coexist in industrial wastewater for example the presence of cd2 hg2 pb2 and cu2 in industrial effluents may cause increasingly serious damage to the environment and ecosystem 13 15 therefore removing these contaminants from wastewater for the scientists and government legislation is an urgent and challenging task recently various methods have been reported for the remediation of these pollutants from wastewater including precipitation adsorption membrane filtration ion exchange electrochemical process and oxidation 1 5 6 16 18 among them adsorption is an efficient method to remove cationic dyes from the aqueous media due to its high efficiency cost effective easy operation and without byproducts 13 19 21 a variety of common porous adsorbents including chitosan activated carbon microcrystalline cellulose zeolite polymer resin metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs were reported for the removal of cationic dyes from the contaminated water bodies 5 22 24 however real application of the adsorbents in industrial effluents has been limited by their low efficiency difficult regeneration time consuming and complicated preparation method therefore developing new and efficient adsorbents for the rapid capture and removal of the dyes has become the focus of current research organic nanotubes have been well developed as a unique family of porous nanomaterials which are mainly prepared by supramolecular assembly of low molecular weight molecules 25 27 they have one dimensional nano sized channels and high affinity for various organic dyes via noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding π π stacking van der waals force etc 28 30 organic nanotubes show potential as adsorbents in wastewater treatment due to their hierarchical structure and structure functional diversity however low adsorption capacities and poor stability in aqueous solution hinder their widespread application crown ethers functionalization is a simple and efficient method to modify the surface of the nanotubes the nanotubes can exhibit high adsorption selectivity for metal ions 31 crown ethers are a group of important host molecules with two important configurations i e d 3d and c i conformations which have negatively polarized oxygen atoms and different cavity sizes 32 crown ethers can form stable complexes with the different metal ions that strongly depend on the crown ether size so they can selectively bind various ions such as k li and na 33 owing to its high selectivity crown ethers based adsorbents has received considerable attention duman et al 34 investigated benzo 18 crown 6 b18c6 immobilized activated carbon cloth for the removal of cr3 co2 and ni2 ions from wastewater and it has the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 22 mmol g co3 ion eliseo et al 35 used oh dibenzo 14 crown 4 oh db14c4 modified multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts as adsorbent for the uptake of li ions achieving the adsorption capacity of 5 4 mg g in this study dibenzo 18 crown 6 db18c6 is introduced into the organic nanotubes assembled from multi pyridyl based n n n tris 3 methylpyridyl trimesic amide tmpta to obtain stable functional nanotubes tmpta ce tmpta nanotubes were chosen because electrophiles may readily attack preferably at the n atom of pyridyl groups to form stable polymeric structures db18c6 is an important crown ether compound and it can selectively capture alkali metal ions from solution db18c6 exhibits the better binding selectivity for k ions than other metal ions in solution phase based on the monte carlo simulation 36 the presence of db18c6 groups in tmpta ce allows host guest interactions by the size of macrocyclic cavity which can improve the adsorption performance towards metal ions due to cyclic polyethyleneglycols anionic dyes are further scavenged from the aqueous solution by electrostatic interactions between metal ions and dye anions together with the framework positive charges strong electrostatic interactions with metal ions charged positively π π interaction hydrogen bonding and synergistic interaction and cationic dyes obviously contribute to adsorption therefore the cationic tmpta ce containing pyridinium groups can be a class of promising materials for the removal of cationic organic pollutants herein we report a novel cationic pyridinium based tmpta ce for the adsorption of dyes mo og and amaranth and phenols bpa and pnp adsorption mechanism was also studied in detail by ftir and xps 2 experimental section 2 1 materials chemicals solvents and reagents used in the experiment were purchased in analytical grade and used without further purification unless otherwise stated deionized water was used throughout all the experiments tmpta was synthesized from trimesic acid and 3 aminomethyl pyridine according to the literature procedure 37 2 3 13 14 tetrakis bromomethyl dibenzo 18 crown 6 ce br was synthesized through the bromomethylation of commercially available db18c6 as reported in the previous procedure 38 2 2 characterization the surface morphology of tmpta ce before and after adsorption was observed using a scanning electron microscope at 20 0 kv sem s5200 hitachi tokyo japan and a transmission electron microscopy operating at 80 kv tem jem 1010 jeol tokyo japan respectively surface chemistry of the samples was analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker tensor 27 as kbr pressed pellets in the range of 4000 400cm 1 at 4 0cm 1 resolution 13c cp mas nmr spectra were recorded on bruker avance ii 500 using 4 mm solid cp mas probe

rate of 10 c min 1 from 25 c to 800 c in n2 atmosphere the specific surface area was measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the pore size distribution was evaluated with density functional theory dft method by n2 adsorption desorption measurements using a micromeritics asap 2020 instrument at 196 c xps was used to examine the surface chemical state and elemental compositions with an xis ultra xps from kratos analytical manchester uk with al κα as the radiation source at 15 kv and 15 ma the static charge effect was compensated using the c1s peak at 284 80 ev the zeta potential ζ values were obtained via a zeta sizer nano series nano zs90 malvern uk under different ph values 4 0 9 0 2 3 synthesis of tmpta tube for tmpta tube 84 mg of tmpta was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol 2 4 ml and the solution was dropped into water 120 ml at room temperature rt under vigorous stirring for 1 min the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol in sequence and then dried under vacuum at 60 c for 24 h to give tmpta tube in 83 yield 2 4 synthesis of tmpta ce 300 mg of tmpta tube was added to a solution of 60 mg of ce br in dry chcl3 30 ml and kept at rt for 48 h without agitation under n2 atmosphere the product was washed with ethanol and then washed with distilled water the washed materials were dried at 60 c in vacuum for 24 h to get light yellow solid tmpta ce yield 80 2 5 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were performed in 100 ml glass bottle in a constant temperature shaker at 120 rpm containing 50 ml solution of dyes or phenols a typical procedure is as follows a certain amount of adsorbent 5 mg was dispersed in 50 ml of 100 mg l mo solution ph 7 containing 10 mmol l of k ions and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 25 c after that 1 ml supernatant samples were withdrawn from mixture filtered by using 0 22 μm microporous membrane and diluted to 10 ml the concentrations of mo solution before and after absorption was determined with uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu and adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e was calculated by using standard calibration curve adsorption behavior of different metal ions was also tested under the same conditions and the remaining metal ions in the solutions were determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy aas varian aa 240 fs the effect of ph on adsorption was adjusted to a range of 4 10 with 1 mol l hcl or naoh all the experiments were tested in triplicate and the deviation was within 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g transient fractional adsorption capacity q t mg g and removal rate r of adsorbents are determined according to the following equations 1 q e c 0 c e m v 0 2 q t c 0 c t m v 0 3 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where q e mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium c o c t and c e mg l are initial transient time t and equilibrium concentration of dyes or phenols respectively v is the solution volume of dyes or phenols ml and m is the dry weight of adsorbent g 3 results and discussion some methods have been reported for the removal of dyes from industrial wastewater each of these methods have inherent limitations as shown in table s1 supporting information adsorption is an efficient process for wastewater treatment and the development of new and efficient adsorbents is particularly critical in the present work tmpta was used as the c 3 symmetrical gelator to construct nanotubular structures further post modified via ce br ce br would bridge between two adjacent pyridyl groups on different tmpta units to achieve a stable polymers the nanotube structure will contain a continuous network of covalent bonds via the tubular network after modification thus making it greater structural stability and generating charged surfaces the synthetic procedure to tmpta ce is shown in fig 1 firstly tmpta nanotubes were obtained using an anti solvent induced instant gelation method with appropriate modification tmpta tube was further modified with ce br via nucleophilic addition reaction to obtain tmpta ce finally the pyridyl groups of tmpta were alkylated with bromoalkyl groups of ce br to generate cationic pyridynium polymeric networks achieving modification of tmpta tube with dibenzo 18 crown 6 functional groups in general the synthesis of tmpta ce is a cost effective efficient and industrially feasible process 3 1 morphology sem was used to study the morphology of the material before and after modification as shown in fig 2a b tmpta tube has long tubular structures with smooth surface and open ends with diameter of 300 800 nm and thickness of about 50 nm after modification sem reveals that tmpta ce maintains tubular structures with outer diameters in the range of 250 700 nm and thickness of about 40 nm implying that tmpta ce has no obvious difference from the tmpta tube fig 2c d tem results clearly confirm the outer wall and inner hollow structure of tmpta tube before and after modification fig 2e f eds was also applied to study the nucleophilic reaction of tmpta with ce br as functional groups eds patterns indicate that the tmpta tube is mostly composed of two elements c and o furthermore eds mapping of the elemental composition shows c o and br to be dispersed on the surface of tmpta ce implying successful modification of ce br onto the surface of tmpta tube fig s1 supporting information 3 2 structure powder x ray diffraction xrd pattern of tmpta tube indicates diffraction peaks implying the existence of crystalline regions in tmpta tube fig s2 supporting information after functionalization the diffraction peaks from tmpta tube disappeared and a large packet peak was recorded for tmpta ce indicating that the functionalization process destroys the ordered arrangement and tmpta tube changes from long range order to amorphous structure ftir spectra of tmpta tube and tmpta ce are shown in fig 3 for tmpta tube a wide characteristic band at 3240 cm 1 is ascribed to nh stretching vibrations 39 the characteristic bands at 1550 and 1287 cm 1 are due to the cn vibration in the pyridine group and aromatic cnh stretching vibrations respectively 40 a band at 1639 cm 1 is assigned to co stretching vibration 41 in the spectrum of tmpta ce the nh stretching at 3240 cm 1 is significantly weakened and vibration band at 3400 cm 1 is greatly enhanced suggesting that they are involved in hydrogen bonding of nh py in addition the cn bond in the pyridine group at 1550 cm 1 is shifted to lower wavenumber at 1530 cm 1 confirming successful crosslinking of n atoms in the pyridine groups of tmpta tube to form pyridinium cations coc band at 1135 cm 1 of db18c6 groups in ce br also appears in tmpta ce suggesting the tmpta nanotubes were successfully functionalized with ce br groups solid state 13c nmr spectrum of tmpta tube and tmpta ce are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the 13c nmr spectrum of tmpta tube shows five resonance peaks due to the carbon atom of methylene group adjacent to pyridine ring 42 32 ppm pyridine ring atoms 125 02 135 40 and 149 58 ppm and the co group carbon atom 169 75 ppm respectively 42 44 after functionalization by ce br the newly formed resonance peaks at 68 67 and 60 95 ppm are attributed to carbon atoms of crown ether ring and the methylene group adjacent to pyridine rings suggesting the formation of pyridinium cations 41 in addition the resonance peak at 30 52 ppm may be due to the carbon atom of ch2 br groups in ce br indicating that not all the ch2 br groups can react with pyridine fig s3 supporting information the results confirm that ce br groups are immobilized on the surface of tmpta tube successfully to determine the content of ce br tmpta ce was dissolved in mixed solvent dmso d 6 dcl v v 1 1 for 1h nmr investigation the signals of ch2 of ce br are located at around 3 0 4 5 ppm the signals at 8 4 and 8 6 ppm are determined as ch on the pyridine ring and benzene ring respectively based on the calculation of peak area of the four peaks the molar ratio of ce br and tmpta tube is 1 8 fig s4 supporting information the results show that tmpta ce maintains the unique nanotubular structure of tmpta tube while the discrete tmpta molecules are interconnected via covalent capture into pyridinium polymers the polymers have positively charged pyridinium groups offering a cationic matrix of the nanotubular material importantly the nanotubular material has ce br functional groups thermogravimetric analysis tga was applied to study the thermal stability of tmpta tube and tmpta ce in n2 fig s5 supporting information the initial weight losses of tmpta tube and tmpta ce before 100 c are 6 4 and 2 9 respectively which is attributed to the release of the captured water or solvent molecules tmpta tube are thermally stable up to 330 c and its weight stabilizes at 78 4 at about 700 c the temperature at tmpta ce begins to lose weight decreases to 280 c and the final weight keeps stable up to 56 6 indicating that the thermal stability of tmpta tube after modification of ce is deceased due to the destruction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in tmpta tube which is in accordance with the xrd results n2 adsorption desorption isotherms show that bet surface area and total pore volume of tmpta ce are 15 0 m2 g and 0 067 cm3 g respectively after the adsorption of mo bet surface area and total pore volume of tmpta ce mo are lower than those of tmpta ce implying the steric hindrance from the phenyl rings of mo the bet surface area and total pore volume of the regenerated tmpta ce are similar with those of tmpta ce respectively indicating that the tmpta ce was retained its architectural features fig s6 and table s2 supporting information 3 3 adsorption of dyes water treatment performance was investigated for tmpta ce mo og and amaranth are anionic dyes and chosen as model dye pollutants the effect of ph of dye aqueous solution on the adsorption capacities of tmpta ce was first investigated fig 5a the initial ph was in the range of 4 0 10 0 the lower adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for the three dyes could be observed in both low and high phs when ph was 6 mo og and amaranth molecules mainly existed in the form of cationic form which could repel the positive tmpta ce 45 however when ph was higher than 7 mo og and amaranth molecules could be dissolved in the alkaline solutions decreasing the adsorption capacity of dye molecules the maximum adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for mo og and amaranth molecules were 554 17 722 65 and 326 81 mg g at ph 6 and 25 c respectively the adsorption process was determined by the zero point charge zpc of the adsorbent in aqueous solutions as shown in fig 5b the phzpc value of tmpta ce is positive when ph ranges from 4 0 to 9 0 implying the surface charge of tmpta ce was positive and it can enhance the adsorption of anionic dyes via electrostatic attraction effect acidic condition is also conducive to the formation of hydrogen bonds and positively charged surface therefore ph of 6 0 is selected for the adsorption study on mo og and amaranth respectively when the phzpc is above 9 0 it is negatively charged and the adsorption effect of anionic dyes is significantly decreased at high ph enhanced deprotonation can cause the adsorbent surface to be negatively charged and the electrostatic forces repel the adsorption of dye anions at the same time excess hydroxyl groups compete with dyes for active sites thus reducing adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in the actual wastewater the existence of cations may affect the adsorption capacity of adsorbate therefore the effect of different cations such as k na li ca2 and mg2 on the removal of anionic dyes was studied as shown in fig 5c there are obvious differences in adsorption capacity when different cations chloride salts coexist with the same concentration interestingly when k ions were present c 10 mmol l the adsorption capacities of mo og and amaranth were 774 96 924 48 and 496 06 mg g and increased from 554 71 722 65 and 326 82 mg g by 39 70 33 33 and 51 78 respectively compared with those in the absence of k ions in contrast addition of na li and ca2 ions had no significant effect on the adsorption of tmpta ce and the introduction of mg2 ions 10 mmol l into the dye solution significantly decreased the adsorption of tmpta ce to 463 95 524 09 and 247 06 mg g for mo og and amaranth respectively although the existence of positive charges can enhance the electrostatic interaction between anionic dyes and adsorbents the competitive adsorption of metal ions also has some available adsorption sites preventing the adsorption process 46 the observed cation effect depends on the aperture of crown ether and metal ions the aperture of db18c6 is about 0 26 0 32 nm which is very close to that of k cation diameter 0 266 nm therefore the addition of k ions can greatly enhance the electrostatic effect thus increasing the adsorption capacity of dyes based on electrostatics the bond strength formed is proportional to the ratio to charge to radius of metal divalent ions in their radii are in the order of mg2 ions ca2 ions implying that the binding ability of mg2 ions for tmpta ce is stronger than that of ca2 perhaps because mg2 ions has higher charge density and is solvated mg2 ions prohibits the adsorption of tmpta ce to dyes db18c6 can affect adsorption by formatting complexes of db18c6 with k ions on the adsorption sites on tmpta ce thus promoting complexes of k ions and anionic dyes due to the strong forces between positively charged k ions and negatively charged anionic dyes or phenols for adsorption of anionic dyes after the modification of ce br more db18c6 functional groups can form strong complexes with k ions on tmpta ce with anionic dyes in addition the pyridinium cations on the surface of tmpta ce also can enhance the adsorption of mo and the other anionic dyes via electrostatic attractive interactions from fig 5d adsorption capacities of mo og and amaranth were increased from 122 15 168 80 and 87 14 mg g to 802 23 924 48 and 496 06 mg g respectively the results indicated that tmpta ce provided db18c6 sites with k ions increasing the adsorption of anionic dyes the adsorption kinetics is helpful to understand the adsorption mechanism the adsorption performance of tmpta ce was studied by using mo as a model compound in the presence and absence of k ions respectively as shown in fig 6a the adsorption of mo in the aqueous solution with tmpta ce in the presence and absence of k ions was very quick attaining 93 6 and 88 5 of their adsorption capacities in 250 min respectively and then with the time going on the adsorption capacity became smooth and finally reached the adsorption equilibrium it was because abundant adsorption sites were available at the beginning of adsorption and decreased with the increasing time the maximum adsorption of tmpta ce for mo in the presence and absence of k ions were 813 0 and 546 4 mg g at 25 c respectively adsorption kinetics and kinetic parameters are shown in fig 6b fig s7 and table s3 supporting information the correlation coefficient r 2 of the pseudo second order dynamic model is above 0 99 which is much higher than those of pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion models the results imply that the adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order model better demonstrating that it is a chemisorption process 17 the adsorption rate of mo is larger in the presence of k ions than that of mo in the absence of k ions based on k 2 further confirming stronger electrostatic interaction between tmpta ce and mo interestingly q exp in the presence of k ions is superior to some known adsorbents in the treatment of dye wastewater table 1 langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models are applied to analyze the relationship between equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent and initial concentration of adsorbate which can give valuable information on adsorption mechanism the adsorption data at different temperatures are fitted according to the relation between c e and q e and the results are shown in fig 6c and summarized in table s4 supporting information the equilibrium adsorption of mo of tmpta ce increased quickly with increasing initial mo concentrations implying that high initial concentration can provide a strong driving force to decrease the mass transfer resistances of adsorbates meanwhile the decrease of the adsorption capacity with rising adsorption temperatures demonstrates an exothermic process in addition the fitting results of the linear langmuir isotherm model possess the highest correlation coefficients r 2 value of above 0 99 based on the r 2 values it indicates that the experimental data are fitted better with the langmuir model better than the other two models based on the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity is 952 3 942 3 and 925 9 mg g at 25 30 and 35 c respectively e a are 17 41 13 42 and 8 32 kj mol at 25 30 and 35 c respectively table s4 supporting information indicating that physical adsorption and ion exchange are main adsorption mechanism in the adsorption process of mo onto tmpta ce 60 the nonlinear fitting of the langmuir adsorption implies that the adsorption of mo on tmpta ce is a monolayer adsorption process 5 the adsorption thermodynamics parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were obtained from the data table s5 supporting information the δg values for the absorption process of mo by tmpta ce are negative demonstrating the spontaneous nature of the adsorption in the investigated temperature range however the increasing δg values with the increasing temperature suggest the adsorption process is more favorable at low temperature the negative δh demonstrates the exothermic nature for the adsorption for mo onto tmpta ce which is supported by the fact that the adsorption capacity decreases with rising temperature the low δh 6 995 kj mol 40 kj mol confirms a physisorption nature of the ion exchange which is effective during adsorption of mo on tmpta ce the negative δs indicates the decreased randomness at the solid interface in the adsorption process implying that the adsorption of mo onto tmpta ce is driven by enthalpy changes 3 4 adsorption of phenols the adsorption of phenols was also studied the adsorption kinetics of phenols using bpa and pnp as models in presence or absence of k ions by tmpta ce was studied in 100 mg l of bpa and pnp solution ph 6 at 25 c as shown in fig 7 in presence of k ions as the reaction time increased adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp increased rapidly at the early stage and then became slow until it reached equilibrium due to the saturation of adsorption sites the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp reached the maximum values which were 105 69 and 98 03 mg g after 360 min respectively in comparison in the absence of k ions the maximum adsorption amounts of bpa and pnp were 82 50 and 68 14 mg g respectively after 360 min the results show that the existence of k ions can also increase the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively pseudo first order pseudo second order and internal diffusion models were used to fit the kinetics data fig s8 supporting information the fitted kinetics parameters of these models are shown in table s6 supporting information compared with the pseudo first order and internal diffusion models the pseudo second order model provides higher r 2 above 0 97 suggesting that the adsorption of bpa and pnp by tmpta ce are in agreement with the pseudo second order model better table s6 the experimental q e exp 105 69 for bpa and 98 03 mg g for pnp in the presence of k ions is well consistent with the calculated q e cal 106 60 for bpa and 97 94 mg g for pnp of the pseudo second order model noticeably the straight lines of bpa and pnp adsorption do not cross the origin demonstrating that the diffusion of bpa and pnp into the intra particle space are main but not the only rate controlling step in the adsorption process 61 62 a comparison of the bpa and pnp adsorption capacities of relevant adsorbents table 2 3 5 regeneration and sensitivity from the viewpoint of industrial application the adsorbent regeneration is one of the most important factors for being an applicable adsorbent in order to evaluate the stability of tmpta ce a five run recycle experiment was performed after tmpta ce was saturated in the mo solution it was rinsed with a methanol solution containing naoh 0 01 mol l to eliminate mo followed by washing with deionized water to remove residual methanol and naoh respectively dried and the regenerated tmpta ce was used for the repeated adsorption desorption cycles to evaluate its adsorption capacity with the fresh adsorbent the regeneration experiments of tmpta ce for the mo adsorption are shown in fig 8 excellent adsorption capacity of 802 23 mg g with adsorption removing efficiency of 99 5 was achieved within the first circle adsorption capacity could still maintain 757 54 mg g and removing efficiency was above 95 after 5 cycles in addition adsorption of mo at the different concentrations was also performed the results showed that adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for mo were 1203 14 21 70 and 25 32 0 23 mg g at 1000 and 0 1 mg l respectively the results indicate that tmpta ce had good regenerability and sensitivity implying that it suitable to adsorb dyes from industrial wastewaters 3 6 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism was studied for tmpta ce the surface elemental analysis of tmpta tube tmpta ce and tmpta ce mo was performed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig s9 supporting information the full range xps spectra indicate the presence of c o and n for tmpta tube c o br and n for tmpta ce and c o br s and n for tmpta ce mo the quantitative data indicate that the oxygen percentage at the surface in tmpta tube is about 4 6 while in the case of tmpta ce the percentage increases up to 10 because tmpta ce has more co groups in addition the presence of br3d was detected at the surface of tmpta ce therefore the successful functionalization of dibenzo 18 crown 6 onto the surface of tmpta tube was proved after mo adsorption s2p was observed on the surface of tmpta ce mo the decrease of br3d indicates that br anions are replaced by mo molecules the results indicate that the adsorption of mo on tmpta ce for tmpta tube the n1s xps spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks at 388 4 and 398 4 ev which are due to nh c o pyridine n respectively 70 in the c1s spectrum of tmpta ce the area ratio of pyridine n nhco peaks increases from 13 to 42 indicating the formation of pyridine n linkages as dibenzo 18 crown 6 groups have been functionalzed successfully for tmpta ce mo the decrease in the area of pyridine n and nhco were observed and the new peaks at 402 4 ev and 399 7 ev are attributed to pyridinium n and nn respectively implying that mo can be adsorped on tmpta tube on the other hand the c1s xps bands exhibit three strong peaks at 284 7 285 6 and 287 8 ev which are due to cc cn and co respectively 71 for tmpta ce a new small peak at 286 2 ev assigned to coc was observed implying dibenzo 18 crown 6 is attached onto the surface of tmpta tube for tmpta ce mo the new peak at 284 8 ev due to c so3 is present in addition of cc co cn and co indicating the prescence of mo for tmpta tube the o1s spectrum exhibits a strong peak at 531 4 ev due to oc in case of tmpta ce a peak at 532 8 ev corresponds to coc indicating that dibenzo 18 crown 6 was attached onto the surface of tmpta tube for tmpta ce mo o 1s xps spectrum is fitted with up to four distinguishable oxygen containing functional groups at 533 2 532 9 531 5 and 530 8 ev which are due to oc oc oc and chemsorped o repectively from the xps results it can be inferred that mo are adsorbed onto tmpta ce through noncovalent interactions to confirm the weak interaction between mo and tmpta ce ftir spectra of tmpta ce before and after the adsorption of mo are compared fig s10 supporting information in the spectrum of tmpta ce the adsorption peak at 3407 8 cm 1 was due to nh groups compared with tmpta ce there is a shift from 3407 8 to 3396 4 cm 1 for hydrogen bonding in the spectrum of tmpta ce mo and the vibration weakens in intensity such red shift in the bonds of various polar groups e g nh is applied to confirm hydrogen bonding interactions in the solid state for tmpta ce mo the carbonyl stretching is shifted to lower wavenumber 1643 cm 1 compared to tmpta ce which is typically observed for intermolecular h bonding therefore the intermolecular hydrogen bonding is present during the adsorption process based on the above results the mechanism of mo adsorption onto tmpta ce is proposed in fig 9 tmpta ce displays excellent adsorption towards mo in batch adsorption processes the results indicate that the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction are proved to play a key role in mo adsorption then the hydrophobic interaction also can promote the mo migration from aqueous solution to the surface of tmpta ce finally mo is captured onto the surface by the dispersion force the significant change of the surface functional groups on tmpta ce during the adsorption process is confirmed with ftir and xps results synergistic effect of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction played a significant role for mo adsorption and the electrostatic attraction is a decisive factor for mo adsorption which is in accordance with the previously reported results 72 75 importantly k ions form host guest complexes with crown ether groups which is beneficial for the adsorption of mo 4 conclusions in summary organic nanotubes self assembled from multi pyridyl based tmpta have been functionalized with db18c6 groups to obtain crown ether functionalized tmpta nanotubes tmpta ce the as synthesized tmpta ce has unique nanotubular and positively charged pyridinium network structure together with db18c6 functional groups tmpta ce exhibits superior adsorption ability towards anionic dyes and phenols remarkably k ions form complexes with the db18c6 groups to enhance the adsorption of mo and bpa among various cations its maximum adsorption capacity for mo was 802 23 mg g in the presence of k ions at ph 6 and 25 c tmpta ce also exhibits good affinity for phenols including bpa and pnp the adsorption of bpa and pnp by tmpta ce is up to 105 69 and 98 03 mg g respectively with the removal efficiency of 99 in the presence of k ions the existence of k ions can improve the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively moreover adsorption capacity could still maintain 757 54 mg g and removing efficiency was above 95 after 5 cycles implying its practical application in wastewater the adsorption on tmpta ce is driven by synergistic effects of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction due to their well fitted sizes k cations can firmly encapsulate into the cavity of db18c6 and then the host guest complexes can absorb negatively charged anion guests through electrostatic attraction thus greatly improving the adsorption performance of tmpta ce this work may provide a way to improve materials adsorption performance of real wastewater systems with coexisting contaminants credit authorship contribution statement zujin yang conceptualization investigation visualization writing

12719,toxic organic pollutants including dyes and phenols in effluent have not be treated efficiently by traditional wastewater methods herein a novel nanotubular material was prepared successfully via supramolecular self assembly of n n n 3 methylpyridine benzenetriamide tmpta and further modified with dibenzo 18 crown 6 groups to obtain crown ether functionalized nanotubes tmpta ce the crown ether based tmpta ce shows a unique cavity structure positively charged pyridinium groups and especially favorite crown ether cation host guest interactions the crown ether based material as an adsorbent exhibits superior synergistic adsorption ability towards anionic dyes and phenols the maximum adsorption capacities of mo bpa and pnp for tmpta ce reached 802 23 105 69 and 98 03 mg g respectively with the removal efficiency of 99 the existence of k ions can improve the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively notably no significant change in adsorption efficiency was observed after 5 repeated adsorption desorption cycles mechanism studies shows that synergistic effect of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction played a significant role for the adsorption of anionic dyes and phenols the results shows that the as synthesized tmpta ce adsorbent with a simple efficient and low cost synthetic process has potential application in practical wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic nanotubes crown ether adsorption dyes phenols data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is one of the world s most important substances on earth with the rapid development of chemical activities water contamination by various toxic pollutants such as heavy metals dyes pharmaceuticals and other aromatic compounds has attracted wide attention 1 4 among these pollutants organic dyes are the most widely used ones due to their extensive applications in textile printing wood cosmetics plastics and leather industries 5 6 in recent decades 100 000 commercial dyes are available in the market about 1 million tons are produced every year of which textile dyes are about 50 and 2 of these dyes are left in wastewater and discharged into water environment 7 among the organic dyes most of them are teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic to human health due to the presence of aromatic rings in their structure if not treated properly from industrial wastewater the cationic dyes in the environment may cause significantly potential hazard to environment and public health even at very low concentrations for example they can cause serious damage to human beings such as liver brain dysfunction of the kidney reproductive system and central nervous system 8 10 dyes in the aqueous solution can also reduce the penetration of sunlight disrupting the biological processes 11 12 in addition dyes and heavy metal ions usually coexist in industrial wastewater for example the presence of cd2 hg2 pb2 and cu2 in industrial effluents may cause increasingly serious damage to the environment and ecosystem 13 15 therefore removing these contaminants from wastewater for the scientists and government legislation is an urgent and challenging task recently various methods have been reported for the remediation of these pollutants from wastewater including precipitation adsorption membrane filtration ion exchange electrochemical process and oxidation 1 5 6 16 18 among them adsorption is an efficient method to remove cationic dyes from the aqueous media due to its high efficiency cost effective easy operation and without byproducts 13 19 21 a variety of common porous adsorbents including chitosan activated carbon microcrystalline cellulose zeolite polymer resin metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs were reported for the removal of cationic dyes from the contaminated water bodies 5 22 24 however real application of the adsorbents in industrial effluents has been limited by their low efficiency difficult regeneration time consuming and complicated preparation method therefore developing new and efficient adsorbents for the rapid capture and removal of the dyes has become the focus of current research organic nanotubes have been well developed as a unique family of porous nanomaterials which are mainly prepared by supramolecular assembly of low molecular weight molecules 25 27 they have one dimensional nano sized channels and high affinity for various organic dyes via noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding π π stacking van der waals force etc 28 30 organic nanotubes show potential as adsorbents in wastewater treatment due to their hierarchical structure and structure functional diversity however low adsorption capacities and poor stability in aqueous solution hinder their widespread application crown ethers functionalization is a simple and efficient method to modify the surface of the nanotubes the nanotubes can exhibit high adsorption selectivity for metal ions 31 crown ethers are a group of important host molecules with two important configurations i e d 3d and c i conformations which have negatively polarized oxygen atoms and different cavity sizes 32 crown ethers can form stable complexes with the different metal ions that strongly depend on the crown ether size so they can selectively bind various ions such as k li and na 33 owing to its high selectivity crown ethers based adsorbents has received considerable attention duman et al 34 investigated benzo 18 crown 6 b18c6 immobilized activated carbon cloth for the removal of cr3 co2 and ni2 ions from wastewater and it has the maximum adsorption capacity of 0 22 mmol g co3 ion eliseo et al 35 used oh dibenzo 14 crown 4 oh db14c4 modified multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts as adsorbent for the uptake of li ions achieving the adsorption capacity of 5 4 mg g in this study dibenzo 18 crown 6 db18c6 is introduced into the organic nanotubes assembled from multi pyridyl based n n n tris 3 methylpyridyl trimesic amide tmpta to obtain stable functional nanotubes tmpta ce tmpta nanotubes were chosen because electrophiles may readily attack preferably at the n atom of pyridyl groups to form stable polymeric structures db18c6 is an important crown ether compound and it can selectively capture alkali metal ions from solution db18c6 exhibits the better binding selectivity for k ions than other metal ions in solution phase based on the monte carlo simulation 36 the presence of db18c6 groups in tmpta ce allows host guest interactions by the size of macrocyclic cavity which can improve the adsorption performance towards metal ions due to cyclic polyethyleneglycols anionic dyes are further scavenged from the aqueous solution by electrostatic interactions between metal ions and dye anions together with the framework positive charges strong electrostatic interactions with metal ions charged positively π π interaction hydrogen bonding and synergistic interaction and cationic dyes obviously contribute to adsorption therefore the cationic tmpta ce containing pyridinium groups can be a class of promising materials for the removal of cationic organic pollutants herein we report a novel cationic pyridinium based tmpta ce for the adsorption of dyes mo og and amaranth and phenols bpa and pnp adsorption mechanism was also studied in detail by ftir and xps 2 experimental section 2 1 materials chemicals solvents and reagents used in the experiment were purchased in analytical grade and used without further purification unless otherwise stated deionized water was used throughout all the experiments tmpta was synthesized from trimesic acid and 3 aminomethyl pyridine according to the literature procedure 37 2 3 13 14 tetrakis bromomethyl dibenzo 18 crown 6 ce br was synthesized through the bromomethylation of commercially available db18c6 as reported in the previous procedure 38 2 2 characterization the surface morphology of tmpta ce before and after adsorption was observed using a scanning electron microscope at 20 0 kv sem s5200 hitachi tokyo japan and a transmission electron microscopy operating at 80 kv tem jem 1010 jeol tokyo japan respectively surface chemistry of the samples was analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker tensor 27 as kbr pressed pellets in the range of 4000 400cm 1 at 4 0cm 1 resolution 13c cp mas nmr spectra were recorded on bruker avance ii 500 using 4 mm solid cp mas probe

rate of 10 c min 1 from 25 c to 800 c in n2 atmosphere the specific surface area was measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the pore size distribution was evaluated with density functional theory dft method by n2 adsorption desorption measurements using a micromeritics asap 2020 instrument at 196 c xps was used to examine the surface chemical state and elemental compositions with an xis ultra xps from kratos analytical manchester uk with al κα as the radiation source at 15 kv and 15 ma the static charge effect was compensated using the c1s peak at 284 80 ev the zeta potential ζ values were obtained via a zeta sizer nano series nano zs90 malvern uk under different ph values 4 0 9 0 2 3 synthesis of tmpta tube for tmpta tube 84 mg of tmpta was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol 2 4 ml and the solution was dropped into water 120 ml at room temperature rt under vigorous stirring for 1 min the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol in sequence and then dried under vacuum at 60 c for 24 h to give tmpta tube in 83 yield 2 4 synthesis of tmpta ce 300 mg of tmpta tube was added to a solution of 60 mg of ce br in dry chcl3 30 ml and kept at rt for 48 h without agitation under n2 atmosphere the product was washed with ethanol and then washed with distilled water the washed materials were dried at 60 c in vacuum for 24 h to get light yellow solid tmpta ce yield 80 2 5 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were performed in 100 ml glass bottle in a constant temperature shaker at 120 rpm containing 50 ml solution of dyes or phenols a typical procedure is as follows a certain amount of adsorbent 5 mg was dispersed in 50 ml of 100 mg l mo solution ph 7 containing 10 mmol l of k ions and the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 25 c after that 1 ml supernatant samples were withdrawn from mixture filtered by using 0 22 μm microporous membrane and diluted to 10 ml the concentrations of mo solution before and after absorption was determined with uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu and adsorption capacity at equilibrium q e was calculated by using standard calibration curve adsorption behavior of different metal ions was also tested under the same conditions and the remaining metal ions in the solutions were determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy aas varian aa 240 fs the effect of ph on adsorption was adjusted to a range of 4 10 with 1 mol l hcl or naoh all the experiments were tested in triplicate and the deviation was within 5 the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g transient fractional adsorption capacity q t mg g and removal rate r of adsorbents are determined according to the following equations 1 q e c 0 c e m v 0 2 q t c 0 c t m v 0 3 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where q e mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium c o c t and c e mg l are initial transient time t and equilibrium concentration of dyes or phenols respectively v is the solution volume of dyes or phenols ml and m is the dry weight of adsorbent g 3 results and discussion some methods have been reported for the removal of dyes from industrial wastewater each of these methods have inherent limitations as shown in table s1 supporting information adsorption is an efficient process for wastewater treatment and the development of new and efficient adsorbents is particularly critical in the present work tmpta was used as the c 3 symmetrical gelator to construct nanotubular structures further post modified via ce br ce br would bridge between two adjacent pyridyl groups on different tmpta units to achieve a stable polymers the nanotube structure will contain a continuous network of covalent bonds via the tubular network after modification thus making it greater structural stability and generating charged surfaces the synthetic procedure to tmpta ce is shown in fig 1 firstly tmpta nanotubes were obtained using an anti solvent induced instant gelation method with appropriate modification tmpta tube was further modified with ce br via nucleophilic addition reaction to obtain tmpta ce finally the pyridyl groups of tmpta were alkylated with bromoalkyl groups of ce br to generate cationic pyridynium polymeric networks achieving modification of tmpta tube with dibenzo 18 crown 6 functional groups in general the synthesis of tmpta ce is a cost effective efficient and industrially feasible process 3 1 morphology sem was used to study the morphology of the material before and after modification as shown in fig 2a b tmpta tube has long tubular structures with smooth surface and open ends with diameter of 300 800 nm and thickness of about 50 nm after modification sem reveals that tmpta ce maintains tubular structures with outer diameters in the range of 250 700 nm and thickness of about 40 nm implying that tmpta ce has no obvious difference from the tmpta tube fig 2c d tem results clearly confirm the outer wall and inner hollow structure of tmpta tube before and after modification fig 2e f eds was also applied to study the nucleophilic reaction of tmpta with ce br as functional groups eds patterns indicate that the tmpta tube is mostly composed of two elements c and o furthermore eds mapping of the elemental composition shows c o and br to be dispersed on the surface of tmpta ce implying successful modification of ce br onto the surface of tmpta tube fig s1 supporting information 3 2 structure powder x ray diffraction xrd pattern of tmpta tube indicates diffraction peaks implying the existence of crystalline regions in tmpta tube fig s2 supporting information after functionalization the diffraction peaks from tmpta tube disappeared and a large packet peak was recorded for tmpta ce indicating that the functionalization process destroys the ordered arrangement and tmpta tube changes from long range order to amorphous structure ftir spectra of tmpta tube and tmpta ce are shown in fig 3 for tmpta tube a wide characteristic band at 3240 cm 1 is ascribed to nh stretching vibrations 39 the characteristic bands at 1550 and 1287 cm 1 are due to the cn vibration in the pyridine group and aromatic cnh stretching vibrations respectively 40 a band at 1639 cm 1 is assigned to co stretching vibration 41 in the spectrum of tmpta ce the nh stretching at 3240 cm 1 is significantly weakened and vibration band at 3400 cm 1 is greatly enhanced suggesting that they are involved in hydrogen bonding of nh py in addition the cn bond in the pyridine group at 1550 cm 1 is shifted to lower wavenumber at 1530 cm 1 confirming successful crosslinking of n atoms in the pyridine groups of tmpta tube to form pyridinium cations coc band at 1135 cm 1 of db18c6 groups in ce br also appears in tmpta ce suggesting the tmpta nanotubes were successfully functionalized with ce br groups solid state 13c nmr spectrum of tmpta tube and tmpta ce are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a the 13c nmr spectrum of tmpta tube shows five resonance peaks due to the carbon atom of methylene group adjacent to pyridine ring 42 32 ppm pyridine ring atoms 125 02 135 40 and 149 58 ppm and the co group carbon atom 169 75 ppm respectively 42 44 after functionalization by ce br the newly formed resonance peaks at 68 67 and 60 95 ppm are attributed to carbon atoms of crown ether ring and the methylene group adjacent to pyridine rings suggesting the formation of pyridinium cations 41 in addition the resonance peak at 30 52 ppm may be due to the carbon atom of ch2 br groups in ce br indicating that not all the ch2 br groups can react with pyridine fig s3 supporting information the results confirm that ce br groups are immobilized on the surface of tmpta tube successfully to determine the content of ce br tmpta ce was dissolved in mixed solvent dmso d 6 dcl v v 1 1 for 1h nmr investigation the signals of ch2 of ce br are located at around 3 0 4 5 ppm the signals at 8 4 and 8 6 ppm are determined as ch on the pyridine ring and benzene ring respectively based on the calculation of peak area of the four peaks the molar ratio of ce br and tmpta tube is 1 8 fig s4 supporting information the results show that tmpta ce maintains the unique nanotubular structure of tmpta tube while the discrete tmpta molecules are interconnected via covalent capture into pyridinium polymers the polymers have positively charged pyridinium groups offering a cationic matrix of the nanotubular material importantly the nanotubular material has ce br functional groups thermogravimetric analysis tga was applied to study the thermal stability of tmpta tube and tmpta ce in n2 fig s5 supporting information the initial weight losses of tmpta tube and tmpta ce before 100 c are 6 4 and 2 9 respectively which is attributed to the release of the captured water or solvent molecules tmpta tube are thermally stable up to 330 c and its weight stabilizes at 78 4 at about 700 c the temperature at tmpta ce begins to lose weight decreases to 280 c and the final weight keeps stable up to 56 6 indicating that the thermal stability of tmpta tube after modification of ce is deceased due to the destruction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in tmpta tube which is in accordance with the xrd results n2 adsorption desorption isotherms show that bet surface area and total pore volume of tmpta ce are 15 0 m2 g and 0 067 cm3 g respectively after the adsorption of mo bet surface area and total pore volume of tmpta ce mo are lower than those of tmpta ce implying the steric hindrance from the phenyl rings of mo the bet surface area and total pore volume of the regenerated tmpta ce are similar with those of tmpta ce respectively indicating that the tmpta ce was retained its architectural features fig s6 and table s2 supporting information 3 3 adsorption of dyes water treatment performance was investigated for tmpta ce mo og and amaranth are anionic dyes and chosen as model dye pollutants the effect of ph of dye aqueous solution on the adsorption capacities of tmpta ce was first investigated fig 5a the initial ph was in the range of 4 0 10 0 the lower adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for the three dyes could be observed in both low and high phs when ph was 6 mo og and amaranth molecules mainly existed in the form of cationic form which could repel the positive tmpta ce 45 however when ph was higher than 7 mo og and amaranth molecules could be dissolved in the alkaline solutions decreasing the adsorption capacity of dye molecules the maximum adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for mo og and amaranth molecules were 554 17 722 65 and 326 81 mg g at ph 6 and 25 c respectively the adsorption process was determined by the zero point charge zpc of the adsorbent in aqueous solutions as shown in fig 5b the phzpc value of tmpta ce is positive when ph ranges from 4 0 to 9 0 implying the surface charge of tmpta ce was positive and it can enhance the adsorption of anionic dyes via electrostatic attraction effect acidic condition is also conducive to the formation of hydrogen bonds and positively charged surface therefore ph of 6 0 is selected for the adsorption study on mo og and amaranth respectively when the phzpc is above 9 0 it is negatively charged and the adsorption effect of anionic dyes is significantly decreased at high ph enhanced deprotonation can cause the adsorbent surface to be negatively charged and the electrostatic forces repel the adsorption of dye anions at the same time excess hydroxyl groups compete with dyes for active sites thus reducing adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in the actual wastewater the existence of cations may affect the adsorption capacity of adsorbate therefore the effect of different cations such as k na li ca2 and mg2 on the removal of anionic dyes was studied as shown in fig 5c there are obvious differences in adsorption capacity when different cations chloride salts coexist with the same concentration interestingly when k ions were present c 10 mmol l the adsorption capacities of mo og and amaranth were 774 96 924 48 and 496 06 mg g and increased from 554 71 722 65 and 326 82 mg g by 39 70 33 33 and 51 78 respectively compared with those in the absence of k ions in contrast addition of na li and ca2 ions had no significant effect on the adsorption of tmpta ce and the introduction of mg2 ions 10 mmol l into the dye solution significantly decreased the adsorption of tmpta ce to 463 95 524 09 and 247 06 mg g for mo og and amaranth respectively although the existence of positive charges can enhance the electrostatic interaction between anionic dyes and adsorbents the competitive adsorption of metal ions also has some available adsorption sites preventing the adsorption process 46 the observed cation effect depends on the aperture of crown ether and metal ions the aperture of db18c6 is about 0 26 0 32 nm which is very close to that of k cation diameter 0 266 nm therefore the addition of k ions can greatly enhance the electrostatic effect thus increasing the adsorption capacity of dyes based on electrostatics the bond strength formed is proportional to the ratio to charge to radius of metal divalent ions in their radii are in the order of mg2 ions ca2 ions implying that the binding ability of mg2 ions for tmpta ce is stronger than that of ca2 perhaps because mg2 ions has higher charge density and is solvated mg2 ions prohibits the adsorption of tmpta ce to dyes db18c6 can affect adsorption by formatting complexes of db18c6 with k ions on the adsorption sites on tmpta ce thus promoting complexes of k ions and anionic dyes due to the strong forces between positively charged k ions and negatively charged anionic dyes or phenols for adsorption of anionic dyes after the modification of ce br more db18c6 functional groups can form strong complexes with k ions on tmpta ce with anionic dyes in addition the pyridinium cations on the surface of tmpta ce also can enhance the adsorption of mo and the other anionic dyes via electrostatic attractive interactions from fig 5d adsorption capacities of mo og and amaranth were increased from 122 15 168 80 and 87 14 mg g to 802 23 924 48 and 496 06 mg g respectively the results indicated that tmpta ce provided db18c6 sites with k ions increasing the adsorption of anionic dyes the adsorption kinetics is helpful to understand the adsorption mechanism the adsorption performance of tmpta ce was studied by using mo as a model compound in the presence and absence of k ions respectively as shown in fig 6a the adsorption of mo in the aqueous solution with tmpta ce in the presence and absence of k ions was very quick attaining 93 6 and 88 5 of their adsorption capacities in 250 min respectively and then with the time going on the adsorption capacity became smooth and finally reached the adsorption equilibrium it was because abundant adsorption sites were available at the beginning of adsorption and decreased with the increasing time the maximum adsorption of tmpta ce for mo in the presence and absence of k ions were 813 0 and 546 4 mg g at 25 c respectively adsorption kinetics and kinetic parameters are shown in fig 6b fig s7 and table s3 supporting information the correlation coefficient r 2 of the pseudo second order dynamic model is above 0 99 which is much higher than those of pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion models the results imply that the adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order model better demonstrating that it is a chemisorption process 17 the adsorption rate of mo is larger in the presence of k ions than that of mo in the absence of k ions based on k 2 further confirming stronger electrostatic interaction between tmpta ce and mo interestingly q exp in the presence of k ions is superior to some known adsorbents in the treatment of dye wastewater table 1 langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r models are applied to analyze the relationship between equilibrium adsorption capacity of adsorbent and initial concentration of adsorbate which can give valuable information on adsorption mechanism the adsorption data at different temperatures are fitted according to the relation between c e and q e and the results are shown in fig 6c and summarized in table s4 supporting information the equilibrium adsorption of mo of tmpta ce increased quickly with increasing initial mo concentrations implying that high initial concentration can provide a strong driving force to decrease the mass transfer resistances of adsorbates meanwhile the decrease of the adsorption capacity with rising adsorption temperatures demonstrates an exothermic process in addition the fitting results of the linear langmuir isotherm model possess the highest correlation coefficients r 2 value of above 0 99 based on the r 2 values it indicates that the experimental data are fitted better with the langmuir model better than the other two models based on the langmuir model the maximum adsorption capacity is 952 3 942 3 and 925 9 mg g at 25 30 and 35 c respectively e a are 17 41 13 42 and 8 32 kj mol at 25 30 and 35 c respectively table s4 supporting information indicating that physical adsorption and ion exchange are main adsorption mechanism in the adsorption process of mo onto tmpta ce 60 the nonlinear fitting of the langmuir adsorption implies that the adsorption of mo on tmpta ce is a monolayer adsorption process 5 the adsorption thermodynamics parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were obtained from the data table s5 supporting information the δg values for the absorption process of mo by tmpta ce are negative demonstrating the spontaneous nature of the adsorption in the investigated temperature range however the increasing δg values with the increasing temperature suggest the adsorption process is more favorable at low temperature the negative δh demonstrates the exothermic nature for the adsorption for mo onto tmpta ce which is supported by the fact that the adsorption capacity decreases with rising temperature the low δh 6 995 kj mol 40 kj mol confirms a physisorption nature of the ion exchange which is effective during adsorption of mo on tmpta ce the negative δs indicates the decreased randomness at the solid interface in the adsorption process implying that the adsorption of mo onto tmpta ce is driven by enthalpy changes 3 4 adsorption of phenols the adsorption of phenols was also studied the adsorption kinetics of phenols using bpa and pnp as models in presence or absence of k ions by tmpta ce was studied in 100 mg l of bpa and pnp solution ph 6 at 25 c as shown in fig 7 in presence of k ions as the reaction time increased adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp increased rapidly at the early stage and then became slow until it reached equilibrium due to the saturation of adsorption sites the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp reached the maximum values which were 105 69 and 98 03 mg g after 360 min respectively in comparison in the absence of k ions the maximum adsorption amounts of bpa and pnp were 82 50 and 68 14 mg g respectively after 360 min the results show that the existence of k ions can also increase the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively pseudo first order pseudo second order and internal diffusion models were used to fit the kinetics data fig s8 supporting information the fitted kinetics parameters of these models are shown in table s6 supporting information compared with the pseudo first order and internal diffusion models the pseudo second order model provides higher r 2 above 0 97 suggesting that the adsorption of bpa and pnp by tmpta ce are in agreement with the pseudo second order model better table s6 the experimental q e exp 105 69 for bpa and 98 03 mg g for pnp in the presence of k ions is well consistent with the calculated q e cal 106 60 for bpa and 97 94 mg g for pnp of the pseudo second order model noticeably the straight lines of bpa and pnp adsorption do not cross the origin demonstrating that the diffusion of bpa and pnp into the intra particle space are main but not the only rate controlling step in the adsorption process 61 62 a comparison of the bpa and pnp adsorption capacities of relevant adsorbents table 2 3 5 regeneration and sensitivity from the viewpoint of industrial application the adsorbent regeneration is one of the most important factors for being an applicable adsorbent in order to evaluate the stability of tmpta ce a five run recycle experiment was performed after tmpta ce was saturated in the mo solution it was rinsed with a methanol solution containing naoh 0 01 mol l to eliminate mo followed by washing with deionized water to remove residual methanol and naoh respectively dried and the regenerated tmpta ce was used for the repeated adsorption desorption cycles to evaluate its adsorption capacity with the fresh adsorbent the regeneration experiments of tmpta ce for the mo adsorption are shown in fig 8 excellent adsorption capacity of 802 23 mg g with adsorption removing efficiency of 99 5 was achieved within the first circle adsorption capacity could still maintain 757 54 mg g and removing efficiency was above 95 after 5 cycles in addition adsorption of mo at the different concentrations was also performed the results showed that adsorption capacities of tmpta ce for mo were 1203 14 21 70 and 25 32 0 23 mg g at 1000 and 0 1 mg l respectively the results indicate that tmpta ce had good regenerability and sensitivity implying that it suitable to adsorb dyes from industrial wastewaters 3 6 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism was studied for tmpta ce the surface elemental analysis of tmpta tube tmpta ce and tmpta ce mo was performed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig s9 supporting information the full range xps spectra indicate the presence of c o and n for tmpta tube c o br and n for tmpta ce and c o br s and n for tmpta ce mo the quantitative data indicate that the oxygen percentage at the surface in tmpta tube is about 4 6 while in the case of tmpta ce the percentage increases up to 10 because tmpta ce has more co groups in addition the presence of br3d was detected at the surface of tmpta ce therefore the successful functionalization of dibenzo 18 crown 6 onto the surface of tmpta tube was proved after mo adsorption s2p was observed on the surface of tmpta ce mo the decrease of br3d indicates that br anions are replaced by mo molecules the results indicate that the adsorption of mo on tmpta ce for tmpta tube the n1s xps spectrum is deconvoluted into two peaks at 388 4 and 398 4 ev which are due to nh c o pyridine n respectively 70 in the c1s spectrum of tmpta ce the area ratio of pyridine n nhco peaks increases from 13 to 42 indicating the formation of pyridine n linkages as dibenzo 18 crown 6 groups have been functionalzed successfully for tmpta ce mo the decrease in the area of pyridine n and nhco were observed and the new peaks at 402 4 ev and 399 7 ev are attributed to pyridinium n and nn respectively implying that mo can be adsorped on tmpta tube on the other hand the c1s xps bands exhibit three strong peaks at 284 7 285 6 and 287 8 ev which are due to cc cn and co respectively 71 for tmpta ce a new small peak at 286 2 ev assigned to coc was observed implying dibenzo 18 crown 6 is attached onto the surface of tmpta tube for tmpta ce mo the new peak at 284 8 ev due to c so3 is present in addition of cc co cn and co indicating the prescence of mo for tmpta tube the o1s spectrum exhibits a strong peak at 531 4 ev due to oc in case of tmpta ce a peak at 532 8 ev corresponds to coc indicating that dibenzo 18 crown 6 was attached onto the surface of tmpta tube for tmpta ce mo o 1s xps spectrum is fitted with up to four distinguishable oxygen containing functional groups at 533 2 532 9 531 5 and 530 8 ev which are due to oc oc oc and chemsorped o repectively from the xps results it can be inferred that mo are adsorbed onto tmpta ce through noncovalent interactions to confirm the weak interaction between mo and tmpta ce ftir spectra of tmpta ce before and after the adsorption of mo are compared fig s10 supporting information in the spectrum of tmpta ce the adsorption peak at 3407 8 cm 1 was due to nh groups compared with tmpta ce there is a shift from 3407 8 to 3396 4 cm 1 for hydrogen bonding in the spectrum of tmpta ce mo and the vibration weakens in intensity such red shift in the bonds of various polar groups e g nh is applied to confirm hydrogen bonding interactions in the solid state for tmpta ce mo the carbonyl stretching is shifted to lower wavenumber 1643 cm 1 compared to tmpta ce which is typically observed for intermolecular h bonding therefore the intermolecular hydrogen bonding is present during the adsorption process based on the above results the mechanism of mo adsorption onto tmpta ce is proposed in fig 9 tmpta ce displays excellent adsorption towards mo in batch adsorption processes the results indicate that the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction are proved to play a key role in mo adsorption then the hydrophobic interaction also can promote the mo migration from aqueous solution to the surface of tmpta ce finally mo is captured onto the surface by the dispersion force the significant change of the surface functional groups on tmpta ce during the adsorption process is confirmed with ftir and xps results synergistic effect of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction played a significant role for mo adsorption and the electrostatic attraction is a decisive factor for mo adsorption which is in accordance with the previously reported results 72 75 importantly k ions form host guest complexes with crown ether groups which is beneficial for the adsorption of mo 4 conclusions in summary organic nanotubes self assembled from multi pyridyl based tmpta have been functionalized with db18c6 groups to obtain crown ether functionalized tmpta nanotubes tmpta ce the as synthesized tmpta ce has unique nanotubular and positively charged pyridinium network structure together with db18c6 functional groups tmpta ce exhibits superior adsorption ability towards anionic dyes and phenols remarkably k ions form complexes with the db18c6 groups to enhance the adsorption of mo and bpa among various cations its maximum adsorption capacity for mo was 802 23 mg g in the presence of k ions at ph 6 and 25 c tmpta ce also exhibits good affinity for phenols including bpa and pnp the adsorption of bpa and pnp by tmpta ce is up to 105 69 and 98 03 mg g respectively with the removal efficiency of 99 in the presence of k ions the existence of k ions can improve the adsorption capacities of bpa and pnp by about 28 14 and 42 82 respectively moreover adsorption capacity could still maintain 757 54 mg g and removing efficiency was above 95 after 5 cycles implying its practical application in wastewater the adsorption on tmpta ce is driven by synergistic effects of π π interaction electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction due to their well fitted sizes k cations can firmly encapsulate into the cavity of db18c6 and then the host guest complexes can absorb negatively charged anion guests through electrostatic attraction thus greatly improving the adsorption performance of tmpta ce this work may provide a way to improve materials adsorption performance of real wastewater systems with coexisting contaminants credit authorship contribution statement zujin yang conceptualization investigation visualization writing
