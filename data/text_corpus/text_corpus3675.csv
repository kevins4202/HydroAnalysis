18375,nitrate production during anammox can decrease total nitrogen removal efficiency which will negatively impact its usefulness for the removal of nitrogen from waste streams however neither the performance characteristics nor physiological shifts associated with nitrate accumulation in anammox reactors under different nitrogen loading rates nlrs is well understood consequently these parameters were studied in a lower nlr anammox reactor termed r1 producing higher than expected levels of nitrate and compared with a higher nlr reactor termed r2 showing no excess nitrate production while both reactors showed high nh4 n removal efficiencies 90 the total nitrogen removal efficiency 60 was much lower in r1 due to higher nitrate production metagenomic analysis found that the number of reads derived from anammox bacteria were significantly higher in r2 another notable trend in reads occurrence was the relatively higher levels of reads from genes predicted to be nitrite oxidoreductases nxr in r1 binning yielded 27 high quality draft genomes from the two reactors analysis of bin occurrence found that r1 showing both a decrease in anammox bacteria and an unexpected increase in nxr in situ assays confirmed that r1 had higher rates of nitrite oxidation to nitrate and suggested that it was not solely due to obligate nob but other nxr containing bacteria are important contributors as well our results demonstrate that nitrate accumulation can be a serious operational concern for the application of anammox technology to low strength wastewater treatment and provide insight into the community changes leading to this outcome graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox nitrate accumulation nitrite oxidoreductase metagenomics 1 introduction anammox is a biologically mediated process in which ammonium is oxidized to nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions with nitrite serving as the electron acceptor mulder et al 1995 strous et al 1999 the anammox process has been proven to be an efficient and cost effective alternative to the conventional nitrification denitrification process for nitrogen pollution control during wastewater treatment hao et al 2002 liu and ni 2015 feng et al 2018 the anammox process has not been standardized but has been carried out in various reactor configurations operated with different nitrogen loading rates jin et al 2008 reino and carrera 2017 reino et al 2018 wang et al 2012 low nitrogen loading rate lnlr reactors are typically run with nitrogen concentrations of 9 73 mg l 1 and are associated with main stream municipal wastewater treatment vela et al 2015 gu et al 2018 lotti et al 2015 high nitrogen loading rate hnlr reactors are typically operated with nitrogen concentrations 240 mg l 1 and are utilized with industrial wastewater or side stream municipal wastewater li et al 2018b phan et al 2017 tang et al 2011 loading rates appear to select for anammox bacteria with distinctive genotypes and phenotypes which affects their nitrogen removal capacities cao et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 there are currently six genera of anammox bacteria within the phylum planctomycetes including candidatus kuenenia ca brocadia ca anammoxoglobus ca anammoximicrobium and ca jettenia which are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems as well as ca scalindua which is commonly found in marine environments ali et al 2015 guo et al 2016 kartal et al 2013 lawson et al 2017 previous studies have found that ca brocadia anammoxidans ca jettenia ca anammoxoglobus or ca kuenenia were the predominant microbial species in lnlr reino et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 li et al 2017 ca brocadia sinica and ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis were usually identified as the dominant anammox bacteria in hnlr cho et al 2018 yang et al 2018 these studies indicate some strain preferences but it has not been directly tested whether different nitrogen loading rates are the primary reasons particular anammox species or phenotypes occur under different conditions moreover any shifts in particular species and or their abundance will likely have significant impacts on nitrate production which can lead to degradation of desirable performance characteristics associations between operating conditions species occurrence and reactor performance particularly nitrate production are not well understood metagenomic based analyses of microbial communities can provide both community and functional insight without amplification bias this approach has been used in the comparison of taxonomic and functional profiles of the microbial communities associated with different aggregate types including flocculent sludge attached biofilm and granular sludge from lab scale anammox bioreactors guo et al 2016 and to successfully build an ecological model of the microbial community in a full scale partial nitritation anammox reactor speth et al 2016 this study investigated two anammox granular sludge reactors operating under typical lnlr 0 8 kg m 3 d 1 or hnlr 10 5 kg m 3 d 1 conditions using a metagenomics approach the relationship between nitrogen removal performance and nitrogen transformation gene type and abundance as well as distribution of relevant genes in abundant genomes was evaluated this permitted an assessment of the taxonomic distribution abundance and genotypes of the dominant members of the community including anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria anaob and other members of the community using this information the relationship between microbial community and the nitrogen transformation performance in both anammox reactors was evaluated these results provide deeper insights into how loading rate influences performance and community structure during the granular sludge anammox process which will aid in developing operational strategies for advanced anammox processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors operation and sampling experiments were carried out in two identical 1 25 l plexiglass expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactors with an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively the inoculant anammox granular sludge was taken from prof zheng ping s lab at zhejiang university kang et al 2018 during the operational period 1 year both reactors were continuously fed with synthetic wastewater as described previously van de graaf et al 1996 nh4 n and no2 n were added in the form of nh4cl and nano2 the influent concentrations of nh4 n for r1 and r2 were 22 mg l 1 and 300 mg l 1 respectively and the no2 n nh4 n of both

from the bins that were annotated as either nitrite oxidoreductase or dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg additional sequences from representative well characterized sources were added as well as two outgroup sequences the alignment and construction of the tree was done using the one click method from phylogeny fr dereeper et al 2008 2 4 in situ activity assays in situ batch experiments were carried out to study the sources or sinks of nitrate in r1 and r2 by specific functional microbes residual nitrogen was first washed out of the reactor by pumping with phosphate buffer 10 mm for 4 5 h 3 fold hrt for measurement of anaerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction assays the influent was purged with 99 99 helium gas for 15 min to ensure anoxic conditions the initial nitrogen concentrations for the anaerobic ammonia oxidation assay were 50 mg l 1 nh4 n and 65 mg l 1 no2 n and 50 mg l 1 no3 n for the nitrate reduction assay respectively in both cases no additional electron donor was provided aerobic nitrate production was determined using 5 mg l 1 do and an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 no2 n for nitrite oxidation and 1 mg l 1 do and an initial 1 mg l 1 nh4 n for

statistical analysis unless noted all analyses were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation t tests were performed using r software version 3 1 1 to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be threshold of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance measurements of the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the influent and effluent along with the nrr over a 2 month period indicated both reactors maintained stable performance table 1 in r1 nlr of 0 8 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 the average influent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 21 7 1 4 25 1 1 0 and 1 5 1 2 mg l 1 respectively effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 0 6 0 3 2 2 0 8 and 18 3 1 1 mg l 1 respectively resulting in an average nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 5 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 in r2 nlr of 10 5 0 7 kg m 3 d 1 the influent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 303 5 20 9 354 2 26 1 and 5 9 4 9 mg l 1 respectively a nrr of 10 0 0 8 kg m 3 d 1 was measured with the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations being 0 7 0 1 5 9 4 6 and 31 0 5 3 mg l 1 respectively the nh4 n removal tn removal as well as ratios of no3 n produced to nh4 n no3 n nh4 n removed and no2 n removed to nh4 n no2 n nh4 n removed for both reactors are summarized in fig s1 the tn removal observed in r2 was as high as 94 9 1 7 similar to efficiencies observed in other anammox enrichment bioreactors lotti et al 2014b de graaff et al 2011 the tn removal efficiency of 57 9 8 0 in r1 was much lower than the 94 9 1 7 measured in r2 p 0 01 due to the relatively higher nitrate levels in the effluent of the former the average no3 n nh4 n ratio in the r1 effluent reached 79 7 which is significantly higher than the 26 ratio predicted from anammox reaction stoichiometry strous et al 1998 other studies of the mainstream anammox process have similarly reported the overall tn removal efficiency was limited 45 due to high no3 production de clippeleir et al 2013 lotti et al 2015 3 2 analysis of key nitrogen cycle genes abundances of the key genes for anammox nitrification and denitrification were measured using normalized read abundance as a proxy for gene abundance fig 1 relative abundances were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm hydrazine synthase gene hzs and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo which are key genes of anaob strous et al 2006 were relatively abundant in both reactors but their abundance was significantly higher in r2 434 18 rpm and 196 6 rpm than r1 249 20 rpm and 115 7 rpm based on this it might also be expected that reads assigned as being from nxr which catalyzes nitrite oxidation to nitrate would be higher in r2 since this gene is found in anammox bacteria however this was not the case since reads predicted as coming from nxr were 650 11 rpm in r1 but 496 11 rpm in r2 p 0 01 this result was in accordance with the higher no3 production in r1 than r2 using a similar approach it was found that the potential for nitrate respiration was present in both reactors however reads from the denitrification related genes were much higher abundance in r2 than r1 which suggested the denitrification activity in r2 was potentially higher than r1 reads from respiratory nitrate reductase nar and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap both of which encode dissimilatory nitrate reductases were about 1 5 fold higher in r2 than in r1 fig 1 this suggests that the nitrate respiration would be more active in r2 than r1 which may increase treatment efficiency in r2 lawson et al 2017 3 3 microbial community analysis sequencing of the community dna extracted from four separate biomass samples in triplicate yielded a total of 1 415 551 324 reads after quality filtering assembly of the resulting reads using megahit generated a total of 345 432 contigs with an n50 of 24 080 bp binning resulted in the recovery of 27 high quality estimated 80 completeness 10 contamination draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s1 kang et al 2015 these 27 draft genomes accounted for 48 5 1 5 and 58 1 2 1 of the original sequencing data from the r1 and r2 samples respectively for convenience bin names referred to in the text were listed in table s1 as expected the dominant bacteria in both reactors were anaob which averaged 43 0 of the reads in r2 and 22 5 in r1 amx1 ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis see fig s2 was the dominant anaob in both reactors and its average abundance in r2 39 8 was significantly higher compared to that in r1 20 8 p 0 01 table s1 a similar bias towards the higher nitrogen loading environment was also observed with amx2 whose reads had an average abundance of 1 2 in r1 and 3 0 in r2 both gani and aai analysis indicates amx2 is a previously uncharacterized species fig s2 amx3 ca jettenia caeni see fig s2 preferred lower nitrogen loading rates since its reads were 0 6 of the total reads in r1 but only 0 2 of the reads in r2 in natural and man made habitats anaob usually co occur with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob requiring that some o2 be available to support aerobic respiration in the latter two groups guo et al 2016 the measured do in r1 and r2 was less than 0 1 mg l 1 which might be expected to preclude the presence of aob and nob however the data in table s1 showed that the genome abundance of aob1 nob1 nob2 and cmx1 in r1 were 0 51 6 43 1 39 and 0 25 respectively in r2 the reads mapping to these bins was aob1 0 00 nob1 0 16 nob2 0 00 and cmx1 0 00 which in every instance was significantly less than in r1 the occurrence of these organisms is likely explained by the observation that the do in the influent tank of both reactors was usually around 3 5 mg l 1 since there was no purging with inert gases to reduce the do in order to more closely mimic what would occur in a full scale application since it has been shown that aob and nob have high affinity terminal oxidases hink et al 2017 it is likely the of influent o2 is sufficient to maintain these aerobes the presence of a likely comammox strain also indicates it too must have high affinity terminal oxidases one possible explanation for the relatively low occurrence of nob in r2 is that conditions in this reactor are unfavorable for their growth analysis revealed that the average fa and fna concentrations in r2 were calculated to be 1 7 0 4 mg fa l 1 and 120 4 5 3 Î¼g fna l 1 respectively both values are higher than the threshold inhibitory levels of 0 1 1 mg fa l 1 and 11 70 Î¼g fna l 1 for nob anthonisen et al 1976 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 this suggests that the higher concentrations of fa and fna occurring in r2 account for the relatively poor growth of nob in summary conditions in the hnlr anammox reactor resulted in a community with relatively lower levels of nob which is consistent with its lower nitrate accumulation given the operating conditions of these reactors the higher levels of nitrate production in r1 is likely associated with nitrite oxidation this prediction is supported by the higher occurrence bin of nob in r1 anaob also contain nxr and given their high occurrence in both reactors could account for the majority of nxr observed in the reads however if this were the case it would be expected nxr reads would be higher in r2 than r1 since this pattern was not observed nxr in r1 is likely coming from other members of the community fig 1 recent work has found that nxr is not limited to obligate nob referred to as strict nitrite oxidizing bacteria snob but is also found in physiologically diverse bacteria referred to here as diverse nob dnob daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 to investigate the distribution of in r1 and r2 the abundance of nxr reads assigned to particular groups of physiologically related bins was determined fig 2 a as expected nxr reads derived from amx bins were much higher in r2 293 14 rpm than r1 157 18 rpm consistent with the higher abundance of anaob in r2 but these values do not account for all the nxr reads table s1 the reads attributable to the snob were much higher in r1 58 16 rpm 58 fold higher than in r2 1 1 rpm and a similar trend occurred for reads attributable to cmx fig 2a of particular note was the observation that the abundance of nxr reads from dnob in r1 was 433 31 rpm 2 fold higher than in r2 fig 2a the importance of nitrite oxidation to the growth of this group of bacteria is uncertain but examination of their genomes suggests they are not snob fig 3 nevertheless the fact that excess nitrate is being produced in r1 suggests that this group are making significant contributions to the production of nitrate in this reactor and possibly in r2 since nxr levels are high there as well fig 1 it has typically been assumed that snob are the principal contributors of excess nitrate production in anammox systems daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 but the results reported here suggest dnob may be also making important contributions fig s3 to confirm that higher nxr levels were associated with higher rates of nitrite oxidation to nitrate the rates of important nitrogen transformation processes were measured using in situ batch experiments with samples from both anammox reactors fig 2b results showed that the rate of nitrate production by anaerobic ammonia oxidation was higher in r2 0 61 0 15 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 than in r1 0 26 0 04 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 a similar trend occurred with anaerobic nitrate reduction activity where r2 had a rate of 0 31 0 17 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 while the rate in r1 was 0 02 0 00 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in r1 the rate of oxidation of nitrite to nitrate was 0 25 0 10 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 which was much higher than the 0 03 0 01 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 measured in r2 the specific activity of ammonia oxidation to nitrate was too low to be detected in both reactors interestingly eq 1 which compares measured rates with the rate predicted from differences in effluent and influent nitrate concentration was unbalanced in both r1 and r2 that is the nitrate production rate calculated using effluent and influent nitrate concentrations was much higher than the sum of v anao v nio v cmx and v nr this suggests nitrate production from sources whose activities were not accounted for in the specific assays were contributing to nitrate generation these may include dnob organisms as indicated by the nxr distribution analysis fig 3 this unaccounted for rate of nitrate production 0 64 0 09 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was higher in r1 than the measured v nio the unaccounted rate 0 25 0 04 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in r2 was also higher than the measured v nio but both measured and unaccounted values were much less than in r1 these results clearly show that r1 had higher rates of nitrate production from nitrite than r2 consistent with the observed levels of nxr in the two communities to gauge the breadth of nxr distribution in the microbial community in the reactors a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of proteins from the mags that are predicted to contain a molybdopterin binding domain that is the site of nitrate nitrite binding as well as selected additional sequences was generated fig s4 branching of the tree indicates that many of the proteins predicted to be nitrate reductases by the genome annotation program are more related to nitrite oxidoreductase sequences than dissimilatory nitrate reductase sequences moreover the nitrite oxidoreductase enzymes are known to contain both cytoplasmic and extracellular facing nitrate binding sites and both types are found in the bins daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 the proteins from the snob draft genomes found in this study are found in the extracellular facing group as expected but the dnob have predominantly cytoplasmic facing proteins we found that a bioreactor operating under low nlr conditions did not achieve high tn removal efficiency due to production of relatively high levels of nitrate the source of this nitrate correlates with an increase of nxr from snob and dnob utilization of nitrite as a source of electrons is not unreasonable in these conditions given no fixed carbon is present in the influent for energetic reasons the electrons generated from nitrite oxidation are most likely being coupled to aerobic respiration daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 if nitrite is providing an energetic benefit why is this process more pronounced in the low nlr one possibility is that aob were more prevalent increasing the rate of ammonia oxidation to nitrite it is difficult to determine this though due to the low read numbers of bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit a pmoa in the reactors fig 1 it is also possible the reduction in anaob abundance in r1 may limit nitrite flux into the anammox process this would increase the nitrite pool available for those organisms with nxr increasing their number in the community further studies targeting the flux of ammonia and nitrite in the two reactors are needed to resolve why the low nlr conditions lead to a relative increase in nxr containing organisms within the community the observation that more nob were found in the low nlr anammox reactor while relative high levels of denitrification genes were found in the high nlr anammox reactor provides some important clues about factors controlling nitrate accumulation in anammox for instance control of certain parameters that can inhibit nob activity and growth such as ph and do in the influent or enhancement of nitrate reduction by addition of partial denitrifiers and biodegradable organic carbon 4 conclusion in this work the performance characteristics and physiological shifts associated with nitrate accumulation in anammox reactors under different nlrs were investigated metagenomics was used to better understand the relationship between the microbial community and higher nitrate accumulation in a lower nlr anammox reactor the main conclusions are as follows 1 the total nitrogen removal efficiency 60 was much lower in the lower nlr reactor due to higher nitrate production 2 metagenomic analysis indicated relatively higher levels of reads from genes predicted to be nitrite oxidoreductases nxr in the lower nlr anammox reactor 3 analysis of mag occurrence found that the lower nlr reactor had both a decrease in anammox bacteria and an unexpected increase in nxr in situ assays suggested that the higher nitrate production was not solely due to obligate nob but other nxr containing bacteria are important contributors as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

18375,nitrate production during anammox can decrease total nitrogen removal efficiency which will negatively impact its usefulness for the removal of nitrogen from waste streams however neither the performance characteristics nor physiological shifts associated with nitrate accumulation in anammox reactors under different nitrogen loading rates nlrs is well understood consequently these parameters were studied in a lower nlr anammox reactor termed r1 producing higher than expected levels of nitrate and compared with a higher nlr reactor termed r2 showing no excess nitrate production while both reactors showed high nh4 n removal efficiencies 90 the total nitrogen removal efficiency 60 was much lower in r1 due to higher nitrate production metagenomic analysis found that the number of reads derived from anammox bacteria were significantly higher in r2 another notable trend in reads occurrence was the relatively higher levels of reads from genes predicted to be nitrite oxidoreductases nxr in r1 binning yielded 27 high quality draft genomes from the two reactors analysis of bin occurrence found that r1 showing both a decrease in anammox bacteria and an unexpected increase in nxr in situ assays confirmed that r1 had higher rates of nitrite oxidation to nitrate and suggested that it was not solely due to obligate nob but other nxr containing bacteria are

identical 1 25 l plexiglass expanded granular sludge blanket egsb reactors with an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively the inoculant anammox granular sludge was taken from prof zheng ping s lab at zhejiang university kang et al 2018 during the operational period 1 year both reactors were continuously fed with synthetic wastewater as described previously van de graaf et al 1996 nh4 n and no2 n were added in the form of nh4cl and nano2 the influent concentrations of nh4 n for r1 and r2 were 22 mg l 1 and 300 mg l 1 respectively and the no2 n nh4 n of both

from the bins that were annotated as either nitrite oxidoreductase or dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg additional sequences from representative well characterized sources were added as well as two outgroup sequences the alignment and construction of the tree was done using the one click method from phylogeny fr dereeper et al 2008 2 4 in situ activity assays in situ batch experiments were carried out to study the sources or sinks of nitrate in r1 and r2 by specific functional microbes residual nitrogen was first washed out of the reactor by pumping with phosphate buffer 10 mm for 4 5 h 3 fold hrt for measurement of anaerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction assays the influent was purged with 99 99 helium gas for 15 min to ensure anoxic conditions the initial nitrogen concentrations for the anaerobic ammonia oxidation assay were 50 mg l 1 nh4 n and 65 mg l 1 no2 n and 50 mg l 1 no3 n for the nitrate reduction assay respectively in both cases no additional electron donor was provided aerobic nitrate production was determined using 5 mg l 1 do and an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 no2 n for nitrite oxidation and 1 mg l 1 do and an initial 1 mg l 1 nh4 n for complete ammonia oxidation kits et al 2017 lawson et al 2018 liquid samples were taken after 4 5 h for determining no3 n concentrations the balance of nitrate transformation rates in the anammox

statistical analysis unless noted all analyses were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation t tests were performed using r software version 3 1 1 to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be threshold of statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance measurements of the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the influent and effluent along with the nrr over a 2 month period indicated both reactors maintained stable performance table 1 in r1 nlr of 0 8 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 the average influent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 21 7 1 4 25 1 1 0 and 1 5 1 2 mg l 1 respectively effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 0 6 0 3 2 2 0 8 and 18 3 1 1 mg l 1 respectively resulting in an average nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 5 0 1 kg m 3 d 1 in r2 nlr of 10 5 0 7 kg m 3 d 1 the influent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were 303 5 20 9 354 2 26 1 and 5 9 4 9 mg l 1 respectively a nrr of 10 0 0 8 kg m 3 d 1 was measured with the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations being 0 7 0 1 5 9 4 6 and 31 0 5 3 mg l 1 respectively the nh4 n removal tn removal as well as ratios of no3 n produced to nh4 n no3 n nh4 n removed and no2 n removed to nh4 n no2 n nh4 n removed for both reactors are summarized in fig s1 the tn removal observed in r2 was as high as 94 9 1 7 similar to efficiencies observed in other anammox enrichment bioreactors lotti et al 2014b de graaff et al 2011 the tn removal efficiency of 57 9 8 0 in r1 was much lower than the 94 9 1 7 measured in r2 p 0 01 due to the relatively higher nitrate levels in the effluent of the former the average no3 n nh4 n ratio in the r1 effluent reached 79 7 which is significantly higher than the 26 ratio predicted from anammox reaction stoichiometry strous et al 1998 other studies of the mainstream anammox process have similarly reported the overall tn removal efficiency was limited 45 due to high no3 production de clippeleir et al 2013 lotti et al 2015 3 2 analysis of key nitrogen cycle genes abundances of the key genes for anammox nitrification and denitrification were measured using normalized read abundance as a proxy for gene abundance fig 1 relative abundances were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm hydrazine synthase gene hzs and hydrazine oxidoreductase hzo which are key genes of anaob strous et al 2006 were relatively abundant in both reactors but their abundance was significantly higher in r2 434 18 rpm and 196 6 rpm than r1 249 20 rpm and 115 7 rpm based on this it might also be expected that reads assigned as being from nxr which catalyzes nitrite oxidation to nitrate would be higher in r2 since this gene is found in anammox bacteria however this was not the case since reads predicted as coming from nxr were 650 11 rpm in r1 but 496 11 rpm in r2 p 0 01 this result was in accordance with the higher no3 production in r1 than r2 using a similar approach it was found that the potential for nitrate respiration was present in both reactors however reads from the denitrification related genes were much higher abundance in r2 than r1 which suggested the denitrification activity in r2 was potentially higher than r1 reads from respiratory nitrate reductase nar and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap both of which encode dissimilatory nitrate reductases were about 1 5 fold higher in r2 than in r1 fig 1 this suggests that the nitrate respiration would be more active in r2 than r1 which may increase treatment efficiency in r2 lawson et al 2017 3 3 microbial community analysis sequencing of the community dna extracted from four separate biomass samples in triplicate yielded a total of 1 415 551 324 reads after quality filtering assembly of the resulting reads using megahit generated a total of 345 432 contigs with an n50 of 24 080 bp binning resulted in the recovery of 27 high quality estimated 80 completeness 10 contamination draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s1 kang et al 2015 these 27 draft genomes accounted for 48 5 1 5 and 58 1 2 1 of the original sequencing data from the r1 and r2 samples respectively for convenience bin names referred to in the text were listed in table s1 as expected the dominant bacteria in both reactors were anaob which averaged 43 0 of the reads in r2 and 22 5 in r1 amx1 ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis see fig s2 was the dominant anaob in both reactors and its average abundance in r2 39 8 was significantly higher compared to that in r1 20 8 p 0 01 table s1 a similar bias towards the higher nitrogen loading environment was also observed with amx2 whose reads had an average abundance of 1 2 in r1 and 3 0 in r2 both gani and aai analysis indicates amx2 is a previously uncharacterized species fig s2 amx3 ca jettenia caeni see fig s2 preferred lower nitrogen loading rates since its reads were 0 6 of the total reads in r1 but only 0 2 of the reads in r2 in natural and man made habitats anaob usually co occur with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nob requiring that some o2 be available to support aerobic respiration in the latter two groups guo et al 2016 the measured do in r1 and r2 was less than 0 1 mg l 1 which might be expected to preclude the presence of aob and nob however the data in table s1 showed that the genome abundance of aob1 nob1 nob2 and cmx1 in r1 were 0 51 6 43 1 39 and 0 25 respectively in r2 the reads mapping to these bins was aob1 0 00 nob1 0 16 nob2 0 00 and cmx1 0 00 which in every instance was significantly less than in r1 the occurrence of these organisms is likely explained by the observation that the do in the influent tank of both reactors was usually around 3 5 mg l 1 since there was no purging with inert gases to reduce the do in order to more closely mimic what would occur in a full scale application since it has been shown that aob and nob have high affinity terminal oxidases hink et al 2017 it is likely the of influent o2 is sufficient to maintain these aerobes the presence of a likely comammox strain also indicates it too must have high affinity terminal oxidases one possible explanation for the relatively low occurrence of nob in r2 is that conditions in this reactor are unfavorable for their growth analysis revealed that the average fa and fna concentrations in r2 were calculated to be 1 7 0 4 mg fa l 1 and 120 4 5 3 Î¼g fna l 1 respectively both values are higher than the threshold inhibitory levels of 0 1 1 mg fa l 1 and 11 70 Î¼g fna l 1 for nob anthonisen et al 1976 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 this suggests that the higher concentrations of fa and fna occurring in r2 account for the relatively poor growth of nob in summary conditions in the hnlr anammox reactor resulted in a community with relatively lower levels of nob which is consistent with its lower nitrate accumulation given the operating conditions of these reactors the higher levels of nitrate production in r1 is likely associated with nitrite oxidation this prediction is supported by the higher occurrence bin of nob in r1 anaob also contain nxr and given their high occurrence in both reactors could account for the majority of nxr observed in the reads however if this were the case it would be expected nxr reads would be higher in r2 than r1 since this pattern was not observed nxr in r1 is likely coming from other members of the community fig 1 recent work has found that nxr is not limited to obligate nob referred to as strict nitrite oxidizing bacteria snob but is also found in physiologically diverse bacteria referred to here as diverse nob dnob daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 to investigate the distribution of in r1 and r2 the abundance of nxr reads assigned to particular groups of physiologically related bins was determined fig 2 a as expected nxr reads derived from amx bins were much higher in r2 293 14 rpm than r1 157 18 rpm consistent with the higher abundance of anaob in r2 but these values do not account for all the nxr reads table s1 the reads attributable to the snob were much higher in r1 58 16 rpm 58 fold higher than in r2 1 1 rpm and a similar trend occurred for reads attributable to cmx fig 2a of particular note was the observation that the abundance of nxr reads from dnob in r1 was 433 31 rpm 2 fold higher than in r2 fig 2a the importance of nitrite oxidation to the growth of this group of bacteria is uncertain but examination of their genomes suggests they are not snob fig 3 nevertheless the fact that excess nitrate is being produced in r1 suggests that this group are making significant contributions to the production of nitrate in this reactor and possibly in r2 since nxr levels are high there as well fig 1 it has typically been assumed that snob are the principal contributors of excess nitrate production in anammox systems daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 but the results reported here suggest dnob may be also making important contributions fig s3 to confirm that higher nxr levels were associated with higher rates of nitrite oxidation to nitrate the rates of important nitrogen transformation processes were measured using in situ batch experiments with samples from both anammox reactors fig 2b results showed that the rate of nitrate production by anaerobic ammonia oxidation was higher in r2 0 61 0 15 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 than in r1 0 26 0 04 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 a similar trend occurred with anaerobic nitrate reduction activity where r2 had a rate of 0 31 0 17 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 while the rate in r1 was 0 02 0 00 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in r1 the rate of oxidation of nitrite to nitrate was 0 25 0 10 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 which was much higher than the 0 03 0 01 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 measured in r2 the specific activity of ammonia oxidation to nitrate was too low to be detected in both reactors interestingly eq 1 which compares measured rates with the rate predicted from differences in effluent and influent nitrate concentration was unbalanced in both r1 and r2 that is the nitrate production rate calculated using effluent and influent nitrate concentrations was much higher than the sum of v anao v nio v cmx and v nr this suggests nitrate production from sources whose activities were not accounted for in the specific assays were contributing to nitrate generation these may include dnob organisms as indicated by the nxr distribution analysis fig 3 this unaccounted for rate of nitrate production 0 64 0 09 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was higher in r1 than the measured v nio the unaccounted rate 0 25 0 04 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in r2 was also higher than the measured v nio but both measured and unaccounted values were much less than in r1 these results clearly show that r1 had higher rates of nitrate production from nitrite than r2 consistent with the observed levels of nxr in the two communities to gauge the breadth of nxr distribution in the microbial community in the reactors a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of proteins from the mags that are predicted to contain a molybdopterin binding domain that is the site of nitrate nitrite binding as well as selected additional sequences was generated fig s4 branching of the tree indicates that many of the proteins predicted to be nitrate reductases by the genome annotation program are more related to nitrite oxidoreductase sequences than dissimilatory nitrate reductase sequences moreover the nitrite oxidoreductase enzymes are known to contain both cytoplasmic and extracellular facing nitrate binding sites and both types are found in the bins daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 the proteins from the snob draft genomes found in this study are found in the extracellular facing group as expected but the dnob have predominantly cytoplasmic facing proteins we found that a bioreactor operating under low nlr conditions did not achieve high tn removal efficiency due to production of relatively high levels of nitrate the source of this nitrate correlates with an increase of nxr from snob and dnob utilization of nitrite as a source of electrons is not unreasonable in these conditions given no fixed carbon is present in the influent for energetic reasons the electrons generated from nitrite oxidation are most likely being coupled to aerobic respiration daims et al 2016 sorokin et al 2012 if nitrite is providing an energetic benefit why is this process more pronounced in the low nlr one possibility is that aob were more prevalent increasing the rate of ammonia oxidation to nitrite it is difficult to determine this though due to the low read numbers of bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunit a pmoa in the reactors fig 1 it is also possible the reduction in anaob abundance in r1 may limit nitrite flux into the anammox process this would increase the nitrite pool available for those organisms with nxr increasing their number in the community further studies targeting the flux of ammonia and nitrite in the two reactors are needed to resolve why the low nlr conditions lead to a relative increase in nxr containing organisms within the community the observation that more nob were found in the low nlr anammox reactor while relative high levels of denitrification genes were found in the high nlr anammox reactor provides some important clues about factors controlling nitrate accumulation in anammox for instance control of certain parameters that can inhibit nob activity and growth such as ph and do in the influent or enhancement of nitrate reduction by addition of partial denitrifiers and biodegradable organic carbon 4 conclusion in this work the performance characteristics and physiological shifts associated with nitrate accumulation in anammox reactors under different nlrs were investigated metagenomics was used to better understand the relationship between the microbial community and higher nitrate accumulation in a lower nlr anammox reactor the main conclusions are as follows 1 the total nitrogen removal efficiency 60 was much lower in the lower nlr reactor due to higher nitrate production 2 metagenomic analysis indicated relatively higher levels of reads from genes predicted to be nitrite oxidoreductases nxr in the lower nlr anammox reactor 3 analysis of mag occurrence found that the lower nlr reactor had both a decrease in anammox bacteria and an unexpected increase in nxr in situ assays suggested that the higher nitrate production was not solely due to obligate nob but other nxr containing bacteria are important contributors as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

18376,as an environmentally friendly material biochar has been widely used to remediate soil water contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants the addition of biochar or modified biochar to porous media might affect the retention of plastic particles and thus influence their fate in natural environment in this study both biochar and magnetic biochar fe3o4 biochar were synthesized via a facile precipitation method at room temperature to determine the significance of biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment on the transport and deposition behaviors of plastic particles the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nano plastic particles and 0 2 Î¼m and 2 Î¼m micro plastic particles in quartz sand were compared with those obtained in quartz sand either with biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment in both 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions the results show that for all three different sized plastic particles under both examined solution conditions the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar in quartz sand decreases the transport and increases the retention of plastic particles in porous media fe3o4 biochar more effectively inhibits the transport of plastic particles than biochar we found that the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar could change the suspension property and increase the adsorption capacity of porous media due to the increase of porous media surface roughness and negatively decrease the zeta potentials of porous media contributing to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles moreover we found that negligible amount of biochar and fe3o4 biochar 1 were released from the columns following the plastic particle transport when the columns were eluted with very low ionic strength solution at high flow rate to simulate a sudden rainstorm similarly small amount of plastic particles were detached from the porous media under this extreme condition 16 5 for quartz sand 14 6 for quartz sand with biochar amendment and 7 5 for quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment we found that over 74 of the fe3o4 biochar can be recovered from the porous media after the retention of plastic particles by using a magnet and 87 plastic particles could be desorbed from fe3o4 biochar by dispersing the fe3o4 biochar into 10 mm naoh solution in addition we found that the amendment of unsaturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar also decreased the transport of plastic particles when biochar fe3o4 biochar were added into porous media as one layer of permeable barrier near to column inlet the decreased transport of plastic particles could be also obtained the results of this study indicate that magnetic biochar can be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems such as in soil or groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic particles magnetic biochar retention adsorption porous media 1 introduction the use of agricultural mulch and greenhouse the irrigation of water with plastics as well as the application of sewage sludge containing microplastic particles on the agricultural land lead to the ubiquitous presence of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems especially in soil nizzetto et al 2016 rillig 2012 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 for example nizzetto et al 2016 estimated that 63 000 43 0000 and 44 000 300 000 tonnes of microplastics are likely added annually to farmlands in europe and north america respectively scheurer and bigalke 2018 reported that 90 of swiss floodplain soils contain plastic particles with concentrations of up to 55 5 mg kg 1 zhang and liu 2018 found that the concentrations of plastic particles in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest buffer zone at dian lake in southwestern china ranged from 7100 to 42 960 particles kg 1 mean 18 760 particles kg 1 since they contain different surface functional groups alimi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 plastic particles can adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants on their surfaces brennecke et al 2016 hirai et al 2011 hu et al 2017 thus the release of plastic particles into the natural environment such as soil system could induce the environmental risk the presence of plastic particles has been found to change soil properties qi et al 2018 have an influence on the soil biota huerta lwanga et al 2016 and have negative effects on crop growth maaÃ et al 2017 qi et al 2018 rillig et al 2017 for example huerta lwanga et al 2016 found that plastic particles significantly reduce the growth rate of the earthworm lumbricus terrestris plastic particles have been found to be able to enter into the terrestrial food chain huerta lwanga et al 2017 and thus could pose health risks of humans bouwmeester et al 2015 sharma and chatterjee 2017 therefore it is essential to inhibit the transport behaviors of plastic particles in porous media after they are released into natural environment as an environmentally friendly material biochar or modified biochar has been widely used to remediate soil contaminants such as heavy metals rajendran et al 2019 shen et al 2019 yang and jiang 2014 and organic pollutants liang et al 2019 rong et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 for example zhang et al 2010 found that the addition of pinus radiate derived biochars to soil could enhance the sorption of phenanthrene in soil rajendran et al 2019 found that the concentrations of cadmium in rice were reduced when adding sulfur and sulfur iron modified biochar to paddy soils shen et al 2019 reported that the introduction of mgo coated biochar to soil significantly facilitated lead removal owing to the numerous oxygen functional groups on biochar it is high likely that biochar could interact with plastic particles the addition of biochar into porous media might reduce the transport behaviors of plastic particles and thus decrease their environmental risks it should be noted that it is commonly difficult to recover biochar after they are added into porous media due to their magnetic property fe3o4 nanoparticles could be efficiently recycled after use via the employment of external magnetic force shan et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 thus the modification of biochar by magnetic fe3o4 could improve the potential recovery of the biochar being added into porous media moreover fe3o4 nanoparticles commonly contain positive surface charge under ph 6 5 jin et al 2015 thus they can adsorb negatively charged particles via attractive electrostatic interactions at ph 6 5 it is expected that the modification of biochar by magnetic fe3o4 could also increase the adsorption of plastic particles the addition of magnetic fe3o4 modified biochar to porous media might further increase the retention of plastic particles in the porous media in addition by using magnetic force fe3o4 modified biochar might be recoverable from porous media after its application to retain plastic particles herein biochar and the fe3o4 modified biochar fe3o4 biochar were synthesized and characterized their performances towards the retention of plastic particles in porous media were investigated in present study carboxylate modified polystyrene latex microspheres with diameter of 0 02 Î¼m as model nano plastic particles 0 2 Î¼m and 2 Î¼m as model microplastic particles were employed both the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of all three different sized plastic particles under environmentally relevant conditions in 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions in quartz sand were compared with those in quartz sand with 0 5 biochar amendment and in quartz sand with 0 5 fe3o4 biochar amendment the possible mechanisms enhancing the deposition of plastic particles by biochar and fe3o4 biochar are proposed and discussed the release of biochar fe3o4 biochar and plastic particles from the columns with increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength to stimulate a rainstorm were investigated the recovery efficiency of fe3o4 biochar from the porous media after the plastic particle transport was determined the desorption of plastic particles after they were adsorbed onto fe3o4 biochar was testified in addition the transport behaviors of plastic particles in unsaturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment as well as in saturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar as permeable barrier near to the column inlet were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of biochar and fe3o4 biochar the biochar was prepared by heating cellulose purchased from j k scientific under oxygen limited conditions in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 6 h the detailed synthesis protocol was described in detail in a previous study yang et al 2018 the fe3o4 biochar was synthesized following a previous study shan et al 2015 briefly 0 932 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 985 g feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 200 ml milli q water in a 500 ml flask and then 2 g synthesized biochar was dispersed into the solution by ultrasonication for 5 min n2 was continually bubbled through the 200 ml solution to expel oxygen under vigorous mechanical agitation naoh 2 m l 1 was added dropwise to the flask at room temperature until the ph reached 10 the black precipitate was then formed and separated with an external magnet which was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the supernatant was neutral ph 7 then the composites referred as fe3o4 biochar were acquired after vacuum freeze drying for 24 h the mass ratio of biochar to fe3o4 was set to be 5 1 for the transport experiments the detailed information regarding why we chose this mass ratio is provided in fig s1 composites with different mass ratios of biochar to fe3o4 1 1 2 1 and 10 1 were also prepared according to the similar procedure 2 2 biochar and fe3o4 biochar characterization the biochar and fe3o4 biochar were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrometer ft ir scanning electron microscope sem brunauere emmette teller bet adsorption isotherms as well as hysteresis loop analysis the zeta potentials and the sizes of biochar and fe3o4 biochar under experimental conditions were characterized using dynamic light scattering dls the concentration of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were determined by an uv spectrophotometer

the detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials the zeta potentials and the sizes of plastic particles biochar fe3o4 biochar and quartz sand in both 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 were determined by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk each measurement was repeated 9 12 times at room temperature 25 c the corresponding results are provided in table s1 2 4 column transport experiments porous media quartz sand without and with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar were wet packed into cylindrical plexiglas columns 10 cm long and 2 cm inner diameter the detailed column packing protocol is provided in supplementary materials after packing all sand columns were first equilibrated using ten pore volumes pvs of salt solutions at the desired ionic strength and ph following pre equilibration 3 pvs of the plastic particle suspension were injected into the column this was followed by elution with 5 pvs of salt solution at the same ionic strength the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 8 m day 1 0 73 ml min 1 using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa to represent fluid velocities in coarse aquifer sediments forced gradient conditions or engineered filtration systems cai et al 2013 harter et al 2000 for selected experiments after the entire plastic particle transport process 10 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution was injected into the column with increasing flow rate up to 4 ml min 1 to imitate the flow rate of a heavy rain event column effluent samples were collected and analyzed to yield the breakthrough curves and the quartz sand was dissected into 10 segments and employed to yield the retained profiles the protocol for obtaining the mass balance is provided in the supplementary materials the detailed overall recovery mass balance for the plastic particles in each experiment is provided in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar and fe3o4 biochar the phase and crystal structures of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were characterized by xrd analyses and the results are shown in fig 1 a the distinct peak at 2Î¸ 23 0 observed in the xrd pattern of biochar fabricated at 400 c is consistent with previous observations its pyrolytic temperature was higher than 350 c hao et al 2013 keiluweit et al 2010 after being modified by fe3o4 the peaks at 2Î¸ 30 1 35 5 43 1 57 1 and 62 6 which correspond to the planes of 112 103 004 321 and 224 of magnetite jcpds 75 1609 liang et al 2018 are present in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 biochar the ft ir results fig s2 show that both biochar and fe3o4 biochar contain hydrophilic functional groups such as c o c c c h and c o which is consistent with previous studies chen et al 2019 wan and li 2018 moreover a strong adsorption peak at 561 cm 1 fe o is observed in the ft ir spectra of fe3o4 biochar suggesting that iron oxides are present on the surfaces of the biochar as shown in the xps results fig s3a the main characteristic peaks of fe3o4 biochar are fe2p 724 ev o1s 531 ev and c1s 285 ev as shown in the high resolution xps spectrum of c fig s3b the sharp peak at 284 5 ev is corresponded to the c c bonds li and li 2019 while the peaks at 285 6 ev and 288 9 ev could be assigned to c o bonds and o c o bonds respectively wan and li 2018 in the high resolution xps spectra of fe fig s3c the binding energy of fe 2p 1 2 appears at 723 4 ev while that of fe 2p 3 2 located at 713 5 ev both of which are consistent with previously reported values of fe3o4 ma et al 2019 the peaks at 531 6 ev 533 2 ev and 530 3 ev observed in the xps spectra of o fig s3d can be attributed to c o o c o and fe o respectively ma et al 2019 wan and li 2018 the results further confirm that fe3o4 has been successfully anchored on the biochar the eds spectrum fig 1b shows the fe distribute areas aligned with those of o which further confirms the presence of fe3o4 on the biochar surface moreover the contentes of s and cl are very low data not shown which agrees well with the xps results and indicates the well crystallized fe3o4 biochar the bet surface area of biochar fig s4 is calculated to be 2 0 m2 g 1 which is similar as those synthesized at about 400 c reported in previous studies park et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 after modification with fe3o4 the bet surface area of the fe3o4 biochar increases to 24 2 m2 g 1 which suggests that fe3o4 biochar might have more adsorption sites and provide stronger adsorption capability than biochar the sem image fig 1d shows that the biochar have a rough surface as shown in fig 1e fe3o4 particles are deposited onto the biochar surface the mass percentage of fe3o4 on the fe3o4 biochar is determined to be 0 1733 both fe3o4 and fe3o4 biochar are found to be superparamagnetic fig s5 the magnetic saturation ms values of fe3o4 and fe3o4 biochar are determined to be 56 2 emu g 1 and 10 7 emu g 1 respectively the fe3o4 biochar can be conveniently and easily separated from water by a magnet within 2 min fig s6 in 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 the zeta potentials of biochar are determined to be negative table s1 while the overall zeta potentials of fe3o4 biochar are positive due to the deposition of positively charged fe3o4 onto the biochar surface 3 2 effects of biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment on plastic particle transport to understand whether the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand would affect the transport and retention of plastic particles transport experiments of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps in quartz sand without and with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment were conducted at low 5 mm and high ionic strength 25 mm in nacl solutions at ph 6 without biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in clean quartz sand are high at both examined ionic strength conditions fig 2 specifically over 75 of plastic particles for all three different sizes pass through the quartz sand columns in 5 mm nacl solution the increase of solution ionic strength decreases the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles as well as those of quartz sand table s1 which decreases the overall dlvo interaction between the plastic particles and the quartz sand fig s7 thus the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles at high ionic strength 25 mm nacl are relatively lower than those at low ionic strength 5 mm nacl the lower breakthrough curves of colloids with increasing ionic strength have been widely reported bradford et al 2007 dong et al 2018 peng et al 2017 although the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in 25 mm nacl are lower relative to those in 5 mm nacl the percentages of plastic particles that passed through the quartz sand columns are still high in 25 mm nacl solution around 58 70 of plastic particles break through the quartz sand columns in 25 mm nacl solution fig 2 and table s2 under both examined ionic strength conditions the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment at an application rate of 0 5 are lower than those in clean quartz sand figs 2 and 3 for instance in 5 mm nacl solutions the breakthrough percentage for 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps in clean quartz sand is 78 5 77 7 and 75 2 respectively the corresponding percentage with the addition of biochar in quartz sand yet decreases to 68 5 37 4 and 36 9 respectively the introduction of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand further decrease the breakthrough percentage of 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps to 0 5 1 3 and 2 6 respectively these observations demonstrate that the addition of small amount of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand decreases the transport of all three different sized plastic particle in quartz sand under both ionic strength conditions abit et al 2014 also reported that pine chip biochars decreased the transport of 1 Î¼m diameter carboxylated polystyrene latex microspheres note that compared to those with biochar amendment the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are obviously lower under both examined ionic strength conditions the observation indicates that although the addition of biochar to quartz sand also decrease the transport of plastic particles fe3o4 biochar amendment is much more effective in inhibiting the transport of plastic particles comparison of the retained plastic particle profiles in quartz sand versus those in biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand shows that for all three different sized plastic particles at both ionic strengths the amounts of plastic particles retained in quartz sand with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar are greater than those in bare quartz sand table s2 and thus the corresponding retained profiles are higher in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to those in bare quartz sand figs 2 and 3 right the observations clearly show that the application of biochar fe3o4 biochar increases the retention of all three different sized plastic particles in porous media moreover for all three different sized plastic particles in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions the fe3o4 biochar results in greater plastic particle deposition than biochar the results indicate that both biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment could decrease the transport and increase the deposition of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand moreover fe3o4 biochar amendment is more effective to retain plastic particles than biochar 3 3 mechanisms for the enhanced deposition of plastic particles 3 3 1 alteration of the effluent properties previous studies have found that the application of biochar to soil could change the soil effluent properties abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 laird et al 2010 to determine whether the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar would also affect the properties of column effluents both influents and effluents from columns packed with only quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment prior to the injection of plastic particle suspension after pre equilibration for 10 pvs of 5 mm nacl solutions were collected the concentrations of metal ions al ca fe mg and k ph and conductivity in both influents and effluents were analyzed the results table s3 show that for column packed only with quartz sand the ph value conductivity and the concentrations of al fe mg and k ions in both influent and effluent are similar which indicates that the properties of the salt suspension do not change during its passage through the quartz sand columns although the ph value and the concentrations of al fe mg and k ions are comparable in both influent and effluent of the columns packed with quartz sands with either biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment the concentrations of ca ions and the conductivity are higher in the effluents of these columns the observation indicates that the addition of either biochar or fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand slightly changes the effluent properties the increased conductivity and concentration of ca ions in the effluents of biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand suggests that compared with those in bare quartz sand the ionic strength of plastic particle suspension during its passage through the amendment columns would be slightly increased which would thus affect the zeta potentials of plastic particles to verify this zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in both influent and effluent suspensions in 5 mm nacl solutions were determined the results table s4 show that for clean quartz sand columns without biochar amendment the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in the effluents are equivalent to those in the influents which is consistent with the negligible change of suspension properties however the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in the effluents collected from the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar are slightly less negative relative to those in the influents the observation indicates that biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment negatively decreases the zeta potentials of plastic particles thus less repulsion between the plastic particle and the quartz sand with biochar amendment and even attraction between the plastic particle and the quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are expected which theoretically supports the observation of the increased retention of plastic particles in the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to those without this modification however it should be noted that both the effluent properties and the zeta potentials of plastic particles in the effluents collected from the biochar amendment columns are similar to those collected from the fe3o4 biochar amendment columns yet the addition of fe3o4 biochar induces more effective retention of plastic particles than the addition of biochar this observation suggests that other mechanisms also contribute to the increased deposition of plastic particles when fe3o4 biochar is added to quartz sand 3 3 2 alteration of the porous media porosity previous studies have shown that the porosity of porous media affects the transport of colloids decreasing porosity increases colloid deposition moussaoui et al 1992 peulen and wilkinson 2011 the porosity of columns packed only with quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment was determined by the gravimetric method chen et al 2011 the porosity of quartz sand columns without amendment is 0 42 0 019 while the porosity of columns both with biochar amendment and with fe3o4 biochar amendment are found to be approximately 0 41 0 012 the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand slightly decrease the porosity by 0 01 this slightly decreased porosity only by 0 01 might have negligible contribution to the increased deposition of plastic particles in the columns note that the porosities of the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment are equal yet the increased plastic particle deposition is more obvious in the fe3o4 biochar amendment columns the observation suggests that other mechanisms might contribute to the more obvious enhancement of the plastic particle deposition due to the application of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand 3 3 3 alteration in the porous media adsorption capacity biochar and modified biochar have been reported to have superior adsorption capabilities for soil contaminates such as organic pollutants and heavy metals mohan et al 2014 qian et al 2016 shen et al 2019 the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand might increase the adsorption capability for plastic particles and thus lead to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles to test this adsorption experiments were conducted by choosing 0 02 Î¼m nps and 0 2 Î¼m mps as representative plastic particles it can be clearly seen from fig 4 that for both 0 02 Î¼m nps and 0 2 Î¼m mps in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions after 2 h adsorption the amounts of plastic particles adsorbed onto the different materials have the following order fe3o4 biochar biochar quartz sand for instance the adsorption fraction of 0 02 Î¼m nps by fe3o4 biochar biochar and quartz sand in 5 mm nacl solution is 31 7 12 8 and 5 1 respectively the orders of the adsorption capacity for plastic particles are consistent with the deposition trends of the plastic particles in porous media quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand with biochar amendment quartz sand without amendment clearly the transport and deposition behaviors of plastic particles in porous media have correlation with the adsorption capacity of porous media the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand might alter the zeta potentials of porous media leading to the increased plastic particle adsorption capacity of treated sand relative to bare quartz sand increased deposition of plastic particles in amended porous media table s1 shows that under all examined conditions zeta potentials of both biochar and fe3o4 biochar treated quartz sand are less negative relative to those of clean quartz sand which suggests that the electrostatic repulsion between the plastic particles and the quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment is lower relative to those between the plastic particles and the bare quartz sand without amendment fig s7 which theoretically supports the larger adsorption capacity for plastic particles by quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to bare quartz sand as a result the decreased transport and enhanced deposition of all three different sized plastic particles is observed in the quartz sand with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment moreover the zeta potentials of sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are less negative than those of sand with biochar amendment due to the less negative zeta potentials of fe3o4 biochar than biochar table s1 the electrostatic repulsion or energy barrier between plastic particles and quartz sand surfaces with fe3o4 biochar amendment is therefore lower than that between plastic particles and quartz sand with biochar amendment fig s7 accordingly greater deposition lager adsorption of plastic particles in quartz sand with the addition of fe3o4 biochar than in quartz sand with the addition of biochar is observed previous studies have also found that the transport and deposition of bio colloids sasidharan et al 2016 plastic particles li et al 2019 and graphene oxides wang et al 2017 would be greatly affected by the alteration in the zeta potentials of porous media surface roughness of porous media might be altered by the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand leading to the change of adsorption deposition capacity of plastic particles previous studies have shown that surface roughness both nano and micro scale plays critical roles on the retention of colloids in porous media bradford and torkzaban 2013 2015 jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 shen et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 sem images of quartz sand biochar and fe3o4 biochar fig 1c d and 1e show that for these three surfaces the roughness appears in the following order fe3o4 biochar biochar quartz sand note that the greater surface area of fe3o4 biochar 24 2 m2 g 1 than that of biochar 2 0 m2 g 1 fig s5 also indicates the larger surface roughness of fe3o4 biochar relative to biochar the increased surface roughness might contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar relative to that in the bare quartz sand to investigate whether the roughness would influence interaction force we calculated the dlvo interaction with the consideration of the surface roughness fig s8 details on the interaction energy calculation are provided in the supplementary materials the results show that the consideration of roughness significantly decreases the values of the energy barrier between plastic and all of the porous media bare quartz sand and quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment for example without considering the surface roughness the energy barriers between the 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps and the bare quartz sand in 5 mm nacl solution are about 27 kt 290 kt and 3220 kt respectively fig s7 taking the roughness into consideration the values of energy barrier decrease to about 10 kt 30 kt and 220 kt respectively fig s8 more importantly when considering the surface roughness the values of energy barrier between plastic particle and sand with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar under all examined solution conditions are lower than those between the plastics and the quartz sand without amendment which theoretically supports the enhanced deposition adsorption of plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar relative to that in bare quartz sand moreover when considering the roughness the energy barrier between the plastic particles and the fe3o4 biochar modified sand are lower than that between the plastics and the biochar modified sand as a result greater deposition of plastic particles is obtained in the fe3o4 biochar modified sand than in the biochar treated sand although both biochar and fe3o4 positive charge could adsorb plastic particles deposition of fe3o4 onto the biochar surfaces yet might have better adsorption performance than physical mixture of biochar and fe3o4 comparison of the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment 0 5 versus those without amendment with the addition of 0 41 w w biochar with the addition of 0 09 w w fe3o4 and with the addition of physical mixture of 0 41 w w biochar and 0 09 w w fe3o4 indicates that among the five amendments the fe3o4 biochar amendment display the best plastic particle retention performance fig 5 due to its magnetic properties fe3o4 tends to form aggregates and their specific surface area thus decreases however it would be difficult for fe3o4 particles deposited onto biochar surfaces to form aggregates they were evenly deposited on biochar surfaces fig 1 thus the surface area favorable for plastic particle adsorption is greater for fe3o4 biochar as a result the greatest plastic retention is observed in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment especially greater retention than physical mixture of biochar and fe3o4 shen et al 2019 also found that mgo modified biochar more effectively adsorbs lead cations than a physical mixture of mgo and biochar due to the even distribution of mgo particles on biochar surface 3 3 4 immobilization performance at high flow rates and the recovery of fe3o4 biochar after application a sudden rainstorm would increase the flow rates and decrease the solution ionic strength chatra et al 2019 hernandez crespo et al 2019 which might lead to the release of the biochar fe3o4 biochar and the detachment of plastic particles to investigate the release of biochar fe3o4 biochar and the detachment of plastic particles from the columns washing experiments were conducted by choosing 0 02 Î¼m nps as representative plastic particles and 25 mm nacl solution as representative deposition experimental solution condition after the transport experiment of 0 02 Î¼m nps in 25 mm nacl solution condition in porous media quartz sand and quartz sands with either biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment 10 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution at ph 6 was injected into the columns with flow rate of 4 ml min 1 to imitate heavy rain and the results are provided in fig s9 and fig 6 a negligible amount of biochar and fe3o4 biochar 1 is flushed out of the columns which indicates that after they were added to the quartz sand columns the biochar and fe3o4 biochar are relatively stable even when flushed with high flow rate fig s9 small amounts of the retained 0 02 Î¼m nps are found to detach from the porous media with increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength fig 6 specifically 16 5 14 6 and 7 5 of plastic particles based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns detach from quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment respectively clearly the addition of fe3o4 biochar to porous media not only causes more plastic particles to be retained but also results in less plastic particles being re mobilized after their retention than in the case of biochar amendment or no amendment under conditions of increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength it is worth pointing out that after the addition of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand prior to the plastic particle transport experiment 95 9 1 8 of the fe3o4 biochar could be recovered by magnet after the plastic particles transport experiment 0 02 Î¼m nps in 25 mm nacl as the representative case 74 7 1 6 of the fe3o4 biochar with plastic particles adsorbed onto their surfaces could still be recovered note that the approach that fe3o4 biochar were recovered after use by employing magnetic separation technique from the porous media slurry is similar as the recovery of nanoscale zero valent iron from soil slurry which has been well addressed in previous study phenrat et al 2019 moreover 87 3 5 4 plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nps as representative could be desorbed from fe3o4 biochar by dispersing the fe3o4 biochar with the adsorption of plastic particles onto their surfaces into 10 mm naoh solution with ultrasonication for 10 min since the majority of plastic particles could be desorbed from the surfaces of fe3o4 biochar it is highly likely that fe3o4 biochar can be utilized repeatedly for plastic particles immobilization after they were recovered and retreated to desorb plastic particles the above results clearly show that the addition of fe3o4 biochar to porous media could increase the immobilization of plastic particles moreover the majority of the fe3o4 biochar could be recycled after its application to porous media to retain plastic particles furthermore we found that majority of plastic particles can be desorbed from the surfaces of fe3o4 biochar the above results indicate that fe3o4 biochar has the potential application for plastic particle immobilization in soil 4 conclusion the results show that with the addition of 0 5 of biochar or fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand the transport of three different sized plastic particles in porous media is greatly decreased under two examined solution ionic strength conditions 5 and 25 mm in nacl solutions compared with biochar fe3o4 biochar exhibits more effective performance for the retention of all three different sized plastic particles under examined conditions the mechanisms driving to the enhanced plastic particle retention induced by the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were discussed the change in the suspension property the increase in the adsorption capacity resulted from the increase in the porous media surface roughness and the negative decrease in the zeta potentials of porous media are found to contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles moreover the potential release of biochar and fe3o4 biochar from the porous media were tested by increasing flow rate and lowering solution ionic strength to simulate the heavy rain we found that increasing the flow rate and decreasing the ionic strength did not lead to the release of biochar and fe3o4 biochar from the columns in addition after being immobilized by fe3o4 biochar only 7 5 of the previously deposited plastic particles can be released from column under the extreme flushing condition due to its magnetic property 74 of the fe3o4 biochar could be recovered from the porous media after the retention of plastic particles using a magnet although the results shown in the present study are drawn from the experiments performed in saturated porous media yet the representative experiments conducted in unsaturated porous media fig s10 also show the similar trend that the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into unsaturated porous media also decrease the transport of plastic particles the observations clearly indicate that for both unsaturated and saturated porous media the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar could inhibit the transport of plastic particles furthermore we found that decreased transport of all three different sized plastic particles were also observed when the same amount of biochar fe3o4 biochar were added into porous media as one layer of permeable barrier near to column inlet fig s11 indicating that biochar fe3o4 biochar especially magnetic biochar could be potentially applied as permeable barrier faisal et al 2018 johnson et al 2008 to immobilize plastic particles in porous media after the adsorption capacity of permeable barrier is fully filled biochar fe3o4 biochar can be extracted and replaced meanwhile preventing groundwater from plastic particle contamination might also be achieved by injecting the biochar fe3o4 biochar into subsurface at high flow rates the push techniques to inject the nanoparticles into the vicinity of the source zone of contamination via using high flow rates have been well addressed in previous studies phenrat et al 2010a 2011 phenrat and kumloet 2016 however it should be noted that the plastic particle transport experiments were conducted in quartz sand under simple solution chemistry conditions in present study previous studies amirbahman and olson 1994 cai et al 2019 he et al 2018 li et al 2019 peng et al 2017 phenrat et al 2010b walker and bob 2001 have shown that natural organic matter clay particles microorganisms engineered nanoparticles and so on which are ubiquitously present in the natural environment have influence on the transport of plastic particles in porous media these copresence of colloids definitely would also affect the transport of plastic particles in porous media with fe3o4 biochar amendment the recovery of fe3o4 biochar from soil and the desorption of plastic particles from fe3o4 biochar would also be affected by the copresence of colloids moreover the recycle process of fe3o4 biochar after use via magnet assisted soil washing might lead to the change of certain nutrients in natural environment to test the feasibility of biochar fe3o4 biochar in the inhibition of plastic particle transport in natural environments such as in soil further studies regarding the effects of copresence of colloids on the plastic particle transport and the recycle of fe3o4 biochar as well as the nutrients interference should be concerned overall the results of this study clearly showed that magnetic biochar could be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in soil or groundwater yet further studies still required prior to their real applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this

18376,as an environmentally friendly material biochar has been widely used to remediate soil water contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants the addition of biochar or modified biochar to porous media might affect the retention of plastic particles and thus influence their fate in natural environment in this study both biochar and magnetic biochar fe3o4 biochar were synthesized via a facile precipitation method at room temperature to determine the significance of biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment on the transport and deposition behaviors of plastic particles the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nano plastic particles and 0 2 Î¼m and 2 Î¼m micro plastic particles in quartz sand were compared with those obtained in quartz sand either with biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment in both 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions the results show that for all three different sized plastic particles under both examined solution conditions the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar in quartz sand decreases the transport and increases the retention of plastic particles in porous media fe3o4 biochar more effectively inhibits the transport of plastic particles than biochar we found that the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar could change the suspension property and increase the adsorption capacity of porous media due to the increase of porous media surface roughness and negatively decrease the zeta potentials of porous media contributing to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles moreover we found that negligible amount of biochar and fe3o4 biochar 1 were released from the columns following the plastic particle transport when the columns were eluted with very low ionic strength solution at high flow rate to simulate a sudden rainstorm similarly small amount of plastic particles were detached from the porous media under this extreme condition 16 5 for quartz sand 14 6 for quartz sand with biochar amendment and 7 5 for quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment we found that over 74 of the fe3o4 biochar can be recovered from the porous media after the retention of plastic particles by using a magnet and 87 plastic particles could be desorbed from fe3o4 biochar by dispersing the fe3o4 biochar into 10 mm naoh solution in addition we found that the amendment of unsaturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar also decreased the transport of plastic particles when biochar fe3o4 biochar were added into porous media as one layer of permeable barrier near to column inlet the decreased transport of plastic particles could be also obtained the results of this study indicate that magnetic biochar can be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems such as in soil or groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords plastic particles magnetic biochar retention adsorption porous media 1 introduction the use of agricultural mulch and greenhouse the irrigation of water with plastics as well as the application of sewage sludge containing microplastic particles on the agricultural land lead to the ubiquitous presence of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems especially in soil nizzetto et al 2016 rillig 2012 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 for example nizzetto et al 2016 estimated that 63 000 43 0000 and 44 000 300 000 tonnes of microplastics are likely added annually to farmlands in europe and north america respectively scheurer and bigalke 2018 reported that 90 of swiss floodplain soils contain plastic particles with concentrations of up to 55 5 mg kg 1 zhang and liu 2018 found that the concentrations of plastic particles in four cropped areas and an established riparian forest buffer zone at dian lake in southwestern china ranged from 7100 to 42 960 particles kg 1 mean 18 760 particles kg 1 since they contain different surface functional groups alimi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 plastic particles can adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants on their surfaces brennecke et al 2016 hirai et al 2011 hu et al 2017 thus the release of plastic particles into the natural environment such as soil system could induce the environmental risk the presence of plastic particles has been found to change soil properties qi et al 2018 have an influence on the soil biota huerta lwanga et al 2016 and have negative effects on crop growth maaÃ et al 2017 qi et al 2018 rillig et al 2017 for example huerta lwanga et al 2016 found that plastic particles significantly reduce the growth rate of the earthworm lumbricus terrestris plastic particles have been found to be able to enter into the terrestrial food chain huerta lwanga et al 2017 and thus could pose health risks of humans bouwmeester et al 2015 sharma and chatterjee 2017 therefore it is essential to inhibit the transport behaviors of plastic particles in porous media after they are released into natural environment as an environmentally friendly material biochar or modified biochar has been widely used to remediate soil contaminants such as heavy metals rajendran et al 2019 shen et al 2019 yang and jiang 2014 and organic pollutants liang et al 2019 rong et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 for example zhang et al 2010 found that the addition of pinus radiate derived biochars to soil could enhance the sorption of phenanthrene in soil rajendran et al 2019 found that the concentrations of cadmium in rice were reduced when adding sulfur and sulfur iron modified biochar to paddy soils shen et al 2019 reported that the introduction of mgo coated biochar to soil significantly facilitated lead removal owing to the numerous oxygen functional groups on biochar it is high likely that biochar could interact with plastic particles the addition of biochar into porous media might reduce the transport behaviors of plastic particles and thus decrease their environmental risks it should be noted that it is commonly difficult to recover biochar after they are added into porous media due to their magnetic property fe3o4 nanoparticles could be efficiently recycled after use via the employment of external magnetic force shan et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 thus the modification of biochar by magnetic fe3o4 could improve the potential recovery of the biochar being added into porous media moreover fe3o4 nanoparticles commonly contain positive surface charge under ph 6 5 jin et al 2015 thus they can adsorb negatively charged particles via attractive electrostatic interactions at ph 6 5 it is expected that the modification of biochar by magnetic fe3o4 could also increase the adsorption of plastic particles the addition of magnetic fe3o4 modified biochar to porous media might further increase the retention of plastic particles in the porous media in addition by using magnetic force fe3o4 modified biochar might be recoverable from porous media after its application to retain plastic particles herein biochar and the fe3o4 modified biochar fe3o4 biochar were synthesized and characterized their performances towards the retention of plastic particles in porous media were investigated in present study carboxylate modified polystyrene latex microspheres with diameter of 0 02 Î¼m as model nano plastic particles 0 2 Î¼m and 2 Î¼m as model microplastic particles were employed both the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of all three different sized plastic particles under environmentally relevant conditions in 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions in quartz sand were compared with those in quartz sand with 0 5 biochar amendment and in quartz sand with 0 5 fe3o4 biochar amendment the possible mechanisms enhancing the deposition of plastic particles by biochar and fe3o4 biochar are proposed and discussed the release of biochar fe3o4 biochar and plastic particles from the columns with increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength to stimulate a rainstorm were investigated the recovery efficiency of fe3o4 biochar from the porous media after the plastic particle transport was determined the desorption of plastic particles after they were adsorbed onto fe3o4 biochar was testified in addition the transport behaviors of plastic particles in unsaturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment as well as in saturated porous media with biochar fe3o4 biochar as permeable barrier near to the column inlet were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of biochar and fe3o4 biochar the biochar was prepared by heating cellulose purchased from j k scientific under oxygen limited conditions in a muffle furnace at 400 c for 6 h the detailed synthesis protocol was described in detail in a previous study yang et al 2018 the fe3o4 biochar was synthesized following a previous study shan et al 2015 briefly 0 932 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 985 g feso4 7h2o were dissolved in 200 ml milli q water in a 500 ml flask and then 2 g synthesized biochar was dispersed into the solution by ultrasonication for 5 min n2 was continually bubbled through the 200 ml solution to expel oxygen under vigorous mechanical agitation naoh 2 m l 1 was added dropwise to the flask at room temperature until the ph reached 10 the black precipitate was then formed and separated with an external magnet which was washed repeatedly with deionized water until the supernatant was neutral ph 7 then the composites referred as fe3o4 biochar were acquired after vacuum freeze drying for 24 h the mass ratio of biochar to fe3o4 was set to be 5 1 for the transport experiments the detailed information regarding why we chose this mass ratio is provided in fig s1 composites with different mass ratios of biochar to fe3o4 1 1 2 1 and 10 1 were also prepared according to the similar procedure 2 2 biochar and fe3o4 biochar characterization the biochar and fe3o4 biochar were characterized by powder x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrometer ft ir scanning electron microscope sem brunauere emmette teller bet adsorption isotherms as well as hysteresis loop analysis the zeta potentials and the sizes of biochar and fe3o4 biochar under experimental conditions were characterized using dynamic light scattering dls the concentration of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were determined by an uv spectrophotometer the detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 preparation of the plastic particle suspension polystyrene is one of the most widely distributed and abundant plastic types in the environment alimi et al 2018 carpente et al 1972 ivleva et al 2017 thus similar as previous studies alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2019 jeong et al 2017 li et al 2019 carboxylate modified polystyrene latex microspheres molecular probes invitrogen canada inc with diameter of 0 02 Î¼m as model nano plastic particles 0 2 Î¼m and 2 Î¼m as model microplastic particles were employed in present study the influent concentrations of the nps or mps were maintained at 4 mg l 1 15 by diluting the stock suspensions a fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to analyze the concentrations of the nps and mps the detailed information is provided in the supplementary materials the zeta potentials and the sizes of plastic particles biochar fe3o4 biochar and quartz sand in both 5 mm and 25 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 were determined by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk each measurement was repeated 9 12 times at room temperature 25 c the corresponding results are provided in table s1 2 4 column transport experiments porous media quartz sand without and with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar were wet packed into cylindrical plexiglas columns 10 cm long and 2 cm inner diameter the detailed column packing protocol is provided in supplementary materials after packing all sand columns were first equilibrated using ten pore volumes pvs of salt solutions at the desired ionic strength and ph following pre equilibration 3 pvs of the plastic particle suspension were injected into the column this was followed by elution with 5 pvs of salt solution at the same ionic strength the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 8 m day 1 0 73 ml min 1 using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa to represent fluid velocities in coarse aquifer sediments forced gradient conditions or engineered filtration systems cai et al 2013 harter et al 2000 for selected experiments after the entire plastic particle transport process 10 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution was injected into the column with increasing flow rate up to 4 ml min 1 to imitate the flow rate of a heavy rain event column effluent samples were collected and analyzed to yield the breakthrough curves and the quartz sand was dissected into 10 segments and employed to yield the retained profiles the protocol for obtaining the mass balance is provided in the supplementary materials the detailed overall recovery mass balance for the plastic particles in each experiment is provided in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar and fe3o4 biochar the phase and crystal structures of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were characterized by xrd analyses and the results are shown in fig 1 a the distinct peak at 2Î¸ 23 0 observed in the xrd pattern of biochar fabricated at 400 c is consistent with previous observations its pyrolytic temperature was higher than 350 c hao et al 2013 keiluweit et al 2010 after being modified by fe3o4 the peaks at 2Î¸ 30 1 35 5 43 1 57 1 and 62 6 which correspond to the planes of 112 103 004 321 and 224 of magnetite jcpds 75 1609 liang et al 2018 are present in the xrd pattern of fe3o4 biochar the ft ir results fig s2 show that both biochar and fe3o4 biochar contain hydrophilic functional groups such as c o c c c h and c o which is consistent with previous studies chen et al 2019 wan and li 2018 moreover a strong adsorption peak at 561 cm 1 fe o is observed in the ft ir spectra of fe3o4 biochar suggesting that iron oxides are present on the surfaces of the biochar as shown in the xps results fig s3a the main characteristic peaks of fe3o4 biochar are fe2p 724 ev o1s 531 ev and c1s 285 ev as shown in the high resolution xps spectrum of c fig s3b the sharp peak at 284 5 ev is corresponded to the c c bonds li and li 2019 while the peaks at 285 6 ev and 288 9 ev could be assigned to c o bonds and o c o bonds respectively wan and li 2018 in the high resolution xps spectra of fe fig s3c the binding energy of fe 2p 1 2 appears at 723 4 ev while that of fe 2p 3 2 located at 713 5 ev both of which are consistent with previously reported values of fe3o4 ma et al 2019 the peaks at 531 6 ev 533 2 ev and 530 3 ev observed in the xps spectra of o fig s3d can be attributed to c o o c o and fe o respectively ma et al 2019 wan and li 2018 the results further confirm that fe3o4 has been successfully anchored on the biochar the eds spectrum fig 1b shows the fe distribute areas aligned with those of o which further confirms the presence of fe3o4 on the biochar surface moreover the contentes of s and cl are very low data not shown which agrees well with the xps results and indicates the well crystallized fe3o4 biochar the bet surface area of biochar fig s4 is calculated to be 2 0 m2 g 1 which is similar as those synthesized at about 400 c reported in previous studies park et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 after modification with fe3o4 the bet surface area of the fe3o4 biochar increases to 24 2 m2 g 1 which suggests that fe3o4 biochar might have more adsorption sites and provide stronger adsorption capability than biochar the sem image fig 1d shows that the biochar have a rough surface as shown in fig 1e fe3o4 particles are deposited onto the biochar surface the mass percentage of fe3o4 on the fe3o4 biochar is determined to be 0 1733 both fe3o4 and fe3o4 biochar are found to be superparamagnetic fig s5 the magnetic saturation ms values of fe3o4 and fe3o4 biochar are determined to be 56 2 emu g 1 and 10 7 emu g 1 respectively the fe3o4 biochar can be conveniently and easily separated from water by a magnet within 2 min fig s6 in 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions at ph 6 the zeta potentials of biochar are determined to be negative table s1 while the overall zeta potentials of fe3o4 biochar are positive due to the deposition of positively charged fe3o4 onto the biochar surface 3 2 effects of biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment on plastic particle transport to understand whether the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand would affect the transport and retention of plastic particles transport experiments of three different sized plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps in quartz sand without and with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment were conducted at low 5 mm and high ionic strength 25 mm in nacl solutions at ph 6 without biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in clean quartz sand are high at both examined ionic strength conditions fig 2 specifically over 75 of plastic particles for all three different sizes pass through the quartz sand columns in 5 mm nacl solution the increase of solution ionic strength decreases the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles as well as those of quartz sand table s1 which decreases the overall dlvo interaction between the plastic particles and the quartz sand fig s7 thus the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles at high ionic strength 25 mm nacl are relatively lower than those at low ionic strength 5 mm nacl the lower breakthrough curves of colloids with increasing ionic strength have been widely reported bradford et al 2007 dong et al 2018 peng et al 2017 although the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in 25 mm nacl are lower relative to those in 5 mm nacl the percentages of plastic particles that passed through the quartz sand columns are still high in 25 mm nacl solution around 58 70 of plastic particles break through the quartz sand columns in 25 mm nacl solution fig 2 and table s2 under both examined ionic strength conditions the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment at an application rate of 0 5 are lower than those in clean quartz sand figs 2 and 3 for instance in 5 mm nacl solutions the breakthrough percentage for 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps in clean quartz sand is 78 5 77 7 and 75 2 respectively the corresponding percentage with the addition of biochar in quartz sand yet decreases to 68 5 37 4 and 36 9 respectively the introduction of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand further decrease the breakthrough percentage of 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps to 0 5 1 3 and 2 6 respectively these observations demonstrate that the addition of small amount of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand decreases the transport of all three different sized plastic particle in quartz sand under both ionic strength conditions abit et al 2014 also reported that pine chip biochars decreased the transport of 1 Î¼m diameter carboxylated polystyrene latex microspheres note that compared to those with biochar amendment the breakthrough curves of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are obviously lower under both examined ionic strength conditions the observation indicates that although the addition of biochar to quartz sand also decrease the transport of plastic particles fe3o4 biochar amendment is much more effective in inhibiting the transport of plastic particles comparison of the retained plastic particle profiles in quartz sand versus those in biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand shows that for all three different sized plastic particles at both ionic strengths the amounts of plastic particles retained in quartz sand with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar are greater than those in bare quartz sand table s2 and thus the corresponding retained profiles are higher in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to those in bare quartz sand figs 2 and 3 right the observations clearly show that the application of biochar fe3o4 biochar increases the retention of all three different sized plastic particles in porous media moreover for all three different sized plastic particles in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions the fe3o4 biochar results in greater plastic particle deposition than biochar the results indicate that both biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment could decrease the transport and increase the deposition of all three different sized plastic particles in quartz sand moreover fe3o4 biochar amendment is more effective to retain plastic particles than biochar 3 3 mechanisms for the enhanced deposition of plastic particles 3 3 1 alteration of the effluent properties previous studies have found that the application of biochar to soil could change the soil effluent properties abit et al 2012 bolster and abit 2012 laird et al 2010 to determine whether the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar would also affect the properties of column effluents both influents and effluents from columns packed with only quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment prior to the injection of plastic particle suspension after pre equilibration for 10 pvs of 5 mm nacl solutions were collected the concentrations of metal ions al ca fe mg and k ph and conductivity in both influents and effluents were analyzed the results table s3 show that for column packed only with quartz sand the ph value conductivity and the concentrations of al fe mg and k ions in both influent and effluent are similar which indicates that the properties of the salt suspension do not change during its passage through the quartz sand columns although the ph value and the concentrations of al fe mg and k ions are comparable in both influent and effluent of the columns packed with quartz sands with either biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment the concentrations of ca ions and the conductivity are higher in the effluents of these columns the observation indicates that the addition of either biochar or fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand slightly changes the effluent properties the increased conductivity and concentration of ca ions in the effluents of biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand suggests that compared with those in bare quartz sand the ionic strength of plastic particle suspension during its passage through the amendment columns would be slightly increased which would thus affect the zeta potentials of plastic particles to verify this zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in both influent and effluent suspensions in 5 mm nacl solutions were determined the results table s4 show that for clean quartz sand columns without biochar amendment the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in the effluents are equivalent to those in the influents which is consistent with the negligible change of suspension properties however the zeta potentials of all three different sized plastic particles in the effluents collected from the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar are slightly less negative relative to those in the influents the observation indicates that biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment negatively decreases the zeta potentials of plastic particles thus less repulsion between the plastic particle and the quartz sand with biochar amendment and even attraction between the plastic particle and the quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are expected which theoretically supports the observation of the increased retention of plastic particles in the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to those without this modification however it should be noted that both the effluent properties and the zeta potentials of plastic particles in the effluents collected from the biochar amendment columns are similar to those collected from the fe3o4 biochar amendment columns yet the addition of fe3o4 biochar induces more effective retention of plastic particles than the addition of biochar this observation suggests that other mechanisms also contribute to the increased deposition of plastic particles when fe3o4 biochar is added to quartz sand 3 3 2 alteration of the porous media porosity previous studies have shown that the porosity of porous media affects the transport of colloids decreasing porosity increases colloid deposition moussaoui et al 1992 peulen and wilkinson 2011 the porosity of columns packed only with quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment was determined by the gravimetric method chen et al 2011 the porosity of quartz sand columns without amendment is 0 42 0 019 while the porosity of columns both with biochar amendment and with fe3o4 biochar amendment are found to be approximately 0 41 0 012 the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand slightly decrease the porosity by 0 01 this slightly decreased porosity only by 0 01 might have negligible contribution to the increased deposition of plastic particles in the columns note that the porosities of the columns with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment are equal yet the increased plastic particle deposition is more obvious in the fe3o4 biochar amendment columns the observation suggests that other mechanisms might contribute to the more obvious enhancement of the plastic particle deposition due to the application of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand 3 3 3 alteration in the porous media adsorption capacity biochar and modified biochar have been reported to have superior adsorption capabilities for soil contaminates such as organic pollutants and heavy metals mohan et al 2014 qian et al 2016 shen et al 2019 the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand might increase the adsorption capability for plastic particles and thus lead to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles to test this adsorption experiments were conducted by choosing 0 02 Î¼m nps and 0 2 Î¼m mps as representative plastic particles it can be clearly seen from fig 4 that for both 0 02 Î¼m nps and 0 2 Î¼m mps in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions after 2 h adsorption the amounts of plastic particles adsorbed onto the different materials have the following order fe3o4 biochar biochar quartz sand for instance the adsorption fraction of 0 02 Î¼m nps by fe3o4 biochar biochar and quartz sand in 5 mm nacl solution is 31 7 12 8 and 5 1 respectively the orders of the adsorption capacity for plastic particles are consistent with the deposition trends of the plastic particles in porous media quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment quartz sand with biochar amendment quartz sand without amendment clearly the transport and deposition behaviors of plastic particles in porous media have correlation with the adsorption capacity of porous media the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand might alter the zeta potentials of porous media leading to the increased plastic particle adsorption capacity of treated sand relative to bare quartz sand increased deposition of plastic particles in amended porous media table s1 shows that under all examined conditions zeta potentials of both biochar and fe3o4 biochar treated quartz sand are less negative relative to those of clean quartz sand which suggests that the electrostatic repulsion between the plastic particles and the quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment is lower relative to those between the plastic particles and the bare quartz sand without amendment fig s7 which theoretically supports the larger adsorption capacity for plastic particles by quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment relative to bare quartz sand as a result the decreased transport and enhanced deposition of all three different sized plastic particles is observed in the quartz sand with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment moreover the zeta potentials of sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment are less negative than those of sand with biochar amendment due to the less negative zeta potentials of fe3o4 biochar than biochar table s1 the electrostatic repulsion or energy barrier between plastic particles and quartz sand surfaces with fe3o4 biochar amendment is therefore lower than that between plastic particles and quartz sand with biochar amendment fig s7 accordingly greater deposition lager adsorption of plastic particles in quartz sand with the addition of fe3o4 biochar than in quartz sand with the addition of biochar is observed previous studies have also found that the transport and deposition of bio colloids sasidharan et al 2016 plastic particles li et al 2019 and graphene oxides wang et al 2017 would be greatly affected by the alteration in the zeta potentials of porous media surface roughness of porous media might be altered by the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into quartz sand leading to the change of adsorption deposition capacity of plastic particles previous studies have shown that surface roughness both nano and micro scale plays critical roles on the retention of colloids in porous media bradford and torkzaban 2013 2015 jin et al 2017 rasmuson et al 2019 shen et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 sem images of quartz sand biochar and fe3o4 biochar fig 1c d and 1e show that for these three surfaces the roughness appears in the following order fe3o4 biochar biochar quartz sand note that the greater surface area of fe3o4 biochar 24 2 m2 g 1 than that of biochar 2 0 m2 g 1 fig s5 also indicates the larger surface roughness of fe3o4 biochar relative to biochar the increased surface roughness might contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar relative to that in the bare quartz sand to investigate whether the roughness would influence interaction force we calculated the dlvo interaction with the consideration of the surface roughness fig s8 details on the interaction energy calculation are provided in the supplementary materials the results show that the consideration of roughness significantly decreases the values of the energy barrier between plastic and all of the porous media bare quartz sand and quartz sands with biochar and fe3o4 biochar amendment for example without considering the surface roughness the energy barriers between the 0 02 Î¼m nps 0 2 Î¼m mps and 2 Î¼m mps and the bare quartz sand in 5 mm nacl solution are about 27 kt 290 kt and 3220 kt respectively fig s7 taking the roughness into consideration the values of energy barrier decrease to about 10 kt 30 kt and 220 kt respectively fig s8 more importantly when considering the surface roughness the values of energy barrier between plastic particle and sand with the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar under all examined solution conditions are lower than those between the plastics and the quartz sand without amendment which theoretically supports the enhanced deposition adsorption of plastic particles in quartz sand with biochar fe3o4 biochar relative to that in bare quartz sand moreover when considering the roughness the energy barrier between the plastic particles and the fe3o4 biochar modified sand are lower than that between the plastics and the biochar modified sand as a result greater deposition of plastic particles is obtained in the fe3o4 biochar modified sand than in the biochar treated sand although both biochar and fe3o4 positive charge could adsorb plastic particles deposition of fe3o4 onto the biochar surfaces yet might have better adsorption performance than physical mixture of biochar and fe3o4 comparison of the breakthrough curves of plastic particles in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment 0 5 versus those without amendment with the addition of 0 41 w w biochar with the addition of 0 09 w w fe3o4 and with the addition of physical mixture of 0 41 w w biochar and 0 09 w w fe3o4 indicates that among the five amendments the fe3o4 biochar amendment display the best plastic particle retention performance fig 5 due to its magnetic properties fe3o4 tends to form aggregates and their specific surface area thus decreases however it would be difficult for fe3o4 particles deposited onto biochar surfaces to form aggregates they were evenly deposited on biochar surfaces fig 1 thus the surface area favorable for plastic particle adsorption is greater for fe3o4 biochar as a result the greatest plastic retention is observed in quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment especially greater retention than physical mixture of biochar and fe3o4 shen et al 2019 also found that mgo modified biochar more effectively adsorbs lead cations than a physical mixture of mgo and biochar due to the even distribution of mgo particles on biochar surface 3 3 4 immobilization performance at high flow rates and the recovery of fe3o4 biochar after application a sudden rainstorm would increase the flow rates and decrease the solution ionic strength chatra et al 2019 hernandez crespo et al 2019 which might lead to the release of the biochar fe3o4 biochar and the detachment of plastic particles to investigate the release of biochar fe3o4 biochar and the detachment of plastic particles from the columns washing experiments were conducted by choosing 0 02 Î¼m nps as representative plastic particles and 25 mm nacl solution as representative deposition experimental solution condition after the transport experiment of 0 02 Î¼m nps in 25 mm nacl solution condition in porous media quartz sand and quartz sands with either biochar or fe3o4 biochar amendment 10 pvs of 0 1 mm nacl solution at ph 6 was injected into the columns with flow rate of 4 ml min 1 to imitate heavy rain and the results are provided in fig s9 and fig 6 a negligible amount of biochar and fe3o4 biochar 1 is flushed out of the columns which indicates that after they were added to the quartz sand columns the biochar and fe3o4 biochar are relatively stable even when flushed with high flow rate fig s9 small amounts of the retained 0 02 Î¼m nps are found to detach from the porous media with increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength fig 6 specifically 16 5 14 6 and 7 5 of plastic particles based on the total amount of plastics retained in columns detach from quartz sand quartz sand with biochar amendment and quartz sand with fe3o4 biochar amendment respectively clearly the addition of fe3o4 biochar to porous media not only causes more plastic particles to be retained but also results in less plastic particles being re mobilized after their retention than in the case of biochar amendment or no amendment under conditions of increasing flow rate and decreasing ionic strength it is worth pointing out that after the addition of fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand prior to the plastic particle transport experiment 95 9 1 8 of the fe3o4 biochar could be recovered by magnet after the plastic particles transport experiment 0 02 Î¼m nps in 25 mm nacl as the representative case 74 7 1 6 of the fe3o4 biochar with plastic particles adsorbed onto their surfaces could still be recovered note that the approach that fe3o4 biochar were recovered after use by employing magnetic separation technique from the porous media slurry is similar as the recovery of nanoscale zero valent iron from soil slurry which has been well addressed in previous study phenrat et al 2019 moreover 87 3 5 4 plastic particles 0 02 Î¼m nps as representative could be desorbed from fe3o4 biochar by dispersing the fe3o4 biochar with the adsorption of plastic particles onto their surfaces into 10 mm naoh solution with ultrasonication for 10 min since the majority of plastic particles could be desorbed from the surfaces of fe3o4 biochar it is highly likely that fe3o4 biochar can be utilized repeatedly for plastic particles immobilization after they were recovered and retreated to desorb plastic particles the above results clearly show that the addition of fe3o4 biochar to porous media could increase the immobilization of plastic particles moreover the majority of the fe3o4 biochar could be recycled after its application to porous media to retain plastic particles furthermore we found that majority of plastic particles can be desorbed from the surfaces of fe3o4 biochar the above results indicate that fe3o4 biochar has the potential application for plastic particle immobilization in soil 4 conclusion the results show that with the addition of 0 5 of biochar or fe3o4 biochar to quartz sand the transport of three different sized plastic particles in porous media is greatly decreased under two examined solution ionic strength conditions 5 and 25 mm in nacl solutions compared with biochar fe3o4 biochar exhibits more effective performance for the retention of all three different sized plastic particles under examined conditions the mechanisms driving to the enhanced plastic particle retention induced by the addition of biochar and fe3o4 biochar were discussed the change in the suspension property the increase in the adsorption capacity resulted from the increase in the porous media surface roughness and the negative decrease in the zeta potentials of porous media are found to contribute to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles moreover the potential release of biochar and fe3o4 biochar from the porous media were tested by increasing flow rate and lowering solution ionic strength to simulate the heavy rain we found that increasing the flow rate and decreasing the ionic strength did not lead to the release of biochar and fe3o4 biochar from the columns in addition after being immobilized by fe3o4 biochar only 7 5 of the previously deposited plastic particles can be released from column under the extreme flushing condition due to its magnetic property 74 of the fe3o4 biochar could be recovered from the porous media after the retention of plastic particles using a magnet although the results shown in the present study are drawn from the experiments performed in saturated porous media yet the representative experiments conducted in unsaturated porous media fig s10 also show the similar trend that the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar into unsaturated porous media also decrease the transport of plastic particles the observations clearly indicate that for both unsaturated and saturated porous media the addition of biochar fe3o4 biochar could inhibit the transport of plastic particles furthermore we found that decreased transport of all three different sized plastic particles were also observed when the same amount of biochar fe3o4 biochar were added into porous media as one layer of permeable barrier near to column inlet fig s11 indicating that biochar fe3o4 biochar especially magnetic biochar could be potentially applied as permeable barrier faisal et al 2018 johnson et al 2008 to immobilize plastic particles in porous media after the adsorption capacity of permeable barrier is fully filled biochar fe3o4 biochar can be extracted and replaced meanwhile preventing groundwater from plastic particle contamination might also be achieved by injecting the biochar fe3o4 biochar into subsurface at high flow rates the push techniques to inject the nanoparticles into the vicinity of the source zone of contamination via using high flow rates have been well addressed in previous studies phenrat et al 2010a 2011 phenrat and kumloet 2016 however it should be noted that the plastic particle transport experiments were conducted in quartz sand under simple solution chemistry conditions in present study previous studies amirbahman and olson 1994 cai et al 2019 he et al 2018 li et al 2019 peng et al 2017 phenrat et al 2010b walker and bob 2001 have shown that natural organic matter clay particles microorganisms engineered nanoparticles and so on which are ubiquitously present in the natural environment have influence on the transport of plastic particles in porous media these copresence of colloids definitely would also affect the transport of plastic particles in porous media with fe3o4 biochar amendment the recovery of fe3o4 biochar from soil and the desorption of plastic particles from fe3o4 biochar would also be affected by the copresence of colloids moreover the recycle process of fe3o4 biochar after use via magnet assisted soil washing might lead to the change of certain nutrients in natural environment to test the feasibility of biochar fe3o4 biochar in the inhibition of plastic particle transport in natural environments such as in soil further studies regarding the effects of copresence of colloids on the plastic particle transport and the recycle of fe3o4 biochar as well as the nutrients interference should be concerned overall the results of this study clearly showed that magnetic biochar could be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in soil or groundwater yet further studies still required prior to their real applications declaration of competing

the relationship between the microbial community and dom is complex especially in the confluence zone previous reports focused on shifts in the different bacterial community in response to exposure to the same terrestrial dom however the transformation of bacterial community induced by convergent dom remains unknown this study showed the shifts of dom components at the junction via excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis metabolic differences were also determined via phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states the results demonstrated a direct link between the microbial metabolism and dom biodegradation during the heterotrophic process in response to diverse dom conditions the taxonomic composition and metabolic function of the microbial community presented significant differences different taxa may be involved in metabolizing various dom components as indicative bacteria that are closely associated with dom components proteobacteria sphingomonas are significant for microbial utilization and were important during the dom degrading process compared with other conditions the abundance of carbon metabolism was higher in convergences where urban rivers joined with estuary or source water furthermore humic like dom converging in the confluence zone induced a more active lipid metabolism this study applied techniques

availability of highly concentrated dom forms an important contribution to eutrophication guenther and valentin 2009 information about the dynamic changes of dom in this process is thus of

saarenheimo et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 however dom of different quality and quantity exist in multifarious water confluences such as river lake interaction kaartokallio et al 2016 in which process biodegradation of dom hold an important position import flows add a mixture of nutrients at different levels that can cause changes of the microbial community microbial community structure and

nutrient cycling pollution transport and the allochthonous microbial communities structure and function beier et al 2015 it remains unclear how the characteristic of various composed dom will influence the microbial community and thus the fate of carbon and nutrients in the river ecosystem dom cycling in the aquatic food web is decomposed by the bacteria community and the relationship between both is complicated and bidirectional jansson et al 2007 it has been reported that dom can influence the dynamics of the major representative species of the heterotrophic bacterial community and these groups can also participate in the dom hydrolysis process kirchman et al 2004 aquatic settings of similar dom concentration and character may support engender different bacterial community

dom quality and quantity kirchman et al 2004 so far many studies have reported notable results and disciplines e g the dom degrading rules and relative changing patterns of the bacteria community landa et al 2014 however it is difficult to find high correspondence between these furthermore using phylogenetic information only derived from 16s rrna genes to predict the dom utilizing ability of one taxa is still not easy logue et al 2016 due to the complex nature and various sources dom of exactly the same quality and composition cannot be included in two different water areas even in similar environments holland et al 2018 the associations between the response of autochthonous communities in composition and function induced by various dom and the corresponding patterns in dom turnover are barely known this study assessed structural and metabolic variations of the microbial community the shifts in concentration and composition of dom and the associations of theses change at the confluence an indoor experiment was designed in which different dom media were inoculated with the same microbial communities to obtain a variety of dom characteristics over broad ranges in river confluence conditions dom were sampled at the intersections where urban rivers met the estuary the drinking water source and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp these areas span large gradients of environmental properties the microbial communities were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust while the dom were characterized via excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eem parafac analyses to determine component differences this work contributes to the completion of the research on links between microbe utilization and dom biodegradation based on a previous study logue et al 2016 the results provide insight into microcosmic changes of river

city inland rivers converge a site dws where the drinking water source met the urban river and the convergence jxz where the effluent from a wwtp was discharged into the river sampling was conducted on may 22 2018 the confluence represented an important input of upstream freshwater and organic carbon to the downstream area thirty water samples each 50 l were taken from each site specific water

prediction sequence analysis was performed using qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 29355 operational taxonomic units otus were assigned using uclust edgar 2010 based on 97 identity a representative sequence from each otu was classified using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier wang et al 2007 and a training set extracted from the silva v128 reference database the functional potentials of bacterial communities under different conditions were predicted using picrust 1 1 0 langille et al 2013 based on the 16s rrna sequences and the genome database picrust was employed to predict the functional composition of a metagenome clustered otus were used to pick the sampled reads against the greengenes 13 5 database the 16s rrna gene copy number was normalized using a normalized otu table finally the metagenome prediction of molecular functions was categorized into kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos at 1 3 pathway levels 2 6 statistical analyses to investigate whether the relative abundance of the microbial community was significantly different between treatments a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted relationships between bacterial assemblages were calculated by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds bray curtis distance ordination analysis of similarities anosim based on nmds was used to investigate significant differences among microbial communities to investigate whether taxonomic and relative abundances of functional gene categories were significantly different under various dom backgrounds lefse and statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp analyses were conducted the software stamp v 2 1 3 was used to analyze the kegg abundance profile to identify significant pathways for metabolism between groups using a two sided welch s t test heatmaps were created to investigate metabolic functional differences between communities based on the bray curtis distance understanding the interactions between the microbial community and dom is essential to identify community assembly rules for utilizing the organic matrix the co occurrence of bacterial otus and fluorescent intensities of parafac components was identified via mine statistics by calculating the maximal information coefficient mic reshef et al 2011 mic analysis can capture a wide range of correlations between data pairs which contain both linearity and nonlinearity multiple testing corrections accounted for the use of the false discovery rate fdr to modulate p values benjamini and hochberg 1995 false discovery rates were calculated using the r package locfdr efron 2004 the correlation was considered significant when fdr was 1 which was equivalent to mic 0 497 the matrix of mic values 0 497 was used with gephi v 9 1 to visualise the network of corresponding to positive linear correlations in these visualizations bacterial otus and dom components are represented as nodes that are connected by lines proportional in length to the mic value pearson product moment correlations were used to determine significant relationships p values 0 05 between metabolic function and significantly variable bacteria of phylogenetic structure among groups these correlations were conducted using r and were visualized using a heatmap in which p values were opposed to an Î± value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of dom in fluorescence doc concentrations varied among confluent sites in situ supplementary table s1 these ranged from 9 55 to 16 3 mg l following the sequence of sce jxz dws qhr previous research pointed out that doc are transported through estuaries to oceans seitzinger and sanders 1997 which could explain that doc were more abundant in estuary areas than in inland rivers parafac analysis identified six distinct fluorescent components for eem at all samples table 1 describing 98 83 of the variability within data the parafac model was compared against other published models in the openfluor database where 93 8 similarity matched to models component one c1 depicted characteristics as microbially dom with fewer aromatic structures peleato et al 2017 component two c2 categorized as the previously defined humic and fulvic like material was common in aquatic environment e g stream river estuary lakes wetlands and shelf seas lapierre and del giorgio 2014 component three c3 was previously reported to be related to proteinaceous tryptophan like matter cohen et al 2014 component four c4 showed locations of maximum peak intensities that are typical for what has been referred to as a combination of marine humic like peak m and terrestrially humic peak a shutova et al 2014 both c3 and c4 can be found in wastewater however c4 could either originate from recycled water greywater stream or treated drinking water murphy et al 2011 the jxz sample originated from wwtp contained higher abundances of proteins and humic substances fig 1 similar as the results reported by previous study yang et al 2014 component five c5 possessed low ex em wavelength fluorescence and was identified as a combination of protein like and tannin like d andrilli et al 2017 based on lower molecular weights and aromaticity c5 was confirmed to have higher bio availability cohen et al 2014 confluence area like dws and qhr had more abundant c5 constituent component six c6 exhibited fluorescence properties similar to humic and tryptophan like dom jorgensen et al 2011 which was abundant in sce and qhr samples the spectra and fluorescence intensities of six dom components changed in four experimental treatments were shown in fig 1 during the initial 12 h after inoculation the fluorescence intensities of most humic like dom and few proteinaceous dom decreased which was also found in previous research young et al 2004 this suggests that the loss of humus within a short incubation period could be explained as bacterial metabolism and the adsorption of humic matter onto bacterial cell walls along with other dissolved solids or inorganic colloids docherty et al 2006 compared with other confluence area most components including protein like and humic like matter turned more active in sce and wwtp area c4 showed similar fluctuation trends in all samples c5 exhibited strong changes suggesting that it was more labile than other organics as major component of tannins and humic dom compositions like c5 commonly exists in the aquatic system and were similar to fluorophore peak b tyrosine like ex 240 em 300 nm moreover the mineralization and remineralization processes caused a change of organic compounds in quantity it was confirmed that the utilization of the same dom component could vary over different water backgrounds however humus was less disturbed by various confluent environments finally the humification degree decreased in sce and jxz and increased in both qhr and dws therefore these results suggest that amino like dom can be rapidly utilized in all areas and the humification process will be accelerated in the confluence zone with high percentages of humic like dom 3 2 shifts in bacterial community composition in response to dom loads the individual populations i e otus were examined which contributed significantly to the differences in community composition between treatments from the start to the end of the experiment following quality filtering a total of 29 355 reads were obtained from 41 samples 36 experimental samples and 5 control samples experimental samples contained an average of 6583 otus bacterial communities under the four treatments were distinct from one another in composition and varied at the temporal scale fig 2 almost all reads were mainly assignable to eight phyla the results implied that in all microbial communities the four dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria proteobacteria have been reported to be able to decompose soluble sugars into both monosaccharides and short chain fatty acids xu et al 2017 it has been reported that proteobacteria could be strongly influenced by lipid and humic like dom while actinobacteria were reported to be significantly adjusted by aromatic and humic like dom liu et al 2019 bacteroidetes which are common and widespread in surface water bacterial communities were functional in decomposing hydrolytic cellulose starch polysaccharides and carbohydrate reddy et al 2019 and have been reported to respond rapidly and remineralize complex and labile dom bauer et al 2006 similar research which focused on the effect of dom addition to bacterial community reported that bacteroidetes alpha and betaproteobacteria were the particularly dominant phylum in response to elevated dom levels traving et al 2017 significant differences were found among samples in the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria p 0 05 taxonomic differences among different treatment over time were evident both betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria followed a trend of fluctuating decline in all conditions and a particular proliferation of betaproteobacteria occurred in the jxz treatment in contrast the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria increased with fluctuation and bacteroidetes increased at the beginning which was followed by a decrease the abundance of deltaproteobacteria shifted between the control and other dom liquor bacterial communities were significantly clustered according to the treatment fig 3 p 0 01 moreover the communities in the same sampling time among groups were taxonomically similar cyanobacteria and verrucomicbia were closer to each other low bray curtis distance fig 3 than other genera experimental bacterial assemblages with dom addition differed in composition compared to control samples and the distances subsequently shortened in non metric multidimensional scaling ordination fig 4 anosim analysis also showed a significant distinction p 0 05 in five dom backgrounds including control there were no significant differences p 0 107 in four treatment except for the control sample this indicates that dom play a significant role in the shaping of the structure of the microbial community and impact its composition 3 3 comparison of functional properties between different treatment functional differences among different treatments were clearly found in a comparison of the relative abundance of the picrust predicted kegg orthologies kos classified at level 2 involved metabolic pathways fig s1 pathways that are indicative of metabolic functions were clearly higher in the dws treatment which may be due to the similarity of dws and inoculated primary environment these major gene categories were significantly different in abundance among microbial communities in different dom treatment p 0 05 fig 5 the activities of lipid metabolism ether lipid metabolism followed the sequence of jxz sce dws qhr similarly it was found that addition of high molecular weight dom from surface seawater to microbial communities enriched genes that are involved in the lipid metabolism mccarren et al 2010 therefore the result indicates that the more humic like dom converge the more active lipid metabolisms will be induced at the confluence with regard to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins one carbon pool by folate and amino acid metabolism lysine degradation the sequences followed qhr dws sce and dws sce qhr both metabolic pathways were strongly associated with the degradation of alanine aspartate glutamate and other carbohydrates neis et al 2015 the pathways of the energy metabolism carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes were significantly higher in qhr and jxz compared with that in sce and dws p 0 05 this indicates an acceleration of nutrient conversion and a depletion of the available organic carbon shi et al 2017 in qhr and jxz microbial functional genes related to the lipid metabolism arachidonic acid metabolism were significantly more expressed in sce compared with that in qhr dws and jxz p 0 05 furthermore genes related to the carbohydrate metabolism propanoate metabolism and galactose metabolism were higher in sce than those at dws and jxz p 0 05 this suggested that the rates of carbon turnover and utilization capacity of carbon sources by bacterial community were higher zhou et al 2019 in sce however functional genes that are linked to the carbohydrate metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis and inositol phosphate metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism fluorobenzoate degradation were significantly lower in jxz p 0 05 this may be related to the high percentage of humic components compared with sce qhr and jxz the functional genes that are involved in the amino acid metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism of cofactors and vitamins retinol metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis were significantly lower in dws p 0 05 this implies that the biodegradations of labile substances e g amino acids were less active in dws additionally functional genes linked with the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides geraniol degradation and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism caprolactam degradation were higher in dws than in sce and qhr p 0 05 similar results were reported which indicates that refractory organics could be mainly degraded by thermophilic bacteria wang et al 2018 all of the above may contribute to higher abundances of metabolic function level 2 in dws than in other dom backgrounds 3 4 co occurrence between community composition and dom components metabolic function and dom components mic analysis provided information about direct associations between fi and relative abundances of the most abundant bacterial taxa at the end of the experiment classified predominantly as proteobacteria and to a far lesser extent bacteroidetes as shown in fig 6 it was found that 199 217 25 and 119 otus had associations with various dom components in sce qhr dws and jxz samples respectively actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were highly relevant to dom components different taxa involved in metabolizing dom components with various characteristics alphaproteobacteria otu 3912 gammaproteobacteria otu 2010 and verrucomicrobia otu 2902 showed positive correlations with c2 both in sce and qhr implying that these otus were close to humic like dom actinobacteria otu 296 betaproteobacteria otu 4965 gammaproteobacteria otu 163 1047 1769 and 3456 deltaproteobacteria otu 162 and verrucomicrobia otu 82 had close links with protein like and amino acids like components gemmatimonadetes and planctomycetes had close connections with humic like and amino acids like components in sce and jxz area both phyla exist in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ward et al 2006 and members of gemmatimonadetes were reported to be highly abundant after dom addition traving et al 2017 as minor phyla in freshwater populations of verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes were suggested to participate in n acetyl glucosamine nag degradation in lakes tada and grossart 2014 compared with other dom components humic like components c2 c4 and c6 exhibited a higher degree of connectivity with otu c1 c2 and c4 formed closely related groups in jxz moreover the highly active component c5 was bound to proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria in sce qhr and dws proteobacteria have been confirmed to be significantly linked to dom concentration and or composition amaral et al 2016 actinobacteria are abundant in freshwaters and involved in dom hydrolysis process kirchman et al 2004 ma et al 2019 deltaproteobacteria were found to be strongly correlated with c5 and c6 sce c1 c3 c4 and c5 qhr and c6 jxz suggesting that both humic like and protein like dom may be contributing factors to the significant difference of this class among groups most protein like and humic like organic matter exhibited high associations with otu in the mic analysis a number of studies indicated that the distribution and dynamic changes of the humic substances follow pronounced correlations with the production of microbial metabolites lee et al 2019 even though humic like dom coagulated through abiotic self assembly are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to both carbohydrates and protein like dom beier et al 2015 compared to low molecular weight dom the high molecular weight organics were generally characterized with high hydrophobic properties and numerous functional groups xu et al 2019 a previous study showed that bacteria were able to consume refractory dom the microbial reworking of which is important in freshwater systems docherty et al 2006 it can be inferred that humic like matter together with most protein or tyrosine like substances is closely linked to microbes which may be due to the unique and functional compositions and impact ecosystem function to better understand the relationship between dom and the microbial community for the utilization and degradation process further research was conducted on the functional level through lefse analysis various genera among groups have been selected fig s2 pearson product moment correlations were calculated to explore significant relationships p values 0 01 rho values 0 9 between metabolic function and bacteria indicative of group difference fig s3 energy metabolism carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism caprolactam degradation were significantly associated with proteobacteria sphingomonas and acinetobacter in all treatments and highly correlated in qhr and dws the active carbon fixation function and genera that were significantly linked with this function may explain the observed increase of fluorescence intensity during the cultivation process this suggests that the microbial utilization of dom in dws may be due to the function of caprolactam degradation the lipid metabolism arachidonic acid metabolism was only highly correlated with proteobacteria sphingopyxis in sce which corresponds to the result of the functional prediction and might be linked to a shift of amino acid like matter such as c2 in sce however the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins retinol metabolism was also closely linked to proteobacteria candidatus accumulibacter only in dws which did not match the functional prediction by comparing the results of mic and pearson analysis sphingomonas varied among groups and were found to be significantly correlated to both dom components and metabolism function the variation of the microbial community in composition or function between treatments may be due to utilizing dom containing humic like protein like and tannin like dom through this genus furthermore not every component in different confluence area had the same degrading tendency and correlation with microbes e g c1 in qhr and jxz samples and c3 in sce and qhr samples the degree of dom biodegradation depends on not only the microbial community structure but also the chemical properties of dom components moreover the observed fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom are a subset of the total dom pool stubbins et al 2014 which suggested that the remaining dom may also contribute to the degrading processes meanwhile various bacterial phylogenetic communities are dominant in different compositions of dom cottrell and kirchman 2000 and responses of a number of bacteria to various amino acid were completely different in that they were auxotrophic for specific amino acids tripp et al 2009 dom is an assemblage of many components and the biodegradation of one ingredient may change according to the characteristics of other composed organic matter these results suggested that the source quality and quantity of dom varied in different river confluences and a number of dom components overlapped which would induce a change of microbial phylogeny and exert significant impacts on the metabolic balance of pools or river systems 4 conclusions in the natural inland watershed the influence zone composed by the accepted river and its input rivers is highly complex various dom originating from different flows and background interact with each other and impact both the microbial community and the ecosystem this study documented the changes of different converged dom biodegraded by the same bacterial community and detailed the responses of community in taxonomy and metabolic function significant shifts of taxa at the genus level structure and level 2 metabolic function were found among groups eem parafac analysis indicated that most dom components shifted differently in various conditions moreover even though organics like protein and amino acid were first utilized humics showed more abundant correlation with community and microbial metabolism actinobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia were found to be closely linked to the degradation of humic like matter moreover the results of otu filtering correlated with dom and genera associated with metabolic function overlapped proteobacteria sphingomonas this suggests that the coinciding microbes may be the key for the exploration of the biodegradation process of dom deltaproteobacteria turned to be significantly different even though the whole bacterial phylogeny were not significantly different among various dom backgrounds the metabolism of the same microbial community shaped differently when facing dom in various urban river confluences the utilization capacity of carbon sources by the bacterial community were higher in the estuary the metabolic function was more abundant at the intersection of source water and urban rivers the abundance of the microbial metabolism was lower downstream of the wwtp effluent this work offers a method to investigate the biodegraded of various dom compounds and provides a

nutritional conditions in the tributaries may impact the degradation of dom downstream grinsted et al 2013 guo et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 few studies have investigated inland river confluence areas saarenheimo et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 however dom of different quality and quantity exist in multifarious water confluences such as river lake interaction kaartokallio et al 2016 in which process biodegradation of dom hold an important position import flows add a mixture of nutrients at different levels that can cause changes of the microbial community microbial community structure and function can shift with changing carbon loading traving et al 2017 during the metabolic process dom character can influence water safety and ecosystem functional variables including light absorption nutrient cycling pollution transport and the allochthonous microbial communities structure and function beier et al 2015 it remains unclear how the characteristic of various composed dom will influence the microbial community and thus the fate of carbon and nutrients in the river ecosystem dom cycling in the aquatic food web is decomposed by the bacteria community and the relationship between both is complicated and bidirectional jansson et al 2007 it has been reported that dom can influence the dynamics of the major representative species of the heterotrophic bacterial community and these groups can also participate in the dom hydrolysis process kirchman et al 2004 aquatic settings of similar dom concentration and character may support engender different bacterial community structures logue et al 2016 researchers have pointed out that functionally distinct bacterial groups play key roles in the variation of bacterial respiration and production when faced with changes in dom quality and quantity kirchman et al 2004 so far many studies have reported notable results and disciplines e g the dom degrading rules and relative changing patterns of the bacteria community landa et al 2014 however it is difficult to find high correspondence between these furthermore using phylogenetic information only derived from 16s rrna genes to predict the dom utilizing ability of one taxa is still not easy logue et al 2016 due to the complex nature and various sources dom of exactly the same quality and composition cannot be included in two different water areas even in similar environments holland et al 2018 the associations between the response of autochthonous communities in composition and function induced by various dom and the corresponding patterns in dom turnover are barely known this study assessed structural and metabolic variations of the microbial community the shifts in concentration and composition of dom and the associations of theses change at the confluence an indoor experiment was designed in which different dom media were inoculated with the same microbial communities to obtain a variety of dom characteristics over broad ranges in river confluence conditions dom were sampled at the intersections where urban rivers met the estuary the drinking water source and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant wwtp these areas span large gradients of environmental properties the microbial communities were analyzed via high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust while the dom were characterized via excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eem parafac analyses to determine component differences this work contributes to the completion of the research on links between microbe utilization and dom biodegradation based on a previous study logue et al 2016 the results provide insight into microcosmic changes of river confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling four typical confluence areas were studied in this experiment which are all situated in the qinhuai river basin of nanjing china table s1 these areas differ in dissolved organic carbon doc characteristics and the types of confluent rivers they were respectively an estuary sce in which the qinhuai river joined the yangtze river a junction qhr where city inland rivers converge a site dws where the drinking water source met the urban river and the convergence jxz where the effluent from a wwtp was discharged into the river sampling was conducted on may 22 2018 the confluence represented an important input of upstream freshwater and organic carbon to the downstream area thirty water samples each 50 l were taken from each site specific water

analyses including tn tp and doc all samples were taking grab samples and were collected in sterile 25 l polypropylene bottles samples were kept cold and in the dark during transportation to the laboratory upon arrival at the laboratory samples were stored at 4 c and in the dark until further processing 2 2 experimental design a batch culture approach was applied in which different media were inoculated with the same bacteria from the yr sample table s1 a control treatment consisted of medium made by ultrapure water and was run alongside the four experimental treatments microbial inocula were added in 1 l glass bottles by precombusted gf d filters guo et al 2014 which were sealed according to logue et al 2016 batch cultures were filled without headspace and were continuously oscillated by shaker throughout the experiment the media were prepared from water samples collected from the four pools sce qhr dws and jxz by filtering through a 0 22 Î¼m pes filtrate which was rinsed with milli q and heat sterilized at 120 c before utilization 1 l liquid media were prepared which were diluted to a final concentration of 17 mg c l 1 nitrogen and phosphorus were added as nh4 no3 final concentration 8 5 mg n l 1 and nah2 po4 final concentration 0 3 mg p l 1 respectively thus avoiding nitrogen and phosphorus limitation sterile media were prepared via uv hijnen et al 2006 all experimental treatments and the control were run in three independent triplicates each the experiment was operated in a constant temperature shaker at 15 c and in the dark dom fluorescence and microbial analysis were sampled nine times at 0 12 24 48 72 96 120 168 and 360 h 2 3 fluorescence characterization excitation emission matrices eems were collected with a fluorescence

shanghai biozeron bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china through quality checking barcodes and primers of raw illumina paired end reads that exceeded 75 of the amplicon length were trimmed off and combined using flash v1 2 7 data for all samples are available on the sequence read archive http www ncbi nlm nih gov sra project reference srp212348 2 5 sequence analyses and functional gene prediction sequence analysis was performed using qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 29355 operational taxonomic units otus were assigned using uclust edgar 2010 based on 97 identity a representative sequence from each otu was classified using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier wang et al 2007 and a training set extracted from the silva v128 reference database the functional potentials of bacterial communities under different conditions were predicted using picrust 1 1 0 langille et al 2013 based on the 16s rrna sequences and the genome database picrust was employed to predict the functional composition of a metagenome clustered otus were used to pick the sampled reads against the greengenes 13 5 database the 16s rrna gene copy number was normalized using a normalized otu table finally the metagenome prediction of molecular functions was categorized into kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos at 1 3 pathway levels 2 6 statistical analyses to investigate whether the relative abundance of the microbial community was significantly different between treatments a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted relationships between bacterial assemblages were calculated by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds bray curtis distance ordination analysis of similarities anosim based on nmds was used to investigate significant differences among microbial communities to investigate whether taxonomic and relative abundances of functional gene categories were significantly different under various dom backgrounds lefse and statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp analyses were conducted the software stamp v 2 1 3 was used to analyze the kegg abundance profile to identify significant pathways for metabolism between groups using a two sided welch s t test heatmaps were created to investigate metabolic functional differences between communities based on the bray curtis distance understanding the interactions between the microbial community and dom is essential to identify community assembly rules for utilizing the organic matrix the co occurrence of bacterial otus and fluorescent intensities of parafac components was identified via mine statistics by calculating the maximal information coefficient mic reshef et al 2011 mic analysis can capture a wide range of correlations between data pairs which contain both linearity and nonlinearity multiple testing corrections accounted for the use of the false discovery rate fdr to modulate p values benjamini and hochberg 1995 false discovery rates were calculated using the r package locfdr efron 2004 the correlation was considered significant when fdr was 1 which was equivalent to mic 0 497 the matrix of mic values 0 497 was used with gephi v 9 1 to visualise the network of corresponding to positive linear correlations in these visualizations bacterial otus and dom components are represented as nodes that are connected by lines proportional in length to the mic value pearson product moment correlations were used to determine significant relationships p values 0 05 between metabolic function and significantly variable bacteria of phylogenetic structure among groups these correlations were conducted using r and were visualized using a heatmap in which p values were opposed to an Î± value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of dom in fluorescence doc concentrations varied among confluent sites in situ supplementary table s1 these ranged from 9 55 to 16 3 mg l following the sequence of sce jxz dws qhr previous research pointed out that doc are transported through estuaries to oceans seitzinger and sanders 1997 which could explain that doc were more abundant in estuary areas than in inland rivers parafac analysis identified six distinct fluorescent components for eem at all samples table 1 describing 98 83 of the variability within data the parafac model was compared against other published models in the openfluor database where 93 8 similarity matched to models component one c1 depicted characteristics as microbially dom with fewer aromatic structures peleato et al 2017 component two c2 categorized as the previously defined humic and fulvic like material was common in aquatic environment e g stream river estuary lakes wetlands and shelf seas lapierre and del giorgio 2014 component three c3 was previously reported to be related to proteinaceous tryptophan like matter cohen et al 2014 component four c4 showed locations of maximum peak intensities that are typical for what has been referred to as a combination of marine humic like peak m and terrestrially humic peak a shutova et al 2014 both c3 and c4 can be found in wastewater however c4 could either originate from recycled water greywater stream or treated drinking water murphy et al 2011 the jxz sample originated from wwtp contained higher abundances of proteins and humic substances fig 1 similar as the results reported by previous study yang et al 2014 component five c5 possessed low ex em wavelength fluorescence and was identified as a combination of protein like and tannin like d andrilli et al 2017 based on lower molecular weights and aromaticity c5 was confirmed to have higher bio availability cohen et al 2014 confluence area like dws and qhr had more abundant c5 constituent component six c6 exhibited fluorescence properties similar to humic and tryptophan like dom jorgensen et al 2011 which was abundant in sce and qhr samples the spectra and fluorescence intensities of six dom components changed in four experimental treatments were shown in fig 1 during the initial 12 h after inoculation the fluorescence intensities of most humic like dom and few proteinaceous dom decreased which was also found in previous research young et al 2004 this suggests that the loss of humus within a short incubation period could be explained as bacterial metabolism and the adsorption of humic matter onto bacterial cell walls along with other dissolved solids or inorganic colloids docherty et al 2006 compared with other confluence area most components including protein like and humic like matter turned more active in sce and wwtp area c4 showed similar fluctuation trends in all samples c5 exhibited strong changes suggesting that it was more labile than other organics as major component of tannins and humic dom compositions like c5 commonly exists in the aquatic system and were similar to fluorophore peak b tyrosine like ex 240 em 300 nm moreover the mineralization and remineralization processes caused a change of organic compounds in quantity it was confirmed that the utilization of the same dom component could vary over different water backgrounds however humus was less disturbed by various confluent environments finally the humification degree decreased in sce and jxz and increased in both qhr and dws therefore these results suggest that amino like dom can be rapidly utilized in all areas and the humification process will be accelerated in the confluence zone with high percentages of humic like dom 3 2 shifts in bacterial community composition in response to dom loads the individual populations i e otus were examined which contributed significantly to the differences in community composition between treatments from the start to the end of the experiment following quality filtering a total of 29 355 reads were obtained from 41 samples 36 experimental samples and 5 control samples experimental samples contained an average of 6583 otus bacterial communities under the four treatments were distinct from one another in composition and varied at the temporal scale fig 2 almost all reads were mainly assignable to eight phyla the results implied that in all microbial communities the four dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria proteobacteria have been reported to be able to decompose soluble sugars into both monosaccharides and short chain fatty acids xu et al 2017 it has been reported that proteobacteria could be strongly influenced by lipid and humic like dom while actinobacteria were reported to be significantly adjusted by aromatic and humic like dom liu et al 2019 bacteroidetes which are common and widespread in surface water bacterial communities were functional in decomposing hydrolytic cellulose starch polysaccharides and carbohydrate reddy et al 2019 and have been reported to respond rapidly and remineralize complex and labile dom bauer et al 2006 similar research which focused on the effect of dom addition to bacterial community reported that bacteroidetes alpha and betaproteobacteria were the particularly dominant phylum in response to elevated dom levels traving et al 2017 significant differences were found among samples in the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria p 0 05 taxonomic differences among different treatment over time were evident both betaproteobacteria and actinobacteria followed a trend of fluctuating decline in all conditions and a particular proliferation of betaproteobacteria occurred in the jxz treatment in contrast the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria increased with fluctuation and bacteroidetes increased at the beginning which was followed by a decrease the abundance of deltaproteobacteria shifted between the control and other dom liquor bacterial communities were significantly clustered according to the treatment fig 3 p 0 01 moreover the communities in the same sampling time among groups were taxonomically similar cyanobacteria and verrucomicbia were closer to each other low bray curtis distance fig 3 than other genera experimental bacterial assemblages with dom addition differed in composition compared to control samples and the distances subsequently shortened in non metric multidimensional scaling ordination fig 4 anosim analysis also showed a significant distinction p 0 05 in five dom backgrounds including control there were no significant differences p 0 107 in four treatment except for the control sample this indicates that dom play a significant role in the shaping of the structure of the microbial community and impact its composition 3 3 comparison of functional properties between different treatment functional differences among different treatments were clearly found in a comparison of the relative abundance of the picrust predicted kegg orthologies kos classified at level 2 involved metabolic pathways fig s1 pathways that are indicative of metabolic functions were clearly higher in the dws treatment which may be due to the similarity of dws and inoculated primary environment these major gene categories were significantly different in abundance among microbial communities in different dom treatment p 0 05 fig 5 the activities of lipid metabolism ether lipid metabolism followed the sequence of jxz sce dws qhr similarly it was found that addition of high molecular weight dom from surface seawater to microbial communities enriched genes that are involved in the lipid metabolism mccarren et al 2010 therefore the result indicates that the more humic like dom converge the more active lipid metabolisms will be induced at the confluence with regard to the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins one carbon pool by folate and amino acid metabolism lysine degradation the sequences followed qhr dws sce and dws sce qhr both metabolic pathways were strongly associated with the degradation of alanine aspartate glutamate and other carbohydrates neis et al 2015 the pathways of the energy metabolism carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes were significantly higher in qhr and jxz compared with that in sce and dws p 0 05 this indicates an acceleration of nutrient conversion and a depletion of the available organic carbon shi et al 2017 in qhr and jxz microbial functional genes related to the lipid metabolism arachidonic acid metabolism were significantly more expressed in sce compared with that in qhr dws and jxz p 0 05 furthermore genes related to the carbohydrate metabolism propanoate metabolism and galactose metabolism were higher in sce than those at dws and jxz p 0 05 this suggested that the rates of carbon turnover and utilization capacity of carbon sources by bacterial community were higher zhou et al 2019 in sce however functional genes that are linked to the carbohydrate metabolism glycolysis gluconeogenesis and inositol phosphate metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism fluorobenzoate degradation were significantly lower in jxz p 0 05 this may be related to the high percentage of humic components compared with sce qhr and jxz the functional genes that are involved in the amino acid metabolism phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism of cofactors and vitamins retinol metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis were significantly lower in dws p 0 05 this implies that the biodegradations of labile substances e g amino acids were less active in dws additionally functional genes linked with the metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides geraniol degradation and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism caprolactam degradation were higher in dws than in sce and qhr p 0 05 similar results were reported which indicates that refractory organics could be mainly degraded by thermophilic bacteria wang et al 2018 all of the above may contribute to higher abundances of metabolic function level 2 in dws than in other dom backgrounds 3 4 co occurrence between community composition and dom components metabolic function and dom components mic analysis provided information about direct associations between fi and relative abundances of the most abundant bacterial taxa at the end of the experiment classified predominantly as proteobacteria and to a far lesser extent bacteroidetes as shown in fig 6 it was found that 199 217 25 and 119 otus had associations with various dom components in sce qhr dws and jxz samples respectively actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were highly relevant to dom components different taxa involved in metabolizing dom components with various characteristics alphaproteobacteria otu 3912 gammaproteobacteria otu 2010 and verrucomicrobia otu 2902 showed positive correlations with c2 both in sce and qhr implying that these otus were close to humic like dom actinobacteria otu 296 betaproteobacteria otu 4965 gammaproteobacteria otu 163 1047 1769 and 3456 deltaproteobacteria otu 162 and verrucomicrobia otu 82 had close links with protein like and amino acids like components gemmatimonadetes and planctomycetes had close connections with humic like and amino acids like components in sce and jxz area both phyla exist in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ward et al 2006 and members of gemmatimonadetes were reported to be highly abundant after dom addition traving et al 2017 as minor phyla in freshwater populations of verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes were suggested to participate in n acetyl glucosamine nag degradation in lakes tada and grossart 2014 compared with other dom components humic like components c2 c4 and c6 exhibited a higher degree of connectivity with otu c1 c2 and c4 formed closely related groups in jxz moreover the highly active component c5 was bound to proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria in sce qhr and dws proteobacteria have been confirmed to be significantly linked to dom concentration and or composition amaral et al 2016 actinobacteria are abundant in freshwaters and involved in dom hydrolysis process kirchman et al 2004 ma et al 2019 deltaproteobacteria were found to be strongly correlated with c5 and c6 sce c1 c3 c4 and c5 qhr and c6 jxz suggesting that both humic like and protein like dom may be contributing factors to the significant difference of this class among groups most protein like and humic like organic matter exhibited high associations with otu in the mic analysis a number of studies indicated that the distribution and dynamic changes of the humic substances follow pronounced correlations with the production of microbial metabolites lee et al 2019 even though humic like dom coagulated through abiotic self assembly are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to both carbohydrates and protein like dom beier et al 2015 compared to low molecular weight dom the high molecular weight organics were generally characterized with high hydrophobic properties and numerous functional groups xu et al 2019 a previous study showed that bacteria were able to consume refractory dom the microbial reworking of which is important in freshwater systems docherty et al 2006 it can be inferred that humic like matter together with most protein or tyrosine like substances is closely linked to microbes which may be due to the unique and functional compositions and impact ecosystem function to better understand the relationship between dom and the microbial community for the utilization and degradation process further research was conducted on the functional level through lefse analysis various genera among groups have been selected fig s2 pearson product moment correlations were calculated to explore significant relationships p values 0 01 rho values 0 9 between metabolic function and bacteria indicative of group difference fig s3 energy metabolism carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism caprolactam degradation were significantly associated with proteobacteria sphingomonas and acinetobacter in all treatments and highly correlated in qhr and dws the active carbon fixation function and genera that were significantly linked with this function may explain the observed increase of fluorescence intensity during the cultivation process this suggests that the microbial utilization of dom in dws may be due to the function of caprolactam degradation the lipid metabolism arachidonic acid metabolism was only highly correlated with proteobacteria sphingopyxis in sce which corresponds to the result of the functional prediction and might be linked to a shift of amino acid like matter such as c2 in sce however the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins retinol metabolism was also closely linked to proteobacteria candidatus accumulibacter only in dws which did not match the functional prediction by comparing the results of mic and pearson analysis sphingomonas varied among groups and were found to be significantly correlated to both dom components and metabolism function the variation of the microbial community in composition or function between treatments may be due to utilizing dom containing humic like protein like and tannin like dom through this genus furthermore not every component in different confluence area had the same degrading tendency and correlation with microbes e g c1 in qhr and jxz samples and c3 in sce and qhr samples the degree of dom biodegradation depends on not only the microbial community structure but also the chemical properties of dom components moreover the observed fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom are a subset of the total dom pool stubbins et al 2014 which suggested that the remaining dom may also contribute to the degrading processes meanwhile various bacterial phylogenetic communities are dominant in different compositions of dom cottrell and kirchman 2000 and responses of a number of bacteria to various amino acid were completely different in that they were auxotrophic for specific amino acids tripp et al 2009 dom is an assemblage of many components and the biodegradation of one ingredient may change according to the characteristics of other composed organic matter these results suggested that the source quality and quantity of dom varied in different river confluences and a number of dom components overlapped which would induce a change of microbial phylogeny and exert significant impacts on the metabolic balance of pools or river systems 4 conclusions in the natural inland watershed the influence zone composed by the accepted river and its input rivers is highly complex various dom originating from different flows and background interact with each other and impact both the microbial community and the ecosystem this study documented the changes of different converged dom biodegraded by the same bacterial community and detailed the responses of community in taxonomy and metabolic function significant shifts of taxa at the genus level structure and level 2 metabolic function were found among groups eem parafac analysis indicated that most dom components shifted differently in various conditions moreover even though organics like protein and amino acid were first utilized humics showed more abundant correlation with community and microbial metabolism actinobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia were found to be closely linked to the degradation of humic like matter moreover the results of otu filtering correlated with dom and genera associated with metabolic function overlapped proteobacteria sphingomonas this suggests that the coinciding microbes may be the key for the exploration of the biodegradation process of dom deltaproteobacteria turned to be significantly different even though the whole bacterial phylogeny were not significantly different among various dom backgrounds the metabolism of the same microbial community shaped differently when facing dom in various urban river confluences the utilization capacity of carbon sources by the bacterial community were higher in the estuary the metabolic function was more abundant at the intersection of source water and urban rivers the abundance of the microbial metabolism was lower downstream of the wwtp effluent this work offers a method to investigate the biodegraded of various dom compounds and provides a basis for the exploration of the interaction of dom and the microbial community at different river confluence reaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18378,capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging technology representing a potential alternative to the common energy intensive desalination methods for low salinity water streams in cdi an electrical field is applied to separate ionic species from aqueous solutions and electro adsorb them into a highly porous material cdi is a complex multi scale system which requires robust mathematical models to closely describe its performance here a dynamic two dimensional model is developed coupling the diffusion and advection of the species in the bulk solution with their diffusion and electro sorption in the porous electrodes in this model the adsorption desorption resistance between the micropores and macropores along with variable non electrostatic attractive forces in the micropores are also incorporated the proposed theory is validated against experiments using a circular cdi cell operating under various conditions where different transport mechanisms are limiting the total ion removal process performance of the cdi systems is also evaluated using inclusive figures of merit the obtained results accentuate the significant effect of the rate limited transfer of the ionic species from the macropores into the micropores especially in systems subject to severe ion starvation where neglecting this electro sorption resistance leads to up to 50 and 210 overestimation of the energy efficiency and overall desalination performance respectively furthermore although the commonly used transport theory describing cdi fails to capture the dynamics of the systems at low initial concentration and high adsorption capacity by assuming fast electro sorption without any resistance the presented theory closely models the transport mechanisms in such systems moreover we experimentally and numerically demonstrate a trade off between the energetic and desalination performance in systems with low and high mass pÃ©clet number graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization dynamic ion adsorption theory adsorption resistance energetic efficiency water desalination 1 introduction secure and sustainable water resources are essential for social and economic development ecological health and humans well being however satisfying the unprecedented water demands of the ever growing population of the planet with the significantly limited available resources is one of the major challenges of our era due to its abundance brackish groundwater with total dissolved solids tds of 1 10 mg ml has the potential to play an important role in this scenario in the us alone the total amount of brackish groundwater available is about 800 times more than that of the saline groundwater and 35 times more than the fresh groundwater withdrawn nationwide each year stanton and p b 2017 moreover the theoretical minimum energy required to desalinate brackish water is less than that needed for higher salinity water elimelech and phillip 2011 hence consuming a small fraction of this valuable water resource can alleviate the fresh water shortage crisis in many water scarce regions rendering efficient means of water desalination of paramount importance capacitive deionization cdi is a relatively new technology which has the potential to serve as a highly efficient and low cost alternative for low salinity water desalination in cdi a low dc potential difference 1 1 2 v is used to apply an electric field to remove ionic species from water streams and electrostatically adsorb them into the electrical double layers edls formed at the surface of a highly porous material anderson et al 2010 oren 2008 suss et al 2015 xu et al 2008 extraction of these ions lowers the solution concentration at the exit the electrodes can then be discharged and regenerated by desorbing the electro adsorbed ions over the past decade the cdi technology has greatly expanded by the introduction of various cdi configurations gao et al 2015 hatzell et al 2015 omosebi et al 2017 smith and dmello 2016 tang et al 2019 physical and chemical modification of the electrodes arulrajan et al 2019 bhat et al 2019 gao et al 2016 liu et al 2015 oyarzun et al 2018 wu et al 2015 optimization of the operating conditions cohen et al 2015 demirer et al 2013 ramachandran et al 2019b salamat et al 2016a b shang et al 2017 standardization of performance metrics hand et al 2019 hawks et al 2018a 2019 salamat and hidrovo 2018 and theoretical analysis of cdi systems dykstra et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2017 qu et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018 cdi is a complex system comprised of several highly coupled transport mechanisms taking place at different length and time scales hence developing a comprehensive theoretical framework validated by experimental data is vital to understand the underlying physics and improve the performance of this technology based on the concept of the donnan equilibrium the modified donnan md theory was introduced by biesheuvel et al which is suitable for the two tier pore size assumption micropores and macropores with dimensions of 2 nm and 50 nm respectively in porous carbon electrodes biesheuvel et al 2011a 2011b this theory has been extensively used to develop one and two dimensional models describing the transport mechanisms and salt adsorption in cdi systems biesheuvel et al 2011a dykstra et al 2016b guyes et al 2017 he et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2014 in all the theories based on the md model highly overlapped edls are assumed in the micropores while their extension in the macropores is being neglected compared to the dimensions of these pores this allows for the premise of uniform concentration of species and electric potential in the micropores and electroneutrality in the macropores analytical solutions have also been developed using simple dynamic response models hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 however neglecting the formation of the edls and the associated dynamics these models are not able to fully capture the physics of cdi so far all the models studying the underlying physics of cdi have overlooked a possible resistance for the adsorption desorption of species from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa assuming that this motion happens instantly however as with any other transport mechanism there should be a resistance to this motion although a few studies have referred to this transport resistance to the best of our knowledge no work has incorporated it in the theoretical analysis porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 even though mubita et al included an equation taking into account the rate of transport between the micro and macropores they considered a high kinetic rate constant implying that the ion transport between the macro and micropores is at equilibrium and no rate limitation exists for this transfer mubita et al 2018 here the implemented 2d model in our previous work salamat and hidrovo 2018 is further extended to incorporate the improved modified donnan i md theory biesheuvel et al 2014 moreover rather than assuming fast ion adsorption and desorption from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa the model is modified to capture the transport resistance for this motion using a formulation akin to the butler volmer equation utilized for describing the charge transfer rate in redox reactions the numerical results are then validated with experimental data from desalination cases with different characteristic dimensionless numbers the desalination and energetic performance of these systems are also evaluated using the previously proposed figures of merit salamat and hidrovo 2018 2 theory in this work the nernst planck equation is used to describe the transport of the charged species in the main channel 1 p s c i t c i u p s d i c i p s z i d i v t c i Ï where c i d i and z i are the concentration diffusion coefficient and valence of the species i respectively and p s is the porosity of the spacer u and Ï are associated with the velocity vector and electric potential at each location respectively v t refers to the thermal voltage calculated as k b t e where k b is the boltzmann constant t is the absolute temperature and e is the elementary electric charge assuming equal diffusion coefficients and based on the electroneutrality approximation by adding and subtracting equation 1 for i 1 binary salt with monovalent ions the transport of the species in the main channel can be expressed as 2 p s c t c u p s d c 3 c Ï 0 in these set of equations c and d are used as the concentration of the salt which is equal to that of both positive and negative ions based on the above assumptions i e c c c and the diffusivity of the species in the main channel respectively equation can also be used to explain the motion of the species in the macropores of the porous electrode by introducing an additional term to include the adsorption desorption of the ions from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa 4 p m a c i t c i u e d i e c i z i d i e v t c i Ï j m a m i i in the above equation p ma stands for the porosity of the macropores and the term j ma mi i refers to the rate of concentration change in the macropores due to the rate limited transfer of species i between the macropores and micropores effective diffusivity of the species in the porous electrodes d i e can be obtained as p m a d i Ï where Ï is the tortuosity of the structure we apply the electroneutrality assumption in the macropores and assume no flow in the porous structure therefore by adding and subtracting equation for both positive and negative ions the transport equations can be written as 5 p m a c t p m a Ï d 2 c j m a m i j m a m i 2 6 p m a Ï d v t c Ï j m a m i j m a m i 2 the adsorption and desorption rate of positively and negatively charged species can be related to the rate of change in their concentration in the micropores c m i i as 7 p m

the electrodes biesheuvel et al 2014 dykstra et al 2016b kim et al 2015b in this model the micropores which include the solution and the electrode s surface are also assumed to be electroneutral therefore the ionic charge density in the solution q i o n and the electronic charge density in the electrode s matrix q e l e c balance each other in the micropores the ionic charge and the potential difference in the micropores can then be related according to 8 f q i o n c s Î´ Ï m i in this equation f is the faraday constant 9 6485 104 c mol and q i o n with units of moles per micropore volume can be calculated as c m i c m i c s is the volumetric specific capacitance of the electrode and is expressed in farads per unit volume of the micropores and Î´ Ï m i is the potential difference between the surface of the charged electrode and the micropore as mentioned earlier all the mathematical models developed so far for cdi assume instantaneous adsorption desorption of ions into from the micropores and to the best of our knowledge no studies have fully explored the effects of electro sorption resistance in cdi cells to incorporate this resistance in our model the transport of ions from the macropores into the micropores can be modeled in a similar fashion to the transfer of electrons in redox reactions although the redox reactions per se are not considered in this work assuming a single step first order redox reaction anodic and cathodic reactions both occur simultaneously at each electrode but in the opposite directions in electrochemical kinetics the butler volmer equation is used to describe the charge transfer rate or in other words the resistance to the charge transfer in the electrode reactions newman and thomas alyea 2012 prentice 1991 the general form of this equation can be written as 9 j f k 0 c r e d s exp Î± e e 0 v t c o x s exp 1 Î± e e 0 v t where j is the current density at the electrode k 0 is the rate constant Î± is the transfer coefficient and e and e 0 are the applied and equilibrium potentials respectively c r e d s and c o x s refer to the concentration of the reduced and oxidized species at the surface of the electrode respectively to incorporate the resistance to the transfer of ions between the macro and micropore in cdi an analogy can be drawn between this transport and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions in the context of cdi too two processes affect the adsorption desorption of the counter ions co ions in two opposite directions see fig 1 first is the electro adsorption of the counter ions into the micropores due to the electrostatic forces and second is their diffusion from the micropores with higher counter ion concentration into the macropores with lower concentration co ions are also affected by the same processes although in the reverse direction electro desorption from the micropores and diffusion from the macropores into the micropores nevertheless it should be noted that in the two tier pore size models based on the md theory including the one implemented here only the micropores and macropores are being considered hence the definition of a physical length scale for the diffusion of the ions from the micropores into the macropores and vice versa is not trivial therefore employing the explained analogy and as suggested by the previously discussed studies an explicit expression similar to the butler volmer equation used for describing the rate of the redox reactions taking place in electrochemical cells is employed to include the transport resistance between the micro and macropores

electrostatic potential difference where Î¼ a t t stands for the non electrostatic adsorption energy of ions in kbt this non electrostatic adsorption term has been added to the md based theories to describe the experimentally observed decrease in the concentration of the inlet solution in cdi systems using porous carbon electrodes prior to applying any electric voltage biesheuvel et al 2012 2014 kastening and heins 2005 porada et al 2013 for the large values of the rate constant k the transfer of the ions between the macropores and micropores can be considered at equilibrium i e no resistance exists for the transfer of the species between the macro and micropores this leads the above equation to reduce to the familiar boltzmann distribution c m i i c i e x p z i Î´ Ï d v t Î¼ a t t k b t used in the md based models for describing the cdi process the main deviation of the i md from the standard version of the md model is that in the former Î¼ a t t is not a constant value and is indeed

between an ion and its image charge in the carbon matrix in units of kbt mol m3 this modification stems from the unrealistic estimation of the md model for the salt adsorption of uncharged carbon electrodes in contact with solutions with a broad range of initial concentrations biesheuvel et al 2014 he et al 2018 the net total electric potential available to the cell Ï t is calculates as 12 Ï

external electric current of the system and in the absence of unfavorable faradaic reactions can be calculated based on the electromigration of the ionic species through the interface of the electrode

with respect to the flow axis the electric potentials in each electrode can be balanced as 14 Ï t 2 Î´ Ï m i Î´ Ï d Ï it should be noted that in this model we assume zero net chemical charge at the surface of the electrodes and therefore the potential at the point of zero charge Ï p z c is set to zero further information on the experimental validation of this assumption are provided in the subsequent sections while equations 2 and 3 are used to model the transport in the main channel equations 1 and 5 8 0 14 are employed to describe the ionic motion within the porous electrodes as explained in our previous work three timescales are associated with the transport mechanisms taking place in cdi units salamat and hidrovo 2018 the electro diffusion timescale which is related to the combined diffusion and electro sorption of species in the porous structure is defined as 15 t e l e c d i f f c s l e 2 Ï 2 p m i d c 0 p m a v t 2 f where c 0 is the initial concentration in the system and l e is the thickness of the electrodes the motion of the species in the bulk flow of the flow between cdi fbcdi unit can be characterized through the bulk diffusion and bulk advection timescales t bulk diff and t bulk adv can be calculated as l g 2 d and vol q respectively l g vol and q are the gap distance between the electrodes the volume of the cell and the flow rate of the inlet solution respectively here we have to clarify that as discussed in our previous work these timescales are described based on the classic md theory where electro sorption is assumed to be infinitely fast without any resistance salamat and hidrovo 2018 in that study and also the work presented here the electro diffusion time constant is defined based on the diffusion resistance of the ions within the macropores and the adsorption capacity of the micropores similar to a rc timescale in other words the electro diffusion time constant does not consider the micro to macropore transfer resistance in this study we also adhere to our previous framework where we used classic md theory as a baseline and use the same terminology for the time constants three non dimensional parameters can be defined to compare these time constants 1 mass pÃ©clet number pe m t bulk diff t bulk adv 2 modified damkÓ§hler number da t bulk adv t elec diff and 3 modified second damkÓ§hler number d a i i t bulk diff t elec diff standard damkÓ§hler numbers are normally used to compare chemical reactions rates to the rate of advection or diffusion in a system although we assume no chemical reaction in the cdi unit here we utilize the concept of the damkÓ§hler numbers to compare the charging rate of the electrodes to the transport rate of the ions in the main channel namely the bulk advection and bulk diffusion to validate the discussed model in this work 7 distinct cases with different time constants are experimentally and numerically tested more details on the conducted experiments are provided next 3 material and methods 3 1 cdi validation experiments table 1 shows the characteristic non dimensional parameters associated with the analyzed cases it should be noted that to validate the developed model in this work rather than focusing on one operational parameter at a time for example the applied potential difference or the inlet concentration we use several desalination cases with different transport timescales and non dimensional numbers this approach is adopted to emphasize the importance of the characteristic time constants t bulk adv t bulk diff and t elec diff in cdi units and the ability of the proposed model to describe the performance of systems operating under different transport timescales as discussed in our previous work the transport timescales in the main channel and the electrodes and the associated non dimensional numbers dictate the temporal behavior of the concentration at the outlet of cdi cells as well as their desalination and energetic performance salamat and hidrovo 2018 in this work 6 cdi cases are investigated in which two of the main transport mechanisms have the same order of magnitude time constant while the third mechanism is about one order of magnitude faster or slower furthermore the case where all the three transport phenomena have timescales of the same order is also investigated to be more specific in the first three cases one transport mechanism is limiting the entire charging process i e is the slowest one in the 4th case all the main salt transport mechanisms take place simultaneously in the bulk and electrodes and in the last three cases two mechanisms are simultaneously limiting the salt removal process with the same order of magnitude time constants while the third one is faster than these two mechanisms 3 2 experimental methods and model parameters derivation to achieve the targeted non dimensional numbers the initial concentration flow rate and the gap distance are adjusted in the numerical and experimental tests flow rates range from 0 18 to 14 ml min and the initial concentrations and the gap distances vary from 1 to 8 mm and from 0 8 mm to 3 2 mm respectively experiments are conducted in a circular fbcdi unit shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information section s1 circular activated carbon electrodes with a diameter of 96 mm average thickness of 238 Î¼m and mass of 0 75 gr material and methods llc usa and titanium sheets with a thickness of 0 1 mm mti corp usa serve as the porous material and current collector respectively to avoid electrical contact between the two sides of the unit polyester plastic mesh disks mcmaster carr usa with different thicknesses and openings are used it is worth mentioning that as shown in previous studies performance of cdi cells is subject to degradation under prolonged experiments gao et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the total duration of the experiments in this work differ from case to case ranging from 1 to 7 days as it depends on the characteristic transport timescales of each case to avoid any degradation effect a new and unused pair of electrodes is used for each case and no evident performance decline is observed over the course of the experiments fig s2 illustrates the experimental setup used in this work a potentiostat modulab solartron analytical usa is utilized to apply 1 v for charging and 0 v for discharging the electrodes the conductivity of the effluent is measured via a flow through conductivity sensor et917 edaq australia and is corrected for temperature changes using a j type thermocouple located at the exit of the cell the flow rate is also measured and recorded using a flow meter sls 1500 sensirion switzerland nacl solutions are used as the inlet reservoir the concentration of which are adjusted by using a 5 m solution sigma aldrich usa and di water to remove the dissolved oxygen the inlet solution is degassed in a vacuum chamber for 12 h before each experiment the ph of the inlet reservoir is then measured using a ph probe ph bta vernier usa having the value of 6 98 0 02 additionally prior to each experiment the electrodes are presoaked in di water to ensure that the pores are fully wetted several successive charge discharge cycles are conducted for each case to make sure that the system has reached the dynamic equilibrium state where the amount of salt adsorbed during desalination is equal to the amount of salt desorbed during regeneration there are several parameters associated with each experiment which need to be input in the model to correlate the experimental data with the numerical results cyclic voltammetry cv is used to estimate the electrode s micropore capacitances and the external resistance of the setup for each case is extracted utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the assumptions of zero point of charge Ï pzc and zero net chemical surface charge are also validated here for this purpose we use 200 ml of degassed 4 mm nacl solution and soak one carbon electrode in it overnight the ph of the solution before and after the submergence of the electrode is measured the presence of different chemical surface groups changes the concentration of h and oh and consequently the ph of the solution due to different surface interactions at the surface of the carbon electrode gao et al 2017 2019 hemmatifar et al 2017 recorded values of ph demonstrate negligible alteration in the ph value from 6 5 before the insertion to the almost neutral value of 7 3 after the insertion this verifies our assumption of zero Ï pzc and zero net chemical charge at the surface of the electrodes we refer the reader to the supplementary information document section s3 for further details on the parameter settings of the model these settings result in only two main parameters to be fitted in our model the ion correlation energy e and the rate constant k which are extracted from the experimental results of the equilibrium state and temporal concentration profile of the effluent in different desalination cases 3 3 performance evaluation of cdi tests in addition to the effluent concentration profile of the cdi tests the salt adsorption and the electronic charge transferred to the electrodes are calculated by the following equations and used to evaluate the effectivity of the proposed model 16 Î´ m w 0 t c o u t c 0 q d t m e 17 q 0 t i n e t d t m e Î´ is the salt adsorption and q is the electronic charge transferred to the electrodes both per mass of the electrodes m w is the molar mass of the salt and m e is the total mass of the used electrodes i n e t t is the net current and is calculated as i t i l e a k where i t is the measured electrical current i leak refers to the non zero residual electrical current in the system long after the equilibrium is reached which is usually attributed to the unfavorable parasitic reactions taking place at the surface of the electrodes hatzell et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2016 shang et al 2017 the charge efficiency Î» of each case defined as the ratio of the moles of salt removed to the moles of charge transferred to the electrodes is also calculated from the experimental and numerical data using the following equation 18 Î» f Î´ m w q to further compare the output of the cdi cells predicted by the model with the experimental data desalination and energetic performances of the analyzed cases are investigated the desalination performance is evaluated using the ultimate desalination throughput udt defined as salamat and hidrovo 2018 19 u d t c 0 c a v e c 0 c 0 c a v e q t d e s a l q c ave is the average concentration of the effluent and is calculated as c a v e 1 t 0 t c t d t and t desal refers to the total desalination time here we use the average concentration as the performance evaluation point as it represents the final concentration of the collected treated water at the end of the desalination stage the first term in the right hand side of equation 19 computes the desalination percentage in the system and the second and the third terms determine the average rate of salt removal from the bulk solution and the total volume of the desalinated water respectively the significance of this figure of merit is that it combines three characteristics of a desirable desalination system i e low average concentration of the effluent and fast ion adsorption from large volumes of the inlet stream in addition it represents the processing rate which is equal to the rate at which the inlet water is being processed times the amount of salt adsorbed to make a thorough assessment of the overall performance of a cdi unit the performance of the regeneration process should also be considered for that purpose the overall desalination and regeneration performance odrp is defined and calculated as 20 o d r p u d t w r t t o t a l wr is the water recovery ratio and is defined as the ratio of the desalinated volume to the total volume of the initial solution and t total is the total duration of the process desalination and regeneration this metric states that a favorable cdi desalination unit should at the same time incorporate high values of udt i e better adsorption performance and high water recovery ratio over a shorter total processing time span moreover the energetic performances of the numerically and experimentally investigated cases are compared against each other the thermodynamic efficiency of both sets of data is calculated as 21 Î· w r e v e i n w rev is the theoretical minimum energy required to desalinate a given solution to the desired concentration and divide the solution into two desalinated and concentrated parts this value is independent of the desalination method and can be calculated through the gibbs free energy as bejan 2016 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 22 w r e v 2 v d c 0 w r ln c 0 w r c d c 0 1 w r c d ln c 0 w r c d c d 1 w r r t r is the universal gas constant and v d and c d are the volume and final concentration of the desalinated solution respectively e in in equation 21 is the actual electrical energy input during the desalination step assuming zero energy recovery and is obtained as 23 e i n t 0 t i n e t t Ï i n d t Ï i n refers to the external potential difference applied through the power supply to further accentuate the importance of including the micro macropore transfer resistance in the mathematical model we also compare the results obtained here with the numerical data from the 2d model with fast adsorption desorption processes classic i md with no electro sorption resistance 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameters extraction cv and eis data obtained in this work are depicted in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the experimental operational conditions and the model parameter settings for each of the mentioned cases are listed in the supplementary information document section s4 we adopt the recommended approach of hawks et al for reporting these parameters and include the separation report of each case in this work hawks et al 2018b salt adsorption Î´ charge q and charge efficiency Î» at equilibrium do not depend on the transfer rate between the macropores and micropores therefore these parameters can be evaluated to find the value for the micropore ion correlation energy e which results in the best fit and minimum error between the experimental and numerical results the value used for parameter e in the model is compatible with the previous works in the literature biesheuvel et al 2014 dykstra et al 2016a 2016b guyes et al 2017 kim et al 2015a fig 2 depicts the salt adsorption charge transferred and charge efficiency of both experimental and numerical data as it can be seen in this figure although there is a good agreement between the values obtained from the experiments and the model for the adsorbed salt Î´ there is a discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results for the charge transferred q and charge efficiency Î» in cases at a relatively low initial concentration 1 mm we believe this indicates that there is another resistive mechanism in these systems which has not been included in the model developed here these cases experience comparably low electrical currents less than 13 ma which as discussed by hemmatifar et al favor unwanted parasitic energy losses due to faradaic reactions hemmatifar et al 2016 as mentioned in the theory section faradaic losses are not considered in this work and we hypothesize that the difference between the numerical and experimental values of q and Î» in the mentioned cases is caused by neglecting the parasitic losses in the model we verify this hypothesis by repeating the experiments for case 1 which shows a somewhat considerable disagreement between the numerical and experimental results at lower applied voltages further discussion on this is provided in the next section next the temporal effluent concentration profiles of the investigated cases are used to evaluate the macropore to micropore transfer rate constant k fig 3 shows the concentration profile at the exit of each cdi unit over time normalized by the initial concentration electro sorption resistance between the micro and macropores is a relatively new concept and has not been fully investigated here based on the obtained numerical and experimental results we believe it is indeed an important component of the theory describing the transport mechanisms in cdi and one that cannot be neglected furthermore we hypothesize that k is a function of the characteristics of the system the obtained results here show an inverse relation between k and the modified damkÓ§hler number da which is defined as the ratio of the bulk advection and the electro diffusion time constants fig 4 depicts k versus da for the analyzed cases in systems with high t bulk adv and relatively low t elec diff high da slow advection cannot keep pace with the relatively quick electro diffusion and is not able to provide ionic species for adsorption at a sufficiently fast rate this can result in significant local depletion of ions in the macropores leading to what is known as ion starvation as studied before in this condition some regions of the electrode locally experience an insufficient number of ions available for electro adsorption a phenomenon which limits the motion of the species from the macropores into the micropores and hinders the entire electro sorption process in the electrodes hawks et al 2018b hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 qu et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 this eventually translates into a higher transport resistance from the macropores into the micropores or in other words lower values of the transfer rate constant k in the systems this phenomenon can also be considered similar to the limiting current in an electrochemical cell where the charge transfer process is restricted by the zero concentration at the surface of the electrode and is mass transfer controlled prentice 1991 as mentioned earlier in our previous work we conducted a parametric study on the transport mechanisms considered in the md based models i e bulk advection bulk diffusion and the microscale electro diffusion without electro sorption resistance and there we showed that in each system the time at which the effluent concentration reaches its minimum value is in the order of the bulk advection timescale salamat and hidrovo 2018 nevertheless as it was concluded from those results the interrelation between the transport phenomena of the system determines the total duration of the desalination and regeneration steps and not a single mechanism the results here also suggest an inverse relationship between the desalination time t desal which is the time required for completion of the salt removal i e when the effluent concentration gets back to its initial value and the transfer rate constant k see fig 5 as this figure shows in cases with very low rate constant high electro sorption resistance the electro sorption of the ions into and out of the micropores could be the limiting transport mechanism in these systems the ion starvation is so severe that it could dominate the whole desalination step hindering the completion of the salt adsorption process since a somewhat similar trend inverse relation is observed between the transfer rate k constant and the da number in the cases investigated here see fig 4 we hypothesize that coupled with the other transport mechanisms the rate limited electro sorption also determines the overall rate of the salt removal process of each system to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in describing the physics of cdi systems we compare the obtained data with the numerical estimation of the classic i md theory where no electro sorption is included in the model see fig 3 it is worth mentioning that most of the md based models developed so far for describing cdi have also demonstrated a good agreement with experimental data yet these models have not been validated against cases subject to ion starvation biesheuvel et al 2011a guyes et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 the cases studied by these theories mostly have relatively high initial concentrations 10 mm and fast flow rates in the main channel analyzing and optimizing the water treatment performance of cdi systems at low initial concentrations are equally vital especially for water softening and heavy metal removal applications choi et al 2019 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 this comparison is conducted for all the cases investigated here as it is shown in fig 3 in all the cases with low initial concentration 2 mm and relatively slow bulk advection the 2d model without the transport resistance i e the classic i md theory cannot fully capture the dynamics of the process as it encounters convergence complexities a closer study of these cases reveals that neglecting the rate limited adsorption desorption results in local ion depletion zones in the macropores where the concentration reaches values extremely close to zero fig 6 illustrates the normalized concentration in the main channel and electrodes macropores at t 1010 s of case 2 which is about three times of the electro diffusion timescale 3t elec diff simulated using the i md theory without considering the electro sorption resistance in this case the initial concentration is 1 mm and pe m 0 1 da 8 6 and da ii 0 8 as it can be seen from this figure most of the macropores in the electrodes are experiencing severe salt starvation and near zero concentration at this instant after which the model fails to describe the transport mechanisms in the cell in fact all the systems with low initial concentration studied here face the same convergence problem where the i md model cannot accurately describe the transport mechanisms taking place in the unit see fig s5 for more illustration of the cases with low initial salinity and slow flow rate facing these complications when being simulated with the classic i md model it should also be noted that although the classic i md theory can model cdi systems with higher initial concentrations it cannot closely predict the performance of the systems with high da number for example in case 5 investigated here da 11 a substantial discrepancy between the numerical and experimental data is observed when no resistance is assumed for the transport of the ions between the micro and macropores as it can be seen from fig 3 while the classic i md model no electro sorption resistance poorly describes the concentration profile at the exit of this system the model developed here offers a much more accurate prediction of the experimental data by considering the transport resistance between the micro and macropores as mentioned above in this system the electro sorption is the key mechanism limiting the whole desalination performance and omitting this transport resistance from the mathematical model results in inaccurate performance evaluation 4 2 performance evaluation to further analyze the desalination and energetic performance of the investigated cases udt odrp and Î· are calculated for each system and shown in fig 7 the obtained results show a good agreement between the numerical and experimental performances as discussed previously in the model implemented here no parasitic reaction losses are being considered and we believe that the current leakage is the main reason for the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results from the model developed here to verify this case 1 pe m 1 7 da 0 2 da ii 0 3 which shows a non negligible disagreement between the experimental and numerical results for q Î» and Î· is repeated at lower external voltages as shown previously increasing the applied voltage intensifies the occurrence of the faradaic reactions he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 consistent with the previous findings more discrepancy between the experimental and numerical data is also observed here by increasing the external voltage see section s6 of the supplementary information document for the obtained results this in fact demonstrates the robustness of the proposed model in predicting the performance of cdi based systems especially in the absence of faradaic reactions although the focus of this study has been on investigating the significance of the electro sorption resistance these results underline the importance of integrating faradaic reactions with the theoretical model in the future studies we refer the reader to the supplementary information document section s6 for further details on this as it can be inferred from fig 7 the most noticeable disagreement between the thermodynamic efficiency values obtained from the experimental data and the proposed model can be seen in the cases where the classic i md is not able to completely describe the dynamics of the transport in cdi low initial concentration cases although addition of the electro sorption resistance in the numerical model does not lead to sufficiently accurate estimation of the energetic efficiency of these cases yet this analysis proves the importance of including all the resistances in a cdi system when assessing its performance compared to other cdi units and even other desalination technologies specifically as these cases offer higher energetic efficiencies it is necessary to obtain a complete and accurate description of the transport mechanisms for efficiency prediction and optimization purposes as the recent discussion between ramachandran et al and qin et al revealed considering correct electrical ionic and transport resistances in cdi is the key element for reaching objective evaluation of the energetic efficiency of this technology compared to other water treatment methods such as ro qin et al 2019 qu et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2019a we believe that by including other resistance mechanisms in the model such as faradaic reactions numerical simulations will achieve a more precise prediction of the cdi systems performance under various operational conditions another important point which should not be overlooked is that increasing the adsorption capacity of the porous electrodes for example by increasing the surface area also further facilitates the occurrence of ion starvation in cdi cells as the community of cdi aims at improving the efficiency of this system in removing ions by utilizing high capacity electrodes reaching a robust and high fidelity mathematical framework which can fully capture this phenomenon is therefore highly crucial furthermore as it was discussed in the previous section although the classic i md theory can model cdi systems with higher initial concentrations it cannot correctly predict the performance of the systems with high da number in case 5 for instance with slow bulk advection and fast electro diffusion da 11 ignoring the rate limited transfer of the ions between the micro and macropores leads to a near 50 and 210 error increase in estimating Î· and odrp respectively in this system the rate limited transfer of ions between the micro and macropores is the main mechanism limiting the whole ion removal process as it can be seen from fig 3 neglecting this transport resistance leads to an inaccurate estimation of the desalination and regeneration duration t desal and t regen and consequently to high discrepancy between the experimental and numerical values of the water recovery ratio wr and the total processing time t total these discrepancies eventually translate into an imprecise evaluation of the energetic efficiency Î· and the overall desalination and regeneration performance odrp in this system a detailed error analysis of the classic i md theory and the proposed model in predicating the energetic and desalination performance of the studied cdi systems is provided in table s8 in the supplementary information nevertheless as the results presented in figs 3 and 7 demonstrate ignoring the electro sorption resistance in the numerical model the classic i md theory still offers an acceptable performance prediction in cases with low da number the higher transfer rate constant k of these cases which means faster electro sorption or in other words micro macropore transfer with less resistance indicates that the electro sorption is not the main mechanism limiting the whole ion removal process in these systems and their performance is in fact constrained by the other transport mechanisms 4 3 developing versus fully developed systems as it was numerically discussed in the previous work whether the cdi unit has a fully developed or developing convective diffusive regime highly affects the desalination and energetic performance of the system salamat and hidrovo 2018 in the former regime diffusion of the species towards the porous electrodes is faster than their advection in the bulk pe m 1 creating fully developed convective diffusive layers in the latter regime however the bulk advection transport of the ions is faster than their bulk diffusion towards the electrode pe m 1 and the diffusion of the species is mainly limited to the thin convective diffusive layer developing near the interface of the electrodes and the main stream the overall performance and thermodynamic efficiency of the conducted experiments versus their pe m are shown in fig 8 previous studies discussed the adverse effect of fast advection and slow diffusion in the main channel high pe m on the effluent concentration reduction percentage equal to c o c o u t c o 100 mutha et al 2018 perez et al 2013 however numerical analysis has proved that despite the apparent disadvantage of developing regimes with high pe m in decreasing the effluent concentration their overall desalination performance is better than systems with low pe m as higher volumes of water are desalinated in a shorter time salamat and hidrovo 2018 this suggests that over the same period water can be processed at a developing regime through a multi cycle desalination configuration where at each cycle the effluent of the previous cycle is further desalinated to reach a final desired lower concentration rather than through one desalination cycle at a fully developed regime the experimental results obtained here also demonstrate that cdi units performing in the developing regime offer a better desalination performance as they can desalinate more volumes of the inlet solution in a shorter amount of time even though they hit a lower desalination percentage per cycle in comparison with the fully developed systems in other words increasing the pe m leads to better overall desalination performance however as both numerical and experimental data present fully developed systems are an energetically better alternative for desalinating a given solution in fact due to their higher levels of desalination fully developed systems are thermodynamically more efficient this has also been investigated by wang et al where increasing the salinity reduction was recommended for improving the thermodynamic efficiency wang et al 2019 5 conclusion here the i md approach coupled with nernst planck transport theory was used to model the motion of the ionic species in a cdi unit in two dimensions the model was further improved by incorporating the transport resistance between the micro and macropores to validate the model desalination cases with different transport timescales were numerically and experimentally investigated a good agreement between both sets of data was demonstrated and we hypothesized that the transfer rate constant describing the rate limited transport of the species from the macropores into the micropores depends on the ratio of the bulk advection and microscale electro diffusion time constants the desalination and energetic performance of the analyzed systems were also evaluated using inclusive metrics defined in our previous work the results presented here showed that the model where the rate limited transfer of the ions between the micro and macropores is neglected the classic i md fails to fully describe the transport of the species within the cdi cell in systems at low initial concentrations and high adsorption capacity while the presented theory closely modeled the dynamics of such cases moreover compared to the classic i md theory the model developed here led to improvement of the desalination performance and energy efficiency estimation by up to 50 and 210 respectively in systems at high da number fast electro diffusion and slow bulk advection which are subject to severe ion starvation hence the inclusion of this resistance in cdi theories is of paramount importance for objective and accurate efficiency evaluation of this water desalination method especially when comparing its performance with other water treatment technologies furthermore confirming the numerical results the experimental data indicated that while systems with developing convective diffusive layers mass pÃ©clet number 1 have better desalination performance in terms of the desalination percentage rate of salt removal total desalinated volume and water recovery ratio they offer an inferior energy efficiency relative to the systems with fully developed convective diffusive layers mass pÃ©clet number 1 the proposed theoretical framework can be extended beyond cdi systems and can provide critical guidelines for designing effective and efficient water desalination and ion removal systems to meet various application specifications declaration of competing

18378,capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging technology representing a potential alternative to the common energy intensive desalination methods for low salinity water streams in cdi an electrical field is applied to separate ionic species from aqueous solutions and electro adsorb them into a highly porous material cdi is a complex multi scale system which requires robust mathematical models to closely describe its performance here a dynamic two dimensional model is developed coupling the diffusion and advection of the species in the bulk solution with their diffusion and electro sorption in the porous electrodes in this model the adsorption desorption resistance between the micropores and macropores along with variable non electrostatic attractive forces in the micropores are also incorporated the proposed theory is validated against experiments using a circular cdi cell operating under various conditions where different transport mechanisms are limiting the total ion removal process performance of the cdi systems is also evaluated using inclusive figures of merit the obtained results accentuate the significant effect of the rate limited transfer of the ionic species from the macropores into the micropores especially in systems subject to severe ion starvation where neglecting this electro sorption resistance leads to up to 50 and 210 overestimation of the energy efficiency and overall desalination performance respectively furthermore although the commonly used transport theory describing cdi fails to capture the dynamics of the systems at low initial concentration and high adsorption capacity by assuming fast electro sorption without any resistance the presented theory closely models the transport mechanisms in such systems moreover we experimentally and numerically demonstrate a trade off between the energetic and desalination performance in systems with low and high mass pÃ©clet number graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization dynamic ion adsorption theory adsorption resistance energetic efficiency water desalination 1 introduction secure and sustainable water resources are essential for social and economic development ecological health and humans well being however satisfying the unprecedented water demands of the ever growing population of the planet with the significantly limited available resources is one of the major challenges of our era due to its abundance brackish groundwater with total dissolved solids tds of 1 10 mg ml has the potential to play an important role in this scenario in the us alone the total amount of brackish groundwater available is about 800 times more than that of the saline groundwater and 35 times more than the fresh groundwater withdrawn nationwide each year stanton and p b 2017 moreover the theoretical minimum energy required to desalinate brackish water is less than that needed for higher salinity water elimelech and phillip 2011 hence consuming a small fraction of this valuable water resource can alleviate the fresh water shortage crisis in many water scarce regions rendering efficient means of water desalination of paramount importance capacitive deionization cdi is a relatively new technology which has the potential to serve as a highly efficient and low cost alternative for low salinity water desalination in cdi a low dc potential difference 1 1 2 v is used to apply an electric field to remove ionic species from water streams and electrostatically adsorb them into the electrical double layers edls formed at the surface of a highly porous material anderson et al 2010 oren 2008 suss et al 2015 xu et al 2008 extraction of these ions lowers the solution concentration at the exit the electrodes can then be discharged and regenerated by desorbing the electro adsorbed ions over the past decade the cdi technology has greatly expanded by the introduction of various cdi configurations gao et al 2015 hatzell et al 2015 omosebi et al 2017 smith and dmello 2016 tang et al 2019 physical and chemical modification of the electrodes arulrajan et al 2019 bhat et al 2019 gao et al 2016 liu et al 2015 oyarzun et al 2018 wu

al 2019 hawks et al 2018a 2019 salamat and hidrovo 2018 and theoretical analysis of cdi systems dykstra et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2017 qu et al 2018 ramachandran et al 2018 cdi is a complex system comprised of several highly coupled transport mechanisms taking place at different length and time scales hence developing a comprehensive theoretical framework validated by experimental data is vital to understand the underlying physics and improve the performance of this technology based on the concept of the donnan equilibrium the modified donnan md theory was introduced by biesheuvel et al which is suitable for the two tier pore size assumption micropores and macropores with dimensions of 2 nm and 50 nm respectively in porous carbon electrodes biesheuvel et al 2011a 2011b this theory has been extensively used to develop one and two dimensional models describing the transport mechanisms and salt adsorption in cdi systems biesheuvel et al 2011a dykstra et al 2016b guyes et al 2017 he et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2014 in all the theories based on the md model highly overlapped edls are assumed in the micropores while their extension in the macropores is being neglected compared to the dimensions of these pores this allows for the premise of uniform concentration of species and electric potential in the micropores and electroneutrality in the macropores analytical solutions have also been developed using simple dynamic response models hawks et al 2018a jande and kim 2013 however neglecting the formation of the edls and the associated dynamics these models are not able to fully capture the physics of cdi so far all the models studying the underlying physics of cdi have overlooked a possible resistance for the adsorption desorption of species from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa assuming that this motion happens instantly however as with any other transport mechanism there should be a resistance to this motion although a few studies have referred to this transport resistance to the best of our knowledge no work has incorporated it in the theoretical analysis porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 even though mubita et al included an equation taking into account the rate of transport between the micro and macropores they considered a high kinetic rate constant implying that the ion transport between the macro and micropores is at equilibrium and no rate limitation exists for this transfer mubita et al 2018 here the implemented 2d model in our previous work salamat and hidrovo 2018 is further extended to incorporate the improved modified donnan i md theory biesheuvel et al 2014 moreover rather than assuming fast ion adsorption and desorption from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa the model is modified to capture the transport resistance for this motion using a formulation akin to the butler volmer equation utilized for describing the charge transfer rate in redox reactions the numerical results are then validated with experimental data from desalination cases with different characteristic dimensionless numbers the desalination and energetic performance of these systems are also evaluated using the previously proposed figures of merit salamat and hidrovo 2018 2 theory in this work the nernst planck equation is used to describe the transport of the charged species in the main channel 1 p s c i t c i u p s d i c i p s z i d i v t c i Ï where c i d i and z i are the concentration diffusion coefficient and valence of the species i respectively and p s is the porosity of the spacer u and Ï are associated with the velocity vector and electric potential at each location respectively v t refers to the thermal voltage calculated as k b t e where k b is the boltzmann constant t is the absolute temperature and e is the elementary electric charge assuming equal diffusion coefficients and based on the electroneutrality approximation by adding and subtracting equation 1 for i 1 binary salt with monovalent ions the transport of the species in the main channel can be expressed as 2 p s c t c u p s d c 3 c Ï 0 in these set of equations c and d are used as the concentration of the salt which is equal to that of both positive and negative ions based on the above assumptions i e c c c and the diffusivity of the species in the main channel respectively equation can also be used to explain the motion of the species in the macropores of the porous electrode by introducing an additional term to include the adsorption desorption of the ions from the macropores into the micropores and vice versa 4 p m a c i t c i u e d i e c i z i d i e v t c i Ï j m a m i i in the above equation p ma stands for the porosity of the macropores and the term j ma mi i refers to the rate of concentration change in the macropores due to the rate limited transfer of species i between the macropores and micropores effective diffusivity of the species in the porous electrodes d i e can be obtained as p m a d i Ï where Ï is the tortuosity of the structure we apply the electroneutrality assumption in the macropores and assume no flow in the porous structure therefore by adding and subtracting equation for both positive and negative ions the transport equations can be written as 5 p m a c t p m a Ï d 2 c j m a m i j m a m i 2 6 p m a Ï d v t c Ï j m a m i j m a m i 2 the adsorption and desorption rate of positively and negatively charged species can be related to the rate of change in their concentration in the micropores c m i i as 7 p m i c m i i t j m a m i i where p mi is the porosity of the micropores here the i md model is used to describe the adsorption and desorption of the ionic species in the edls formed in the micropores of the electrodes biesheuvel et al 2014 dykstra et al 2016b kim et al 2015b in this model the micropores which include the solution and the electrode s surface are also assumed to be electroneutral therefore the ionic charge density in the solution q i o n and the electronic charge density in the electrode s matrix q e l e c balance each other in the micropores the ionic charge and the potential difference in the micropores can then be related according to 8 f q i o n c s Î´ Ï m i in this equation f is the faraday constant 9 6485 104 c mol and q i o n with units of moles per micropore volume can be calculated as c m i c m i c s is the volumetric specific capacitance of the electrode and is expressed in farads per unit volume of the micropores and Î´ Ï m i is the potential difference between the surface of the charged electrode and the micropore as mentioned earlier all the mathematical models developed so far for cdi assume instantaneous adsorption desorption of ions into from the micropores and to the best of our knowledge no studies have fully explored the effects of electro sorption resistance in cdi cells to incorporate this resistance in our model the transport of ions from the macropores into the micropores can be modeled in a similar fashion to the transfer of electrons in redox reactions although the redox reactions per se are not considered in this work assuming a single step first order redox reaction anodic and cathodic reactions both occur simultaneously at each electrode but in the opposite directions in electrochemical kinetics the butler volmer equation is used to describe the charge transfer rate or in other words the resistance to the charge transfer in the electrode reactions newman and thomas alyea 2012 prentice 1991 the general form of this equation can be written as 9 j f k 0 c r e d s exp Î± e e 0 v t c o x s exp 1 Î± e e 0 v t where j is the current density at the electrode k 0 is the rate constant Î± is the transfer coefficient and e and e 0 are the applied and equilibrium potentials respectively c r e d s and c o x s refer to the concentration of the reduced and oxidized species at the surface of the electrode respectively to incorporate the resistance to the transfer of ions between the macro and micropore in cdi an analogy can be drawn between this transport and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions in the context of cdi too two processes affect the adsorption desorption of the counter ions co ions in two opposite directions see fig 1 first is the electro adsorption of the counter ions into the micropores due to the electrostatic forces and second is their diffusion from the micropores with higher counter ion concentration into the macropores with lower concentration co ions are also affected by the same processes although in the reverse direction electro desorption from the micropores and diffusion from the macropores into the micropores nevertheless it should be noted that in the two tier pore size models based on the md theory including the one implemented here only the micropores and macropores are being considered hence the definition of a physical length scale for the diffusion of the ions from the micropores into the macropores and vice versa is not trivial therefore employing the explained analogy and as suggested by the previously discussed studies an explicit expression similar to the butler volmer equation used for describing the rate of the redox reactions taking place in electrochemical cells is employed to include the transport resistance between the micro and macropores

electrostatic potential difference where Î¼ a t t stands for the non electrostatic adsorption energy of ions in kbt this non electrostatic adsorption term has been added to the md based theories to describe the experimentally observed decrease in the concentration of the inlet solution in cdi systems using porous carbon electrodes prior to applying any electric voltage biesheuvel et al 2012 2014 kastening and heins 2005 porada et al 2013 for the large values of the rate constant k the transfer of the ions between the macropores and micropores can be considered at equilibrium i e no resistance exists for the transfer of the species between the macro and micropores this leads the above equation to reduce to the familiar boltzmann distribution c m i i c i e x p z i Î´ Ï d v t Î¼ a t t k b t used in the md based models for describing the cdi process the main deviation of the i md from the standard version of the md model is that in the former Î¼ a t t is not a constant value and is indeed a function of the ionic concentration in the micropores in other words 11 Î¼ a t t e c m i c m i where e is the micropore ion correlation energy and is associated with the attractive coulomb energy between an ion and its image charge in the carbon matrix in units of kbt mol m3 this modification stems from the unrealistic estimation of the md model for the salt adsorption of uncharged carbon electrodes in contact with solutions with a broad range of initial concentrations biesheuvel et al 2014 he et al 2018 the net total electric potential available to the cell Ï t is calculates as 12 Ï t Ï i n i r e x t Ï i n is the external potential difference applied through the power supply and r ext refers to all the external setup the wires the current collectors and the main channel ionic

external electric current of the system and in the absence of unfavorable faradaic reactions can be calculated based on the electromigration of the ionic species through the interface of the electrode and the bulk flow see equation 6 13 i p m a d Ï f v t 2 c Ï n d a in the above equation n is the direction normal to the interface of the electrode and the main channel eventually assuming symmetry with respect to the flow axis the electric potentials in each electrode can be balanced as 14 Ï t 2 Î´ Ï m i Î´ Ï d Ï it should be noted that in this model we assume zero net chemical charge at the surface of the electrodes and therefore the potential at the point of zero charge Ï p z c is set to zero further information on the experimental validation of this assumption are provided in the subsequent sections while equations 2 and 3 are used to model the transport in the main channel equations 1 and 5 8 0 14 are employed to describe the ionic motion within the porous electrodes as explained in our previous work three timescales are associated with the transport mechanisms taking place in cdi units salamat and hidrovo 2018 the electro diffusion timescale which is related to the combined diffusion and electro sorption of species in the porous structure is defined as 15 t e l e c d i f f c s l e 2 Ï 2 p m i d c 0 p m a v t 2 f where c 0 is the initial concentration in the system and l e is the thickness of the electrodes the motion of the species in the bulk flow of the flow between cdi fbcdi unit can be characterized through the bulk diffusion and bulk advection timescales t bulk diff and t bulk adv can be calculated as l g 2 d and vol q respectively l g vol and q are the gap distance between the electrodes the volume of the cell and the flow rate of the inlet solution respectively here we have to clarify that as discussed in our previous work these timescales are described based on the classic md theory where electro sorption is assumed to be infinitely fast without any resistance salamat and hidrovo 2018 in that study and also the work presented here the electro diffusion time constant is defined based on the diffusion resistance of the ions within the macropores and the adsorption capacity of the micropores similar to a rc timescale in other words the electro diffusion time constant does not consider the micro to macropore transfer resistance in this study we also adhere to our previous framework where we used classic md theory as a baseline and use the same terminology for the time constants three non dimensional parameters can be defined to compare these time constants 1 mass pÃ©clet number pe m t bulk diff t bulk adv 2 modified damkÓ§hler number da t bulk adv t elec diff and 3 modified second damkÓ§hler number d a i i t bulk diff t elec diff standard damkÓ§hler numbers are normally used to compare chemical reactions rates to the rate of advection or diffusion in a system although we assume no chemical reaction in the cdi unit here we utilize the concept of the damkÓ§hler numbers to compare the charging rate of the electrodes to the transport rate of the ions in the main channel namely the bulk advection and bulk diffusion to validate the discussed model in this work 7 distinct cases with different time constants are experimentally and numerically tested more details on the conducted experiments are provided next 3 material and methods 3 1 cdi validation experiments table 1 shows the characteristic non dimensional parameters associated with the analyzed cases it should be noted that to validate the developed model in this work rather than focusing on one operational parameter at a time for example the applied potential difference or the inlet concentration we use several desalination cases with different transport timescales and non dimensional numbers this approach is adopted to emphasize the importance of the characteristic time constants t bulk adv t bulk diff and t elec diff in cdi units and the ability of the proposed model to describe the performance of systems operating under different transport timescales as discussed in our previous work the transport timescales in the main channel and the electrodes and the associated non dimensional numbers dictate the temporal behavior of the concentration at the outlet of cdi cells as well as their desalination and energetic performance salamat and hidrovo 2018 in this work 6 cdi cases are investigated in which two of the main transport mechanisms have the same order of magnitude time constant while the third mechanism is about one order of magnitude faster or slower furthermore the case where all the three transport phenomena have timescales of the same order is also investigated to be more specific in the first three cases one transport mechanism is limiting the entire charging process i e is the slowest one in the 4th case all the main salt transport mechanisms take place simultaneously in the bulk and electrodes and in the last three cases two mechanisms are simultaneously limiting the salt removal process with the same order of magnitude time constants while the third one is faster than these two mechanisms 3 2 experimental methods and model parameters derivation to achieve the targeted non dimensional numbers the initial concentration flow rate and the gap distance are adjusted in the numerical and experimental tests flow rates range from 0 18 to 14 ml min and the initial concentrations and the gap distances vary from 1 to 8 mm and from 0 8 mm to 3 2 mm respectively experiments are conducted in a circular fbcdi unit shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information section s1 circular activated carbon electrodes with a diameter of 96 mm average thickness of 238 Î¼m and mass of 0 75 gr material and methods llc usa and titanium sheets with a thickness of 0 1 mm mti corp usa serve as the porous material and current collector respectively to avoid electrical contact between the two sides of the unit polyester plastic mesh disks mcmaster carr usa with different thicknesses and openings are used it is worth mentioning that as shown in previous studies performance of cdi cells is subject to degradation under prolonged experiments gao et al 2015 omosebi et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the total duration of the experiments in this work differ from case to case ranging from 1 to 7 days as it depends on the characteristic transport timescales of each case to avoid any degradation effect a new and unused pair of electrodes is used for each case and no evident performance decline is observed over the course of the experiments fig s2 illustrates the experimental setup used in this work a potentiostat modulab solartron analytical usa is utilized to apply 1 v for charging and 0 v for discharging the electrodes the conductivity of the effluent is measured via a flow through conductivity sensor et917 edaq australia and is corrected for temperature changes using a j type thermocouple located at the exit of the cell the flow rate is also measured and recorded using a flow meter sls 1500 sensirion switzerland nacl solutions are used as the inlet reservoir the concentration of which are adjusted by using a 5 m solution sigma aldrich usa and di water to remove the dissolved oxygen the inlet solution is degassed in a vacuum chamber for 12 h before each experiment the ph of the inlet reservoir is then measured using a ph probe ph bta vernier usa having the value of 6 98 0 02 additionally prior to each experiment the electrodes are presoaked in di water to ensure that the pores are fully wetted several successive charge discharge cycles are conducted for each case to make sure that the system has reached the dynamic equilibrium state where the amount of salt adsorbed during desalination is equal to the amount of salt desorbed during regeneration there are several parameters associated with each experiment which need to be input in the model to correlate the experimental data with the numerical results cyclic voltammetry cv is used to estimate the electrode s micropore capacitances and the external resistance of the setup for each case is extracted utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis the assumptions of zero point of charge Ï pzc and zero net chemical surface charge are also validated here for this purpose we use 200 ml of degassed 4 mm nacl solution and soak one carbon electrode in it overnight the ph of the solution before and after the submergence of the electrode is measured the presence of different chemical surface groups changes the concentration of h and oh and consequently the ph of the solution due to different surface interactions at the surface of the carbon electrode gao et al 2017 2019 hemmatifar et al 2017 recorded values of ph demonstrate negligible alteration in the ph value from 6 5 before the insertion to the almost neutral value of 7 3 after the insertion this verifies our assumption of zero Ï pzc and zero net chemical charge at the surface of the electrodes we refer the reader to the supplementary information document section s3 for further details on the parameter settings of the model these settings result in only two main parameters to be fitted in our model the ion correlation energy e and the rate constant k which are extracted from the experimental results of the equilibrium state and temporal concentration profile of the effluent in different desalination cases 3 3 performance evaluation of cdi tests in addition to the effluent concentration profile of the cdi tests the salt adsorption and the electronic charge transferred to the electrodes are calculated by the following equations and used to evaluate the effectivity of the proposed model 16 Î´ m w 0 t c o u t c 0 q d t m e 17 q 0 t i n e t d t m e Î´ is the salt adsorption and q is the electronic charge transferred to the electrodes both per mass of the electrodes m w is the molar mass of the salt and m e is the total mass of the used electrodes i n e t t is the net current and is calculated as i t i l e a k where i t is the measured electrical current i leak refers to the non zero residual electrical current in the system long after the equilibrium is reached which is usually attributed to the unfavorable parasitic reactions taking place at the surface of the electrodes hatzell et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2016 shang et al 2017 the charge efficiency Î» of each case defined as the ratio of the moles of salt removed to the moles of charge transferred to the electrodes is also calculated from the experimental and numerical data using the following equation 18 Î» f Î´ m w q to further compare the output of the cdi cells predicted by the model with the experimental data desalination and energetic performances of the analyzed cases are investigated the desalination performance is evaluated using the ultimate desalination throughput udt defined as salamat and hidrovo 2018 19 u d t c 0 c a v e c 0 c 0 c a v e q t d e s a l q c ave is the average concentration of the effluent and is calculated as c a v e 1 t 0 t c t d t and t desal refers to the total desalination time here we use the average concentration as the performance evaluation point as it represents the final concentration of the collected treated water at the end of the desalination stage the first term in the right hand side of equation 19 computes the desalination percentage in the system and the second and the third terms determine the average rate of salt removal from the bulk solution and the total volume of the desalinated water respectively the significance of this figure of merit is that it combines three characteristics of a desirable desalination system i e low average concentration of the effluent and fast ion adsorption from large volumes of the inlet stream in addition it represents the processing rate which is equal to the rate at which the inlet water is being processed times the amount of salt adsorbed to make a thorough assessment of the overall performance of a cdi unit the performance of the regeneration process should also be considered for that purpose the overall desalination and regeneration performance odrp is defined and calculated as 20 o d r p u d t w r t t o t a l wr is the water recovery ratio and is defined as the ratio of the desalinated volume to the total volume of the initial solution and t total is the total duration of the process desalination and regeneration this metric states that a favorable cdi desalination unit should at the same time incorporate high values of udt i e better adsorption performance and high water recovery ratio over a shorter total processing time span moreover the energetic performances of the numerically and experimentally investigated cases are compared against each other the thermodynamic efficiency of both sets of data is calculated as 21 Î· w r e v e i n w rev is the theoretical minimum energy required to desalinate a given solution to the desired concentration and divide the solution into two desalinated and concentrated parts this value is independent of the desalination method and can be calculated through the gibbs free energy as bejan 2016 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 22 w r e v 2 v d c 0 w r ln c 0 w r c d c 0 1 w r c d ln c 0 w r c d c d 1 w r r t r is the universal gas constant and v d and c d are the volume and final concentration of the desalinated solution respectively e in in equation 21 is the actual electrical energy input during the desalination step assuming zero energy recovery and is obtained as 23 e i n t 0 t i n e t t Ï i n d t Ï i n refers to the external potential difference applied through the power supply to further accentuate the importance of including the micro macropore transfer resistance in the mathematical model we also compare the results obtained here with the numerical data from the 2d model with fast adsorption desorption processes classic i md with no electro sorption resistance 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameters extraction cv and eis data obtained in this work are depicted in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the experimental operational conditions and the model parameter settings for each of the mentioned cases are listed in the supplementary information document section s4 we adopt the recommended approach of hawks et al for reporting these parameters and include the separation report of each case in this work hawks et al 2018b salt adsorption Î´ charge q and charge efficiency Î» at equilibrium do not depend on the transfer rate between the macropores and micropores therefore these parameters can be evaluated to find the value for the micropore ion correlation energy e which results in the best fit and minimum error between the experimental and numerical results the value used for parameter e in the model is compatible with the previous works in the literature biesheuvel et al 2014 dykstra et al 2016a 2016b guyes et al 2017 kim et al 2015a fig 2 depicts the salt adsorption charge transferred and charge efficiency of both experimental and numerical data as it can be seen in this figure although there is a good agreement between the values obtained from the experiments and the model for the adsorbed salt Î´ there is a discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results for the charge transferred q and charge efficiency Î» in cases at a relatively low initial concentration 1 mm we believe this indicates that there is another resistive mechanism in these systems which has not been included in the model developed here these cases experience comparably low electrical currents less than 13 ma which as discussed by hemmatifar et al favor unwanted parasitic energy losses due to faradaic reactions hemmatifar et al 2016 as mentioned in the theory section faradaic losses are not considered in this work and we hypothesize that the difference between the numerical and experimental values of q and Î» in the mentioned cases is caused by neglecting the parasitic losses in the model we verify this hypothesis by repeating the experiments for case 1 which shows a somewhat considerable disagreement between the numerical and experimental results at lower applied voltages further discussion on this is provided in the next section next the temporal effluent concentration profiles of the investigated cases are used to evaluate the macropore to micropore transfer rate constant k fig 3 shows the concentration profile at the exit of each cdi unit over time normalized by the initial concentration electro sorption resistance between the micro and macropores is a relatively new concept and has not been fully investigated here based on the obtained numerical and experimental results we believe it is indeed an important component of the theory describing the transport mechanisms in cdi and one that cannot be neglected furthermore we hypothesize that k is a function of the characteristics of the system the obtained results here show an inverse relation between k and the modified damkÓ§hler number da which is defined as the ratio of the bulk advection and the electro diffusion time constants fig 4 depicts k versus da for the analyzed cases in systems with high t bulk adv and relatively low t elec diff high da slow advection cannot keep pace with the relatively quick electro diffusion and is not able to provide ionic species for adsorption at a sufficiently fast rate this can result in significant local depletion of ions in the macropores leading to what is known as ion starvation as studied before in this condition some regions of the electrode locally experience an insufficient number of ions available for electro adsorption a phenomenon which limits the motion of the species from the macropores into the micropores and hinders the entire electro sorption process in the electrodes hawks et al 2018b hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 qu et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 this eventually translates into a higher transport resistance from the macropores into the micropores or in other words lower values of the transfer rate constant k in the systems this phenomenon can also be considered similar to the limiting current in an electrochemical cell where the charge transfer process is restricted by the zero concentration at the surface of the electrode and is mass transfer controlled prentice 1991 as mentioned earlier in our previous work we conducted a parametric study on the transport mechanisms considered in the md based models i e bulk advection bulk diffusion and the microscale electro diffusion without electro sorption resistance and there we showed that in each system the time at which the effluent concentration reaches its minimum value is in the order of the bulk advection timescale salamat and hidrovo 2018 nevertheless as it was concluded from those results the interrelation between the transport phenomena of the system determines the total duration of the desalination and regeneration steps and not a single mechanism the results here also suggest an inverse relationship between the desalination time t desal which is the time required for completion of the salt removal i e when the effluent concentration gets back to its initial value and the transfer rate constant k see fig 5 as this figure shows in cases with very low rate constant high electro sorption resistance the electro sorption of the ions into and out of the micropores could be the limiting transport mechanism in these systems the ion starvation is so severe that it could dominate the whole desalination step hindering the completion of the salt adsorption process since a somewhat similar trend inverse relation is observed between the transfer rate k constant and the da number in the cases investigated here see fig 4 we hypothesize that coupled with the other transport mechanisms the rate limited electro sorption also determines the overall rate of the salt removal process of each system to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in describing the physics of cdi systems we compare the obtained data with the numerical estimation of the classic i md theory where no electro sorption is included in the model see fig 3 it is worth mentioning that most of the md based models developed so far for describing cdi have also demonstrated a good agreement with experimental data yet these models have not been validated against cases subject to ion starvation biesheuvel et al 2011a guyes et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 porada et al 2013 the cases studied by these theories mostly have relatively high initial concentrations 10 mm and fast flow rates in the main channel analyzing and optimizing the water treatment performance of cdi systems at low initial concentrations are equally vital especially for water softening and heavy metal removal applications choi et al 2019 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 this comparison is conducted for all the cases investigated here as it is shown in fig 3 in all the cases with low initial concentration 2 mm and relatively slow bulk advection the 2d model without the transport resistance i e the classic i md theory cannot fully capture the dynamics of the process as it encounters convergence complexities a closer study of these cases reveals that neglecting the rate limited adsorption desorption results in local ion depletion zones in the macropores where the concentration reaches values extremely close to zero fig 6 illustrates the normalized concentration in the main channel and electrodes macropores at t 1010 s of case 2 which is about three times of the electro diffusion timescale 3t elec diff simulated using the i md theory without considering the electro sorption resistance in this case the initial concentration is 1 mm and pe m 0 1 da 8 6 and da ii 0 8 as it can be seen from this figure most of the macropores in the electrodes are experiencing severe salt starvation and near zero concentration at this instant after which the model fails to describe the transport mechanisms in the cell in fact all the systems with low initial concentration studied here face the same convergence problem where the i md model cannot accurately describe the transport mechanisms taking place in the unit see fig s5 for more illustration of the cases with low initial salinity and slow flow rate facing these complications when being simulated with the classic i md model it should also be noted that although the classic i md theory can model cdi systems with higher initial concentrations it cannot closely predict the performance of the systems with high da number for example in case 5 investigated here da 11 a substantial discrepancy between the numerical and experimental data is observed when no resistance is assumed for the transport of the ions between the micro and macropores as it can be seen from fig 3 while the classic i md model no electro sorption resistance poorly describes the concentration profile at the exit of this system the model developed here offers a much more accurate prediction of the experimental data by considering the transport resistance between the micro and macropores as mentioned above in this system the electro sorption is the key mechanism limiting the whole desalination performance and omitting this transport resistance from the mathematical model results in inaccurate performance evaluation 4 2 performance evaluation to further analyze the desalination and energetic performance of the investigated cases udt odrp and Î· are calculated for each system and shown in fig 7 the obtained results show a good agreement between the numerical and experimental performances as discussed previously in the model implemented here no parasitic reaction losses are being considered and we believe that the current leakage is the main reason for the discrepancy between the experimental and numerical results from the model developed here to verify this case 1 pe m 1 7 da 0 2 da ii 0 3 which shows a non negligible disagreement between the experimental and numerical results for q Î» and Î· is repeated at lower external voltages as shown previously increasing the applied voltage intensifies the occurrence of the faradaic reactions he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 consistent with the previous findings more discrepancy between the experimental and numerical data is also observed here by increasing the external voltage see section s6 of the supplementary information document for the obtained results this in fact demonstrates the robustness of the proposed model in predicting the performance of cdi based systems especially in the absence of faradaic reactions although the focus of this study has been on investigating the significance of the electro sorption resistance these results underline the importance of integrating faradaic reactions with the theoretical model in the future studies we refer the reader to the supplementary information document section s6 for further details on this as it can be inferred from fig 7 the most noticeable disagreement between the thermodynamic efficiency values obtained from the experimental data and the proposed model can be seen in the cases where the classic i md is not able to completely describe the dynamics of the transport in cdi low initial concentration cases although addition of the electro sorption resistance in the numerical model does not lead to sufficiently accurate estimation of the energetic efficiency of these cases yet this analysis proves the importance of including all the resistances in a cdi system when assessing its performance compared to other cdi units and even other desalination technologies specifically as these cases offer higher energetic efficiencies it is necessary to obtain a complete and accurate description of the transport mechanisms for efficiency prediction and optimization purposes as the recent discussion between ramachandran et al and qin et al revealed considering correct electrical ionic and transport resistances in cdi is the key element for reaching objective evaluation of the energetic efficiency of this technology compared to other water treatment methods such as ro qin et al 2019 qu et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2019a we believe that by including other resistance mechanisms in the model such as faradaic reactions numerical simulations will achieve a more precise prediction of the cdi systems performance under various operational conditions another important point which should not be overlooked is that increasing the adsorption capacity of the porous electrodes for example by increasing the surface area also further facilitates the occurrence of ion starvation in cdi cells as the community of cdi aims at improving the efficiency of this system in removing ions by utilizing high capacity electrodes reaching a robust and high fidelity mathematical framework which can fully capture this phenomenon is therefore highly crucial furthermore as it was discussed in the previous section although the classic i md theory can model cdi systems with higher initial concentrations it cannot correctly predict the performance of the systems with high da number in case 5 for instance with slow bulk advection and fast electro diffusion da 11 ignoring the rate limited transfer of the ions between the micro and macropores leads to a near 50 and 210 error increase in estimating Î· and odrp respectively in this system the rate limited transfer of ions between the micro and macropores is the main mechanism limiting the whole ion removal process as it can be seen from fig 3 neglecting this transport resistance leads to an inaccurate estimation of the desalination and regeneration duration t desal and t regen and consequently to high discrepancy between the experimental and numerical values of the water recovery ratio wr and the total processing time t total these discrepancies eventually translate into an imprecise evaluation of the energetic efficiency Î· and the overall desalination and regeneration performance odrp in this system a detailed error analysis of the classic i md theory and the proposed model in predicating the energetic and desalination performance of the studied cdi systems is provided in table s8 in the supplementary information nevertheless as the results presented in figs 3 and 7 demonstrate ignoring the electro sorption resistance in the numerical model the classic i md theory still offers an acceptable performance prediction in cases with low da number the higher transfer rate constant k of these cases which means faster electro sorption or in other words micro macropore transfer with less resistance indicates that the electro sorption is not the main mechanism limiting the whole ion removal process in these systems and their performance is in fact constrained by the other transport mechanisms 4 3 developing versus fully developed systems as it was numerically discussed in the previous work whether the cdi unit has a fully developed or developing convective diffusive regime highly affects the desalination and energetic performance of the system salamat and hidrovo 2018 in the former regime diffusion of the species towards the porous electrodes is faster than their advection in the bulk pe m 1 creating fully developed convective diffusive layers in the latter regime however the bulk advection transport of the ions is faster than their bulk diffusion towards the electrode pe m 1 and the diffusion of the species is mainly limited to the thin convective diffusive layer developing near the interface of the electrodes and the main stream the overall performance and thermodynamic efficiency of the conducted experiments versus their pe m are shown in fig 8 previous studies discussed the adverse effect of fast advection and slow diffusion in the main channel high pe m on the effluent concentration reduction percentage equal to c o c o u t c o 100 mutha et al 2018 perez et al 2013 however numerical analysis has proved that despite the apparent disadvantage of developing regimes with high pe m in decreasing the effluent concentration their overall desalination performance is better than systems with low pe m as higher volumes of water are desalinated in a shorter time salamat and hidrovo 2018 this suggests that over the same period water can be processed at a developing regime through a multi cycle desalination configuration where at each cycle the effluent of the previous cycle is further desalinated to reach a final desired lower concentration rather than through one desalination cycle at a fully developed regime the experimental results obtained here also demonstrate that cdi units performing in the developing regime offer a better desalination performance as they can desalinate more volumes of the inlet solution in a shorter amount of time even though they hit a lower desalination percentage per cycle in comparison with the fully developed systems in other words increasing the pe m leads to better overall desalination performance however as both numerical and experimental data present fully developed systems are an energetically better alternative for desalinating a given solution in fact due to their higher levels of desalination fully developed systems are thermodynamically more efficient this has also been investigated by wang et al where increasing the salinity reduction was recommended for improving the thermodynamic efficiency wang et al 2019 5 conclusion here the i md approach coupled with nernst planck transport theory was used to model the motion of the ionic species in a cdi unit in two dimensions the model was further improved by incorporating the transport resistance between the micro and macropores to validate the model desalination cases with different transport timescales were numerically and experimentally investigated a good agreement between both sets of data was demonstrated and we hypothesized that the transfer rate constant describing the rate limited transport of the species from the macropores into the micropores depends on the ratio of the bulk advection and microscale electro diffusion time constants the desalination and energetic performance of the analyzed systems were also evaluated using inclusive metrics defined in our previous work the results presented here showed that the model where the rate limited transfer of the ions between the micro and macropores is neglected the classic i md fails to fully describe the transport of the species within the cdi cell in systems at low initial concentrations and high adsorption capacity while the presented theory closely modeled the dynamics of such cases moreover compared to the classic i md theory the model developed here led to improvement of the desalination performance and energy efficiency estimation by up to 50 and 210 respectively in systems at high da number fast electro diffusion and slow bulk advection which are subject to severe ion starvation hence the inclusion of this resistance in cdi theories is of paramount importance for objective and accurate efficiency evaluation of this water desalination method especially when comparing its performance with other water treatment technologies furthermore confirming the numerical results the experimental data indicated that while systems with developing convective diffusive layers mass pÃ©clet number 1 have better desalination performance in terms of the desalination percentage rate of salt removal total desalinated volume and water recovery ratio they offer an inferior energy efficiency relative to the systems with fully developed convective diffusive layers mass pÃ©clet number 1 the proposed theoretical framework can be extended beyond cdi systems and can provide critical guidelines for designing effective and efficient water desalination and ion removal systems to meet various application specifications declaration of competing

18379,the operation of seasonal underground thermal energy storages utes as part of renewed heat supply systems can cause amplified temperature variations in the urban subsurface therefore long term environmental consequences for water extractions by trace elements and heavy metals tehms are a key point of concern regarding temperature effects on aquifer hydrogeochemistry to address this issue we report the results of flow through and circular flow column tests conducted with 4 anoxic northern german aquifer sediments tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c and analysed for 20 tehms increased

cooling of the previously heated circular flow column tests to 10 c caused reversals of concentration changes by 30 95 this indicates a return to initial hydrochemical conditions after termination of

lack of knowledge regarding their long term environmental consequences bonte et al 2011 hÃ¤hnlein et al 2013 several utes studies and field tests in the 1980s and early 1990s focussed on investigating operational aspects such as enhanced corrosion induced precipitation of fe and mn hydr oxides in and around source and injection wells carbonate scaling within heat exchangers and pipes as well as

with 3 quaternary sands garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a showed that b cd and ni concentrations decreased and ba concentrations increased with increasing temperatures in a current geothermal field site with groundwater temperatures up to 40 c moreover elevated temperatures of up to 25 c with a maximum Î´t of 7 c in a holocene aquifer caused increasing concentrations of b and li which returned to baseline during re cooling saito et al 2016 with regard to temporally or spatially decreasing temperatures saito et al 2016 and van breukelen and bonte 2016 emphasised the unknown degree of reversibility of tehm concentration changes which significantly controls their spatial propagation downstream from heated areas and the return to initial conditions after the end of utes operations together these previous studies indicate that concentration changes of groundwater components especially tehms induced by temperature variations can differ considerably depending on the sediment and experimental setup this lack of transferability between different sediments may be traced to various interacting and hard to separate processes that cause concentration changes to single groundwater components consequently there is no profound basis for a quantifying discussion on the hydrochemical impact of temporally and spatially varying temperature fields in the range of 10 70 c or higher therefore this work focusses on characterising the net concentration changes of tehms at varying temperature conditions in the range of 10 70 c for 4 typical northern german aquifer sediments in flow through and circular flow column tests essential questions investigated include i which component specific and temporal relations between temperature conditions and tehm concentration changes exist for the investigated sediments moreover how reversible are tehm concentration changes at varying temperature conditions ii how do concentration changes due to elevated temperatures compare to tehm concentration variations at ambient groundwater temperatures in different aquifer sediments iii which elements can be identified as of primary concern within preliminary hydrogeochemical investigations of utes project development 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment characterisation 4 natural sediments from anoxic aquifers in kuden a odderade b and bÃ¶nebÃ¼ttel c d in schleswig holstein germany were obtained from waterworks drillings see supplemental map showing sediment locations fig a 1 liners of sediments b c and d remained sealed until further processing in the laboratory liners of sediment a were open and the sediment was exposed to the atmosphere potentially causing oxidation of sulphides and formation of oxides thus a redistribution of tehms before the sediment was geochemically characterised and tempered in the heating experiments cannot be excluded for each sediment several metres of drilling cores were homogenised by mixing them in a barrel under an argon atmosphere to minimise the effects of heterogeneity on the results the homogenised sediment samples were characterised by geochemical analysis table 1 and stored under an argon atmosphere until needed to obtain the total element composition of the sediments acid pressure digestions were used the si content was not directly measurable with this method therefore to obtain the share of sio2 the oxides of all measured elements and the loss of carbon due to ignition table 1 were subtracted from 100 the elemental composition of the sediments determined by acid pressure digestions showed sediment d having the lowest total tehm content followed by sediments a c and b table 1 the sum of the main elements na k mg ca and fe followed the same order for si this was reversed sediment b contained the highest content of organic carbon and sediment c the highest carbonate content table 1 sediment specific contents of individual tehms are listed in the supplementals table a1 2 2 water

phreeqc minteq v4 databases parkhurst and appelo 2013 2 3 experimental setups 2 3 1 long term flow through column tests long term flow through column tests were used to examine the temporal development of tehm elution behaviour table 3 they were also used to quantify the total elutable amount of tehms over the experimental runtime therefore sediment c filled 110 cm long hdpe columns internal diameter 10 cm were percolated with site water table 2 and tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c for 10 months using a refrigerator and heating tapes a flow rate of 1 ml min led to an initial residence time within the column of 36 h which shortened at higher temperatures over the experimental runtime due to gas phase formation and entrapment lÃ¼ders et al 2016 water samples for tehm analyses were taken at the in and outflow a detailed description of an identical setup is included in lÃ¼ders et al 2016 2 3 2 circular flow column tests 34 circuits divided into 3 different experimental series were set up table 3 and supplemental fig a2 an Î± series consisting of 16 circuits 4 for each sediment tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c were run for 8 weeks to determine tehm concentrations at steady state conditions to evaluate concentration changes due to increased temperatures these were set in relation to the concentration variations between the different sediments at 10 c the Î² and Î³ series investigated the reversible share of element specific concentration changes subsequently referred to as reversibilities in a heat storage cycle with increasing and then decreasing temperatures these were performed for 1 week at increased temperatures and 1 week at the initial 10 c the Î² series consisted of 6 circuits 3 filled with sediment a and 3 with sediment d 1 circuit per sediment was tempered to 25 40 and 70 c for 1 week afterwards all 6 circuits were re cooled to 10 c and operated for another week which represented a simplified heating and re cooling phase in the centre of a heat storage without considerable advective loss of heated water the Î³ series consisted of 12 circuits again the half filled with sediment a and the half with sediment d 3 circuits per sediment were run at 10 c and 1 of the other 3 circuits per sediment at 25 40 or 70 c respectively after 1 week of operation the columns were disconnected from the reservoir bags subsequently the reservoir bag of a heated circuit was connected to a column that was previously run at 10 c to simulate an advective transport of thermally affected water to cooler down gradient surroundings e g induced by background regional groundwater flow or mismatches in injected and extracted water volumes the 3 new circuits per sediment were run for another week at 10 c so consequently in the Î² series reversibility of tehm concentration changes was tested by heating and cooling the same water sediment system while in the Î³ series reversibility was tested by displacing the water from the heated water sediment system to a sediment that had remained at ambient temperatures of 10 c all 3 series were run under anoxic conditions supplemental fig a3 and a4 a detailed description of

address concerns regarding the geochemical effects of utes sites on water extractions information about the extent of potential plumes with increased tehm concentrations are helpful existing complex models either focus on technical issues such as clogging garcÃ­a gil et al 2016b or the redistribution of as between and around the hot and cold wells of an aquifer thermal energy storage ates system based on temperature dependent surface complexation bonte et al 2014 due to insufficient understanding of tehm release and fixation process details and associated parameterisation deficits we developed a simplified analytical 1 dimensional 1d approach to estimate the progression of tehm concentrations based on existing data the following destails of this approach are supported by a step by step description for the calculations in appendix a tehm concentrations and reversibilities were taken from the circular flow column experiments 2 3 2 3 1 3 2 assuming tehm concentration changes induced by changes in temperatures are reversible 3 2 tehms advectively transported out of thermally affected spaces at borehole thermal energy storage btes sites should be re fixated downstream btes fields would likely be installed in cohesive sediments whose temperature dependent tehm release behaviour has not yet been investigated hence data from this study s loose sediments were used as a substitute in ates systems tehms released around the hot well during the injection cycle would be partially pumped out in the subsequent hot water extraction cycle and after reinjection re fixated both around and downstream from the corresponding cold well this back and forth pumping of water with increased tehm concentrations also occurs in the following storage cycles where the exact share of tehms transported to the cold well and the share of tehms being re fixated downstream from the hot or cold well depicts site specifically however consideration of various tehm distributions between the hot and cold wells go beyond the scope and capabilities of this simplified 1d approach as these calculations only consider refixation downstream from the hot well following the initial injection cycle thus compared to a real site where re fixation of released tehms is distributed to the downstream direction of the hot and cold wells the tehm affected distance downstream from the ates site as a whole will rather be overestimated with these calculations processes not covered such as contact of pumped water to surface installations and associated mineral precipitation or tehm sorption potential gas phase formation with effects on the flow field were also neglected in this simplified approach exemplarily this estimation was done for as as as appeared to be the most relevant tehm 3 3 and bonte et al 2013b 3 results and discussion 3 1 tehm concentration changes due to increased temperatures relation to background hydrogeochemistry and associated release processes 3 1 1 flow through column tests in the flow through column test with sediment c heated to 70 c the ph decreased slightly from 7 2 to 7 0 within the first 10 exchanged pore volumes pvs afterwards ph conditions remained largely stable around 7 2 see supplemental fig b1 also for the following main groundwater components na and k concentrations increased with the start of heating during the first 4 pvs the release then declined over the experimental runtime and terminated after 6 and 170 pvs respectively ca and mg decreased with the start of heating and after 25 pvs the concentration decrease stabilised at a lower level the tic concentrations also decreased during the entire time the column was heated indicating carbonate precipitation which was supported by a decreasing oversaturation of calcite along the flow path si was released over the entire experimental heating runtime but after a maximum at approximately 50 pvs the release slowly declined for the first 50 pvs a stronger and then declining release of organic carbon was accompanied by eh values decreasing by 250 mv 200 mv with increasing fe and decreasing sulphate concentrations indicating iron and sulphate reducing conditions at the lower temperatures these effects were either occurring to a lesser extent e g na k or corg release or not at all e g sulphate reduction the observed tehm concentration changes at increased temperatures can be divided into 4 categories first elements that showed a strong release after the start of heating that then diminished with ongoing experimental runtime li as mo and sb second elements that showed lowered concentrations at increased temperatures co ni cu zn cd and sn third elements that exhibited continuous release over the experimental runtime ba fourth elements whose concentrations were not substantially affected by increased temperatures al v cr mn se sr tl and pb the release behaviour observed for li mo and sb was similar to that exemplarily shown for as fig 1 where release was strongest at 70 c for li as and mo and at 40 c for sb the time limited release of these elements indicates an elution from temperature dependent finite pools thus under unchanged temperature conditions and after depletion of the corresponding pools further release of these elements should not occur the total eluted amount per element over the experimental runtime in the column test at 70 c compared to the element content in sediment c supplemental table a1 yielded an elutable share of 0 1 10 15 and 2 1 for li as mo and sb respectively the elutable share of as at 10 is within the range of the mean share of the non and specifically adsorbed as fraction 9 2 that were determined for 20 different soils by wenzel et al 2001 suggesting this fraction is a temperature dependent elutable pool the elements of the second category showed lower concentrations at elevated temperatures compared to the 10 c reference experiment for co fig 1 and cu and cd this is related to decreasing concentrations at higher temperatures for ni zn and sn increasing concentrations in the 10 c reference experiment over experimental runtime that did not occur as strongly at elevated temperatures were responsible concentrations changes of co cu and cd appeared to be longer lasting than those of the first category although potentially stronger concentration changes in the initial heating phase might be prevented by limited starting concentrations ba showed a stable continuous release at increased temperatures which decreased slightly towards the end of the experimental runtime fig 1 this indicates a much larger pool with differing properties compared to elements with time limited releases li as mo and sb 3 1 2 circular flow column tests in the Î± series of circular flow column tests see supplemental fig b2 to b 16 for graphs that show ph eh and concentrations of main groundwater components over experimental runtime ph values started at 7 3 to 7 5 for sediments a b and c and at 7 7 for sediment d at 10 25 and 40 c the ph values remained stable at 70 c the ph decreased by approximately 0 2 units within the first week then slightly decreased further and stabilised at ph values between 6 5 and 6 7 for sediments a b and c and approximately 7 4 for sediment d ca and mg concentrations decreased in sediments a and c increased with sediment b and were stable with sediment d tic concentrations strongly increased at higher temperatures for all sediments probably caused by a stronger organic carbon release and respiration na and k concentrations generally increased at higher temperatures whereas si concentrations increased over experimental runtime only at 70 and partially at 40 c for na and k this indicates desorption as the main source while at higher temperatures the dissolution of silicates may have also contributed to increasing na and k concentrations organic carbon concentrations increased over the entire experimental runtime at 25 40 and 70 c eh values fluctuated but overall they were stable at 300 350 mv within the first week after 1 2 weeks of experimental runtime eh values started to decrease to between 50 and 250 mv with no obvious temperature trend this drop was accompanied by decreasing sulphate concentrations at 70 c in all sediments at 40 c in sediments a c and d and at 25 c in sediment d fe concentrations partially increased at 10 c and d 25 a b and d and 40 c d mn concentration slightly increased at 10 and 25 c with sediments a and c and were increasing stronger for sediment b at all elevated temperatures comparison of circular flow column eluate concentrations of the Î± series after 1 and 8 weeks of circuit operations at 70 c revealed that for most tehms concentration changes were significantly larger in the first week of heating than in the subsequent 7 weeks supplemental fig b17 this can be explained by discontinuous tehm release behaviour 3 1 1 or by relatively fast reaching of steady state conditions v sb and tl concentrations decreased after concentration increases in the first week of heating indicating a subsequent fixation process examining tehm concentrations after the initial week of heating and before the onset of stronger reducing conditions showed that li as mo sb and ba concentrations increased with temperature in all 4 investigated sediments in the circular flow column experiments and the extent was sediment specific fig 2 depending on the sediment used v mn co cu zn sn tl pb and u concentrations increased decreased or went unchanged with increasing temperatures fig 2 ni concentrations decreased with temperature but partially only after a maximum concentration at 25 c fig 2 the elements al cr se sr cd and pb were unaffected by changes in temperature supplemental fig b18 for sediment c which was investigated in both the flow through and the circular flow column tests the direction of concentration changes for the individual elements was equal in both setups however in contrast to the flow through column tests concentrations of co ni cu zn and sn showed a maximum concentration at 25 c instead of 10 c before decreasing with increasing temperatures as several elements were affected this behaviour might be linked to a regulating parameter such as ph which was slightly higher 7 6 in the circular flow than in the flow through column tests 7 4 heated to 25 c 3 1 3 hydrochemical processes regulating tehm concentration changes several tehms released at increased temperatures exist as oxyanions under the respective conditions in the flow through and circular flow column experiments this included the concentration increases of as mo sb in all sediments figs 1 and 2 and v sediment specific fig 2 a preferential release of oxyanions has already been observed bonte et al 2013b and corresponded to the weaker sorption of anions such as arsenate arsenite selenate selenite and silicate at increased temperatures kersten and vlasova 2013 2009a 2009b maji et al 2007 parida and das 1997 this weaker sorption of anions was likely caused by a decrease in the point of zero charge with increasing temperatures predominantly coupled to a change in the dissociation constant of water Ã¡lvarez merino et al 2008 tewari and mclean 1972 and an associated negative enthalpy of surface complexation reactions for anions bonte et al 2014 kersten and vlasova 2009a in contrast individual studies on marine clayey material found decreasing concentrations of arsenate and arsenite at increasing temperatures genÃ§ fuhrman et al 2004 these authors assumed this was due to better accessibility to inner surfaces caused by a widening of the grain structure and accelerated diffusion at higher temperatures which could superpose the weaker sorption of anions in fine grained sediments for cations a decrease in the point of zero charge can cause stronger sorption on variable charge surfaces as reported for cu2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cd2 and co2 by angove et al 1999 echeverrÃ­a et al 2003 rodda et al 1993 this corresponds with the observed decreases in co sediment specific figs 1 and 2 and ni concentrations in all sediments fig 2 with increasing temperatures and reported positive enthalpies of surface complexation reactions for cations bonte et al 2014 changes in ph can cause diverse effects however ph conditions show no general change due to increasing temperatures supplemental fig b19 brons et al 1991 bonte et al 2013b hence the decrease in the point of zero charge appears to be the dominant process a second temperature dependent process affecting tehm concentrations may be the preferential sorption of divalent in exchange for monovalent ions at increased temperatures as has been shown for ca2 mg2 cu2 and ni2 in exchange for k and na by bansal 1982 el batouti et al 2003 ogwada and sparks 1986 and udo 1978 when these studies presented enthalpies for the sorption reactions they reported lower enthalpy values for the sorption of monovalent cations suggesting a similar mechanism as for the exchange between anions and cations as less positively charged monovalent ions were preferentially desorbed although not observable for all of the elements in combination with all examined sediments cations with monovalent speciation tended to show increasing concentrations na and k supplemental fig b1 b6 and b7 li and tl fig 2 while cations with divalent speciation showed rather decreasing concentrations ca2 and mg2 supplemental fig b1 b8 and b9 co2 and ni2 figs 1 and 2 a third potential process controlling tehm concentrations is the reductive dissolution of mn and fe hydr oxides bonte et al 2013b their dissolution is associated with an increase in organic carbon availability and biodegradation at higher temperatures that causes a shift towards stronger reducing conditions including potential sulphate reduction 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 also bonte et al 2013a jesuÃek et al 2013 thus tehms incorporated into or sorbed on mn and fe hydr oxides can be released while newly precipitated sulphides can incorporate or adsorb tehms at the same time and in close spatial proximity bonte et al 2013b kabata pendias 2010 aside from sulphides also carbonates frequently precipitated at increased temperatures can incorporate fe and mn griffioen and appelo 1993 and potentially further tehms associated with fe or mn consequently decreasing concentrations of v sb and tl after the shift towards sulphate reducing conditions in the circular flow column tests 3 1 2 supplemental fig b17 were likely associated with the fixation in or on newly precipitated sulphides or carbonates with ba as a divalent cation decreasing concentrations would be expected katz et al 2013 however ba concentrations increased figs 1 and 2 in contrast to those elements being released by desorption li as mo and sb 3 1 1 continuously released ba fig 1 likely originated from longer lasting mineral dissolution this assumption is supported by observations made at an ongoing geothermally used aquifer with temperatures up to 40 c where ba concentrations were positively correlated with temperature changes garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a given that relatively fast sorption processes were probably already near a steady state in agreement with the work of bonte et al 2013b there was no general correlation between released tehms and sediment characteristics related to sorption of tehms such as bulk fe content or amorphic fe phases for the investigated sediments 3 2 reversibility of temperature induced tehm concentration changes reversibility of tehm concentration changes was investigated with 18 circular flow column tests of the Î² and Î³ series for tehms whose concentrations were affected by increased temperatures li v mn co ni as mo sb ba tl and u 3 1 2 mo showed the lowest 30 and tl the highest 95 overall reversibility with all other elemental reversibilities lying between 47 and 77 fig 3a to investigate whether element specific reversibilities were influenced by the heating temperature sediment or experimental setting reversibilities were displayed separately for these categories element specific reversibilities were averaged for experiments with equal temperatures equal sediments and equal experimental settings and plotted against an overall average fig 3b d average reversibility at 40 c 74 was only slightly higher than at 25 c and 70 c 57 and 59 the element specific deviation in reversibility between the 3 temperatures ranged from 9 tl to 67 u highlighting the importance of element specific differences fig 3b overall no consistent trend between reversibility with temperature was apparent average reversibility in sediment a 65 was only slightly higher than in sediment d 62 average reversibilities of li v mn co and ni were higher in sediment a whereas as mo sb ba tl and u showed a higher average reversibility in sediment d the differences in reversibility between the 2 sediments reached 41 for v but stayed below 10 for mn as sb and tl fig 3c average reversibilities in the Î³ series 69 were higher than in the Î² series 58 only li as and u showed higher reversibilities in the Î² series experiments fig 3d similar reversibilities for the experiments with sediments from which tehms were released in the preceding heating phase Î² series and for those that were not heated previously Î³ series suggests that fixation of tehms due to re cooling was largely independent from the initial release process reversibility of concentration changes with 1 week of re cooling to 10 c after a 1 week phase of heating to 25 40 or 70 c was incomplete for all analysed tehms given the overall complexity of the systems quantifying reversibilities was the main attempt however in relation to main element hydrogeochemistry and the literature there are clues regarding the potential processes limiting reversibility in the Î² series incomplete reversibility might be partially explained by the dissolution of mn or fe hydr oxides due to increased temperatures 3 1 2 and a thermally enhanced aging of remaining fe hydr oxides ford et al 1997 with an associated decline in sorption capacity however this does not explain incomplete reversibilities in the Î³ series as the sediment in contact with the water during the re cooling phase had not been heated based on the equal duration of the heating and re cooling phases in this study slower sorption kinetics at 10 c as opposed to desorption kinetics at elevated temperatures as observed by bruemmer et al 1988 and scheckel and sparks 2001 are a likely explanation for incomplete reversibilities in both series this should be further addressed in future studies by applying a longer re cooling phase and if applicable by measuring a time series of concentrations during the heating and re cooling phases 3 3 evaluation of tehm concentration changes the extent and frequency of pronounced tehm concentration changes were evaluated to identify elements of primary concern for preliminary investigations of utes project development 3 criteria were evaluated first concentration changes between 10 and 70 c in the circular flow column tests normalised to the concentration of the respective element at 10 c which was taken as the initial state were used to assess the extent of relative element specific tehm concentration changes fig 4 blue bars left axis second the same concentration changes normalised to the standard deviation of concentrations measured in circular flow column tests with all 4 sediments tempered to 10 c were used to relate temperature induced changes to the variability standard deviation in the initial state between the different sediments fig 4 yellow bars right axis third a review of increasing or decreasing concentrations at higher temperatures including results published in this context by focussing on the first and second criteria mn tl li sb mo v and as showed comparatively high values in both aspects indicating that these elements show strong temperature effects that exceed variations at ambient temperatures of 10 c however to evaluate which elements should be of primary focus in future investigations all available laboratory and field studies in this context were reviewed bonte et al 2013b garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a jesuÃek et al 2013 saito et al 2016 tehms were assigned to a category from 1 to 5 representing descending relevance in preliminary hydrogeochemical investigations for utes projects table 4 and depending on whether a specific tehm demonstrated sediment specifically or for all sediments increased or decreased concentrations at elevated temperatures or only negligible changes it was noted that field studies are only available for temperatures up to 25 and 41 c whereas laboratory work covered temperatures up to 60 and 70 c in the laboratory study by bonte et al 2013b and in this study as concentrations increased with temperature in all sediments and partially increased already at 25 c in contrast the field studies revealed no evidence for increasing as concentrations garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a saito et al 2016 explanations may include differences in sediment composition lack of data from the initial phase of heating garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a when the strongest tehm concentration changes occur in laboratory experiments 3 1 1 and bonte et al 2013b or an insufficient temperature increase for measurable concentration changes saito et al 2016 furthermore sediments investigated in laboratory experiments are typically disturbed sediments are usually obtained from drillings moved to the laboratory homogenised and placed in columns this process might cause the activation of mineral surfaces and potentially intensifies concentration changes under laboratory conditions this is in contrast to field studies as indicated by the concentration increases in this study s column tests at 10 c compared to the respective site water supplemental fig b20 how results from laboratory investigations are scalable to field conditions in terms of the influence of temperatures up to 70 c on hydrogeochemistry especially for tehm behaviour to our knowledge has not yet been investigated this issue is not further elaborated on here but is addressed in an ongoing project www testum aquifer de which combines a field heat storage test with laboratory experiments with sediment samples from the test site using the currently available dataset as a basis 3 groups of elements category 1 3 table 4 revealed a combined concentration limit for ground or drinking water by inter national regulations supplemental table b1 with increasing concentrations due to elevated temperatures in some of the investigated sediments the first group comprises only as which showed the strongest relative concentration increases at higher temperatures increases that exceeded the standard deviation of as concentrations at 10 c in most of the sediments the second group consisting of v mn and mo still exhibited considerable relative concentration increases at higher temperatures in several sediments that also exceeded the variability of concentrations at 10 c but on average to a lesser extent than as the third group of elements b f cr co sb ba tl and u was released from a limited share of the sediments at increased temperatures and the relative concentration changes only partially exceeded the standard deviation of concentrations measured at 10 c for the fourth group of elements al ni cu zn se cd hg and pb no or negligible concentration increases due to elevated temperature were observed for the fifth group of elements li be p sc ga sr sn la eu ho yb and th there were no concentration limits for ground or drinking water in place which indicates the innocuousness of concentration changes for these elements therefore the elements as v mn mo b f cr co sb ba tl and u should be treated with particular care for preliminary investigations of utes project development however due to the lack of tehm data from high temperature field tests the unproven transferability from the laboratory to the field and the overall limited database this assessment of elements should be continuously verified with data from future laboratory and field pilot studies 3 4 estimated spreading of plumes with increased tehm concentrations around utes facilities during the initial heating phase although there are still uncertainties regarding process parametrisation and transferability of concentration changes from laboratory experiments to field applications the size ratios between an aquifer section used to store heat and potential plumes of increased tehm concentrations were estimated to obtain an assessment concerning their potential spreading this was done for as by calculating the distribution of as concentrations both up and downstream from numerical utes sites the estimated as concentrations were placed in context using a legal threshold value to deduce distances downstream from heat storages potentially affected by critical tehm concentrations depending on site and sediment specific characteristics for the generic boundary conditions of the numerical utes sites examined here the drinking water limit of as 10 Î¼g l table b1 taken as an exemple threshold value would be undercut by 2 sediments with relatively high as discharges 25 or 45 m downstream from the btes field and 200 or 400 m downstream from the ates injection well for sediment a or c fig 5 in cross section these distances are approximately 1 2 or 2 5 ates and 1 8 or 3 btes times larger than the yellow framed 170 m ates or 14 m btes aquifer section used for heat extraction fig 5 as most tehms released in the column tests appeared to originate from a finite pool 3 1 1 this estimation yielded the maximum expected concentrations and distances for initial heat storage cycles which should decline and shrink after the initial operating phase respectively in instances where a heat storage operation is terminated before tehms are completely eluted tehm concentrations should decrease when linked to decreasing temperatures over time as demonstrated in this study for decreasing temperatures over distance although to refine and increase the robustness of such estimations further research is required to test whether longer heating phases or multiple heating and cooling cycles can cause enhanced reductive dissolution or aging of sorbing minerals and an associated decline in reversibility however the performed estimations illustrate that even for sediments with relatively high tehm discharge only narrowly restricted areas with increased tehm concentrations should develop during the initial heating phase 4 conclusions flow through and circular flow column tests with 4 typical anoxic northern german aquifer sediments showed increasing li as mo sb and ba concentrations and decreasing ni concentrations at elevated temperatures in all of the investigated sediments whereas temperature effects on v mn co tl and u concentrations varied sediment specifically apart from ba all these components showing increased concentrations at higher temperatures were temporally released indicating a temperature dependent finite tehm pool which limited the released mass and duration however in the short term elevated temperatures of 70 c caused concentration changes in as v mn li and tl to exceed variations between the sediments at 10 c considerably since these concentration changes varied considerably between the sediments preliminary site specific hydrochemical investigations for planned heat storage sites remain necessary to assess tehm behaviour processes triggered or intensified by a temperature increase that are believed to be largely responsible for the tehm release include a decrease in the point of zero charge and an associated negative enthalpy for surface complexation reactions of anions leading to desorption of tehms present as oxy anions e g vanadate chromate arsenate arsenite molybdate and antimonate preferential desorption of monovalent ions e g li and tl in exchange for divalent e g co and ni ions the reductive dissolution of minerals such as mn and fe hydr oxides whereby potentially further tehms ba are released re cooling down to 10 c demonstrated the tehm release to be element specifically reversible between 30 and 95 the degree of reversibility seemed to be somewhat unaffected by the applied temperature the sediment or the experimental setting if higher kinetic sorption rates at higher temperatures are responsible for incomplete reversibility then higher reversibilities could be presumed in the field with longer contact times in general the observed reversibility of tehm concentration changes allows for estimating distances around heat storage sites affected by increased tehm concentrations as shown for as with a 1d approach based on the experimental data and temperature profiles from existing numerical utes sites allows for the application of active cooling as a countermeasure in cases of an unexpected adverse progression of tehm concentrations will lead to successive redevelopment of initial natural groundwater conditions with reversals to natural ambient temperatures downstream or after the termination of utes operations currently it appears impossible to relate tehm releases due to heating of a sediment to easily obtainable hydrogeochemical parameters as contents of specific metal oxides or sulphides therefore further research in identifying and quantifying the involved processes could enable developing methods for faster preliminary site investigations with limited temporal and financial efforts as well as the development of more detailed process based models for predicting tehm behaviour under varying temperatures together with the verification of transferability of laboratory results to the field this would promote a more widespread application of subsurface heat storages beyond the processes discussed here future evaluation procedures should focus on a balanced consideration of groundwater protection and sustainable use of the geologic underground in this sense and for streamlining of utes authorisation procedures the possibility of assessing the impact area as a subterranean technical facility for which criteria are different than for groundwater and allow time limited deviations from the surrounding area inside the facility should be assessed juridically funding this study is part of the angus

18379,the operation of seasonal underground thermal energy storages utes as part of renewed heat supply systems can cause amplified temperature variations in the urban subsurface therefore long term environmental consequences for water extractions by trace elements and heavy metals tehms are a key point of concern regarding temperature effects on aquifer hydrogeochemistry to address this issue we report the results of flow through and circular flow column tests conducted with 4 anoxic northern german aquifer sediments tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c and analysed for 20 tehms increased temperatures in column tests caused increasing li as mo sb and ba concentrations and decreasing ni concentrations in all of the sediments with a sediment specific extent whereas effects on v mn co tl and u concentrations varied sediment specifically apart from ba all these components were released as a pulse in the initial heating phase indicating a temperature dependent finite elutable pool re cooling of the previously heated circular flow column tests to 10 c caused reversals of concentration changes by 30 95 this indicates a return to initial hydrochemical conditions after termination of heat storage operation and downstream from heat storages during the operations the latter was approximated for as with a simplified analytical 1 dimensional approach presuming transferability from a laboratory to a field scale this reversal in concentration changes enables active cooling as a countermeasure in cases of unexpected adverse tehm progression from the perspective of our findings tehm

up to 90 c bauer et al 2013 jenne et al 1992 in addition subsurface temperatures are affected by groundwater heat pumps used for heating or cooling purposes garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a sub surface

of installed geothermal bayer et al 2012 and utes systems bonte et al 2011 have steadily risen in several countries concerns about potential conflicts with groundwater quality have arisen due to a lack of knowledge regarding their long term environmental consequences bonte et al 2011 hÃ¤hnlein et al 2013 several utes studies and field tests in the 1980s and early 1990s focussed on investigating operational aspects such as enhanced corrosion induced precipitation of fe and mn hydr oxides in and around source and injection wells carbonate scaling within heat exchangers and pipes as well as technical solutions to prevent precipitations andersson 1990 jenne et al 1992 within aquifers dissolution of amorphic sio2 and feldspars holm et al 1987 precipitation of carbonates griffioen and appelo 1993 the release of organic carbon and an associated shift towards more reductive conditions bonte et al 2013a brons et al 1991 jesuÃek et al 2013 are expected to be the main hydrogeochemical processes the latter includes potential reductive dissolution of fe and mn hydr oxides and the precipitation of sulphides associated with these processes trace elements and heavy metals tehms can be mobilised and fixated due to reductive dissolution or precipitation of minerals that incorporate tehms or provide sorption sites or changes in ph and eh conditions and subsequent changes to the speciation of solutes or charges on mineral surfaces bonte et al 2013b found significantly increased concentrations of as at 25 and 60 c and of p mo v b and f at 60 c by heating column tests filled with 3 quaternary sands garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a showed that b cd and ni concentrations decreased and ba concentrations increased with increasing temperatures in a current geothermal field site with groundwater temperatures up to 40 c moreover elevated temperatures of up to 25 c with a maximum Î´t of 7 c in a holocene aquifer caused increasing concentrations of b and li which returned to baseline during re cooling saito et al 2016 with regard to temporally or spatially decreasing temperatures saito et al 2016 and van breukelen and bonte 2016 emphasised the unknown degree of reversibility of tehm concentration changes which significantly controls their spatial propagation downstream from heated areas and the return to initial conditions after the end of utes operations together these previous studies indicate that concentration changes of groundwater components especially tehms induced by temperature variations can differ considerably depending on the sediment and experimental setup this lack of transferability between different sediments may be traced to various interacting and hard to separate processes that cause concentration changes to single groundwater components consequently there is no profound basis for a quantifying discussion on the hydrochemical impact of temporally and spatially varying temperature fields in the range of 10 70 c or higher therefore this work focusses on characterising the net concentration changes of tehms at varying temperature conditions in the range of 10 70 c for 4 typical northern german aquifer sediments in flow through and circular flow column tests essential questions investigated include i which component specific and temporal relations between temperature conditions and tehm concentration changes exist for the investigated sediments moreover how reversible are tehm concentration changes at varying temperature conditions ii how do concentration changes due to elevated temperatures compare to tehm concentration variations at ambient groundwater temperatures in different aquifer sediments iii which elements can be identified as of primary concern within preliminary hydrogeochemical investigations of utes project development 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment characterisation 4 natural sediments from anoxic aquifers in kuden a odderade b and bÃ¶nebÃ¼ttel c d in schleswig holstein germany were obtained from waterworks drillings see supplemental map showing sediment locations fig a 1 liners of sediments b c and d remained sealed until further processing in the laboratory liners of sediment a were open and the sediment was exposed to the atmosphere potentially causing oxidation of sulphides and formation of oxides thus a redistribution of tehms before the sediment was geochemically characterised and tempered in the heating experiments cannot be excluded for each sediment several metres of drilling cores were homogenised by mixing them in a barrel under an argon atmosphere to minimise the effects of heterogeneity on the results the homogenised sediment samples were characterised by geochemical analysis table 1 and stored under an argon atmosphere until needed to obtain the total element composition of the sediments acid pressure digestions were used the si content was not directly measurable with this method therefore to obtain the share of sio2 the oxides of all measured elements and the loss of carbon due to ignition table 1 were subtracted from 100 the elemental composition of the sediments determined by acid pressure digestions showed sediment d having the lowest total tehm content followed by sediments a c and b table 1 the sum of the main elements na k mg ca and fe followed the same order for si this was reversed sediment b contained the highest content of organic carbon and sediment c the highest carbonate content table 1 sediment specific contents of individual tehms are listed in the supplementals table a1 2 2 water

phreeqc minteq v4 databases parkhurst and appelo 2013 2 3 experimental setups 2 3 1 long term flow through column tests long term flow through column tests were used to examine the temporal development of tehm elution behaviour table 3 they were also used to quantify the total elutable amount of tehms over the experimental runtime therefore sediment c filled 110 cm long hdpe columns internal diameter 10 cm were percolated with site water table 2 and tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c for 10 months using a refrigerator and heating tapes a flow rate of 1 ml min led to an initial residence time within the column of 36 h which shortened at higher temperatures over the experimental runtime due to gas phase formation and entrapment lÃ¼ders et al 2016 water samples for tehm analyses were taken at the in and outflow a detailed description of an identical setup is included in lÃ¼ders et al 2016 2 3 2 circular flow column tests 34 circuits divided into 3 different experimental series were set up table 3 and supplemental fig a2 an Î± series consisting of 16 circuits 4 for each sediment tempered to 10 25 40 and 70 c were run for 8 weeks to determine tehm concentrations at steady state conditions to evaluate concentration changes due to increased temperatures these were set in relation to the concentration variations between the different sediments at 10 c the Î² and Î³ series investigated the reversible share of element specific concentration changes subsequently referred to as reversibilities in a heat storage cycle with increasing and then decreasing temperatures these were performed for 1 week at increased temperatures and 1 week at the initial 10 c the Î² series consisted of 6 circuits 3 filled with sediment a and 3 with sediment d 1 circuit per sediment was tempered to 25 40 and 70 c for 1 week afterwards all 6 circuits were re cooled to 10 c and operated for another week which represented a simplified heating and re cooling phase in the centre of a heat storage without considerable advective loss of heated water the Î³ series consisted of 12 circuits again the half filled with sediment a and the half with sediment d 3 circuits per sediment were run at 10 c and 1 of the other 3 circuits per sediment at 25 40 or 70 c respectively after 1 week of operation the columns were disconnected from the reservoir bags subsequently the reservoir bag of a heated circuit was connected to a column that was previously run at 10 c to simulate an advective transport of thermally affected water to cooler down gradient surroundings e g induced by background regional groundwater flow or mismatches in injected and extracted water volumes the 3 new circuits per sediment were run for another week at 10 c so consequently in the Î² series reversibility of tehm concentration changes was tested by heating and cooling the same water sediment system while in the Î³ series reversibility was tested by displacing the water from the heated water sediment system to a sediment that had remained at ambient temperatures of 10 c all 3 series were run under anoxic conditions supplemental fig a3 and a4 a detailed description of

address concerns regarding the geochemical effects of utes sites on water extractions information about the extent of potential plumes with increased tehm concentrations are helpful existing complex models either focus on technical issues such as clogging garcÃ­a gil et al 2016b or the redistribution of as between and around the hot and cold wells of an aquifer thermal energy storage ates system based on temperature dependent surface complexation bonte et al 2014 due to insufficient understanding of tehm release and fixation process details and associated parameterisation deficits we developed a simplified analytical 1 dimensional 1d approach to estimate the progression of tehm concentrations based on existing data the following destails of this approach are supported by a step by step description for the calculations in appendix a tehm concentrations and reversibilities were taken from the circular flow column experiments 2 3 2 3 1 3 2 assuming tehm concentration changes induced by changes in temperatures are reversible 3 2 tehms advectively transported out of thermally affected spaces at borehole thermal energy storage btes sites should be re fixated downstream btes fields would likely be installed in cohesive sediments whose temperature dependent tehm release behaviour has not yet been investigated hence data from this study s loose sediments were used as a substitute in ates systems tehms released around the hot well during the injection cycle would be partially pumped out in the subsequent hot water extraction cycle and after reinjection re fixated both around and downstream from the corresponding cold well this back and forth pumping of water with increased tehm concentrations also occurs in the following storage cycles where the exact share of tehms transported to the cold well and the share of tehms being re fixated downstream from the hot or cold well depicts site specifically however consideration of various tehm distributions between the hot and cold wells go beyond the scope and capabilities of this simplified 1d approach as these calculations only consider refixation downstream from the hot well following the initial injection cycle thus compared to a real site where re fixation of released tehms is distributed to the downstream direction of the hot and cold wells the tehm affected distance downstream from the ates site as a whole will rather be overestimated with these calculations processes not covered such as contact of pumped water to surface installations and associated mineral precipitation or tehm sorption potential gas phase formation with effects on the flow field were also neglected in this simplified approach exemplarily this estimation was done for as as as appeared to be the most relevant tehm 3 3 and bonte et al 2013b 3 results and discussion 3 1 tehm concentration changes due to increased temperatures relation to background hydrogeochemistry and associated release processes 3 1 1 flow through column tests in the flow through column test with sediment c heated to 70 c the ph decreased slightly from 7 2 to 7 0 within the first 10 exchanged pore volumes pvs afterwards ph conditions remained largely stable around 7 2 see supplemental fig b1 also for the following main groundwater components na and k concentrations increased with the start of heating during the first 4 pvs the release then declined over the experimental runtime and terminated after 6 and 170 pvs respectively ca and mg decreased with the start of heating and after 25 pvs the concentration decrease stabilised at a lower level the tic concentrations also decreased during the entire time the column was heated indicating carbonate precipitation which was supported by a decreasing oversaturation of calcite along the flow path si was released over the entire experimental heating runtime but after a maximum at approximately 50 pvs the release slowly declined for the first 50 pvs a stronger and then declining release of organic carbon was accompanied by eh values decreasing by 250 mv 200 mv with increasing fe and decreasing sulphate concentrations indicating iron and sulphate reducing conditions at the lower temperatures these effects were either occurring to a lesser extent e g na k or corg release or not at all e g sulphate reduction the observed tehm concentration changes at increased temperatures can be divided into 4 categories first elements that showed a strong release after the start of heating that then diminished with ongoing experimental runtime li as mo and sb second elements that showed lowered concentrations at increased temperatures co ni cu zn cd and sn third elements that exhibited continuous release over the experimental runtime ba fourth elements whose concentrations were not substantially affected by increased temperatures al v cr mn se sr tl and pb the release behaviour observed for li mo and sb was similar to that exemplarily shown for as fig 1 where release was strongest at 70 c for li as and mo and at 40 c for sb the time limited release of these elements indicates an elution from temperature dependent finite pools thus under unchanged temperature conditions and after depletion of the corresponding pools further release of these elements should not occur the total eluted amount per element over the experimental runtime in the column test at 70 c compared to the element content in sediment c supplemental table a1 yielded an elutable share of 0 1 10 15 and 2 1 for li as mo and sb respectively the elutable share of as at 10 is within the range of the mean share of the non and specifically adsorbed as fraction 9 2 that were determined for 20 different soils by wenzel et al 2001 suggesting this fraction is a temperature dependent elutable pool the elements of the second category showed lower concentrations at elevated temperatures compared to the 10 c reference experiment for co fig 1 and cu and cd this is related to decreasing concentrations at higher temperatures for ni zn and sn increasing concentrations in the 10 c reference experiment over experimental runtime that did not occur as strongly at elevated temperatures were responsible concentrations changes of co cu and cd appeared to be longer lasting than those of the first category although potentially stronger concentration changes in the initial heating phase might be prevented by limited starting concentrations ba showed a stable continuous release at increased temperatures which decreased slightly towards the end of the experimental runtime fig 1 this indicates a much larger pool with differing properties compared to elements with time limited releases li as mo and sb 3 1 2 circular flow column tests in the Î± series of circular flow column tests see supplemental fig b2 to b 16 for graphs that show ph eh and concentrations of main groundwater components over experimental runtime ph values started at 7 3 to 7 5 for sediments a b and c and at 7 7 for sediment d at 10 25 and 40 c the ph values remained stable at 70 c the ph decreased by approximately 0 2 units within the first week then slightly decreased further and stabilised at ph values between 6 5 and 6 7 for sediments a b and c and approximately 7 4 for sediment d ca and mg concentrations decreased in sediments a and c increased with sediment b and were stable with sediment d tic concentrations strongly increased at higher temperatures for all sediments probably caused by a stronger organic carbon release and respiration na and k concentrations generally increased at higher temperatures whereas si concentrations increased over experimental runtime only at 70 and partially at 40 c for na and k this indicates desorption as the main source while at higher temperatures the dissolution of silicates may have also contributed to increasing na and k concentrations organic carbon concentrations increased over the entire experimental runtime at 25 40 and 70 c eh values fluctuated but overall they were stable at 300 350 mv within the first week after 1 2 weeks of experimental runtime eh values started to decrease to between 50 and 250 mv with no obvious temperature trend this drop was accompanied by decreasing sulphate concentrations at 70 c in all sediments at 40 c in sediments a c and d and at 25 c in sediment d fe concentrations partially increased at 10 c and d 25 a b and d and 40 c d mn concentration slightly increased at 10 and 25 c with sediments a and c and were increasing stronger for sediment b at all elevated temperatures comparison of circular flow column eluate concentrations of the Î± series after 1 and 8 weeks of circuit operations at 70 c revealed that for most tehms concentration changes were significantly larger in the first week of heating than in the subsequent 7 weeks supplemental fig b17 this can be explained by discontinuous tehm release behaviour 3 1 1 or by relatively fast reaching of steady state conditions v sb and tl concentrations decreased after concentration increases in the first week of heating indicating a subsequent fixation process examining tehm concentrations after the initial week of heating and before the onset of stronger reducing conditions showed that li as mo sb and ba concentrations increased with temperature in all 4 investigated sediments in the circular flow column experiments and the extent was sediment specific fig 2 depending on the sediment used v mn co cu zn sn tl pb and u concentrations increased decreased or went unchanged with increasing temperatures fig 2 ni concentrations decreased with temperature but partially only after a maximum concentration at 25 c fig 2 the elements al cr se sr cd and pb were unaffected by changes in temperature supplemental fig b18 for sediment c which was investigated in both the flow through and the circular flow column tests the direction of concentration changes for the individual elements was equal in both setups however in contrast to the flow through column tests concentrations of co ni cu zn and sn showed a maximum concentration at 25 c instead of 10 c before decreasing with increasing temperatures as several elements were affected this behaviour might be linked to a regulating parameter such as ph which was slightly higher 7 6 in the circular flow than in the flow through column tests 7 4 heated to 25 c 3 1 3 hydrochemical processes regulating tehm concentration changes several tehms released at increased temperatures exist as oxyanions under the respective conditions in the flow through and circular flow column experiments this included the concentration increases of as mo sb in all sediments figs 1 and 2 and v sediment specific fig 2 a preferential release of oxyanions has already been observed bonte et al 2013b and corresponded to the weaker sorption of anions such as arsenate arsenite selenate selenite and silicate at increased temperatures kersten and vlasova 2013 2009a 2009b maji et al 2007 parida and das 1997 this weaker sorption of anions was likely caused by a decrease in the point of zero charge with increasing temperatures predominantly coupled to a change in the dissociation constant of water Ã¡lvarez merino et al 2008 tewari and mclean 1972 and an associated negative enthalpy of surface complexation reactions for anions bonte et al 2014 kersten and vlasova 2009a in contrast individual studies on marine clayey material found decreasing concentrations of arsenate and arsenite at increasing temperatures genÃ§ fuhrman et al 2004 these authors assumed this was due to better accessibility to inner surfaces caused by a widening of the grain structure and accelerated diffusion at higher temperatures which could superpose the weaker sorption of anions in fine grained sediments for cations a decrease in the point of zero charge can cause stronger sorption on variable charge surfaces as reported for cu2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cd2 and co2 by angove et al 1999 echeverrÃ­a et al 2003 rodda et al 1993 this corresponds with the observed decreases in co sediment specific figs 1 and 2 and ni concentrations in all sediments fig 2 with increasing temperatures and reported positive enthalpies of surface complexation reactions for cations bonte et al 2014 changes in ph can cause diverse effects however ph conditions show no general change due to increasing temperatures supplemental fig b19 brons et al 1991 bonte et al 2013b hence the decrease in the point of zero charge appears to be the dominant process a second temperature dependent process affecting tehm concentrations may be the preferential sorption of divalent in exchange for monovalent ions at increased temperatures as has been shown for ca2 mg2 cu2 and ni2 in exchange for k and na by bansal 1982 el batouti et al 2003 ogwada and sparks 1986 and udo 1978 when these studies presented enthalpies for the sorption reactions they reported lower enthalpy values for the sorption of monovalent cations suggesting a similar mechanism as for the exchange between anions and cations as less positively charged monovalent ions were preferentially desorbed although not observable for all of the elements in combination with all examined sediments cations with monovalent speciation tended to show increasing concentrations na and k supplemental fig b1 b6 and b7 li and tl fig 2 while cations with divalent speciation showed rather decreasing concentrations ca2 and mg2 supplemental fig b1 b8 and b9 co2 and ni2 figs 1 and 2 a third potential process controlling tehm concentrations is the reductive dissolution of mn and fe hydr oxides bonte et al 2013b their dissolution is associated with an increase in organic carbon availability and biodegradation at higher temperatures that causes a shift towards stronger reducing conditions including potential sulphate reduction 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 also bonte et al 2013a jesuÃek et al 2013 thus tehms incorporated into or sorbed on mn and fe hydr oxides can be released while newly precipitated sulphides can incorporate or adsorb tehms at the same time and in close spatial proximity bonte et al 2013b kabata pendias 2010 aside from sulphides also carbonates frequently precipitated at increased temperatures can incorporate fe and mn griffioen and appelo 1993 and potentially further tehms associated with fe or mn consequently decreasing concentrations of v sb and tl after the shift towards sulphate reducing conditions in the circular flow column tests 3 1 2 supplemental fig b17 were likely associated with the fixation in or on newly precipitated sulphides or carbonates with ba as a divalent cation decreasing concentrations would be expected katz et al 2013 however ba concentrations increased figs 1 and 2 in contrast to those elements being released by desorption li as mo and sb 3 1 1 continuously released ba fig 1 likely originated from longer lasting mineral dissolution this assumption is supported by observations made at an ongoing geothermally used aquifer with temperatures up to 40 c where ba concentrations were positively correlated with temperature changes garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a given that relatively fast sorption processes were probably already near a steady state in agreement with the work of bonte et al 2013b there was no general correlation between released tehms and sediment characteristics related to sorption of tehms such as bulk fe content or amorphic fe phases for the investigated sediments 3 2 reversibility of temperature induced tehm concentration changes reversibility of tehm concentration changes was investigated with 18 circular flow column tests of the Î² and Î³ series for tehms whose concentrations were affected by increased temperatures li v mn co ni as mo sb ba tl and u 3 1 2 mo showed the lowest 30 and tl the highest 95 overall reversibility with all other elemental reversibilities lying between 47 and 77 fig 3a to investigate whether element specific reversibilities were influenced by the heating temperature sediment or experimental setting reversibilities were displayed separately for these categories element specific reversibilities were averaged for experiments with equal temperatures equal sediments and equal experimental settings and plotted against an overall average fig 3b d average reversibility at 40 c 74 was only slightly higher than at 25 c and 70 c 57 and 59 the element specific deviation in reversibility between the 3 temperatures ranged from 9 tl to 67 u highlighting the importance of element specific differences fig 3b overall no consistent trend between reversibility with temperature was apparent average reversibility in sediment a 65 was only slightly higher than in sediment d 62 average reversibilities of li v mn co and ni were higher in sediment a whereas as mo sb ba tl and u showed a higher average reversibility in sediment d the differences in reversibility between the 2 sediments reached 41 for v but stayed below 10 for mn as sb and tl fig 3c average reversibilities in the Î³ series 69 were higher than in the Î² series 58 only li as and u showed higher reversibilities in the Î² series experiments fig 3d similar reversibilities for the experiments with sediments from which tehms were released in the preceding heating phase Î² series and for those that were not heated previously Î³ series suggests that fixation of tehms due to re cooling was largely independent from the initial release process reversibility of concentration changes with 1 week of re cooling to 10 c after a 1 week phase of heating to 25 40 or 70 c was incomplete for all analysed tehms given the overall complexity of the systems quantifying reversibilities was the main attempt however in relation to main element hydrogeochemistry and the literature there are clues regarding the potential processes limiting reversibility in the Î² series incomplete reversibility might be partially explained by the dissolution of mn or fe hydr oxides due to increased temperatures 3 1 2 and a thermally enhanced aging of remaining fe hydr oxides ford et al 1997 with an associated decline in sorption capacity however this does not explain incomplete reversibilities in the Î³ series as the sediment in contact with the water during the re cooling phase had not been heated based on the equal duration of the heating and re cooling phases in this study slower sorption kinetics at 10 c as opposed to desorption kinetics at elevated temperatures as observed by bruemmer et al 1988 and scheckel and sparks 2001 are a likely explanation for incomplete reversibilities in both series this should be further addressed in future studies by applying a longer re cooling phase and if applicable by measuring a time series of concentrations during the heating and re cooling phases 3 3 evaluation of tehm concentration changes the extent and frequency of pronounced tehm concentration changes were evaluated to identify elements of primary concern for preliminary investigations of utes project development 3 criteria were evaluated first concentration changes between 10 and 70 c in the circular flow column tests normalised to the concentration of the respective element at 10 c which was taken as the initial state were used to assess the extent of relative element specific tehm concentration changes fig 4 blue bars left axis second the same concentration changes normalised to the standard deviation of concentrations measured in circular flow column tests with all 4 sediments tempered to 10 c were used to relate temperature induced changes to the variability standard deviation in the initial state between the different sediments fig 4 yellow bars right axis third a review of increasing or decreasing concentrations at higher temperatures including results published in this context by focussing on the first and second criteria mn tl li sb mo v and as showed comparatively high values in both aspects indicating that these elements show strong temperature effects that exceed variations at ambient temperatures of 10 c however to evaluate which elements should be of primary focus in future investigations all available laboratory and field studies in this context were reviewed bonte et al 2013b garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a jesuÃek et al 2013 saito et al 2016 tehms were assigned to a category from 1 to 5 representing descending relevance in preliminary hydrogeochemical investigations for utes projects table 4 and depending on whether a specific tehm demonstrated sediment specifically or for all sediments increased or decreased concentrations at elevated temperatures or only negligible changes it was noted that field studies are only available for temperatures up to 25 and 41 c whereas laboratory work covered temperatures up to 60 and 70 c in the laboratory study by bonte et al 2013b and in this study as concentrations increased with temperature in all sediments and partially increased already at 25 c in contrast the field studies revealed no evidence for increasing as concentrations garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a saito et al 2016 explanations may include differences in sediment composition lack of data from the initial phase of heating garcÃ­a gil et al 2016a when the strongest tehm concentration changes occur in laboratory experiments 3 1 1 and bonte et al 2013b or an insufficient temperature increase for measurable concentration changes saito et al 2016 furthermore sediments investigated in laboratory experiments are typically disturbed sediments are usually obtained from drillings moved to the laboratory homogenised and placed in columns this process might cause the activation of mineral surfaces and potentially intensifies concentration changes under laboratory conditions this is in contrast to field studies as indicated by the concentration increases in this study s column tests at 10 c compared to the respective site water supplemental fig b20 how results from laboratory investigations are scalable to field conditions in terms of the influence of temperatures up to 70 c on hydrogeochemistry especially for tehm behaviour to our knowledge has not yet been investigated this issue is not further elaborated on here but is addressed in an ongoing project www testum aquifer de which combines a field heat storage test with laboratory experiments with sediment samples from the test site using the currently available dataset as a basis 3 groups of elements category 1 3 table 4 revealed a combined concentration limit for ground or drinking water by inter national regulations supplemental table b1 with increasing concentrations due to elevated temperatures in some of the investigated sediments the first group comprises only as which showed the strongest relative concentration increases at higher temperatures increases that exceeded the standard deviation of as concentrations at 10 c in most of the sediments the second group consisting of v mn and mo still exhibited considerable relative concentration increases at higher temperatures in several sediments that also exceeded the variability of concentrations at 10 c but on average to a lesser extent than as the third group of elements b f cr co sb ba tl and u was released from a limited share of the sediments at increased temperatures and the relative concentration changes only partially exceeded the standard deviation of concentrations measured at 10 c for the fourth group of elements al ni cu zn se cd hg and pb no or negligible concentration increases due to elevated temperature were observed for the fifth group of elements li be p sc ga sr sn la eu ho yb and th there were no concentration limits for ground or drinking water in place which indicates the innocuousness of concentration changes for these elements therefore the elements as v mn mo b f cr co sb ba tl and u should be treated with particular care for preliminary investigations of utes project development however due to the lack of tehm data from high temperature field tests the unproven transferability from the laboratory to the field and the overall limited database this assessment of elements should be continuously verified with data from future laboratory and field pilot studies 3 4 estimated spreading of plumes with increased tehm concentrations around utes facilities during the initial heating phase although there are still uncertainties regarding process parametrisation and transferability of concentration changes from laboratory experiments to field applications the size ratios between an aquifer section used to store heat and potential plumes of increased tehm concentrations were estimated to obtain an assessment concerning their potential spreading this was done for as by calculating the distribution of as concentrations both up and downstream from numerical utes sites the estimated as concentrations were placed in context using a legal threshold value to deduce distances downstream from heat storages potentially affected by critical tehm concentrations depending on site and sediment specific characteristics for the generic boundary conditions of the numerical utes sites examined here the drinking water limit of as 10 Î¼g l table b1 taken as an exemple threshold value would be undercut by 2 sediments with relatively high as discharges 25 or 45 m downstream from the btes field and 200 or 400 m downstream from the ates injection well for sediment a or c fig 5 in cross section these distances are approximately 1 2 or 2 5 ates and 1 8 or 3 btes times larger than the yellow framed 170 m ates or 14 m btes aquifer section used for heat extraction fig 5 as most tehms released in the column tests appeared to originate from a finite pool 3 1 1 this estimation yielded the maximum expected concentrations and distances for initial heat storage cycles which should decline and shrink after the initial operating phase respectively in instances where a heat storage operation is terminated before tehms are completely eluted tehm concentrations should decrease when linked to decreasing temperatures over time as demonstrated in this study for decreasing temperatures over distance although to refine and increase the robustness of such estimations further research is required to test whether longer heating phases or multiple heating and cooling cycles can cause enhanced reductive dissolution or aging of sorbing minerals and an associated decline in reversibility however the performed estimations illustrate that even for sediments with relatively high tehm discharge only narrowly restricted areas with increased tehm concentrations should develop during the initial heating phase 4 conclusions flow through and circular flow column tests with 4 typical anoxic northern german aquifer sediments showed increasing li as mo sb and ba concentrations and decreasing ni concentrations at elevated temperatures in all of the investigated sediments whereas temperature effects on v mn co tl and u concentrations varied sediment specifically apart from ba all these components showing increased concentrations at higher temperatures were temporally released indicating a temperature dependent finite tehm pool which limited the released mass and duration however in the short term elevated temperatures of 70 c caused concentration changes in as v mn li and tl to exceed variations between the sediments at 10 c considerably since these concentration changes varied considerably between the sediments preliminary site specific hydrochemical investigations for planned heat storage sites remain necessary to assess tehm behaviour processes triggered or intensified by a temperature increase that are believed to be largely responsible for the tehm release include a decrease in the point of zero charge and an associated negative enthalpy for surface complexation reactions of anions leading to desorption of tehms present as oxy anions e g vanadate chromate arsenate arsenite molybdate and antimonate preferential desorption of monovalent ions e g li and tl in exchange for divalent e g co and ni ions the reductive dissolution of minerals such as mn and fe hydr oxides whereby potentially further tehms ba are released re cooling down to 10 c demonstrated the tehm release to be element specifically reversible between 30 and 95 the degree of reversibility seemed to be somewhat unaffected by the applied temperature the sediment or the experimental setting if higher kinetic sorption rates at higher temperatures are responsible for incomplete reversibility then higher reversibilities could be presumed in the field with longer contact times in general the observed reversibility of tehm concentration changes allows for estimating distances around heat storage sites affected by increased tehm concentrations as shown for as with a 1d approach based on the experimental data and temperature profiles from existing numerical utes sites allows for the application of active cooling as a countermeasure in cases of an unexpected adverse progression of tehm concentrations will lead to successive redevelopment of initial natural groundwater conditions with reversals to natural ambient temperatures downstream or after the termination of utes operations currently it appears impossible to relate tehm releases due to heating of a sediment to easily obtainable hydrogeochemical parameters as contents of specific metal oxides or sulphides therefore further research in identifying and quantifying the involved processes could enable developing methods for faster preliminary site investigations with limited temporal and financial efforts as well as the development of more detailed process based models for predicting tehm behaviour under varying temperatures together with the verification of transferability of laboratory results to the field this would promote a more widespread application of subsurface heat storages beyond the processes discussed here future evaluation procedures should focus on a balanced consideration of groundwater protection and sustainable use of the geologic underground in this sense and for streamlining of utes authorisation procedures the possibility of assessing the impact area as a subterranean technical facility for which criteria are different than for groundwater and allow time limited deviations from the surrounding area inside the facility should be assessed juridically funding this study is part of the angus
