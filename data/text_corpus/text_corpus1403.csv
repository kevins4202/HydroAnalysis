7015,the evolution of the channel thalweg and pool riffle sequences is a critical feature of morphological adjustments in fluvial systems and might have important effects on aquatic habitat quality channel stability and navigation based on the 220 cross sectional profiles from 2002 to 2016 residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were used to quantitatively analyse the vertical variations and longitudinal distribution of the pool riffle sequences and channel thalweg in the yichang chenglingji reach ycr of the middle yangtze river which consists of the yizhi zhijiang shashi gongan and shishou jianli sub reaches the results showed that the dramatic reduction in the sediment loads following the construction of the three gorges dam tgd has caused significant adjustments in the size morphological diversity and spatial distribution of pool riffle structures in the ycr the average depth of the pools in the yizhi zhijiang reach and the shishou jianli reach overall exhibited a nonlinear growth trend with the average residual depth increasing by 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively however the average residual depth in the shashi gongan reach showed a decreasing trend with a reduction of approximately 1 2 m the longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches contracted to different degrees and the specific percentage of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles total riffle length total sub reach length decreased by 8 9 6 and 5 9 in the three sub reaches from upstream to the downstream in addition the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the shashi gongan reach and shishou jianli reach weakened after the construction of the tgd while the bed topography in the yizhi zhijiang reach became more complex and diverse moreover the pool riffle structures in the ycr were rearranged and distributed regularly following the initiation of the tgd operation although the variation characteristics of the average pool spacing in the three sub reaches were quite different quantitative relationship between the average residual depth and the previous four year hydrological condition was proposed for the three sub reaches based on the delayed response model drm and verified using the measurements from 2013 to 2016 keywords channel thalweg residual depths spatial distribution delayed response model three gorges dam yichang chenglingji reach 1 introduction the channel thalweg is the curve connecting the deepest points of the river and it is a typical and essential feature in riverbed topography summerfield 1991 the temporal and spatial variations of the channel thalweg in fluvial systems are influenced by many natural and artificial factors madej 1999 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 macaire et al 2010 li et al 2017 and have important effects on riverbed stability and navigation conditions pool riffle structures are critical elements of thalweg morphology in alluvial rivers and reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of aquatic habitat lisle 1982 thompson 2001 2012 cao et al 2003 hassan and woodsmith 2004 macvicar and roy 2007a b schwartz and herricks 2007 yi et al 2013 which is of great interest to both ecologists and geomorphologists in the study of river geomorphology pools are generally defined as deep regions with low velocities at low water levels whereas riffles are defined as regions with high velocities and steep water surface slopes at low water levels thus riffles mark the transition zones between successive pools thompson 2001 several methods have been developed to identify pools and riffles in alluvial rivers which are mainly divided into two categories one is on the basis of the flow characteristics yang 1971 knighton 1998 and the other is on the basis of the topographic features of the riverbed leopold et al 1964 o neill and abrahams 1984 lisle 1987 peterson et al 1992 carling and orr 2000 yi et al 2013 for example o neill and abrahams 1984 proposed a bedform differencing technique to identify pool riffle structures in the channel thalweg carling and orr 2000 suggested a zero crossing method to distinguish pools and riffles since the discrimination of the first category of methods is greatly affected by flow conditions the second one is generally considered to be more reliable in scientific research lisle 1987 madej 1999 thompson 2002 yi et al 2013 to eliminate the impact of discharge on the discrimination of pool riffle couplets in different reach scale bedforms lisle 1987 introduced the residual depth concept of ecology into river geomorphology to analyse variations in bed elevation in the channel thalweg the residual depth refers to the elevation difference between a pool and the downstream riffle crest which is equal to the water depth in the channel thalweg when the upstream flow is zero lisle 1987 madej 1999 in this case pools can be classified as the area where the residual depth is greater than zero and the remainder of the riverbed topography can be classified as riffles where the residual depth is equal to zero the residual depth represents the production capacity of a river system under extremely low flow conditions such as the worst water depth condition for fish spawning and is thus a critical feature that characterizes the variance in riverbed topography in both geomorphology and ecology furthermore the method of measuring the residual depth is straightforward and unbiased therefore this parameter has been widely used in the study of pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg lisle 1987 1995 richmond and fausch 1995 madej 1999 cowie et al 2015 hoggard et al 2017 most previous research into channel thalweg evolution has focused on lateral migration xu 1997 jin et al 2000 li et al 2017 however fewer studies have investigated the vertical variation and longitudinal distribution of pool riffle sequences in channel thalwegs rayburg and neave 2008 proposed and tested 12 three dimensional asymmetry indices to evaluate the morphological diversity and complexity of pool riffle structures in alluvial rivers and determined their most effective combination although the location of individual pools and riffles is random in a river system the pool riffle sequences usually present a stable statistical characteristic in space leopold et al 1964 graf 1979 myers and swanson 1997 thompson 2012 harvey 1975 found that pool riffle spacing is correlated with a five year recurrence interval flow and the mean annual floods thompson 2001 proposed a minimum length assumption that will create a minimum pool spacing in addition a large number of studies have suggested that the average pool spacing is between five and seven times the bankfull width in alluvial rivers with a stable distribution of pool riffle structures leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 lofthouse and robert 2008 madej 1999 selected residual depth as a tool to analyse the distribution of the channel thalweg in redwood creek in the northern coast ranges of california and found that the pool riffle sequences had a spatial autocorrelation feature furthermore self formed pool riffle sequences tend to exhibit a certain regularity or self similarity however this spatial self similarity between forced pool riffle sequences is usually poor which means that a random distribution pattern of pools and riffles likely occurs in forced channels human activities including upstream damming and bank revetments can profoundly modify downstream riverbed topography and thus influence the size and frequency of pool riffle structures williams and wolman 1984 yuan et al 2012 dai and liu 2013 lai et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 lv et al 2018 the yangtze river the third longest river in the world was remarkably affected by the three gorges dam tgd since the tgd operation in 2003 considerable hydro morphological adjustments have occurred in the yichang chenglingji reach ycr of the middle yangtze river dai and liu 2013 tang et al 2014 mei et al 2015 2018 yuan et al 2016 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 with substantial suspended sediment being trapped in the tgd mei et al 2015 2018 the downstream sub saturated flow triggered severe channel degradation cwrc 2016 xia et al 2017 and the thalweg elevation presented an obvious down cutting trend dai and liu 2013 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 found that the total area of sandbars in the ycr which were mainly formed by riffle accumulations and floodplain avulsions decreased from 149 km2 to 120 km2 based on remote sensing images from 2002 to 2016 yuan et al 2016 performed an analysis of bed topography and found that riffles in the yichang hankou reach contracted to different degrees following the operation of the tgd which was consistent with the findings reported by tang et al 2014 however most previous studies have been mainly based on qualitative descriptions and little attention has been paid to the transformation of pool riffle structures thus quantitative investigations into the evolution of pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg downstream of the dam under strong scouring conditions are required in this study the ycr was selected as the study area and residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were performed to comprehensively analyse variations in the channel thalweg and the distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the ycr caused by the tgd operation based on 220 profiles that were repeatedly surveyed from 2002 to 2016 the main objectives of the current study are to i calculate the residual depths of the channel thalweg in the ycr from 2002 to 2016 and analyse the variation characteristics of bed topography ii quantitatively analyse the spatial distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the ycr following the tgd operation iii develop quantitative relationships between the average residual depths and the previous hydrological conditions based on the delayed response model drm wu et al 2012 and iv identify the possible influencing factors on the evolution of the pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg and discuss the impacts of previous hydrological conditions on variations in the average residual depth based on the drm 2 study area the yangtze river is the largest river in china and has a total length of 6300 km this river is usually classified into upper middle and lower reaches according to different geographical environments and hydrological characteristics cao and wang 2015 the 408 km long study reach i e the ycr is located between yichang and chenglingji in the middle yangtze river and it is composed of the yizhi zhijiang shashi gongan shishou and jianli sub reaches cwrc 2016 the ycr is located immediately upstream of the middle yangtze river and approximately 44 km downstream of the tgd as shown in fig 1 three diversion branches can be identified in the right bank of the ycr and they link the middle yangtze river to dongting lake xia et al 2017 yu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the ycr covers 220 specified cross sections surveyed by the changjiang water resources commission cwrc with an average spacing between two successive sections of approximately 2 km in this study the ycr is classified into three sub reaches according to different hydrological conditions river patterns and local geology sub reach i is a slightly curved or relatively straight channel and the surface layer of the riverbed in this sub reach is mainly composed of gravel pebbles and sand this sub reach is mainly restricted by stable riverbanks and hills thus the channel geomorphological configuration remains stable with sandbars widely distributed along this sub reach sub reach ii which is located on an alluvial plain is a typical multi branched channel with frequent migrations of mainstream flow and the riverbed consists mainly of moderately fine and fine sand the riverbanks in this sub reach consist mainly of a clay upper layer and a thin sand lower layer xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sub reach iii is a predominately meandering channel with complex pool riffle structures and most riverbanks in this sub reach consist of loose sediments that are often stratified the riverbed consists mainly of fine sand with a median diameter of 0 16 mm cao and wang 2015 cwrc 2016 wang et al 2018 the three hydrometric stations zhicheng shashi and jianli are located approximately 105 198 and 347 km downstream of the tgd respectively fig 1 and these hydrometric stations are representative of the hydrological conditions in each of the three sub reaches to control bank collapse and combat catastrophic floods various bank revetments have been constructed in the ycr and they are mostly concentrated in sub reaches ii and iii according to the available statistics which are incomplete approximately 270 km of the riverbanks have been protected via engineering yu and lu 2008 thus accounting for 66 of the total length of the ycr in general bank revetments restrict the degree of erosion via control of the boundary conditions therefore the bankfull width in the ycr remains stable and large scale bank erosion has basically been controlled xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 residual depth determination and spatial autocorrelation statistical method in this study the residual depths of the channel thalweg along the three sub reaches were determined by the method proposed by lisle 1987 as shown in fig 2 first the longitudinal thalweg profiles of the three sub reaches from 2002 to 2016 were plotted according to the observed data of 220 cross sections then the water depth in the thalweg i e the residual depth was determined and calculated under the assumption that the flow discharge was zero fig 2a in this case areas where the residual depth was greater than zero could be identified as pools and the remainders were considered riffles to determine the distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the bed topography fig 2b finally the characteristics in the three sub reaches including the distribution of residual depths the percentage of longitudinal sub reach length occupied by riffles and the standard deviation of the residual depths could be counted and analysed the standard deviation of the residual depths reflected the inhomogeneity of the variations in the bed elevation and it could be used to evaluate the morphological complexity and diversity of aquatic habitats lisle 1995 madej 1999 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 the residual depth quantitatively characterizes the size of pools and riffles in the bed topography but cannot reflect the spatial distribution of the pool riffle structures to address this gap several analytical methods have been developed which mainly include average nearest neighbor analysis getis ord general g analysis multi distance spatial cluster analysis spatial autocorrelation analysis satellite image analysis and aerial photograph analysis legendre and fortin 1989 madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 xia et al 2017 in general all these methods can evaluate the spatial distribution of topographical points to some extent however the first three of these methods aim at different variables at a certain distance in a specific region and the satellite images and aerial photographs with adequate data length and high accuracy are difficult to obtain for general researchers thus these methods are unsuitable for exploring the spatial relationships between the pools and riffles in different distance classes in view of these above mentioned limitations in this paper the spatial autocorrelation coefficient moran s i was introduced to investigate the spatial distribution of the pool riffle couplets in the ycr legendre and fortin 1989 madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 moran s i can effectively explore and analyse spatial data and test spatial hypotheses and can be specifically expressed as follows 1 i d n s i 1 n j 1 n ω i j y i y y j y i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the residual depth at the points i and j of the thalweg y is the average residual depth of the study reach n is the total number of thalweg points ω i j represents the spatial weight between points i and j which is equal to 1 when the distance between the two points is within d and 0 otherwise and s is the summation of all spatial weights i e s i 1 n j 1 n ω i j the calculated value of moran s i may be positive or negative within the range 1 to 1 positive values indicate that the residual depths between the thalweg points within the distance class d are similar which suggests that these thalweg points tend to exhibit a clustered pattern in space such as riffles and riffles or pools and pools in contrast negative values indicate that the residual depths between thalweg points within the distance class d are clearly different suggesting that these points tend to exhibit a dispersed pattern in space such as pools and riffles an irregularly random spatial pattern of the thalweg points would be expected when the observed moran s i is close to zero tiefelsdorf 2000 however the calculated values of moran s i cannot directly explain the spatial relationships of data points because the statistical significance confidence level of moran s i must also be quantified using an important parameter z score rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 which can be written as follows 2 z i i e i v i where e i is the expected index of i d 1 n 1 and v i is the variance of i d e i 2 e i 2 as a characteristic parameter that comprehensively quantifies the influence weight of each element in i d z i can suggest the spatial pattern of thalweg points and evaluate the statistical significance of this spatial pattern for example if z i is greater than 2 58 or less than 2 58 it indicates that there is a 1 likelihood that this clustered or dispersed pattern could be the result of random chance jackson et al 2009 it should be noted that values of z i greater than 2 58 mean there is a strong spatial correlation in mathematical statistics and a more positive or negative value of z i means that the thalweg points with similar residual depth are more clustered or dispersed therefore the distance corresponding to the maximal value or peak of z i indicates the most active and obvious distance of the thalweg points in the clustered pattern such as pools and pools which also reflects the lag distance of pool riffle sequences in the upstream and downstream i e the average pool spacing in this study madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 jackson et al 2009 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 furthermore the significance test is carried out to examine the validity of these maximal values in different years in this case aiming at the same study area such as the ycr and variables such as the residual depth the distances corresponding to the maximal values of z i in different years can indicate the variation in the average pool spacing since the tgd operation in this study z i was utilized to explore and compare the spatial distribution of thalweg points at different distances in the three sub reaches and 2 58 was selected as the criterion for the significance obtained from the spatial test the calculation distances of all three sub reaches ranged from 3 km to 60 km approximately 1 3 of the longest sub reach length with an interval distance of 1 km 3 2 simulation method for the average residual depth based on the drm the average residual depth represents the water storage capacity of rivers and the average depth of the pools in the bed topography under extremely low flow conditions and is thus an important parameter for evaluating the environmental quality of aquatic habitats therefore the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths under variations in hydrological conditions should be quantitatively simulated a delayed response is an important and common characteristic of fluvial systems during non equilibrium adjustment processes knighton 1998 zheng et al 2014 following disturbances such as the tgd operation downstream channels cannot immediately adjust to the new equilibrium state corresponding to the changed conditions but require a relaxation time to gradually approach equilibrium via scouring and silting changes and other morphological adjustments knighton 1998 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2016 recently wu et al 2012 proposed a general framework for simulating the morphologic response to disturbances based on the assumption that the channel adjustment rate following disruptions is proportional to the differences between its current and equilibrium values 3 dy dt β y y e where y and y e represent the current and equilibrium values of the characteristic variable respectively and β represents the rate of change the following iterative relationship can be derived by integrating eq 3 wu et al 2012 4 y n 1 e β δ t i 1 n e n i β δ t y ei e n β δ t y 0 where n is the total number of time steps and y n is the current value after the nth time step considering that the effect of the initial condition y 0 on y n gradually diminishes over time the influence weight of the initial condition can be adjusted to 1 e β δ t e n β δ t y e 0 which results in the following drm wu and li 2011 lv et al 2018 5 y n 1 e β δ t i 0 n e n i β δ t y ei the key to applying the drm is to determine the equilibrium value y e nevertheless a method of deriving the theoretical solution for the equilibrium average residual depth is not currently available recently lv et al 2018 proposed a semi empirical factor defined as the sediment carrying intensity based on the widely used sediment transport capacity formula proposed by zhang yuan et al 2012 the factor can approximately reflect the sediment carrying capacity of the flow in the ycr which can be expressed by 6 f i q i 3 h i 4 d i 2 where q i h i and d i are the mean discharge mean water depth and median diameter of the suspended sediment in the ith year respectively f i can be used to comprehensively analyse the effects of flow sediment gradation and channel boundary conditions on the channel evolution in the ycr lv et al 2018 in addition the morphodynamic adjustments in the ycr are closely related to the sediment loads during the flood season xia et al 2016 therefore the potential equilibrium average residual depth h rei may be estimated as follows 7 h rei k f i a s fi b k q i 3 h i 4 d i 2 a s fi b where h rei and s fi are the equilibrium average residual depth and mean sediment concentration during the flood season in the ith year respectively several studies have shown that the response of channel evolution in the ycr is closely related to the previous four year n 3 hydrological conditions xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 in view of this we selected the parameters n 3 and δ t 1 a in eq 5 resulting in the following drm for the average residual depth in the ycr 8 h r 1 e β i 0 3 e 3 i β h rei where h ri is the measured value of the average residual depth in the ith year to check the accuracy and applicability of eq 8 the parameters were calibrated and verified with the measurements in 2002 2012 and 2013 2016 respectively 4 results 4 1 distribution of residual depths in the channel thalweg from 1951 until the tgd operation although scour and silt adjustments occurred in local reaches of the ycr in certain periods the whole ycr generally presented a dynamic equilibrium state huang et al 2014 therefore the morphological characteristics in 2002 can serve here as a reference to explore the effects of the dam closure from 2003 on the downstream bed topography degradation patterns caused by the operation of reservoirs can remarkably influence the size frequency and average spacing of downstream pools and riffles lofthouse and robert 2008 thompson 2012 fig 3 shows box plots of the residual depth distribution in the three sub reaches from 2002 to 2016 the average residual depths of sub reaches i and iii presented an overall significant growth trend since the tgd operation p 0 01 specifically the average residual depth of these two sub reaches increased from 4 5 m and 6 6 m in 2002 to 5 9 m and 8 5 m in 2016 fig 4 with an increase of 31 p 0 0019 and 29 p 0 0000 respectively in contrast the average residual depth of sub reach ii demonstrated a decreasing trend over time with a reduction of approximately 23 p 0 0004 from 5 3 m to 4 1 m during 2002 2016 compared with an increase tendency during the pre tgd period from 1990 s to 2002 yu and lu 2008 cwrc 2016 moreover the median and maximum residual depths did not show the same variation trend as the average residual depth the median residual depth of the three sub reaches all presented irregular fluctuations whereas the maximum residual depth in the three sub reaches showed increasing decreasing and irregular fluctuation trends this finding suggests that the entire residual depth distribution in the three sub reaches was varied thus consideration of the distribution pattern of box plots could provide a more comprehensive status compared with the average values alone when analysing the variations in bed topography madej 1999 the relative proportion of the length of riffles versus pools is another essential and critical characteristic of aquatic habitats buffington et al 2002 fig 5 shows the temporal variations in the percentage of longitudinal length occupied by riffles in the three sub reaches in general these percentages in the three sub reaches all presented a decreasing trend p 0 05 following the operation of the tgd which was consistent with the results obtained by many researchers jiang et al 2008 tang et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the specific percentages of longitudinal length occupied by riffles total riffle length total sub reach length decreased from 15 2 13 3 and 13 3 to 7 2 3 7 and 7 4 respectively during the period from 2002 to 2016 fig 5 therefore the riffles are respectively 8 p 0 0000 9 6 p 0 0350 and 5 9 p 0 0143 less of the total length for each sub reach this finding demonstrates that the riffles in all three sub reaches were under intense erosion since the dam closure and the longitudinal length of the riffles decreased while the corresponding measures of the pools increased accordingly with the most obvious channel being the multi branched sub reach ii following the tgd operation the percentage of total channel length occupied by riffles in sub reach ii decreased from 13 3 to 4 1 during the first four years 2002 2006 after which the decreasing rate gradually slowed fig 5 these findings might also indicate an important reason for the decrease in the average residual depth in sub reach ii the inhomogeneity of variations in thalweg elevation can be evaluated by the standard deviation of the residual depths lisle 1995 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 as shown in fig 6 a the standard deviations in sub reaches ii and iii both show a decreasing trend whereas in sub reach i they show a clear increase which suggests that the morphological inhomogeneity diversity of the channel thalweg in sub reaches ii p 0 0003 and iii p 0 0039 weakened while the bed topography in sub reach i p 0 0003 was more complex and diverse following the dam closure after 2010 the adjustment rate of the standard deviations in all sub reaches changed only slightly and flattened which might demonstrate that the morphological diversity of the riverbed was approaching a limit under current hydrological conditions nevertheless the degree of vertical mobility of the channel thalweg would increase under higher average residual depths of the reaches madej 1999 to eliminate this scale effect it is necessary to introduce a dimensionless parameter the inhomogeneity index standard deviation average to compare the morphological diversity at different reach scales the general assumption is that higher index values represent better habitats with increasing morphological diversity as shown in fig 6b the index values of the three sub reaches were all greater than 0 7 and the index of sub reach i was obviously higher than that of sub reaches ii and iii implying that the habitat conditions of all sub reaches were relatively good with the best conditions likely occurring in sub reach i 4 2 spatial autocorrelation characteristics in the channel thalweg fig 7 shows the correlograms of spatial autocorrelation by distance in the study reaches from 2002 to 2016 the main parts of z i in the correlograms were positive implying that the thalweg topography tended to present a clustered pattern in space moreover the values of z i were relatively high at short lag distances approximately 3 5 km in most correlograms and this short distance range indicated the longitudinal length of the adjacent thalweg points with similar residual depths therefore this distance class approximately reflected the average length of a riffle or pool in the pool riffle sequences madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 furthermore this lag distance was so short that it might not be able to guarantee that all points had at least one neighbouring point in the calculation which led to an insufficient statistical significance for the resulting values of z i tiefelsdorf 2000 as the lag distance increased the subsequent d corresponding to the maximal or peak value of z i represented the average spacing between larger bed features that were similar in the upstream and downstream i e the average pool spacing in the pool riffle sequences madej 1999 as presented fig 7a in sub reach i z i gradually increased from 5 km and achieved a larger value of approximately 6 between lags of 20 and 30 km in 2002 which suggested that the thalweg points exhibited an obvious clustered distribution at this distance range besides the maximal z i appeared at 26 km in 2002 with a value that was much larger than 2 58 even though this peak was very close to the values achieved in a range of 20 30 km the significance test for this maximal z i was accepted by the confidence level with a p value much 0 01 fig 8 b meaning that there is a 1 likelihood that this small difference could be the result of noise tiefelsdorf 2000 jackson et al 2009 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 therefore the pool riffle couplets presented the most clustered distribution with an average pool spacing of approximately 26 km in 2002 over time this average pool spacing gradually decreased to 20 km by 2016 p 0 01 indicating that the pools in sub reach i migrated downstream under the strong scouring caused by the tgd operation and that the size and frequency of the pools increased accordingly figs 4 and 7 thus leading to a gradual decreasing trend in the average pool spacing in addition a second extremum of z i during most years appeared in the range of 30 50 km which might be the periodic repetition of the average spacing of 20 26 km however the regularity between z i and the lag distance d in sub reach ii was quite different from that in sub reach i fig 7b the values of d average pool spacing corresponding to the maximal values of z i did not show a decreasing or increasing trend with time but instead fluctuated within 8 11 km from 2002 to 2016 and notably these peaks were all accepted at the 1 significance level fig 8b this finding is not surprising because the energy of the sub saturated flow was mainly dissipated by the lateral erosion of riffles and riverbanks in sub reach ii tang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and thus fewer obvious changes occurred in the longitudinal position of the pools therefore the spatial distribution of the pool riffle sequences remained basically stable in 2002 2016 and the average pool spacing varied only within a small range similar to sub reach i the second extremum of z i during most years was in the range of 25 40 km which was also the artificial repetition of 8 11 km with respect to downstream sub reach iii the self development of pool riffle sequences in this study reach was under severe restrictions prior to the dam closure due to the integrated effects of various natural and human factors such as cut offs sand excavation massive river regulation works and the converging influence of dongting lake xia et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 lv et al 2018 thus an interesting finding is that the values of z i were nearly within the range of 2 58 to 2 58 at different distances except for at a small scale 3 5 km in 2002 implying that the spatial distribution of the bed topography in this sub reach showed poor regularity or randomness prior to the tgd operation this result is also consistent with the conclusions of several previous studies montgomery et al 1995 madej 1999 thompson 2001 2012 that a random spatial pattern would be expected due to the forced development of the pool riffle structures in river systems after the tgd operation from 2003 to 2009 the values of z i gradually increased but no distinct peak appeared in any of the distance classes fig 7c which suggested that the thalweg topography was gradually rearranged in space but a significant average spacing had not yet been formed by 2010 a peak emerged at the lag distance of 11 km although this peak seems a little tenuous visually the result of the significance test with p 0 01 indicates that it is more than just randomness fig 8b furthermore this average pool spacing remained basically stable at 11 km during the following years this variation demonstrates that the bed topography in this sub reach was regularly reorganized during the process of intense erosion caused by the drastic reduction in incoming sediment loads and the topography gradually transformed from a random arrangement to a regular distribution with a stable average pool spacing of 11 km 4 3 simulation of the average residual depth based on the drm in terms of the hydraulic elements of the three study reaches from 2002 to 2016 as shown in table 2 the parameters in eq 8 were determined through the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis using the measurements in 2002 2012 the obtained parameters and verified results are shown in table 3 and fig 9 respectively the parameters of determination for all three sub reaches were similar to unity table 3 moreover the simulation for the average residual depths generally agreed with the measurements at n 3 with r2 values ranging from 0 554 to 0 836 this result shows that the response of the channel geometry to the tgd operation was closely related to the previous four year hydrological conditions thus the findings quantitatively demonstrate that channel evolution lags behind the variations in flow and sediment regimes according to the comparison between the calculated and verified values fig 9 the calculated average residual depths were basically consistent with the observed data in all three sub reaches during the period from 2013 to 2016 implying that the drm eq 8 was adequate for predicting the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths corresponding to the different hydrological conditions 5 discussion in natural fluvial systems the temporal and spatial evolution of the pool riffle structures in channels is generally dominated by upstream hydrological conditions bed material composition longitudinal slope and channel patterns leopold et al 1964 goode and wohl 2007 li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in this section the possible factors affecting the hydro morphological adjustments of the pool riffle couplets in the channel thalweg are discussed 5 1 impacts of variations in flow and sediment regimes since the dam closure in june 2003 the tgd has induced a decline in sediment supply but has scarcely modified the downstream flow regime cwrc 2016 xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 mei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 fig 10 shows the temporal variations in the annual runoff and sediment discharge at the zhicheng shashi and jianli hydrometric stations during 1950 2016 compared with the pre tgd period 1950 2002 the annual runoff has been little affected by the dam closure fig 10a however the annual sediment loads at these three stations dramatically decreased by 91 87 and 80 respectively fig 10b in addition the proportion of water volume in the flood season decreased from 78 1950 2002 to 70 2003 2016 but the sediment transport was still concentrated in the flood season 91 following the tgd operation fig 10c with substantial suspended sediment loads being trapped in the tgd downstream sub saturated flow caused remarkable erosion of the riverbed and the pool riffle structures in the ycr dai and liu 2013 mei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in particular the cumulative erosion volume in the bankfull channel was 1 1 billion m3 from 2002 to 2016 cwrc 2016 lv et al 2018 the pools in sub reach i and iii were extensively scoured and thus the average depth of the pools expanded accordingly fig 4 this scour adjustment is also reflected in the sediment gradation to a certain degree wang et al 2018 the median diameter of the suspended sediment at the zhicheng shashi and chenglingji stations increased from 0 009 0 012 and 0 009 mm 1990 2002 to 0 014 0 024 and 0 164 mm 2016 respectively cwrc 2016 erosion and deposition lead directly to variations in riverbed elevation which can result in further dynamic adjustment of the longitudinal slope of alluvial rivers phillips et al 2005 following the reservoir impoundment the average longitudinal slope of the ycr took on a decreasing trend in response to the intense tgd induced erosion xia et al 2016 a decreased longitudinal slope associated with the enlargement of channels would be expected to decrease the mean flow velocity and then increase the water level during extreme floods such as the 2016 flood mei et al 2018 subsequently extreme flooding would induce the loss of floodplains through extensive erosion which might be also an important justification for the shrinkage of the riffles in the ycr 5 2 impacts of different channel patterns pool riffle structures generally present different morphodynamic characteristics in response to multiple channel patterns knighton 1998 yu and lu 2008 wang et al 2018 owing to the closest position to the dam and straight or slightly curved channel type the pool riffle couplets in sub reach i are naturally more sensitive to downstream sub saturated flow and suffer sustained scouring wang et al 2018 which leads to downstream migration and shrinkage of riffles as well as the increase of the average pool depth figs 4 and 5 however the average residual depth of sub reach iii far from the tgd was clearly higher than that of sub reach i near the tgd because of the soft sandy riverbed figs 1 and 4 which could be easily scoured this finding reveals that the geologic composition of the bed surface might play a major role in controlling the size of pools in the ycr yu and lu 2008 cwrc 2016 contrary to sub reaches i and iii the average residual depth of sub reach ii demonstrates a decreasing trend p 0 01 with a reduction from 5 3 m to 4 1 m during 2002 2016 which has been related to the frequent migrations of the mainstream flow in sub reach ii caused by its multi branched channel type jiang et al 2008 tang et al 2014 chalov and alexeevsky 2015 li et al 2017 during this process the excess stream power of sub saturated flow is continuously consumed through lateral adjustments which induces a reduction in the energy available for vertical erosion this finding is consistent with previous research in which the channel evolution in sub reach ii is characterized by prominent degradation of riffles and lateral bank erosion in local reaches without adequate bank revetments tang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 taking the morphological adjustments of two typical cross sections at jing73 and jing34 in sub reach ii as examples fig 11 over the past 15 years the mainstream flow gradually shifted from the left branch to the right branch at jing73 leading to remarkable deposition in the left branch and erosion in the right branch the thalweg elevation adjusted from 10 m to 15 m accordingly with an increase of 5 m slight vertical erosion occurred in the bed surface at jing34 and the thalweg depth increased by only 2 8 m however the riffle between the two branches was severely scoured and the average width of the riffle was reduced by approximately 258 m furthermore the cumulative retreat width of the concave bank reached 153 m due to the lack of protection by bank revetments with a typical mean erosion rate of 11 m yr being observed therefore the morphodynamic adjustments in this sub reach might be dominated by riffle erosion and lateral channel broadening because of the strong migration intensity according to fig 8 the average pool spacing in sub reaches ii and iii are close and respectively 5 2 7 2 and 8 0 times the bankfull width with the stable pool riffle distribution which generally meets the rules obtained by many scholars leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 lofthouse and robert 2008 however this spacing within sub reach i is higher than that in sub reaches ii and iii at present on the one hand the channel pattern and riverbed geology of sub reach i are quite different from those of the other two sub reaches on the other hand sub reach i is closest to the tgd which implies that the channel geometry required a longer time than the other two sub reaches to adjust to the new equilibrium state corresponding to the tgd induced hydrological conditions these comprehensive impacts place sub reach i under long term and non equilibrium hydro morphological processes thus the average pool spacing in this sub reach fig 8 has not yet stabilized wang et al 2018 but presents a decreasing trend p 0 01 therefore this spacing might decrease further and this slow adjustment process also reflects the delayed response of the channel evolution in the ycr to the tgd operation 5 3 impacts of previous hydrological conditions extensive studies have demonstrated that the delayed response is widespread in channel evolution which suggests that previous hydrological conditions can make a huge impact on current channel morphology wu and li 2011 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 in this study the calculated values of the average residual depths are clearly more accurate with r2 0 56 0 84 when taking the previous four years n 3 conditions into account compared with those r2 0 13 0 27 when only considering the current n 0 flow and sediment regimes fig 12 to concretely quantify the influence weights of previous hydrological conditions we can re write eq 8 as h r 1 e β h r e 3 1 e β e β h r e 2 1 e β e 2 β h r e 1 1 e β e 3 β h r e 0 when n 3 subsequently the impact of each year s conditions can be estimated via the specific percentages of the h r occupied by the right four items as presented in table 4 the mean influence weights of the previous four years are 30 27 23 and 20 respectively indicating that the total weights of the previous hydrological conditions account for 70 furthermore the more recent conditions create a greater influence which is in line with the basic understanding of hydro morphological evolution besides the influence weight of the current year in 2006 34 is maximal even though the difference between it and other current years weights seems relatively small one possible reason for this peak is that 2006 was a typical dry year fig 10 cwrc 2016 so a considerable impact of the current hydrological condition in this year on channel morphology would be expected due to the sudden decreases in the flow and sediment discharges several mathematical methods have been developed to describe the delayed response of the self adjusting processes of alluvial rivers including traditional empirical functions xia et al 2016 2017 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 as well as the recently established drm wu and li 2011 wu et al 2012 for instance xia et al 2016 proposed an empirical relationship between bankfull geometry and the previous five year average fluvial erosion intensity the ratio of the square of flow discharge to sediment concentration in the jingjiang reach of the middle yangtze river which assigned the same influence weight to all previous conditions compared with these empirical functions the drm presented in this study is derived on a theoretical basis and the sediment carrying intensity takes more hydraulic factors into account than does fluvial erosion intensity xia et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2017 with encouraging predictions being observed fig 9 thus the drm can provide a useful reference for future channel regulation and navigation improvement it should be noted that the drm does not quantify the impact of the anti erosion capacity of the riverbed on morphodynamic adjustments in the calculation and this might cause some inadequate predictions and thus require further analysis and optimization the methods presented in this paper including the residual depth determination the spatial autocorrelation statistical analysis and the drm have been shown to be effective in studying channel evolution in the longitudinal direction and they would be potential and promising techniques for extending the analysis to monitor the lateral adjustments in bed topography in the future 6 conclusions the temporal and spatial variations of the channel thalweg and pool riffle structures in the 408 km yichang chenglingji reach ycr which was classified into three sub reaches in this study were comprehensively analysed since the commencement of operation of the three gorges dam tgd based on the 220 cross sectional profiles during the period from 2002 to 2016 the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows i the dramatic reduction in incoming sediment discharge following the tgd operation caused substantial adjustments in the size and morphological diversity of the pool riffle structures in the ycr the average depth of the pools in the yizhi zhijiang reach and the shishou jianli reach exhibited an overall growth trend with the average residual depth increasing by 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively however this value in the shashi gongan reach showed a decreasing trend and presented a reduction of approximately 1 2 m the longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches presented a clear contracting trend and the specific percentages of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles decreased by 8 9 6 and 5 9 from upstream to downstream in addition the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the shashi gongan reach and shishou jianli reach weakened while the bed topography in the yizhi zhijiang reach became more complex and diverse following the dam closure ii after the tgd commenced operation in 2003 the pool riffle structures in the ycr were reorganized and gradually exhibited a certain regular spatial distribution the average pool spacing in the yizhi zhijiang reach remarkably decreased from 26 km to 20 km in 2002 2016 whereas this distance in the shashi gongan reach remained basically stable in the range of 8 11 km with a slight fluctuation however the spatial distribution of the pool riffle structures in the shishou jianli reach showed poor regularity or randomness prior to the tgd operation but a stable average pool spacing of 11 km in the channel thalweg gradually formed through morphological adjustments caused by the changed hydrological conditions since the tgd operation iii the quantitative relationships between the average residual depths and the previous four year hydrological conditions were developed in all three reaches based on the drm these relationships were verified with the measurements in 2013 2016 and would be adequate for predicting the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths corresponding to the different flow and sediment regimes acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program

7015,the evolution of the channel thalweg and pool riffle sequences is a critical feature of morphological adjustments in fluvial systems and might have important effects on aquatic habitat quality channel stability and navigation based on the 220 cross sectional profiles from 2002 to 2016 residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were used to quantitatively analyse the vertical variations and longitudinal distribution of the pool riffle sequences and channel thalweg in the yichang chenglingji reach ycr of the middle yangtze river which consists of the yizhi zhijiang shashi gongan and shishou jianli sub reaches the results showed that the dramatic reduction in the sediment loads following the construction of the three gorges dam tgd has caused significant adjustments in the size morphological diversity and spatial distribution of pool riffle structures in the ycr the average depth of the pools in the yizhi zhijiang reach and the shishou jianli reach overall exhibited a nonlinear growth trend with the average residual depth increasing by 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively however the average residual depth in the shashi gongan reach showed a decreasing trend with a reduction of approximately 1 2 m the longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches contracted to different degrees and the specific percentage of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles total riffle length total sub reach length decreased by 8 9 6 and 5 9 in the three sub reaches from upstream to the downstream in addition the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the shashi gongan reach and shishou jianli reach weakened after the construction of the tgd while the bed topography in the yizhi zhijiang reach became more complex and diverse moreover the pool riffle structures in the ycr were rearranged and distributed regularly following the initiation of the tgd operation although the variation characteristics of the average pool spacing in the three sub reaches were quite different quantitative relationship between the average residual depth and the previous four year hydrological condition was proposed for the three sub reaches based on the delayed response model drm and verified using the measurements from 2013 to 2016 keywords channel thalweg residual depths spatial distribution delayed response model three gorges dam yichang chenglingji reach 1 introduction the channel thalweg is the curve connecting the deepest points of the river and it is a typical and essential feature in riverbed topography summerfield 1991 the temporal and spatial variations of the channel thalweg in fluvial systems are influenced by many natural and artificial factors madej 1999 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 macaire et al 2010 li et al 2017 and have important effects on riverbed stability and navigation conditions pool riffle structures are critical elements of thalweg morphology in alluvial rivers and reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of aquatic habitat lisle 1982 thompson 2001 2012 cao et al 2003 hassan and woodsmith 2004 macvicar and roy 2007a b schwartz and herricks 2007 yi et al 2013 which is of great interest to both ecologists and geomorphologists in the study of river geomorphology pools are generally defined as deep regions with low velocities at low water levels whereas riffles are defined as regions with high velocities and steep water surface slopes at low water levels thus riffles mark the transition zones between successive pools thompson 2001 several methods have been developed to identify pools and riffles in alluvial rivers which are mainly divided into two categories one is on the basis of the flow characteristics yang 1971 knighton 1998 and the other is on the basis of the topographic features of the riverbed leopold et al 1964 o neill and abrahams 1984 lisle 1987 peterson et al 1992 carling and orr 2000 yi et al 2013 for example o neill and abrahams 1984 proposed a bedform differencing technique to identify pool riffle structures in the channel thalweg carling and orr 2000 suggested a zero crossing method to distinguish pools and riffles since the discrimination of the first category of methods is greatly affected by flow conditions the second one is generally considered to be more reliable in scientific research lisle 1987 madej 1999 thompson 2002 yi et al 2013 to eliminate the impact of discharge on the discrimination of pool riffle couplets in different reach scale bedforms lisle 1987 introduced the residual depth concept of ecology into river geomorphology to analyse variations in bed elevation in the channel thalweg the residual depth refers to the elevation difference between a pool and the downstream riffle crest which is equal to the water depth in the channel thalweg when the upstream flow is zero lisle 1987 madej 1999 in this case pools can be classified as the area where the residual depth is greater than zero and the remainder of the riverbed topography can be classified as riffles where the residual depth is equal to zero the residual depth represents the production capacity of a river system under extremely low flow conditions such as the worst water depth condition for fish spawning and is thus a critical feature that characterizes the variance in riverbed topography in both geomorphology and ecology furthermore the method of measuring the residual depth is straightforward and unbiased therefore this parameter has been widely used in the study of pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg lisle 1987 1995 richmond and fausch 1995 madej 1999 cowie et al 2015 hoggard et al 2017 most previous research into channel thalweg evolution has focused on lateral migration xu 1997 jin et al 2000 li et al 2017 however fewer studies have investigated the vertical variation and longitudinal distribution of pool riffle sequences in channel thalwegs rayburg and neave 2008 proposed and tested 12 three dimensional asymmetry indices to evaluate the morphological diversity and complexity of pool riffle structures in alluvial rivers and determined their most effective combination although the location of individual pools and riffles is random in a river system the pool riffle sequences usually present a stable statistical characteristic in space leopold et al 1964 graf 1979 myers and swanson 1997 thompson 2012 harvey 1975 found that pool riffle spacing is correlated with a five year recurrence interval flow and the mean annual floods thompson 2001 proposed a minimum length assumption that will create a minimum pool spacing in addition a large number of studies have suggested that the average pool spacing is between five and seven times the bankfull width in alluvial rivers with a stable distribution of pool riffle structures leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 lofthouse and robert 2008 madej 1999 selected residual depth as a tool to analyse the distribution of the channel thalweg in redwood creek in the northern coast ranges of california and found that the pool riffle sequences had a spatial autocorrelation feature furthermore self formed pool riffle sequences tend to exhibit a certain regularity or self similarity however this spatial self similarity between forced pool riffle sequences is usually poor which means that a random distribution pattern of pools and riffles likely occurs in forced channels human activities including upstream damming and bank revetments can profoundly modify downstream riverbed topography and thus influence the size and frequency of pool riffle structures williams and wolman 1984 yuan et al 2012 dai and liu 2013 lai et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 lv et al 2018 the yangtze river the third longest river in the world was remarkably affected by the three gorges dam tgd since the tgd operation in 2003 considerable hydro morphological adjustments have occurred in the yichang chenglingji reach ycr of the middle yangtze river dai and liu 2013 tang et al 2014 mei et al 2015 2018 yuan et al 2016 xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 with substantial suspended sediment being trapped in the tgd mei et al 2015 2018 the downstream sub saturated flow triggered severe channel degradation cwrc 2016 xia et al 2017 and the thalweg elevation presented an obvious down cutting trend dai and liu 2013 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 found that the total area of sandbars in the ycr which were mainly formed by riffle accumulations and floodplain avulsions decreased from 149 km2 to 120 km2 based on remote sensing images from 2002 to 2016 yuan et al 2016 performed an analysis of bed topography and found that riffles in the yichang hankou reach contracted to different degrees following the operation of the tgd which was consistent with the findings reported by tang et al 2014 however most previous studies have been mainly based on qualitative descriptions and little attention has been paid to the transformation of pool riffle structures thus quantitative investigations into the evolution of pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg downstream of the dam under strong scouring conditions are required in this study the ycr was selected as the study area and residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were performed to comprehensively analyse variations in the channel thalweg and the distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the ycr caused by the tgd operation based on 220 profiles that were repeatedly surveyed from 2002 to 2016 the main objectives of the current study are to i calculate the residual depths of the channel thalweg in the ycr from 2002 to 2016 and analyse the variation characteristics of bed topography ii quantitatively analyse the spatial distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the ycr following the tgd operation iii develop quantitative relationships between the average residual depths and the previous hydrological conditions based on the delayed response model drm wu et al 2012 and iv identify the possible influencing factors on the evolution of the pool riffle sequences in the channel thalweg and discuss the impacts of previous hydrological conditions on variations in the average residual depth based on the drm 2 study area the yangtze river is the largest river in china and has a total length of 6300 km this river is usually classified into upper middle and lower reaches according to different geographical environments and hydrological characteristics cao and wang 2015 the 408 km long study reach i e the ycr is located between yichang and chenglingji in the middle yangtze river and it is composed of the yizhi zhijiang shashi gongan shishou and jianli sub reaches cwrc 2016 the ycr is located immediately upstream of the middle yangtze river and approximately 44 km downstream of the tgd as shown in fig 1 three diversion branches can be identified in the right bank of the ycr and they link the middle yangtze river to dongting lake xia et al 2017 yu et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 the ycr covers 220 specified cross sections surveyed by the changjiang water resources commission cwrc with an average spacing between two successive sections of approximately 2 km in this study the ycr is classified into three sub reaches according to different hydrological conditions river patterns and local geology sub reach i is a slightly curved or relatively straight channel and the surface layer of the riverbed in this sub reach is mainly composed of gravel pebbles and sand this sub reach is mainly restricted by stable riverbanks and hills thus the channel geomorphological configuration remains stable with sandbars widely distributed along this sub reach sub reach ii which is located on an alluvial plain is a typical multi branched channel with frequent migrations of mainstream flow and the riverbed consists mainly of moderately fine and fine sand the riverbanks in this sub reach consist mainly of a clay upper layer and a thin sand lower layer xia et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sub reach iii is a predominately meandering channel with complex pool riffle structures and most riverbanks in this sub reach consist of loose sediments that are often stratified the riverbed consists mainly of fine sand with a median diameter of 0 16 mm cao and wang 2015 cwrc 2016 wang et al 2018 the three hydrometric stations zhicheng shashi and jianli are located approximately 105 198 and 347 km downstream of the tgd respectively fig 1 and these hydrometric stations are representative of the hydrological conditions in each of the three sub reaches to control bank collapse and combat catastrophic floods various bank revetments have been constructed in the ycr and they are mostly concentrated in sub reaches ii and iii according to the available statistics which are incomplete approximately 270 km of the riverbanks have been protected via engineering yu and lu 2008 thus accounting for 66 of the total length of the ycr in general bank revetments restrict the degree of erosion via control of the boundary conditions therefore the bankfull width in the ycr remains stable and large scale bank erosion has basically been controlled xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 residual depth determination and spatial autocorrelation statistical method in this study the residual depths of the channel thalweg along the three sub reaches were determined by the method proposed by lisle 1987 as shown in fig 2 first the longitudinal thalweg profiles of the three sub reaches from 2002 to 2016 were plotted according to the observed data of 220 cross sections then the water depth in the thalweg i e the residual depth was determined and calculated under the assumption that the flow discharge was zero fig 2a in this case areas where the residual depth was greater than zero could be identified as pools and the remainders were considered riffles to determine the distribution of the pool riffle sequences in the bed topography fig 2b finally the characteristics in the three sub reaches including the distribution of residual depths the percentage of longitudinal sub reach length occupied by riffles and the standard deviation of the residual depths could be counted and analysed the standard deviation of the residual depths reflected the inhomogeneity of the variations in the bed elevation and it could be used to evaluate the morphological complexity and diversity of aquatic habitats lisle 1995 madej 1999 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 the residual depth quantitatively characterizes the size of pools and riffles in the bed topography but cannot reflect the spatial distribution of the pool riffle structures to address this gap several analytical methods have been developed which mainly include average nearest neighbor analysis getis ord general g analysis multi distance spatial cluster analysis spatial autocorrelation analysis satellite image analysis and aerial photograph analysis legendre and fortin 1989 madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 xia et al 2017 in general all these methods can evaluate the spatial distribution of topographical points to some extent however the first three of these methods aim at different variables at a certain distance in a specific region and the satellite images and aerial photographs with adequate data length and high accuracy are difficult to obtain for general researchers thus these methods are unsuitable for exploring the spatial relationships between the pools and riffles in different distance classes in view of these above mentioned limitations in this paper the spatial autocorrelation coefficient moran s i was introduced to investigate the spatial distribution of the pool riffle couplets in the ycr legendre and fortin 1989 madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 moran s i can effectively explore and analyse spatial data and test spatial hypotheses and can be specifically expressed as follows 1 i d n s i 1 n j 1 n ω i j y i y y j y i 1 n y i y 2 where y is the residual depth at the points i and j of the thalweg y is the average residual depth of the study reach n is the total number of thalweg points ω i j represents the spatial weight between points i and j which is equal to 1 when the distance between the two points is within d and 0 otherwise and s is the summation of all spatial weights i e s i 1 n j 1 n ω i j the calculated value of moran s i may be positive or negative within the range 1 to 1 positive values indicate that the residual depths between the thalweg points within the distance class d are similar which suggests that these thalweg points tend to exhibit a clustered pattern in space such as riffles and riffles or pools and pools in contrast negative values indicate that the residual depths between thalweg points within the distance class d are clearly different suggesting that these points tend to exhibit a dispersed pattern in space such as pools and riffles an irregularly random spatial pattern of the thalweg points would be expected when the observed moran s i is close to zero tiefelsdorf 2000 however the calculated values of moran s i cannot directly explain the spatial relationships of data points because the statistical significance confidence level of moran s i must also be quantified using an important parameter z score rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 which can be written as follows 2 z i i e i v i where e i is the expected index of i d 1 n 1 and v i is the variance of i d e i 2 e i 2 as a characteristic parameter that comprehensively quantifies the influence weight of each element in i d z i can suggest the spatial pattern of thalweg points and evaluate the statistical significance of this spatial pattern for example if z i is greater than 2 58 or less than 2 58 it indicates that there is a 1 likelihood that this clustered or dispersed pattern could be the result of random chance jackson et al 2009 it should be noted that values of z i greater than 2 58 mean there is a strong spatial correlation in mathematical statistics and a more positive or negative value of z i means that the thalweg points with similar residual depth are more clustered or dispersed therefore the distance corresponding to the maximal value or peak of z i indicates the most active and obvious distance of the thalweg points in the clustered pattern such as pools and pools which also reflects the lag distance of pool riffle sequences in the upstream and downstream i e the average pool spacing in this study madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 jackson et al 2009 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 furthermore the significance test is carried out to examine the validity of these maximal values in different years in this case aiming at the same study area such as the ycr and variables such as the residual depth the distances corresponding to the maximal values of z i in different years can indicate the variation in the average pool spacing since the tgd operation in this study z i was utilized to explore and compare the spatial distribution of thalweg points at different distances in the three sub reaches and 2 58 was selected as the criterion for the significance obtained from the spatial test the calculation distances of all three sub reaches ranged from 3 km to 60 km approximately 1 3 of the longest sub reach length with an interval distance of 1 km 3 2 simulation method for the average residual depth based on the drm the average residual depth represents the water storage capacity of rivers and the average depth of the pools in the bed topography under extremely low flow conditions and is thus an important parameter for evaluating the environmental quality of aquatic habitats therefore the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths under variations in hydrological conditions should be quantitatively simulated a delayed response is an important and common characteristic of fluvial systems during non equilibrium adjustment processes knighton 1998 zheng et al 2014 following disturbances such as the tgd operation downstream channels cannot immediately adjust to the new equilibrium state corresponding to the changed conditions but require a relaxation time to gradually approach equilibrium via scouring and silting changes and other morphological adjustments knighton 1998 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2016 recently wu et al 2012 proposed a general framework for simulating the morphologic response to disturbances based on the assumption that the channel adjustment rate following disruptions is proportional to the differences between its current and equilibrium values 3 dy dt β y y e where y and y e represent the current and equilibrium values of the characteristic variable respectively and β represents the rate of change the following iterative relationship can be derived by integrating eq 3 wu et al 2012 4 y n 1 e β δ t i 1 n e n i β δ t y ei e n β δ t y 0 where n is the total number of time steps and y n is the current value after the nth time step considering that the effect of the initial condition y 0 on y n gradually diminishes over time the influence weight of the initial condition can be adjusted to 1 e β δ t e n β δ t y e 0 which results in the following drm wu and li 2011 lv et al 2018 5 y n 1 e β δ t i 0 n e n i β δ t y ei the key to applying the drm is to determine the equilibrium value y e nevertheless a method of deriving the theoretical solution for the equilibrium average residual depth is not currently available recently lv et al 2018 proposed a semi empirical factor defined as the sediment carrying intensity based on the widely used sediment transport capacity formula proposed by zhang yuan et al 2012 the factor can approximately reflect the sediment carrying capacity of the flow in the ycr which can be expressed by 6 f i q i 3 h i 4 d i 2 where q i h i and d i are the mean discharge mean water depth and median diameter of the suspended sediment in the ith year respectively f i can be used to comprehensively analyse the effects of flow sediment gradation and channel boundary conditions on the channel evolution in the ycr lv et al 2018 in addition the morphodynamic adjustments in the ycr are closely related to the sediment loads during the flood season xia et al 2016 therefore the potential equilibrium average residual depth h rei may be estimated as follows 7 h rei k f i a s fi b k q i 3 h i 4 d i 2 a s fi b where h rei and s fi are the equilibrium average residual depth and mean sediment concentration during the flood season in the ith year respectively several studies have shown that the response of channel evolution in the ycr is closely related to the previous four year n 3 hydrological conditions xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 in view of this we selected the parameters n 3 and δ t 1 a in eq 5 resulting in the following drm for the average residual depth in the ycr 8 h r 1 e β i 0 3 e 3 i β h rei where h ri is the measured value of the average residual depth in the ith year to check the accuracy and applicability of eq 8 the parameters were calibrated and verified with the measurements in 2002 2012 and 2013 2016 respectively 4 results 4 1 distribution of residual depths in the channel thalweg from 1951 until the tgd operation although scour and silt adjustments occurred in local reaches of the ycr in certain periods the whole ycr generally presented a dynamic equilibrium state huang et al 2014 therefore the morphological characteristics in 2002 can serve here as a reference to explore the effects of the dam closure from 2003 on the downstream bed topography degradation patterns caused by the operation of reservoirs can remarkably influence the size frequency and average spacing of downstream pools and riffles lofthouse and robert 2008 thompson 2012 fig 3 shows box plots of the residual depth distribution in the three sub reaches from 2002 to 2016 the average residual depths of sub reaches i and iii presented an overall significant growth trend since the tgd operation p 0 01 specifically the average residual depth of these two sub reaches increased from 4 5 m and 6 6 m in 2002 to 5 9 m and 8 5 m in 2016 fig 4 with an increase of 31 p 0 0019 and 29 p 0 0000 respectively in contrast the average residual depth of sub reach ii demonstrated a decreasing trend over time with a reduction of approximately 23 p 0 0004 from 5 3 m to 4 1 m during 2002 2016 compared with an increase tendency during the pre tgd period from 1990 s to 2002 yu and lu 2008 cwrc 2016 moreover the median and maximum residual depths did not show the same variation trend as the average residual depth the median residual depth of the three sub reaches all presented irregular fluctuations whereas the maximum residual depth in the three sub reaches showed increasing decreasing and irregular fluctuation trends this finding suggests that the entire residual depth distribution in the three sub reaches was varied thus consideration of the distribution pattern of box plots could provide a more comprehensive status compared with the average values alone when analysing the variations in bed topography madej 1999 the relative proportion of the length of riffles versus pools is another essential and critical characteristic of aquatic habitats buffington et al 2002 fig 5 shows the temporal variations in the percentage of longitudinal length occupied by riffles in the three sub reaches in general these percentages in the three sub reaches all presented a decreasing trend p 0 05 following the operation of the tgd which was consistent with the results obtained by many researchers jiang et al 2008 tang et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the specific percentages of longitudinal length occupied by riffles total riffle length total sub reach length decreased from 15 2 13 3 and 13 3 to 7 2 3 7 and 7 4 respectively during the period from 2002 to 2016 fig 5 therefore the riffles are respectively 8 p 0 0000 9 6 p 0 0350 and 5 9 p 0 0143 less of the total length for each sub reach this finding demonstrates that the riffles in all three sub reaches were under intense erosion since the dam closure and the longitudinal length of the riffles decreased while the corresponding measures of the pools increased accordingly with the most obvious channel being the multi branched sub reach ii following the tgd operation the percentage of total channel length occupied by riffles in sub reach ii decreased from 13 3 to 4 1 during the first four years 2002 2006 after which the decreasing rate gradually slowed fig 5 these findings might also indicate an important reason for the decrease in the average residual depth in sub reach ii the inhomogeneity of variations in thalweg elevation can be evaluated by the standard deviation of the residual depths lisle 1995 bartley and rutherfurd 2002 as shown in fig 6 a the standard deviations in sub reaches ii and iii both show a decreasing trend whereas in sub reach i they show a clear increase which suggests that the morphological inhomogeneity diversity of the channel thalweg in sub reaches ii p 0 0003 and iii p 0 0039 weakened while the bed topography in sub reach i p 0 0003 was more complex and diverse following the dam closure after 2010 the adjustment rate of the standard deviations in all sub reaches changed only slightly and flattened which might demonstrate that the morphological diversity of the riverbed was approaching a limit under current hydrological conditions nevertheless the degree of vertical mobility of the channel thalweg would increase under higher average residual depths of the reaches madej 1999 to eliminate this scale effect it is necessary to introduce a dimensionless parameter the inhomogeneity index standard deviation average to compare the morphological diversity at different reach scales the general assumption is that higher index values represent better habitats with increasing morphological diversity as shown in fig 6b the index values of the three sub reaches were all greater than 0 7 and the index of sub reach i was obviously higher than that of sub reaches ii and iii implying that the habitat conditions of all sub reaches were relatively good with the best conditions likely occurring in sub reach i 4 2 spatial autocorrelation characteristics in the channel thalweg fig 7 shows the correlograms of spatial autocorrelation by distance in the study reaches from 2002 to 2016 the main parts of z i in the correlograms were positive implying that the thalweg topography tended to present a clustered pattern in space moreover the values of z i were relatively high at short lag distances approximately 3 5 km in most correlograms and this short distance range indicated the longitudinal length of the adjacent thalweg points with similar residual depths therefore this distance class approximately reflected the average length of a riffle or pool in the pool riffle sequences madej 1999 tiefelsdorf 2000 furthermore this lag distance was so short that it might not be able to guarantee that all points had at least one neighbouring point in the calculation which led to an insufficient statistical significance for the resulting values of z i tiefelsdorf 2000 as the lag distance increased the subsequent d corresponding to the maximal or peak value of z i represented the average spacing between larger bed features that were similar in the upstream and downstream i e the average pool spacing in the pool riffle sequences madej 1999 as presented fig 7a in sub reach i z i gradually increased from 5 km and achieved a larger value of approximately 6 between lags of 20 and 30 km in 2002 which suggested that the thalweg points exhibited an obvious clustered distribution at this distance range besides the maximal z i appeared at 26 km in 2002 with a value that was much larger than 2 58 even though this peak was very close to the values achieved in a range of 20 30 km the significance test for this maximal z i was accepted by the confidence level with a p value much 0 01 fig 8 b meaning that there is a 1 likelihood that this small difference could be the result of noise tiefelsdorf 2000 jackson et al 2009 rasidi et al 2013 chen et al 2015 therefore the pool riffle couplets presented the most clustered distribution with an average pool spacing of approximately 26 km in 2002 over time this average pool spacing gradually decreased to 20 km by 2016 p 0 01 indicating that the pools in sub reach i migrated downstream under the strong scouring caused by the tgd operation and that the size and frequency of the pools increased accordingly figs 4 and 7 thus leading to a gradual decreasing trend in the average pool spacing in addition a second extremum of z i during most years appeared in the range of 30 50 km which might be the periodic repetition of the average spacing of 20 26 km however the regularity between z i and the lag distance d in sub reach ii was quite different from that in sub reach i fig 7b the values of d average pool spacing corresponding to the maximal values of z i did not show a decreasing or increasing trend with time but instead fluctuated within 8 11 km from 2002 to 2016 and notably these peaks were all accepted at the 1 significance level fig 8b this finding is not surprising because the energy of the sub saturated flow was mainly dissipated by the lateral erosion of riffles and riverbanks in sub reach ii tang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and thus fewer obvious changes occurred in the longitudinal position of the pools therefore the spatial distribution of the pool riffle sequences remained basically stable in 2002 2016 and the average pool spacing varied only within a small range similar to sub reach i the second extremum of z i during most years was in the range of 25 40 km which was also the artificial repetition of 8 11 km with respect to downstream sub reach iii the self development of pool riffle sequences in this study reach was under severe restrictions prior to the dam closure due to the integrated effects of various natural and human factors such as cut offs sand excavation massive river regulation works and the converging influence of dongting lake xia et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 lv et al 2018 thus an interesting finding is that the values of z i were nearly within the range of 2 58 to 2 58 at different distances except for at a small scale 3 5 km in 2002 implying that the spatial distribution of the bed topography in this sub reach showed poor regularity or randomness prior to the tgd operation this result is also consistent with the conclusions of several previous studies montgomery et al 1995 madej 1999 thompson 2001 2012 that a random spatial pattern would be expected due to the forced development of the pool riffle structures in river systems after the tgd operation from 2003 to 2009 the values of z i gradually increased but no distinct peak appeared in any of the distance classes fig 7c which suggested that the thalweg topography was gradually rearranged in space but a significant average spacing had not yet been formed by 2010 a peak emerged at the lag distance of 11 km although this peak seems a little tenuous visually the result of the significance test with p 0 01 indicates that it is more than just randomness fig 8b furthermore this average pool spacing remained basically stable at 11 km during the following years this variation demonstrates that the bed topography in this sub reach was regularly reorganized during the process of intense erosion caused by the drastic reduction in incoming sediment loads and the topography gradually transformed from a random arrangement to a regular distribution with a stable average pool spacing of 11 km 4 3 simulation of the average residual depth based on the drm in terms of the hydraulic elements of the three study reaches from 2002 to 2016 as shown in table 2 the parameters in eq 8 were determined through the multivariate nonlinear regression analysis using the measurements in 2002 2012 the obtained parameters and verified results are shown in table 3 and fig 9 respectively the parameters of determination for all three sub reaches were similar to unity table 3 moreover the simulation for the average residual depths generally agreed with the measurements at n 3 with r2 values ranging from 0 554 to 0 836 this result shows that the response of the channel geometry to the tgd operation was closely related to the previous four year hydrological conditions thus the findings quantitatively demonstrate that channel evolution lags behind the variations in flow and sediment regimes according to the comparison between the calculated and verified values fig 9 the calculated average residual depths were basically consistent with the observed data in all three sub reaches during the period from 2013 to 2016 implying that the drm eq 8 was adequate for predicting the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths corresponding to the different hydrological conditions 5 discussion in natural fluvial systems the temporal and spatial evolution of the pool riffle structures in channels is generally dominated by upstream hydrological conditions bed material composition longitudinal slope and channel patterns leopold et al 1964 goode and wohl 2007 li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in this section the possible factors affecting the hydro morphological adjustments of the pool riffle couplets in the channel thalweg are discussed 5 1 impacts of variations in flow and sediment regimes since the dam closure in june 2003 the tgd has induced a decline in sediment supply but has scarcely modified the downstream flow regime cwrc 2016 xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 mei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 fig 10 shows the temporal variations in the annual runoff and sediment discharge at the zhicheng shashi and jianli hydrometric stations during 1950 2016 compared with the pre tgd period 1950 2002 the annual runoff has been little affected by the dam closure fig 10a however the annual sediment loads at these three stations dramatically decreased by 91 87 and 80 respectively fig 10b in addition the proportion of water volume in the flood season decreased from 78 1950 2002 to 70 2003 2016 but the sediment transport was still concentrated in the flood season 91 following the tgd operation fig 10c with substantial suspended sediment loads being trapped in the tgd downstream sub saturated flow caused remarkable erosion of the riverbed and the pool riffle structures in the ycr dai and liu 2013 mei et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in particular the cumulative erosion volume in the bankfull channel was 1 1 billion m3 from 2002 to 2016 cwrc 2016 lv et al 2018 the pools in sub reach i and iii were extensively scoured and thus the average depth of the pools expanded accordingly fig 4 this scour adjustment is also reflected in the sediment gradation to a certain degree wang et al 2018 the median diameter of the suspended sediment at the zhicheng shashi and chenglingji stations increased from 0 009 0 012 and 0 009 mm 1990 2002 to 0 014 0 024 and 0 164 mm 2016 respectively cwrc 2016 erosion and deposition lead directly to variations in riverbed elevation which can result in further dynamic adjustment of the longitudinal slope of alluvial rivers phillips et al 2005 following the reservoir impoundment the average longitudinal slope of the ycr took on a decreasing trend in response to the intense tgd induced erosion xia et al 2016 a decreased longitudinal slope associated with the enlargement of channels would be expected to decrease the mean flow velocity and then increase the water level during extreme floods such as the 2016 flood mei et al 2018 subsequently extreme flooding would induce the loss of floodplains through extensive erosion which might be also an important justification for the shrinkage of the riffles in the ycr 5 2 impacts of different channel patterns pool riffle structures generally present different morphodynamic characteristics in response to multiple channel patterns knighton 1998 yu and lu 2008 wang et al 2018 owing to the closest position to the dam and straight or slightly curved channel type the pool riffle couplets in sub reach i are naturally more sensitive to downstream sub saturated flow and suffer sustained scouring wang et al 2018 which leads to downstream migration and shrinkage of riffles as well as the increase of the average pool depth figs 4 and 5 however the average residual depth of sub reach iii far from the tgd was clearly higher than that of sub reach i near the tgd because of the soft sandy riverbed figs 1 and 4 which could be easily scoured this finding reveals that the geologic composition of the bed surface might play a major role in controlling the size of pools in the ycr yu and lu 2008 cwrc 2016 contrary to sub reaches i and iii the average residual depth of sub reach ii demonstrates a decreasing trend p 0 01 with a reduction from 5 3 m to 4 1 m during 2002 2016 which has been related to the frequent migrations of the mainstream flow in sub reach ii caused by its multi branched channel type jiang et al 2008 tang et al 2014 chalov and alexeevsky 2015 li et al 2017 during this process the excess stream power of sub saturated flow is continuously consumed through lateral adjustments which induces a reduction in the energy available for vertical erosion this finding is consistent with previous research in which the channel evolution in sub reach ii is characterized by prominent degradation of riffles and lateral bank erosion in local reaches without adequate bank revetments tang et al 2014 xia et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 wang et al 2018 taking the morphological adjustments of two typical cross sections at jing73 and jing34 in sub reach ii as examples fig 11 over the past 15 years the mainstream flow gradually shifted from the left branch to the right branch at jing73 leading to remarkable deposition in the left branch and erosion in the right branch the thalweg elevation adjusted from 10 m to 15 m accordingly with an increase of 5 m slight vertical erosion occurred in the bed surface at jing34 and the thalweg depth increased by only 2 8 m however the riffle between the two branches was severely scoured and the average width of the riffle was reduced by approximately 258 m furthermore the cumulative retreat width of the concave bank reached 153 m due to the lack of protection by bank revetments with a typical mean erosion rate of 11 m yr being observed therefore the morphodynamic adjustments in this sub reach might be dominated by riffle erosion and lateral channel broadening because of the strong migration intensity according to fig 8 the average pool spacing in sub reaches ii and iii are close and respectively 5 2 7 2 and 8 0 times the bankfull width with the stable pool riffle distribution which generally meets the rules obtained by many scholars leopold et al 1964 keller and melhorn 1978 lofthouse and robert 2008 however this spacing within sub reach i is higher than that in sub reaches ii and iii at present on the one hand the channel pattern and riverbed geology of sub reach i are quite different from those of the other two sub reaches on the other hand sub reach i is closest to the tgd which implies that the channel geometry required a longer time than the other two sub reaches to adjust to the new equilibrium state corresponding to the tgd induced hydrological conditions these comprehensive impacts place sub reach i under long term and non equilibrium hydro morphological processes thus the average pool spacing in this sub reach fig 8 has not yet stabilized wang et al 2018 but presents a decreasing trend p 0 01 therefore this spacing might decrease further and this slow adjustment process also reflects the delayed response of the channel evolution in the ycr to the tgd operation 5 3 impacts of previous hydrological conditions extensive studies have demonstrated that the delayed response is widespread in channel evolution which suggests that previous hydrological conditions can make a huge impact on current channel morphology wu and li 2011 wu et al 2012 xia et al 2016 lv et al 2018 in this study the calculated values of the average residual depths are clearly more accurate with r2 0 56 0 84 when taking the previous four years n 3 conditions into account compared with those r2 0 13 0 27 when only considering the current n 0 flow and sediment regimes fig 12 to concretely quantify the influence weights of previous hydrological conditions we can re write eq 8 as h r 1 e β h r e 3 1 e β e β h r e 2 1 e β e 2 β h r e 1 1 e β e 3 β h r e 0 when n 3 subsequently the impact of each year s conditions can be estimated via the specific percentages of the h r occupied by the right four items as presented in table 4 the mean influence weights of the previous four years are 30 27 23 and 20 respectively indicating that the total weights of the previous hydrological conditions account for 70 furthermore the more recent conditions create a greater influence which is in line with the basic understanding of hydro morphological evolution besides the influence weight of the current year in 2006 34 is maximal even though the difference between it and other current years weights seems relatively small one possible reason for this peak is that 2006 was a typical dry year fig 10 cwrc 2016 so a considerable impact of the current hydrological condition in this year on channel morphology would be expected due to the sudden decreases in the flow and sediment discharges several mathematical methods have been developed to describe the delayed response of the self adjusting processes of alluvial rivers including traditional empirical functions xia et al 2016 2017 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 as well as the recently established drm wu and li 2011 wu et al 2012 for instance xia et al 2016 proposed an empirical relationship between bankfull geometry and the previous five year average fluvial erosion intensity the ratio of the square of flow discharge to sediment concentration in the jingjiang reach of the middle yangtze river which assigned the same influence weight to all previous conditions compared with these empirical functions the drm presented in this study is derived on a theoretical basis and the sediment carrying intensity takes more hydraulic factors into account than does fluvial erosion intensity xia et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2017 with encouraging predictions being observed fig 9 thus the drm can provide a useful reference for future channel regulation and navigation improvement it should be noted that the drm does not quantify the impact of the anti erosion capacity of the riverbed on morphodynamic adjustments in the calculation and this might cause some inadequate predictions and thus require further analysis and optimization the methods presented in this paper including the residual depth determination the spatial autocorrelation statistical analysis and the drm have been shown to be effective in studying channel evolution in the longitudinal direction and they would be potential and promising techniques for extending the analysis to monitor the lateral adjustments in bed topography in the future 6 conclusions the temporal and spatial variations of the channel thalweg and pool riffle structures in the 408 km yichang chenglingji reach ycr which was classified into three sub reaches in this study were comprehensively analysed since the commencement of operation of the three gorges dam tgd based on the 220 cross sectional profiles during the period from 2002 to 2016 the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows i the dramatic reduction in incoming sediment discharge following the tgd operation caused substantial adjustments in the size and morphological diversity of the pool riffle structures in the ycr the average depth of the pools in the yizhi zhijiang reach and the shishou jianli reach exhibited an overall growth trend with the average residual depth increasing by 1 4 m and 1 9 m respectively however this value in the shashi gongan reach showed a decreasing trend and presented a reduction of approximately 1 2 m the longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches presented a clear contracting trend and the specific percentages of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles decreased by 8 9 6 and 5 9 from upstream to downstream in addition the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the shashi gongan reach and shishou jianli reach weakened while the bed topography in the yizhi zhijiang reach became more complex and diverse following the dam closure ii after the tgd commenced operation in 2003 the pool riffle structures in the ycr were reorganized and gradually exhibited a certain regular spatial distribution the average pool spacing in the yizhi zhijiang reach remarkably decreased from 26 km to 20 km in 2002 2016 whereas this distance in the shashi gongan reach remained basically stable in the range of 8 11 km with a slight fluctuation however the spatial distribution of the pool riffle structures in the shishou jianli reach showed poor regularity or randomness prior to the tgd operation but a stable average pool spacing of 11 km in the channel thalweg gradually formed through morphological adjustments caused by the changed hydrological conditions since the tgd operation iii the quantitative relationships between the average residual depths and the previous four year hydrological conditions were developed in all three reaches based on the drm these relationships were verified with the measurements in 2013 2016 and would be adequate for predicting the dynamic adjustments of the average residual depths corresponding to the different flow and sediment regimes acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and development program

7016,this study presents an investigation of probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables including precipitation temperature and soil moisture and the potential links to large scale atmospheric circulation over baden württemberg southwest germany first the joint dependence between seasonal streamflow and hydroclimatic variables was established by using copulas on the basis of the joint dependence structure we estimated the probabilities of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events conditioned upon two different scenarios high and low of hydroclimatic variables for various seasons over the study area the results indicate that both precipitation and soil moisture are positively related to the streamflow variation in baden württemberg for each season and strongly impact the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high streamflow events temperature tends to have less impact on the streamflow variation and an inverse connection between streamflow and temperature is found in spring and summer then the connections between streamflow variability and large scale atmospheric circulation in summer and winter were explored by using composite analysis although the atmospheric circulation patterns vary in each season it can be found that in summer high streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg are related to a cyclonic activity over central europe while low streamflow anomalies are linked to anticyclonic patterns over western ireland the high streamflow anomalies in winter are strongly impacted by the westerlies that play an important role in favoring warm and moist airstreams from the atlantic ocean towards the study area while an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies the presented probabilistic methodology could also be applied in other regions worldwide keywords streamflow hydroclimatic variables probability atmospheric circulation baden württemberg 1 introduction climatic variables such as precipitation and air temperature have been widely recognized as key parameters in the hydrological cycle also soil moisture affects the process of precipitation transformation into infiltration and streamflow and thus largely determines the streamflow behavior and variability aubert et al 2003 understanding the linkages between hydroclimatic variables e g precipitation air temperature and soil moisture and streamflow is significant for water resources planning and adapting appropriate practices to deal with the drought and flood risk under extreme conditions an improved knowledge about these relationships may also assist the further development of hydrological modeling in the past decades numerous studies have focused on investigating the relationships between the variability in streamflow and changes in the hydroclimatic driving phenomena over different parts of the world on the one hand some researchers focused on employing deterministic correlation coefficient and linear statistical approaches such as multiple linear regressions to examine the influence of regional hydroclimatic variables on streamflow and the potential links between them brocca et al 2008 cayan et al 1993 cunderlik and burn 2004 ficklin et al 2009 kletti and stefan 1997 penna et al 2011 stewart et al 2005 on the other hand many scholars investigated the hydrological response to climate and environment variability based on conceptual or physically based hydrological models and also assessed the sensitivity of the streamflow to changes in the hydroclimatic drivers hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 jha et al 2004 menzel et al 2006 zehe et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 however few studies have focused on building up the joint probabilistic dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic factors and identifying the conditional likelihoods of prolonged high streamflow events and hydrological drought under varying hydroclimatic scenarios particularly regarding the seasonal variation this probability based information would be of great value for water resources planning and prevention to identify the joint probabilistic dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables copulas could be an ideal tool the main advantages of copulas include allowing the dependence to be constructed independently from the marginal distributions and modeling different marginal distributions without any transformations genest and favre 2007 during the past decade copulas have gained popularity and there are increasing applications of copulas in multivariate hydrological modeling for instance in the field of flood frequency analysis single variable analysis has been widely used in the past while it has the problem in handling the multivariate stochastic flood characteristics such as volume peak and duration of the flood hydrograph bobée and rasmussen 1994 copulas provide an effective solution to model the joint dependence structure of uncertain multiple flood characteristics reddy and ganguli 2012 in order to improve the estimation of design flood hydrograph requena et al 2013 introduced a bivariate copula model to simulate the joint distribution of flood peak and volume and to obtain the return periods linked to the risk of dam overtopping rainfall intensity durationfrequency idf curves are very important in floodplain management and urban drainage design however in order to model joint distributions of rainfall variables including intensity depth and duration many previous studies assumed these variables are independent have the same marginal distribution usually assumed to be normal distribution or transformed to normal distribution singh and zhang 2007 developed copula based idf curves by relaxing such assumptions in addition copulas offer an effective tool in other hydrological applications such as return periods of drought events hydrological prediction drought identification and geostatistical interpolation bárdossy and li 2008 genest and favre 2007 liu et al 2015a madadgar and moradkhani 2013 reddy and ganguli 2012 salvadori and de michele 2004 song and singh 2010 tong et al 2015 zhang and singh 2007 wang et al 2012 large scale atmospheric circulation is known to strongly affect precipitation variability and thus the changes in streamflow there have been many studies focusing on the changes in atmospheric dynamics and their links to regional hydrological processes and extreme flow events in europe jacobeit et al 2003 detected the connections between flood events and atmospheric circulation patterns for the past 500 years in central europe they described how some specific atmospheric circulation modes as a dynamic factor significantly influence the incidence of flood events bardossy and filiz 2005 identified the flood producing atmospheric circulation patterns cps by means of large scale pressure fields over some meso scale catchments in france and spain bouwer et al 2006 quantitatively assessed the impact of variation in atmospheric circulation on the changes in winter streamflow over northwestern europe they reported that the frequency of the westerlies over europe could be a useful reference for investigating climate change impacts on streamflow in northwest europe ionita et al 2012 examined the streamflow in the rhine river and the links to large scale climate anomaly patterns in spring and autumn using composite analysis and concluded that the variability of the atmospheric circulation pattern significantly affects the precipitation fluctuations and rhine streamflow variability in both seasons the current study focuses on investigating how streamflow and hydroclimatic factors are coupled in baden württemberg southwest germany particularly focusing on the likelihoods of prolonged high streamflow events and hydrological drought under different hydroclimatic conditions several previous studies have provided valuable knowledge about the linear connections e g the correlation analysis between the streamflow variability and hydroclimatic changes over some specific regions or basins in baden württemberg e g huang et al 2015 schröter et al 2015 warrach sagi et al 2008 however little previous work has been done to probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic forcings and the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high streamflow events under different hydroclimatic conditions in baden württemberg the current study attempts to quantify the seasonal probabilistic dependence structure between streamflow and hydroclimatic factors including precipitation temperature and soil moisture over baden württemberg by using copulas the established dependence structure allows the evaluation of the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events conditioned on different hydroclimatic scenarios moreover large scale atmospheric circulation imposes an important impact on the precipitation over this area and thus strongly affects the hydrological extremes this study also seeks to explore the possible connections between streamflow in baden württemberg and large scale atmospheric circulation this analysis may provide additional information to understand the streamflow variability based on prior knowledge from varying atmospheric circulation patterns 2 methodology the proposed framework in the study consists of three components the first one involves building up joint dependence structure of streamflow and hydroclimatic variables based on copula the second part is the conditional simulations and the final part aims to evaluate the probabilistic difference with given conditions additionally the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis was used here to identify dominant spatial modes of streamflow over the study area 2 1 probabilistic measures of the dependence between streamflow and different hydroclimatic variables a copula is simply described as a joint distribution function from multiple variables laux et al 2011 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 sklar 1959 based on sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a bivariate distribution f x y x y for variables x and y can be expressed by a copula that satisfies 1 f x y c f x x f y y c u 1 u 2 c is called a copula which is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf and its form reflects the joint dependence structure u 1 f x x and u 2 f y y modeling the joint dependence structure requires a well fitted marginal distribution of each variable to determine the best fit distribution of the variables four common theoretical probability distributions which are commonly used in hydroclimatology were compared normal gamma weibull and lognormal kao and govindaraju 2010 khedun et al 2014 madadgar et al 2014 the parameters of each distribution were estimated by the maximum likelihood method gyasi agyei 2013 to determine the appropriateness of the theoretical distributions and discriminate between them the chi squared goodness of fit was employed madadgar and moradkhani 2013 massey 1951 this test returns the p value which should be greater than the significance level 5 to accept the null hypothesis the most appropriate distribution was determined by the smallest statistics the corresponding p value should be greater than the significance level as well from the chi squared test after obtaining the best fitted marginal distributions an approximate bivariate copula is expected to join the margins and construct the joint dependence in this study several commonly used copulas were considered such as gaussian clayton gumbel frank and joe the details of these copulas used in the current study are found in liu et al 2015b to select the copula that best models the dependence of the given data a parametric bootstrapping goodness of fit test was used genest and rémillard 2008 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 the goodness of fit test is called the cramér von mises test which computes the cramér von mises statistic s n as a measure of the distance between the empirical and parametric copulas given by 2a s n 0 1 k δ c u 2 d c u u u 1 u 2 u k 0 1 k 2b δ c n c emp c θ where cemp and cθ are the empirical and parametric copulas fitted to the given data with the size of n the p values associated with the test statistics were calculated by the bootstrap sampling procedure using the monte carlo approach genest and favre 2007 the null hypothesis h 0 c emp c θ is accepted when the p value is above a predefined significance level of 5 otherwise it is rejected and the copula would not be a good selection for the considered significance level among several copulas the one with the smallest s n and highest p value greater than the significant level as well will be considered the best fitted copula madadgar and moradkhani 2013 once the copula based joint distribution has been achieved the conditional distributions of x under given y can be generated and thus the conditional distribution can be computed the conditional non exceedance distribution of x x given y y can be given as follows 3 f x y y x y c x y x y f y y given the conditional probability one can also gain the probability of attaining the required streamflow or the likelihood of hydrological drought or prolonged high streamflow event under the given conditions of hydroclimatic variables in fact an f x x event could be defined as dangerous if f x x exceeds or never exceeds a certain threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 the current study deems streamflow to be under a streamflow deficit event here indicating a hydrological drought event if the corresponding streamflow value is less than the 20th percentile of streamflow cdf denoted as f x x deficit 20 also it is possible to obtain the conditional exceedance distribution of x x given y y by computing f x x y y x y 1 c x y x y f y y this study considers streamflow under a high streamflow event when the corresponding streamflow value is greater than the 80th percentile of streamflow cdf denoted as f x x flood 80 this study focuses on two given scenarios of hydroclimatic variables events at the 30th and 70th quantiles of hydroclimatic variables denoted as f y y 30 and f y y 70 it should be mentioned that one could conduct an experiment with any scenarios of hydroclimatic variables with self defined streamflow deficit thresholds as long as the copula based joint distribution has been constructed based on the joint distribution one can use the probabilistic difference between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables to describe the sensitivity of streamflow to different hydroclimatic variables the probabilistic difference is given as follows 4 difference f x y y 1 x y f x y y 2 x y d x 2 2 empirical orthogonal function method the eof technique is a statistical and diagnostic tool to extract the spatial and temporal characteristics modes which are ordered according to their representations of data variance and the first leading modes generally account for most of the total variance su et al 2008 it has been widely used in describing patterns of atmospheric oceanic and climatic research over a spatial area eof analysis enables one to select the dominant modes of variability while largely reducing the data space the output of eof analysis includes spatial patterns eofs temporal series principal components pcs and eigenvalues liu et al 2013 su et al 2008 tatli and türkes 2011 the eofs can be plotted as vector maps to identity the spatial modes by presenting which regions are closely related or unrelated according to correlation coefficients the pcs of each mode quantify the amplitude the temporal series of each mode regarding the variable considered the modes are ranked by their significance to the overall variability according to the eigenvalues the leading modes can accouter for most of the original variability su et al 2008 3 study area and datasets baden württemberg is a federal state located in southwest germany with an area of 35 752 km2 the geography varies greatly across this state for example germany s largest continuous forest area is located in the black forest in western baden württemberg apart from the black forest the swabian alp is another important mountain range extending from southwest to northeast of baden württemberg the main rivers over this state include the rhine the neckar a tributary of the rhine and the danube the climate of baden württemberg features the typical temperate oceanic conditions of the higher middle latitudes the mean annual temperature is around 8 1 c with a range between 3 3 c in the highest part of the black forest approximately 1500 m and about 10 4 c in the rhine valley the mean annual precipitation is between 660 mm and 2200 mm and is spread throughout the entire year the monthly streamflow anomalies from 27 streamflow gauges in baden württemberg during the period 1948 2003 were constructed using daily discharge data provided by lubw the federal agency for the environment measurements and nature protection the locations of the selected streamflow gauges are shown in fig 1 table 1 gives some basic statistical information about the streamflow data these stations are independent from non nested catchments and were selected based on careful analysis of possible human impacts on streamflow variability i e the chosen gauges with their catchments have few or minor human impacts the dominant patterns of the variability of monthly streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg were examined using the eof or principal component analysis the monthly precipitation monthly temperature and modeled monthly soil moisture data used in this study were derived from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc datasets with a spatial resolution of 0 5 available from https data noaa gov dataset the various hydroclimatic variables used here are the input air temperature and precipitation and output soil moisture from a global land model which is a one layer bucket water balance model a detailed description of this model and how this dataset was produced can be found in huang et al 1996 and fan and van den dool 2004 these gridded products have been widely used for many regional and global hydroclimatic applications e g fan and van den dool 2008 fujinami et al 2015 syed et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 for the analysis of atmospheric circulation this study used the geopotential height anomalies z850 the zonal and the meridional wind u and v wind components at 850 hpa on a 2 5 2 5 grid during the period 1948 2003 from the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar r1 dataset kalnay et al 1996 4 results and discussion 4 1 eof patterns table 2 shows the proportion of the total variance explained by the first five eofs regarding streamflow anomalies from the 27 selected streamflow gauges surprisingly it can be found that the first eof can explain almost 76 of the total variability this indicates that the complexity of the spatial pattern of streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg has been largely explained by the single first eof spatial structure fig 2 illustrates spatial patterns of streamflow anomalies for the first four eofs interpolated by the kriging method according to the distribution of eof1 pattern the strong spatially coherent areas characterized by the correlation coefficients over 0 7 cover most of the study area indicating that a good representation of data variance has been extracted by eof1 mode however the second mode eof2 only accounts for 6 of the total variance and less variance is explained for the other two eof modes which have also weak even negative correlation coefficients as compared to eof1 given that the first eof of streamflow has explained the majority of the total variance we used the corresponding monthly time series pc1 of the first eof to represent the time series of streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg 4 2 probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables we first examined the joint dependence structure between streamflow pc1 values and hydroclimatic variables then it is capable to identify the conditional probability of streamflow under different scenarios of hydroclimatic variables based on the established dependence structure the joint dependence structure between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables in different seasons was constructed by a proper bivariate copula function through joining their marginal distributions table 3 presents the chi squared statistics of theoretical distributions for different variables in each season and their log likelihood values the choice of the theoretical distributions for each case was determined by their chi squared statistics afterwards the cramér von mises test was used to test the goodness of fit of the copulas as mentioned in section 2 1 table 4 gives the goodness of fit statistics s n of the cramér von mises test for the dependence of streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables i e precipitation temperature and soil moisture for each season it can be seen that the best fitted copula varies among different cases based on the best fitted copula we can model the joint cdf of streamflow and different hydroclimatic variables in four seasons once the dependence structure is built up the conditional distributions of streamflow conditioned upon two scenarios i e f y y 30 and f y y 70 of explanatory variables e g precipitation air temperature and soil moisture can be obtained using eq 3 fig 3 indicates the conditional distributions of streamflow under two given scenarios of the hydroclimatic variables in different seasons in addition it is also possible to gain the probabilities the intersections between the vertical line and two solid curves of streamflow deficit events regarding a certain streamflow threshold f x x deficit 20 given the two precipitation conditions in fig 3 this value helps us to know about the probability of occurring hydrological droughts with respect to the given streamflow thresholds and smaller values mean a lower probability for precipitation the likelihoods of occurring hydrological droughts in different seasons are generally around 10 30 under the low precipitation scenario f y 30 the increment of precipitation i e under the precipitation scenario f y 70 indeed has a positive effect on reducing the likelihood of drought the probability close to zero this difference between the two curves of conditional distributions also suggests that streamflow in this study area is very sensitive to the precipitation in each season it can be noted that in spring and summer the likelihood of occurring hydrological droughts is weak for the given low temperature condition however when the temperature shifts towards a higher condition the likelihood turns to be slightly higher particularly in summer the streamflow seems insensitive to the temperature variability in autumn but the higher temperature results in a lower probability in winter as shown in fig 3 the soil moisture presents a similar pattern of the conditional distribution as compared to precipitation in general the likelihood of streamflow deficit drops to some extent under the high soil moisture conditions fig 4 provides the occurrence probabilities for the given threshold of high streamflow event f x x flood 80 conditioned on two given hydroclimatic scenarios under scarce precipitation and soil moisture conditions the likelihoods of high streamflow events are relatively low the probability close to zero for each season the possibility apparently increases to some extent over 20 when precipitation and soil moisture become sufficient particularly in autumn likelihood of occurring high streamflow events generally around 20 seems insensitive to the temperature variability as compared to other variables additionally this study also examined the probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables across different seasons using eq 4 as shown in fig 3 the blue areas it is evident that the precipitation and soil moisture generally present stronger positive probabilistic relationships with streamflow than others in each season there is an inverse probabilistic relationship between streamflow and air temperature in spring and summer while the relationship seems to be very weak in autumn and turns positive in winter the analysis of conditional probabilistic relationships between streamflow and both precipitation and soil moisture confirms that precipitation soil moisture exerts a positive effect on streamflow variability over this region and the occurrence of high streamflow events and hydrological droughts is very sensitive to the precipitation soil moisture conditions ruiz villanueva et al 2012 we noticed that temperature has less importance based on the probabilistic relationship in contributing to variations in streamflow for each season when compared to precipitation and soil moisture in spring and summer temperature exerts negative effect on streamflow variability this is probably attributed to the fact that higher temperature may affect soil moisture via evapotranspiration particularly in summer haslinger et al 2014 however this effect is less significant in winter in this study area as the rate of evapotranspiration is low in autumn the changes in temperature have little impact on streamflow variability while the temperature in winter provides a positive contribution to streamflow by affecting the occurrence of snowfall and snowmelt higher temperature generally exacerbates the snowmelt particularly in mountainous regions such as the black forest on the other hand an increase of temperature in winter may result in more precipitation in the form of rainfall instead of snowfall as a consequence of more streamflow 4 3 linkages between streamflow variability and atmospheric circulation the atmospheric circulation systems have an essential influence on precipitation variations at both spatial and temporal scales and thus also impact streamflow variations this section is to further explore the possible physical mechanisms of the linkages between streamflow extremes over baden württemberg and atmospheric circulation in both summer and winter for each season we used the first principal component of streamflow anomalies i e pc1 values over baden württemberg to build composite anomaly maps of geopotential height and wind vectors at 850 hpa for both high and low streamflow years the high and low streamflow events for each season were determined by their corresponding thresholds i e events not exceeding 30 of the streamflow pc1 low flows and events exceeding 70 of the pc1 high flows in summer we constructed the composite map of the z850 anomalies and wind vectors by combing the years with high including 1948 1953 1955 1956 1961 1965 1966 1968 1969 1978 1980 1986 1987 and 1995 and low including 1949 1950 1952 1959 1962 1964 1974 1976 1977 1979 1981 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1998 and 2003 values of the streamflow anomalies during the period 1948 2002 fig 5 for the years of high streamflow anomalies there is a center of negative geopotential height anomalies over central europe a positive center is over the northern atlantic ocean the study area is found under a cyclonic region in central europe which could induce water vapor according to the wind vectors from the north atlantic ocean to europe and thus result in intensive precipitation and above normal streamflow beurton and thieken 2009 ionita et al 2012 2015 petrow and merz 2009 this map also shows that central europe is under the effect of the african jet the warm and dry air from the eastern portion of northern africa is brought to europe based on the wind vectors but mainly in the southern part during the years of low summer streamflow anomalies a center of positive geopotential height anomalies is located over the west of ireland the anticyclonic activity see the wind vectors over this region can result in reduced precipitation thus less streamflow in western europe including baden württemberg fig 6 shows the composite anomaly maps of the geopotential height and the wind vectors in the high including 1948 1955 1958 1966 1967 1970 1975 1977 1980 1982 1983 1994 1995 1999 2000 2002 and 2003 and low including 1949 1950 1954 1960 1963 1964 1965 1969 1971 1972 1973 1976 1985 1991 1992 1993 1996 and 1998 winter streamflow years for high streamflow years fig 6a this map exhibits a center of positive geopotential height anomalies over greenland and a negative center over northern europe this pattern leads to a strong pressure gradient difference between the positive and negative centers the cyclonic activity over northern europe is related to an eastward shift of the atlantic jet orientation which is beneficial for the transport of warm water vapor from the atlantic ocean towards europe including the study area this could bring enhanced precipitation in this area and thus results in high streamflow anomalies however an opposite pattern is found in the years with low streamflow anomalies fig 6b northern europe becomes a center of positive geopotential height anomalies this pressure gradient induces the dry and cold air from the scandinavian peninsula to baden württemberg according to the wind vectors and thus results in scarce precipitation and reduced streamflow over this region some previous studies have stated that large scale sea surface temperature sst fluctuations may connect to atmospheric circulations patterns which induce precipitation variations and thus changes in streamflow latif et al 2000 rajagopalan et al 1998 ionita et al 2015 the high and low streamflow anomalies in baden württemberg could also have potential teleconnections with the sst anomalies in certain regions in addition it has also been well reported that the climate variability in europe is linked to the north atlantic oscillation nao the nao affects the intensity and direction of the wind anomalies and interaction between air masses in the north atlantic region it is also one of the most important teleconnection patterns which affect the climate and hydrology over western europe in all seasons barnston and livezey 1987 hurrell et al 2003 kingston et al 2006 rimbu et al 2004 particularly in winter when the atmosphere is very active and greatly drives the climate dynamics moreover some existing studies also pointed out that el niño southern oscillation enso events have a significant influence on the precipitation and streamflow over europe the el niño events are usually associated with the large streamflow in most rivers over europe while the opposite situation happens during la niña events dettinger and diaz 2000 4 4 the effect of data uncertainty on evaluating the joint dependence the investigation of statistical relationships between hydroclimatic factors is strongly affected by the uncertainty in the forcing data ajami et al 2007 beven et al 2008 laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt and ter braak 2011 wang et al 2009 the success of establishing any statistical relationships e g here the joint dependence is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of available data used sorooshian et al 1983 for instance the length of available data time series may strongly impact the representability of various hydroclimatic phenomena and the modeling of their dependence in this section we simply test the sensitivity of estimation copula parameters indicating the joint dependence between streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables to the variability in the length of time series and see how much the copula parameters vary among different data lengths in order to be comparable between copula parameters we used the best fitted copulas from table 4 with respect to various seasons and variables in addition to the 56 year records used above for the copula parameter estimation other five record lengths including the lengths of 10 20 30 40 and 50 years were performed to examine the effect on copula parameters table 5 gives the copula parameter values estimated by different record lengths the corresponding copulas given in table 4 it can be found that the copula parameters indeed are sensitive to the record lengths in general the parameter estimates get progressively more stable between larger data records e g higher than 40 year records but also some exceptions exist e g the copula parameter of streamflow temperature dependence in spring despite that it still seems challenging at this stage to know how long the data records should be effectively used in order to ensure appropriate representation of the complex hydroclimatic phenomena it is reasonable to assume at least a length of 40 year records may be expected for the possible statistical diagnoses in the current study in addition to data quantity data quality also strongly affects the statistical relationships between hydroclimatic factors such as the measurement errors and observations contaminated by noise wang et al 2014 some scholars have stepped into this field and developed feasible algorithms to deal with the noise in hydroclimatic time series such as the wavelet based de noising technique wang et al 2014 we will attempt to apply such techniques to examine the noise in the data in order to identify the uncertainty regarding the data quality and detect the effect of noise on the probabilistic relationships in the future works 5 conclusions this study presents a general approach to identify probabilistic and multi scale relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables precipitation temperature and soil moisture and the potential connections to large scale atmospheric circulation in baden württemberg southwest germany first copulas were employed to construct a bivariate probabilistic model to examine the dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables once a joint distribution has been established the probability of occurring hydrological droughts or prolonged high streamflow events defined by certain streamflow thresholds was evaluated conditioned upon two high and low different given scenarios of hydroclimatic variables across different seasons it is thus possible to obtain the information about the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events under the given conditions of hydroclimatic variables this probability based assessment presents important additional information for the development of hydrological drought mitigation and prevention strategies our results indicate that precipitation and soil moisture significantly drive the streamflow variability in baden württemberg in each season and more sufficient precipitation and soil moisture generally result in lower probability of streamflow deficit and higher probability of occurring high streamflow events temperature seems to be less sensitive to the streamflow variations as compared to the others and there is a negative relationship between streamflow and temperature in spring and summer this study also proves for the first time that these basic relationships can be explained by the joint probabilistic technique proposed this study further assessed the connections between streamflow over baden württemberg and large scale atmospheric circulation based on the composite analysis in summer the cyclonic activity over central europe causes increased precipitation and thus high streamflow anomalies the low streamflow anomalies are generally linked to the northern atmospheric circulation that induces the movement of cold air from northern europe towards this study area and reduce the precipitation and streamflow the high streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg in winter are impacted by the westerlies this circulation pattern is related to the transport of warm water vapor from the atlantic ocean towards the study area causing enhanced precipitation and thus more streamflow however an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies the further work will focus on exploring the specific connections between climate indices such as enso and nao and streamflow variability over baden württemberg particularly on interannual and decadal scales acknowledgments the authors

7016,this study presents an investigation of probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables including precipitation temperature and soil moisture and the potential links to large scale atmospheric circulation over baden württemberg southwest germany first the joint dependence between seasonal streamflow and hydroclimatic variables was established by using copulas on the basis of the joint dependence structure we estimated the probabilities of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events conditioned upon two different scenarios high and low of hydroclimatic variables for various seasons over the study area the results indicate that both precipitation and soil moisture are positively related to the streamflow variation in baden württemberg for each season and strongly impact the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high streamflow events temperature tends to have less impact on the streamflow variation and an inverse connection between streamflow and temperature is found in spring and summer then the connections between streamflow variability and large scale atmospheric circulation in summer and winter were explored by using composite analysis although the atmospheric circulation patterns vary in each season it can be found that in summer high streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg are related to a cyclonic activity over central europe while low streamflow anomalies are linked to anticyclonic patterns over western ireland the high streamflow anomalies in winter are strongly impacted by the westerlies that play an important role in favoring warm and moist airstreams from the atlantic ocean towards the study area while an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies the presented probabilistic methodology could also be applied in other regions worldwide keywords streamflow hydroclimatic variables probability atmospheric circulation baden württemberg 1 introduction climatic variables such as precipitation and air temperature have been widely recognized as key parameters in the hydrological cycle also soil moisture affects the process of precipitation transformation into infiltration and streamflow and thus largely determines the streamflow behavior and variability aubert et al 2003 understanding the linkages between hydroclimatic variables e g precipitation air temperature and soil moisture and streamflow is significant for water resources planning and adapting appropriate practices to deal with the drought and flood risk under extreme conditions an improved knowledge about these relationships may also assist the further development of hydrological modeling in the past decades numerous studies have focused on investigating the relationships between the variability in streamflow and changes in the hydroclimatic driving phenomena over different parts of the world on the one hand some researchers focused on employing deterministic correlation coefficient and linear statistical approaches such as multiple linear regressions to examine the influence of regional hydroclimatic variables on streamflow and the potential links between them brocca et al 2008 cayan et al 1993 cunderlik and burn 2004 ficklin et al 2009 kletti and stefan 1997 penna et al 2011 stewart et al 2005 on the other hand many scholars investigated the hydrological response to climate and environment variability based on conceptual or physically based hydrological models and also assessed the sensitivity of the streamflow to changes in the hydroclimatic drivers hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 jha et al 2004 menzel et al 2006 zehe et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 however few studies have focused on building up the joint probabilistic dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic factors and identifying the conditional likelihoods of prolonged high streamflow events and hydrological drought under varying hydroclimatic scenarios particularly regarding the seasonal variation this probability based information would be of great value for water resources planning and prevention to identify the joint probabilistic dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables copulas could be an ideal tool the main advantages of copulas include allowing the dependence to be constructed independently from the marginal distributions and modeling different marginal distributions without any transformations genest and favre 2007 during the past decade copulas have gained popularity and there are increasing applications of copulas in multivariate hydrological modeling for instance in the field of flood frequency analysis single variable analysis has been widely used in the past while it has the problem in handling the multivariate stochastic flood characteristics such as volume peak and duration of the flood hydrograph bobée and rasmussen 1994 copulas provide an effective solution to model the joint dependence structure of uncertain multiple flood characteristics reddy and ganguli 2012 in order to improve the estimation of design flood hydrograph requena et al 2013 introduced a bivariate copula model to simulate the joint distribution of flood peak and volume and to obtain the return periods linked to the risk of dam overtopping rainfall intensity durationfrequency idf curves are very important in floodplain management and urban drainage design however in order to model joint distributions of rainfall variables including intensity depth and duration many previous studies assumed these variables are independent have the same marginal distribution usually assumed to be normal distribution or transformed to normal distribution singh and zhang 2007 developed copula based idf curves by relaxing such assumptions in addition copulas offer an effective tool in other hydrological applications such as return periods of drought events hydrological prediction drought identification and geostatistical interpolation bárdossy and li 2008 genest and favre 2007 liu et al 2015a madadgar and moradkhani 2013 reddy and ganguli 2012 salvadori and de michele 2004 song and singh 2010 tong et al 2015 zhang and singh 2007 wang et al 2012 large scale atmospheric circulation is known to strongly affect precipitation variability and thus the changes in streamflow there have been many studies focusing on the changes in atmospheric dynamics and their links to regional hydrological processes and extreme flow events in europe jacobeit et al 2003 detected the connections between flood events and atmospheric circulation patterns for the past 500 years in central europe they described how some specific atmospheric circulation modes as a dynamic factor significantly influence the incidence of flood events bardossy and filiz 2005 identified the flood producing atmospheric circulation patterns cps by means of large scale pressure fields over some meso scale catchments in france and spain bouwer et al 2006 quantitatively assessed the impact of variation in atmospheric circulation on the changes in winter streamflow over northwestern europe they reported that the frequency of the westerlies over europe could be a useful reference for investigating climate change impacts on streamflow in northwest europe ionita et al 2012 examined the streamflow in the rhine river and the links to large scale climate anomaly patterns in spring and autumn using composite analysis and concluded that the variability of the atmospheric circulation pattern significantly affects the precipitation fluctuations and rhine streamflow variability in both seasons the current study focuses on investigating how streamflow and hydroclimatic factors are coupled in baden württemberg southwest germany particularly focusing on the likelihoods of prolonged high streamflow events and hydrological drought under different hydroclimatic conditions several previous studies have provided valuable knowledge about the linear connections e g the correlation analysis between the streamflow variability and hydroclimatic changes over some specific regions or basins in baden württemberg e g huang et al 2015 schröter et al 2015 warrach sagi et al 2008 however little previous work has been done to probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic forcings and the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and high streamflow events under different hydroclimatic conditions in baden württemberg the current study attempts to quantify the seasonal probabilistic dependence structure between streamflow and hydroclimatic factors including precipitation temperature and soil moisture over baden württemberg by using copulas the established dependence structure allows the evaluation of the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events conditioned on different hydroclimatic scenarios moreover large scale atmospheric circulation imposes an important impact on the precipitation over this area and thus strongly affects the hydrological extremes this study also seeks to explore the possible connections between streamflow in baden württemberg and large scale atmospheric circulation this analysis may provide additional information to understand the streamflow variability based on prior knowledge from varying atmospheric circulation patterns 2 methodology the proposed framework in the study consists of three components the first one involves building up joint dependence structure of streamflow and hydroclimatic variables based on copula the second part is the conditional simulations and the final part aims to evaluate the probabilistic difference with given conditions additionally the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis was used here to identify dominant spatial modes of streamflow over the study area 2 1 probabilistic measures of the dependence between streamflow and different hydroclimatic variables a copula is simply described as a joint distribution function from multiple variables laux et al 2011 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 sklar 1959 based on sklar s theorem sklar 1959 a bivariate distribution f x y x y for variables x and y can be expressed by a copula that satisfies 1 f x y c f x x f y y c u 1 u 2 c is called a copula which is the joint cumulative distribution function cdf and its form reflects the joint dependence structure u 1 f x x and u 2 f y y modeling the joint dependence structure requires a well fitted marginal distribution of each variable to determine the best fit distribution of the variables four common theoretical probability distributions which are commonly used in hydroclimatology were compared normal gamma weibull and lognormal kao and govindaraju 2010 khedun et al 2014 madadgar et al 2014 the parameters of each distribution were estimated by the maximum likelihood method gyasi agyei 2013 to determine the appropriateness of the theoretical distributions and discriminate between them the chi squared goodness of fit was employed madadgar and moradkhani 2013 massey 1951 this test returns the p value which should be greater than the significance level 5 to accept the null hypothesis the most appropriate distribution was determined by the smallest statistics the corresponding p value should be greater than the significance level as well from the chi squared test after obtaining the best fitted marginal distributions an approximate bivariate copula is expected to join the margins and construct the joint dependence in this study several commonly used copulas were considered such as gaussian clayton gumbel frank and joe the details of these copulas used in the current study are found in liu et al 2015b to select the copula that best models the dependence of the given data a parametric bootstrapping goodness of fit test was used genest and rémillard 2008 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 the goodness of fit test is called the cramér von mises test which computes the cramér von mises statistic s n as a measure of the distance between the empirical and parametric copulas given by 2a s n 0 1 k δ c u 2 d c u u u 1 u 2 u k 0 1 k 2b δ c n c emp c θ where cemp and cθ are the empirical and parametric copulas fitted to the given data with the size of n the p values associated with the test statistics were calculated by the bootstrap sampling procedure using the monte carlo approach genest and favre 2007 the null hypothesis h 0 c emp c θ is accepted when the p value is above a predefined significance level of 5 otherwise it is rejected and the copula would not be a good selection for the considered significance level among several copulas the one with the smallest s n and highest p value greater than the significant level as well will be considered the best fitted copula madadgar and moradkhani 2013 once the copula based joint distribution has been achieved the conditional distributions of x under given y can be generated and thus the conditional distribution can be computed the conditional non exceedance distribution of x x given y y can be given as follows 3 f x y y x y c x y x y f y y given the conditional probability one can also gain the probability of attaining the required streamflow or the likelihood of hydrological drought or prolonged high streamflow event under the given conditions of hydroclimatic variables in fact an f x x event could be defined as dangerous if f x x exceeds or never exceeds a certain threshold salvadori and de michele 2004 the current study deems streamflow to be under a streamflow deficit event here indicating a hydrological drought event if the corresponding streamflow value is less than the 20th percentile of streamflow cdf denoted as f x x deficit 20 also it is possible to obtain the conditional exceedance distribution of x x given y y by computing f x x y y x y 1 c x y x y f y y this study considers streamflow under a high streamflow event when the corresponding streamflow value is greater than the 80th percentile of streamflow cdf denoted as f x x flood 80 this study focuses on two given scenarios of hydroclimatic variables events at the 30th and 70th quantiles of hydroclimatic variables denoted as f y y 30 and f y y 70 it should be mentioned that one could conduct an experiment with any scenarios of hydroclimatic variables with self defined streamflow deficit thresholds as long as the copula based joint distribution has been constructed based on the joint distribution one can use the probabilistic difference between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables to describe the sensitivity of streamflow to different hydroclimatic variables the probabilistic difference is given as follows 4 difference f x y y 1 x y f x y y 2 x y d x 2 2 empirical orthogonal function method the eof technique is a statistical and diagnostic tool to extract the spatial and temporal characteristics modes which are ordered according to their representations of data variance and the first leading modes generally account for most of the total variance su et al 2008 it has been widely used in describing patterns of atmospheric oceanic and climatic research over a spatial area eof analysis enables one to select the dominant modes of variability while largely reducing the data space the output of eof analysis includes spatial patterns eofs temporal series principal components pcs and eigenvalues liu et al 2013 su et al 2008 tatli and türkes 2011 the eofs can be plotted as vector maps to identity the spatial modes by presenting which regions are closely related or unrelated according to correlation coefficients the pcs of each mode quantify the amplitude the temporal series of each mode regarding the variable considered the modes are ranked by their significance to the overall variability according to the eigenvalues the leading modes can accouter for most of the original variability su et al 2008 3 study area and datasets baden württemberg is a federal state located in southwest germany with an area of 35 752 km2 the geography varies greatly across this state for example germany s largest continuous forest area is located in the black forest in western baden württemberg apart from the black forest the swabian alp is another important mountain range extending from southwest to northeast of baden württemberg the main rivers over this state include the rhine the neckar a tributary of the rhine and the danube the climate of baden württemberg features the typical temperate oceanic conditions of the higher middle latitudes the mean annual temperature is around 8 1 c with a range between 3 3 c in the highest part of the black forest approximately 1500 m and about 10 4 c in the rhine valley the mean annual precipitation is between 660 mm and 2200 mm and is spread throughout the entire year the monthly streamflow anomalies from 27 streamflow gauges in baden württemberg during the period 1948 2003 were constructed using daily discharge data provided by lubw the federal agency for the environment measurements and nature protection the locations of the selected streamflow gauges are shown in fig 1 table 1 gives some basic statistical information about the streamflow data these stations are independent from non nested catchments and were selected based on careful analysis of possible human impacts on streamflow variability i e the chosen gauges with their catchments have few or minor human impacts the dominant patterns of the variability of monthly streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg were examined using the eof or principal component analysis the monthly precipitation monthly temperature and modeled monthly soil moisture data used in this study were derived from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc datasets with a spatial resolution of 0 5 available from https data noaa gov dataset the various hydroclimatic variables used here are the input air temperature and precipitation and output soil moisture from a global land model which is a one layer bucket water balance model a detailed description of this model and how this dataset was produced can be found in huang et al 1996 and fan and van den dool 2004 these gridded products have been widely used for many regional and global hydroclimatic applications e g fan and van den dool 2008 fujinami et al 2015 syed et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 for the analysis of atmospheric circulation this study used the geopotential height anomalies z850 the zonal and the meridional wind u and v wind components at 850 hpa on a 2 5 2 5 grid during the period 1948 2003 from the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar r1 dataset kalnay et al 1996 4 results and discussion 4 1 eof patterns table 2 shows the proportion of the total variance explained by the first five eofs regarding streamflow anomalies from the 27 selected streamflow gauges surprisingly it can be found that the first eof can explain almost 76 of the total variability this indicates that the complexity of the spatial pattern of streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg has been largely explained by the single first eof spatial structure fig 2 illustrates spatial patterns of streamflow anomalies for the first four eofs interpolated by the kriging method according to the distribution of eof1 pattern the strong spatially coherent areas characterized by the correlation coefficients over 0 7 cover most of the study area indicating that a good representation of data variance has been extracted by eof1 mode however the second mode eof2 only accounts for 6 of the total variance and less variance is explained for the other two eof modes which have also weak even negative correlation coefficients as compared to eof1 given that the first eof of streamflow has explained the majority of the total variance we used the corresponding monthly time series pc1 of the first eof to represent the time series of streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg 4 2 probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables we first examined the joint dependence structure between streamflow pc1 values and hydroclimatic variables then it is capable to identify the conditional probability of streamflow under different scenarios of hydroclimatic variables based on the established dependence structure the joint dependence structure between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables in different seasons was constructed by a proper bivariate copula function through joining their marginal distributions table 3 presents the chi squared statistics of theoretical distributions for different variables in each season and their log likelihood values the choice of the theoretical distributions for each case was determined by their chi squared statistics afterwards the cramér von mises test was used to test the goodness of fit of the copulas as mentioned in section 2 1 table 4 gives the goodness of fit statistics s n of the cramér von mises test for the dependence of streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables i e precipitation temperature and soil moisture for each season it can be seen that the best fitted copula varies among different cases based on the best fitted copula we can model the joint cdf of streamflow and different hydroclimatic variables in four seasons once the dependence structure is built up the conditional distributions of streamflow conditioned upon two scenarios i e f y y 30 and f y y 70 of explanatory variables e g precipitation air temperature and soil moisture can be obtained using eq 3 fig 3 indicates the conditional distributions of streamflow under two given scenarios of the hydroclimatic variables in different seasons in addition it is also possible to gain the probabilities the intersections between the vertical line and two solid curves of streamflow deficit events regarding a certain streamflow threshold f x x deficit 20 given the two precipitation conditions in fig 3 this value helps us to know about the probability of occurring hydrological droughts with respect to the given streamflow thresholds and smaller values mean a lower probability for precipitation the likelihoods of occurring hydrological droughts in different seasons are generally around 10 30 under the low precipitation scenario f y 30 the increment of precipitation i e under the precipitation scenario f y 70 indeed has a positive effect on reducing the likelihood of drought the probability close to zero this difference between the two curves of conditional distributions also suggests that streamflow in this study area is very sensitive to the precipitation in each season it can be noted that in spring and summer the likelihood of occurring hydrological droughts is weak for the given low temperature condition however when the temperature shifts towards a higher condition the likelihood turns to be slightly higher particularly in summer the streamflow seems insensitive to the temperature variability in autumn but the higher temperature results in a lower probability in winter as shown in fig 3 the soil moisture presents a similar pattern of the conditional distribution as compared to precipitation in general the likelihood of streamflow deficit drops to some extent under the high soil moisture conditions fig 4 provides the occurrence probabilities for the given threshold of high streamflow event f x x flood 80 conditioned on two given hydroclimatic scenarios under scarce precipitation and soil moisture conditions the likelihoods of high streamflow events are relatively low the probability close to zero for each season the possibility apparently increases to some extent over 20 when precipitation and soil moisture become sufficient particularly in autumn likelihood of occurring high streamflow events generally around 20 seems insensitive to the temperature variability as compared to other variables additionally this study also examined the probabilistic relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables across different seasons using eq 4 as shown in fig 3 the blue areas it is evident that the precipitation and soil moisture generally present stronger positive probabilistic relationships with streamflow than others in each season there is an inverse probabilistic relationship between streamflow and air temperature in spring and summer while the relationship seems to be very weak in autumn and turns positive in winter the analysis of conditional probabilistic relationships between streamflow and both precipitation and soil moisture confirms that precipitation soil moisture exerts a positive effect on streamflow variability over this region and the occurrence of high streamflow events and hydrological droughts is very sensitive to the precipitation soil moisture conditions ruiz villanueva et al 2012 we noticed that temperature has less importance based on the probabilistic relationship in contributing to variations in streamflow for each season when compared to precipitation and soil moisture in spring and summer temperature exerts negative effect on streamflow variability this is probably attributed to the fact that higher temperature may affect soil moisture via evapotranspiration particularly in summer haslinger et al 2014 however this effect is less significant in winter in this study area as the rate of evapotranspiration is low in autumn the changes in temperature have little impact on streamflow variability while the temperature in winter provides a positive contribution to streamflow by affecting the occurrence of snowfall and snowmelt higher temperature generally exacerbates the snowmelt particularly in mountainous regions such as the black forest on the other hand an increase of temperature in winter may result in more precipitation in the form of rainfall instead of snowfall as a consequence of more streamflow 4 3 linkages between streamflow variability and atmospheric circulation the atmospheric circulation systems have an essential influence on precipitation variations at both spatial and temporal scales and thus also impact streamflow variations this section is to further explore the possible physical mechanisms of the linkages between streamflow extremes over baden württemberg and atmospheric circulation in both summer and winter for each season we used the first principal component of streamflow anomalies i e pc1 values over baden württemberg to build composite anomaly maps of geopotential height and wind vectors at 850 hpa for both high and low streamflow years the high and low streamflow events for each season were determined by their corresponding thresholds i e events not exceeding 30 of the streamflow pc1 low flows and events exceeding 70 of the pc1 high flows in summer we constructed the composite map of the z850 anomalies and wind vectors by combing the years with high including 1948 1953 1955 1956 1961 1965 1966 1968 1969 1978 1980 1986 1987 and 1995 and low including 1949 1950 1952 1959 1962 1964 1974 1976 1977 1979 1981 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1998 and 2003 values of the streamflow anomalies during the period 1948 2002 fig 5 for the years of high streamflow anomalies there is a center of negative geopotential height anomalies over central europe a positive center is over the northern atlantic ocean the study area is found under a cyclonic region in central europe which could induce water vapor according to the wind vectors from the north atlantic ocean to europe and thus result in intensive precipitation and above normal streamflow beurton and thieken 2009 ionita et al 2012 2015 petrow and merz 2009 this map also shows that central europe is under the effect of the african jet the warm and dry air from the eastern portion of northern africa is brought to europe based on the wind vectors but mainly in the southern part during the years of low summer streamflow anomalies a center of positive geopotential height anomalies is located over the west of ireland the anticyclonic activity see the wind vectors over this region can result in reduced precipitation thus less streamflow in western europe including baden württemberg fig 6 shows the composite anomaly maps of the geopotential height and the wind vectors in the high including 1948 1955 1958 1966 1967 1970 1975 1977 1980 1982 1983 1994 1995 1999 2000 2002 and 2003 and low including 1949 1950 1954 1960 1963 1964 1965 1969 1971 1972 1973 1976 1985 1991 1992 1993 1996 and 1998 winter streamflow years for high streamflow years fig 6a this map exhibits a center of positive geopotential height anomalies over greenland and a negative center over northern europe this pattern leads to a strong pressure gradient difference between the positive and negative centers the cyclonic activity over northern europe is related to an eastward shift of the atlantic jet orientation which is beneficial for the transport of warm water vapor from the atlantic ocean towards europe including the study area this could bring enhanced precipitation in this area and thus results in high streamflow anomalies however an opposite pattern is found in the years with low streamflow anomalies fig 6b northern europe becomes a center of positive geopotential height anomalies this pressure gradient induces the dry and cold air from the scandinavian peninsula to baden württemberg according to the wind vectors and thus results in scarce precipitation and reduced streamflow over this region some previous studies have stated that large scale sea surface temperature sst fluctuations may connect to atmospheric circulations patterns which induce precipitation variations and thus changes in streamflow latif et al 2000 rajagopalan et al 1998 ionita et al 2015 the high and low streamflow anomalies in baden württemberg could also have potential teleconnections with the sst anomalies in certain regions in addition it has also been well reported that the climate variability in europe is linked to the north atlantic oscillation nao the nao affects the intensity and direction of the wind anomalies and interaction between air masses in the north atlantic region it is also one of the most important teleconnection patterns which affect the climate and hydrology over western europe in all seasons barnston and livezey 1987 hurrell et al 2003 kingston et al 2006 rimbu et al 2004 particularly in winter when the atmosphere is very active and greatly drives the climate dynamics moreover some existing studies also pointed out that el niño southern oscillation enso events have a significant influence on the precipitation and streamflow over europe the el niño events are usually associated with the large streamflow in most rivers over europe while the opposite situation happens during la niña events dettinger and diaz 2000 4 4 the effect of data uncertainty on evaluating the joint dependence the investigation of statistical relationships between hydroclimatic factors is strongly affected by the uncertainty in the forcing data ajami et al 2007 beven et al 2008 laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt and ter braak 2011 wang et al 2009 the success of establishing any statistical relationships e g here the joint dependence is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of available data used sorooshian et al 1983 for instance the length of available data time series may strongly impact the representability of various hydroclimatic phenomena and the modeling of their dependence in this section we simply test the sensitivity of estimation copula parameters indicating the joint dependence between streamflow and other hydroclimatic variables to the variability in the length of time series and see how much the copula parameters vary among different data lengths in order to be comparable between copula parameters we used the best fitted copulas from table 4 with respect to various seasons and variables in addition to the 56 year records used above for the copula parameter estimation other five record lengths including the lengths of 10 20 30 40 and 50 years were performed to examine the effect on copula parameters table 5 gives the copula parameter values estimated by different record lengths the corresponding copulas given in table 4 it can be found that the copula parameters indeed are sensitive to the record lengths in general the parameter estimates get progressively more stable between larger data records e g higher than 40 year records but also some exceptions exist e g the copula parameter of streamflow temperature dependence in spring despite that it still seems challenging at this stage to know how long the data records should be effectively used in order to ensure appropriate representation of the complex hydroclimatic phenomena it is reasonable to assume at least a length of 40 year records may be expected for the possible statistical diagnoses in the current study in addition to data quantity data quality also strongly affects the statistical relationships between hydroclimatic factors such as the measurement errors and observations contaminated by noise wang et al 2014 some scholars have stepped into this field and developed feasible algorithms to deal with the noise in hydroclimatic time series such as the wavelet based de noising technique wang et al 2014 we will attempt to apply such techniques to examine the noise in the data in order to identify the uncertainty regarding the data quality and detect the effect of noise on the probabilistic relationships in the future works 5 conclusions this study presents a general approach to identify probabilistic and multi scale relationships between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables precipitation temperature and soil moisture and the potential connections to large scale atmospheric circulation in baden württemberg southwest germany first copulas were employed to construct a bivariate probabilistic model to examine the dependence between streamflow and hydroclimatic variables once a joint distribution has been established the probability of occurring hydrological droughts or prolonged high streamflow events defined by certain streamflow thresholds was evaluated conditioned upon two high and low different given scenarios of hydroclimatic variables across different seasons it is thus possible to obtain the information about the likelihoods of hydrological droughts and prolonged high streamflow events under the given conditions of hydroclimatic variables this probability based assessment presents important additional information for the development of hydrological drought mitigation and prevention strategies our results indicate that precipitation and soil moisture significantly drive the streamflow variability in baden württemberg in each season and more sufficient precipitation and soil moisture generally result in lower probability of streamflow deficit and higher probability of occurring high streamflow events temperature seems to be less sensitive to the streamflow variations as compared to the others and there is a negative relationship between streamflow and temperature in spring and summer this study also proves for the first time that these basic relationships can be explained by the joint probabilistic technique proposed this study further assessed the connections between streamflow over baden württemberg and large scale atmospheric circulation based on the composite analysis in summer the cyclonic activity over central europe causes increased precipitation and thus high streamflow anomalies the low streamflow anomalies are generally linked to the northern atmospheric circulation that induces the movement of cold air from northern europe towards this study area and reduce the precipitation and streamflow the high streamflow anomalies over baden württemberg in winter are impacted by the westerlies this circulation pattern is related to the transport of warm water vapor from the atlantic ocean towards the study area causing enhanced precipitation and thus more streamflow however an opposite atmospheric pattern is found for the years with low streamflow anomalies the further work will focus on exploring the specific connections between climate indices such as enso and nao and streamflow variability over baden württemberg particularly on interannual and decadal scales acknowledgments the authors

7017,water saving irrigation systems e g drip and sprinkler conserve water but they can reduce potential groundwater recharge pgr over traditional systems e g furrow and may impair sustainability particularly in arid and semi arid regions this study used a hybrid experimental and numerical approach to determine the effects of different irrigation systems on the dynamics of pgr in a semi arid region a 210 cm tall 300 cm long and 150 cm wide soil column was prepared to simulate the soil environment of the karaj region in iran a range of soil and environmental properties were monitored during a winter wheat cropping season 140 days under different irrigation systems treatments soil water content and drainage were measured under each irrigation system and these were used to a calculate different components of water balance and b model long term soil water flow dynamics using hydrus 1d about 14 83 0 14 and 0 80 of the applied water as irrigation and precipitation under furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively were drained below 200 cm and this was estimated as the pgr annual pgr under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19 228 mm with an average of 111 3 mm however mean annual pgr under the sprinkler 4 1 mm and drip 0 7 mm was an order of magnitude lower than furrow irrigation deep drainage leading to pgr under the water saving methods was observed only after a very large rainfall event the absence of large rainfall events between irrigations reduced pgr under water saving irrigation systems in the arid and semi arid region the simulated model was further used to estimate the total amount of pgr over a 20 year period of wheat cultivation furrow irrigation estimated much higher amounts of pgr 222 7 cm over drip and sprinkler systems this raised questions about the sustainability of water saving irrigation methods in the study area as groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these areas the recharge capacity of the adopted methods is critical to ensure the future availability and use of groundwater in the karaj region of iran as well as similar arid and semi arid regions elsewhere keywords potential groundwater

et al 2013 various water saving irrigation systems e g drip sub surface drip and sprinkler have been developed and applied throughout the world to increase irrigation efficiency which has affected groundwater recharge a large body of literature investigated the efficiency of these irrigation systems over more conventional ones abd el wahed and ali 2013 al jamal et al 2001 amer 2011 banedjschafie et al 2008 dar et al 2017 eranki et al 2017 fulton et al 1991 hansona et al 1997 hassanli et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2013 almost all these studies indicated that water saving irrigation systems eliminated deep drainage by increasing water efficiency and almost doubled crop production some researchers have pointed out that the alternate use of saved water in some areas cooley et al 2008 while others indicated an increase in the total irrigated area using the saved water this resulted in increased evapotranspiration from more intensive cropping leading to an overall increase in consumptive water use peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 scheierling et al 2006a scheierling et al 2006b ward and pulido velazquez 2008 whittlesey and huffaker 1995 in general the increased water use efficiency began motivating more and more irrigators to switch from furrow to more efficient irrigation systems however areas where the groundwater is the main source for irrigation the switch may lead to reduced groundwater recharge from irrigation return flow due to the efficient use of applied water this is more important in arid and semi arid areas where evapotranspiration typically exceeds precipitation during most seasons leading to practically negligible continuous recharge from precipitation qin et al 2011 and surface water in an irrigated area with a deep water table downward soil water flux from the bottom of the root zone deep drainage is often referred to as potential groundwater recharge pgr min et al 2015 radford et al 2009 wohling et al 2012 generally if deep drainage is not hampered by low hydraulic conductivity horizons in the deep vadose zone or lateral flow to nearby local depressions it could eventually completely recharge the groundwater after a delay de vries and simmers 2002 therefore deep drainage below the root zone under an irrigation system could be considered as the source of groundwater recharge and in this case as the pgr this is more critical in areas where groundwater is the main source of irrigation in recent years unsaturated zone methods physical methods tracer methods and numerical modeling for estimating groundwater recharge have been fully tested and broadly applied in irrigated area but the effects of drip and sprinkler irrigation against furrow system on the dynamics of recharge process in arid and semiarid regions is not entirely clear and requires further study hu et al 2017 most of the studies only assessed the effect within very shallow depths or sparse water content measurements with short time scales one to several years in which the mean value of multi year recharge could not be accurately estimated moreover having a shallow depth of observation may not represent the true recharge due to the dynamics created by roots and other environmental forcing prevailed in shallow layer the natural groundwater cycle in the karaj region of northern iran has changed over the years due to human activities in such a semiarid region where the return flow from irrigation events plays a significant role on pgr knowledge of the way in which groundwater recharge is affected by the changes in natural and anthropogenic factors particularly irrigation water use is essential for ensuring effective management of available water supplies simons et al 2015 the main objective of this research was to assess the impact of three irrigation systems including drip sprinkler and furrow on pgr using an experimental and numerical modelling approach the study was conducted in controlled conditions using a soil column for collecting data to simulate the field conditions of the karaj region of iran and modelled for long term variability of natural pgr processes using hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2005 2 experimental investigation 2 1 methods 2 1 1 experimental soil column and site location a large soil column 210 cm in height 300 cm in length and 150 cm in width was prepared using optically clear acrylic on the front wall and steel sheets on the other walls fig 1 two dividers were used to separate the column into three equal cells with 15 000 cm2 or 1 5 m2 surface area to apply three irrigation systems i e furrow drip and sprinkler the sheet walls and dividers were sealed carefully to avoid lateral soil water exchange between the cells the column was filled with soil layer by layer collected from a farm 35 47 45 n and 50 56 35 e in the agriculture experimental site seed and plant improvement institute spii of karaj city iran utmost care was taken to maintain the original bulk density during packing of the soil column three cells were prepared simultaneously with the same soil and horizontal thickness to eliminate the effects of variability the column was established at laboratory conditions with fewer daylight hours and protected from natural rainfall by using a tent soil physical properties were characterized on the undisturbed samples collected from a soil profile excavated adjacent to the sampling location the 2 m deep profile was sectioned into four layers and sampled to determine soil bulk density grossman and reinsch 2002 soil water retention curve dane and hopmans 2002 and soil texture gee and or 2002 in laboratory vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was measured in the laboratory using falling head experiments on undisturbed soil cores collected from each layer table 1 each cell was installed with two vertical time domain reflectometry tdr profile probes pr2 profile probe delta t devices ltd with seven sensors at 10 20 30 40 60 100 and 150 cm depths from the top to measure soil water content fig 1b three tensiometers t5 x ums inc germany were installed in the furrow irrigation cell to monitor the pressure head at a 5 min interval and at depths of 30 60 and 120 cm using tensiometers ums inc germany fig 1 in addition two vertical sets of piezometers were installed in each cell to compare the impact of the sheet walls on the flow directions during saturated conditions at a depth of 30 60 120 and 150 cm from the top one set was fixed on the sheet wall while another one was installed at 40 cm away from the sheet wall at the same depths fig 1 a 10 cm drainage layer gravel with a tap was installed at the lower boundary of each cell for measuring the drainage rate the progression of wetting front s was monitored from the accurate soil water and drainage measurements over a 140 day period from 26 december 2016 to 15 may 2017 irrigation application rates were controlled using a flow meter installed at the top under all irrigation systems fig 1c the drip irrigation system was designed with a 16 mm inside diameter tube for water supply emitters to supply water at 4 l h 1 and an emitter spacing of 30 cm in total 6 emitters were installed for the drip irrigation system a sprinkler nozzle was installed at 2 m above to simulate rainfall intensity of 50 mm h 1 a temporary tent was used to protect the furrow and drip cells from the splash of the sprinkler cell furrow irrigation applications were carried out using two small furrows at the top the most common cropping system in the karaj region is winter wheat with a typical growing season between early november and mid june of the following year generally depending on the availability and variability of rainfall 5 7 irrigation events of 70 mm for furrow irrigation 8 10 irrigation events of 30 mm for drip irrigation and 10 12 irrigation events of 30 mm for sprinkler irrigation are a widespread practice in the area table 2 these practices were adopted in the current study to represent the irrigation management in the karaj region the soil water budget in a vertical soil column was expressed as yazaki et al 2006 1 et i d r δ s where i and dr were irrigation flow meter and drainage rates measured respectively δ s the change in soil water storage was calculated by multiplying the thickness of each layer to the corresponding change in water content 2 2 results 2 2 1 measured water balance components fig 2 shows measured water content at 40 100 and 150 cm under the different irrigation systems under the furrow system water content changed right after irrigation at the 40 cm depth even with a small amount e g sixth irrigation event while the deeper layers responded with a time lag fig 2a however there was almost no change in water content at deeper depths for drip and sprinkler systems until a relatively large amount of water was applied i e fifth event overall changes in water content at 150 cm were smooth and without sharp peaks except after the fifth event with minimal deep percolation under water saving irrigation systems fig 2b c a large amount of water was applied during the fifth event to test the effects of water content on the propagation of the wetting front during subsequent events in soils with higher amounts of antecedent water content in the profile i e after applying the fifth event the wetting front tended to move deeper and deep drainage increased figs 2b c and 3b c which was in agreement with the results reported by bethune et al 2008 the cumulative drainage was a little higher in the sprinkler system fig 3 c than the drip system fig 3b this was due to a higher amount of infiltration after the fifth event however the drainage amount was relatively smaller and stopped later in the water saving irrigation systems fig 3b c this means that deep drainage almost ceased under water saving irrigation systems unless there were considerably large amounts of water applied however arid and semi arid regions like the karaj region of iran does not normally experience such rainfall events thereby leading to a considerable negative impact on pgr the amount of evapotranspiration was relatively equal for the three systems i e 6 cm 4 5 cm and 4 5 cm in furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively however the soil column was established in laboratory conditions with relatively fewer daylight hours on the contrary the amount of drainage varied under different irrigation systems a total of 57 5 of the applied water drained out under the furrow irrigation system though this amount was zero before the fifth event a total of 18 and 21 of the applied water was drained out under the drip and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively fig 3 drainage response time the time difference between the first irrigation event and the first drainage event min et al 2015 was also calculated and it was found to be around 40 days under the furrow system a quicker response 21 days for the drip system and 16 days for the sprinkler system in the deep drainage was observed after the fifth event 95 days for the drip system and 90 days for the sprinkler system from the first irrigation with identical soil horizons in the three irrigation systems the variability in deep drainage was due only to the amount of water applications under the different irrigation systems 3 numerical investigation 3 1 methods 3 1 1 numerical model and soil hydraulic properties numerical simulations of the irrigation flow dynamics and root water uptake were investigated using the hydrus 1d software package šimunek et al 2005 with measured and calculated data from the soil column experiment the governing equation describing water flow in hydrus 1d was the modified richards equation 2 θ t z k h h z 1 s z t where θ was the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h was the pressure head l s was a sink term accounting for root water uptake t 1 z was vertical spatial coordinate l t was time t and k was the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 the sink term s represented the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to plant water uptake root water uptake was modeled using the function feddes et al 1978 3 s h α h s p where the water stress response function α h was a prescribed dimensionless function of the soil water stress response 0 α 1 to account for reductions in uptake due to drought stress and sp was the potential water uptake rate t 1 for α h the functional form of feddes et al 1978 using hydrus default parameter values for wheat i e h1 0 cm h2 1 cm h3 900 cm h4 16 000 cm was used based on studies by wesseling et al 1991 the root growth was described using the verhulst pearl growth function during the growing season šimunek et al 2005 an atmospheric boundary condition with a surface layer was selected at the top of the profile for the three irrigation systems the latter condition allowed water to build up on the surface the height of the surface water layer increased due to precipitation and decreased due to infiltration and evaporation and the value was assumed at 11 cm in the model a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the

were estimated from fitting using the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 for the inverse solution a time series of soil water content and pressure head at each observation point were reconstructed using the soil column data of the furrow irrigation cell monitored between 26 december 2016 and 15 may 2017 the calibrated model was then verified using data from the drip and sprinkler systems as characterization of flow behavior in the layered profile requires a large number of parameters several parameterizations were investigated in this study using different combinations of four layer parameters θr θs ks α and n the parameters were calibrated only when the differences between the calculated and measured water content were larger than the standard deviation uniqueness and stability of the inverse solution were tested repeatedly using different initial estimates for the calibrated parameters to reduce the parameter uncertainty both soil water content and matric potential rather than only soil water content were used to calibrate the model the root mean square error rmse and r squared coefficient r2 were calculated to quantify the deviation of the modeled results from the observed data the calibrated and validated model was then used to assess pgr using long term nov 1997 june 2017 meteorological data the downward flux at the bottom of the soil column below the root zone was assumed to be equal to pgr these recharge simulations were intended to explore the overall water balance of the vadose zone including precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration potential groundwater recharge and change in soil water storage the effects of different irrigation systems on pgr were calculated based on the long term 1 november 1997 31 june 2017 simulated drainage data the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation and daily values of the potential evapotranspiration etp following allen et al 1998 7 e t p k c e t 0 where kc was a dimensionless crop coefficient and was extracted following allen et al 1998 for all stages of plant growth due to lack of leaf area index lai data potential evaporation ep was calculated from the etp following jiménez martínez et al 2009 8 e p e t f t where the function f t was specified as follows a during mid growing season the ground was fully covered and the effective evaporation was zero or f t 0 b during early growth stages or after planting the ground cover was almost nonexistent thus the potential evaporation was maximum or f t 1 and c the remaining growth stages were modelled using a sigmoid curve jiménez martínez et al 2009 assuming f t 1 at planting to f t 0 at the beginning of the mid growing season eventually daily potential transpiration tp was calculated by subtracting ep from etp dividing etp into ep and tp was necessary as input parameters for hydrus 1d model as atmospheric boundary condition was used in this study the actual amount and the time of irrigation application during the past 20 years were not available however the irrigation time and irrigation amounts were estimated following published works min et al 2015 sun et al 2010 and the farmers irrigation schedule for winter wheat table 2 the irrigation schedule was approximated as follows a rank the annual rainfall events in descending order and b calculate the probability of exceedance of the rainfall events using the hazen method hazen 1930 if the precipitation was greater than the precipitation at 25 probability of exceedance only key irrigation periods must be irrigated as listed in table 2 however if the precipitation was less than the precipitation at 25 probability of exceedance extra irrigation events were included in the schedule values indicated in the parentheses 3 2 results 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the initial simulation of soil water dynamic was not quite in agreement with the observed data when measured soil hydraulic parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity was used however the inverse module of hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2005 improved the estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters table 1 and was found to be an effective tool for evaluating soil water dynamics kandelous et al 2012 ramos et al 2012 there were differences in the measured and inversely predicted hydraulic conductivities table 1 this can be related to the improved results of hydrus 1d simulation when its input parameters are calibrated against dynamic flow measurements kandelous and šimůnek 2010 in general there were good agreements between the observed and simulated soil water content and the pressure heads during calibration of the model the rmse varied between 0 0036 and 0 0244 cm3 cm 3 for water content fig 4 and 13 16 17 49 cm for pressure head fig 5 at different depths the r2 ranged between 0 85 and 0 97 for water content and 0 86 and 0 99 for pressure head at different depths it should be noted that the pressure head was only monitored in the furrow system and used during the calibration step a similar range of validation results were observed using the measured data under the drip and sprinkler systems the r2 varied between 0 83 and 0 93 and 0 87 and 0 94 for drip and sprinkler systems respectively table 3 a slight improved performance of the simulation was observed for the sprinkler system over the drip system this may be related to the atmospheric type of boundary condition which showed strong promise for the sprinkler system while the sprinkler system allowed almost uniform infiltration over the entire surface the infiltration was almost localized under the drip system this may lead to the delay in reaching the infiltration water from the emitter to the sensors though overall there was good agreement between the simulated and measured soil water content some smaller differences may be attributable to spatial heterogeneity and observation errors vazifedoust et al 2008 3 2 2 recharge estimation using numerical modeling fig 6 shows the monthly pgr and input water under the three irrigation systems the estimated monthly pgr varied between 1 and 115 5 mm with an average of 8 6 mm under the furrow system from 1997 to 2017 fig 6a the long term estimated pgr under the drip system was almost zero fig 6b there was only one peak in the monthly pgr began in late december 2011 and became zero after a one year cycle this was due to the high amount of monthly precipitation in october 2011 127 4 mm estimated monthly pgr rates under the sprinkler system showed three non zero cycles and were related to the excessive amounts of water input fig 6c overall the furrow system consistently contributed to higher groundwater recharge over water saving systems drip and sprinkler especially in the months when farmers rely more on groundwater and less on precipitation fig 6 along with the total pgr the rates also varied among different irrigation systems the highest rate was 15 98 mm d 1 0 003 mm d 1 and 0 12 mm d 1 for furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively the pgr rates started to increase in late february and reached the maximum in april fig 6a the lag of 20 50 days between peak input water and maximum recharge was attributed to the antecedent moisture accumulation fig 6a under the furrow system the maximum value was observed in late april 2003 there was an episodic wet period during this time consisting of up to 13 consecutive days about 80 mm of rainfall between two irrigation events increasing the total amount of water stored in the soil profile eventually the higher antecedent water content increased water movement from following the irrigation events skaggs et al 2010 and led to an increased pgr rate this showed the complexity of the recharge process in arid and semi arid regions application of a fraction of rainfall and irrigation events as recharge might be appropriate in wet areas with a regular irrigation schedule and continuous recharge process however the use of such a method could be an over simplified approach in arid and semi arid regions with episodic rainfall and irregular irrigation events the total estimated pgr also varied greatly under different irrigation systems fig 7 the cumulative pgr was 222 7 1 4 and 8 3 cm under furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation systems during the simulation period respectively additionally the actual transpiration was frequently lower than the potential rate because soil water at various times was insufficient to sustain the potential uptake rate jiménez martínez et al 2009 overall considering the same cropping system and land use there was less pgr and transpiration as less water was applied through irrigation while a high percentage of the applied water under the furrow system was not used by plants and percolated down to recharge groundwater water saving irrigation systems eliminated this potential liu et al 2012 wang et al 2008 3 2 2 1 long term water balance components simulated annual water budget components under the three irrigation systems are summarized in table 4 in the long term irrigation increased actual evapotranspiration and accelerated the field water cycle the percentages of the applied water precipitation p irrigation i contributed to recharge of the groundwater were 14 83 under the furrow system 0 14 under the drip system and 0 8 under the sprinkler system this was in par with other studies carried out in the same region or elsewhere with similar climate for example recharge coefficient was reported between 0 13 and 0 27 using tritium and bromide tracing data for wheat and maize wang et al 2008 variation of 4 38 7 using lysimeter data for wheat by jafari et al 2012 18 using water budget method by mohammadi et al 2014 and 0 34 using lysemeter data for cotton hu et al 2017 for drip irrigation 53 return flow was reported in cotton by li et al 2016 and 23 by hu et al 2017 for sprinkler irrigation wang et al 2008 estimated coefficients between 0 08 and 0 1 for wheat and maize the demonstrated variability of the recharge rate reflects the influence of different crops cultivation practices irrigation systems soil types climatic conditions and time scale scanlon et al 2006 the recharge under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19 228 mm yr 1 with an average of 111 3 mm yr 1 annual input water p i for the same period varied between 627 and 1042 mm yr 1 with an average of 750 mm yr 1 unlike this the sprinkler system contributed to a total of 4 1 mm and drip system contributed to a total of 0 7 mm to recharge the groundwater this clearly showed that despite its higher water use efficiency the water saving irrigation systems with low deep drainage rates create a lack of excess water to recharge groundwater unless other recharge methods are in use therefore short term water saving under these systems may affect the long term sustainability of groundwater the amount of groundwater that was available after 20 years of planting was substantially higher 222 7 cm under the furrow system than that of the water saving systems table 4 as these methods use groundwater as a source even low rates of pgr may affect the future available groundwater resources however paying for the same amount of water may increase the irrigation area with no significant change in the total water supply which may lead to a further decrease in the quantity of water infiltration liu et al 2012 3 2 3 soil water storage variations soil water storage is an important parameter for considering soil water fluxes which are related to applied water plant growth surface and subsurface runoff li et al 2016 soil water storage of the soil profile 0 200 cm over the simulated period was investigated under different irrigation systems fig 8 soil water storage decreased during the fallow periods and dry months the magnitude of soil water fluctuations was smaller in water saving systems it indicated that water saving systems decelerated the field water cycle the amount of water stored in soil profile under surface irrigation system was in average 5 cm compared to water saving systems as it can be seen from the fig 8 the amount of stored water in water saving system decreased to 25 cm the minimum value of soil water storage dividing this value by the soil profile thickness resulted in a value 0 125 closer to residual water content on the other hand there was no estimated considerable pgr for these systems it reminds that under water saving systems with minimum deep percolation most of the irrigation and precipitation water was lost through evapotranspiration and or changes in soil water storage as a result this form of irrigation systems may be great for the area with shallow water table in such areas applying water saving irrigation can prevent deep percolation and results in decline water table depth to remove the fluctuation effects on the root zone however in arid and semi arid regions with deep groundwater level where irrigation return flow is one of the main sources of recharge water saving systems may disconnect the relation between root zone and unsaturated zone for long term agricultural activities 3 2 3 1 uncertainty and sensitivity assessment the experimental and numerical approach used in the present study may be affected by several potential sources of uncertainty uncertainty may exist in building the soil column the daily reference evapotranspiration rate et 0 crop coefficient kc model parameters such as the soil hydraulic parameters and the long term amount of irrigation input water however in previous studies the model parameter uncertainty has been investigated using simple sensitivity analysis in order to avoid the complexity of considering all parameters jiménez martínez et al 2009 lu et al 2011 min et al 2015 this was achieved by perturbing increasing or decreasing the soil hydraulic parameters in eqs 4 and 5 by 10 20 and 30 one at a time in all soil layers while other parameters were kept unchanged table 1 the changes in the magnitude of recharge rate due to different soil hydraulic parameters were investigated fig 9 shows the order of sensitivity of the parameters including θs n α θr and l for groundwater recharge except for the lower bound of ks these changes were relatively small and somewhat expected for simulations in which rainfall irrigation and evaporation rates were mostly imposed as boundary conditions lu et al 2011 reducing the ks by 30 resulted in an increase of 45 in the estimated recharge this may be due to the low hydraulic conductivity in the root zone which keeps the surface soil close to saturation for a long period of time such that the uptake might have been reduced according to eq 3 and hence the increase of simulated drainage jiménez martínez et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis for atmospheric boundary conditions and effects of climatic data appear to be included in et0 kc causes a similar effect to etp according to eq 7 and it is not included in this analysis perturbations in et0 caused greater change in the estimated recharge rates for sprinkler system table 5 with regard to the water inputs i e irrigation and precipitation the greatest change in recharge is not always due to changes in irrigation but also to variations in precipitation for water saving systems table 5 changing water saving system s water input caused greater uncertainty than furrow system it reveals in the case the magnitude of the recharge rate is small relative to that of other variables small inaccuracies in values of those variables commonly result in large uncertainties in the recharge rate scanlon et al 2002 however the irrigation amount could not be supplied accurately for long term simulations as the irrigation activity of farmers was not administered uniformly and consistently it can affect the change in recharge rates by up to 20 min et al 2015 the present study estimated that though the water saving irrigation systems reduced water consumption it almost impaired the recharge of groundwater groundwater recharge estimation in the karaj region showed that the irrigation system can change groundwater recharge intensity and duration as irrigation return flow is one of the main sources of recharge in the karaj region the recharge intensity of groundwater became weaker in water saving irrigation than in the traditional furrow system 4 summary and conclusions the present study used an experimental and numerical method to investigate the long term impact of different irrigation systems on potential groundwater recharge pgr in a semi arid region in iran a large soil column with three sections was constructed and instrumented to collect accurate soil water data under three different irrigation systems including furrow drip and sprinkler over a 140 day period 26 december 2016 15 may 2017 overall there was minimal change in soil water content at deep layers under water saving irrigation systems e g drip and sprinkler however when there was a very high amount of water application either rainfall or irrigation deep drainage took place in this case 18 and 21 of the applied water drained during the very high application rate under drip and sprinkler systems respectively the antecedent soil water content also affected the wetting front and deep drainage the response time for deep drainage was around 40 days under furrow irrigation the system drained the maximum amount of water the laboratory measured soil water content and pressure head data under furrow irrigation were then used to calibrate the hydrus 1d model in addition the soil water content data under drip and sprinkler irrigation were used to validate the model the results show a strong agreement r2 as high as 0 97 between the measured and estimated data the calibrated model was then used to simulate long term natural pgr under different irrigation systems between 1997 and 2017 while the furrow system contributed to groundwater recharge at the maximum level 222 7 cm in the last 20 years the groundwater recharge under water saving methods was minimal 1 4 and 8 3 cm under drip and sprinkler systems respectively the recharge coefficients were 14 83 0 14 and 0 8 for the furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively estimated groundwater recharge after 20 years of planting was substantially higher 222 7 cm under furrow irrigation as compared to water saving systems in arid and semi arid regions with sporadic rainfall events irrigation return flow is the main source of groundwater recharge from the mass balance model it can be inferred that groundwater recharge would be higher with furrow irrigation which was already expected shifting from furrow irrigation to water saving irrigation systems can reduce soil water storage in soil profile in the long term it may disconnect the relation of flow dynamics between root zone and unsaturated zone in arid and semiarid regions however there are many external possibly negative effects that were not considered such as water quality nitrate leaching etc many limitations may affect the results especially tracking water inputs thus it is recommended there be further investigation on the inputs and outputs of different irrigation systems water quality effects and other methods of groundwater recharge should be considered acknowledgments this research was supported by a research fund of the soil conservation and watershed management research institute scwmri of iran and the natural

7017,water saving irrigation systems e g drip and sprinkler conserve water but they can reduce potential groundwater recharge pgr over traditional systems e g furrow and may impair sustainability particularly in arid and semi arid regions this study used a hybrid experimental and numerical approach to determine the effects of different irrigation systems on the dynamics of pgr in a semi arid region a 210 cm tall 300 cm long and 150 cm wide soil column was prepared to simulate the soil environment of the karaj region in iran a range of soil and environmental properties were monitored during a winter wheat cropping season 140 days under different irrigation systems treatments soil water content and drainage were measured under each irrigation system and these were used to a calculate different components of water balance and b model long term soil water flow dynamics using hydrus 1d about 14 83 0 14 and 0 80 of the applied water as irrigation and precipitation under furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively were drained below 200 cm and this was estimated as the pgr annual pgr under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19 228 mm with an average of 111 3 mm however mean annual pgr under the sprinkler 4 1 mm and drip 0 7 mm was an order of magnitude lower than furrow irrigation deep drainage leading to pgr under the water saving methods was observed only after a very large rainfall event the absence of large rainfall events between irrigations reduced pgr under water saving irrigation systems in the arid and semi arid region the simulated model was further used to estimate the total amount of pgr over a 20 year period of wheat cultivation furrow irrigation estimated much higher amounts of pgr 222 7 cm over drip and sprinkler systems this raised questions about the sustainability of water saving irrigation methods in the study area as groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these areas the recharge capacity of the adopted methods is critical to ensure the future availability and use of groundwater in the karaj region of iran as well as similar arid and semi arid regions elsewhere keywords potential groundwater

et al 2013 various water saving irrigation systems e g drip sub surface drip and sprinkler have been developed and applied throughout the world to increase irrigation efficiency which has affected groundwater recharge a large body of literature investigated the efficiency of these irrigation systems over more conventional ones abd el wahed and ali 2013 al jamal et al 2001 amer 2011 banedjschafie et al 2008 dar et al 2017 eranki et al 2017 fulton et al 1991 hansona et al 1997 hassanli et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2013 almost all these studies indicated that water saving irrigation systems eliminated deep drainage by increasing water efficiency and almost doubled crop production some researchers have pointed out that the alternate use of saved water in some areas cooley et al 2008 while others indicated an increase in the total irrigated area using the saved water this resulted in increased evapotranspiration from more intensive cropping leading to an overall increase in consumptive water use peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 scheierling et al 2006a scheierling et al 2006b ward and pulido velazquez 2008 whittlesey and huffaker 1995 in general the increased water use efficiency began motivating more and more irrigators to switch from furrow to more efficient irrigation systems however areas where the groundwater is the main source for irrigation the switch may lead to reduced groundwater recharge from irrigation return flow due to the efficient use of applied water this is more important in arid and semi arid areas where evapotranspiration typically exceeds precipitation during most seasons leading to practically negligible continuous recharge from precipitation qin et al 2011 and surface water in an irrigated area with a deep water table downward soil water flux from the bottom of the root zone deep drainage is often referred to as potential groundwater recharge pgr min et al 2015 radford et al 2009 wohling et al 2012 generally if deep drainage is not hampered by low hydraulic conductivity horizons in the deep vadose zone or lateral flow to nearby local depressions it could eventually completely recharge the groundwater after a delay de vries and simmers 2002 therefore deep drainage below the root zone under an irrigation system could be considered as the source of groundwater recharge and in this case as the pgr this is more critical in areas where groundwater is the main source of irrigation in recent years unsaturated zone methods physical methods tracer methods and numerical modeling for estimating groundwater recharge have been fully tested and broadly applied in irrigated area but the effects of drip and sprinkler irrigation against furrow system on the dynamics of recharge process in arid and semiarid regions is not entirely clear and requires further study hu et al 2017 most of the studies only assessed the effect within very shallow depths or sparse water content measurements with short time scales one to several years in which the mean value of multi year recharge could not be accurately estimated moreover having a shallow depth of observation may not represent the true recharge due to the dynamics created by roots and other environmental forcing prevailed in shallow layer the natural groundwater cycle in the karaj region of northern iran has changed over the years due to human activities in such a semiarid region where the return flow from irrigation events plays a significant role on pgr knowledge of the way in which groundwater recharge is affected by the changes in natural and anthropogenic factors particularly irrigation water use is essential for ensuring effective management of available water supplies simons et al 2015 the main objective of this research was to assess the impact of three irrigation systems including drip sprinkler and furrow on pgr using an experimental and numerical modelling approach the study was conducted in controlled conditions using a soil column for collecting data to simulate the field conditions of the karaj region of iran and modelled for long term variability of natural pgr processes using hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2005 2 experimental investigation 2 1 methods 2 1 1 experimental soil column and site location a large soil column 210 cm in height 300 cm in length and 150 cm in width was prepared using optically clear acrylic on the front wall and steel sheets on the other walls fig 1 two dividers were used to separate the column into three equal cells with 15 000 cm2 or 1 5 m2 surface area to apply three irrigation systems i e furrow drip and sprinkler the sheet walls and dividers were sealed carefully to avoid lateral soil water exchange between the cells the column was filled with soil layer by layer collected from a farm 35 47 45 n and 50 56 35 e in the agriculture experimental site seed and plant improvement institute spii of karaj city iran utmost care was taken to maintain the original bulk density during packing of the soil column three cells were prepared simultaneously with the same soil and horizontal thickness to eliminate the effects of variability the column was established at laboratory conditions with fewer daylight hours and protected from natural rainfall by using a tent soil physical properties were characterized on the undisturbed samples collected from a soil profile excavated adjacent to the sampling location the 2 m deep profile was sectioned into four layers and sampled to determine soil bulk density grossman and reinsch 2002 soil water retention curve dane and hopmans 2002 and soil texture gee and or 2002 in laboratory vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was measured in the laboratory using falling head experiments on undisturbed soil cores collected from each layer table 1 each cell was installed with two vertical time domain reflectometry tdr profile probes pr2 profile probe delta t devices ltd with seven sensors at 10 20 30 40 60 100 and 150 cm depths from the top to measure soil water content fig 1b three tensiometers t5 x ums inc germany were installed in the furrow irrigation cell to monitor the pressure head at a 5 min interval and at depths of 30 60 and 120 cm using tensiometers ums inc germany fig 1 in addition two vertical sets of piezometers were installed in each cell to compare the impact of the sheet walls on the flow directions during saturated conditions at a depth of 30 60 120 and 150 cm from the top one set was fixed on the sheet wall while another one was installed at 40 cm away from the sheet wall at the same depths fig 1 a 10 cm drainage layer gravel with a tap was installed at the lower boundary of each cell for measuring the drainage rate the progression of wetting front s was monitored from the accurate soil water and drainage measurements over a 140 day period from 26 december 2016 to 15 may 2017 irrigation application rates were controlled using a flow meter installed at the top under all irrigation systems fig 1c the drip irrigation system was designed with a 16 mm inside diameter tube for water supply emitters to supply water at 4 l h 1 and an emitter spacing of 30 cm in total 6 emitters were installed for the drip irrigation system a sprinkler nozzle was installed at 2 m above to simulate rainfall intensity of 50 mm h 1 a temporary tent was used to protect the furrow and drip cells from the splash of the sprinkler cell furrow irrigation applications were carried out using two small furrows at the top the most common cropping system in the karaj region is winter wheat with a typical growing season between early november and mid june of the following year generally depending on the availability and variability of rainfall 5 7 irrigation events of 70 mm for furrow irrigation 8 10 irrigation events of 30 mm for drip irrigation and 10 12 irrigation events of 30 mm for sprinkler irrigation are a widespread practice in the area table 2 these practices were adopted in the current study to represent the irrigation management in the karaj region the soil water budget in a vertical soil column was expressed as yazaki et al 2006 1 et i d r δ s where i and dr were irrigation flow meter and drainage rates measured respectively δ s the change in soil water storage was calculated by multiplying the thickness of each layer to the corresponding change in water content 2 2 results 2 2 1 measured water balance components fig 2 shows measured water content at 40 100 and 150 cm under the different irrigation systems under the furrow system water content changed right after irrigation at the 40 cm depth even with a small amount e g sixth irrigation event while the deeper layers responded with a time lag fig 2a however there was almost no change in water content at deeper depths for drip and sprinkler systems until a relatively large amount of water was applied i e fifth event overall changes in water content at 150 cm were smooth and without sharp peaks except after the fifth event with minimal deep percolation under water saving irrigation systems fig 2b c a large amount of water was applied during the fifth event to test the effects of water content on the propagation of the wetting front during subsequent events in soils with higher amounts of antecedent water content in the profile i e after applying the fifth event the wetting front tended to move deeper and deep drainage increased figs 2b c and 3b c which was in agreement with the results reported by bethune et al 2008 the cumulative drainage was a little higher in the sprinkler system fig 3 c than the drip system fig 3b this was due to a higher amount of infiltration after the fifth event however the drainage amount was relatively smaller and stopped later in the water saving irrigation systems fig 3b c this means that deep drainage almost ceased under water saving irrigation systems unless there were considerably large amounts of water applied however arid and semi arid regions like the karaj region of iran does not normally experience such rainfall events thereby leading to a considerable negative impact on pgr the amount of evapotranspiration was relatively equal for the three systems i e 6 cm 4 5 cm and 4 5 cm in furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively however the soil column was established in laboratory conditions with relatively fewer daylight hours on the contrary the amount of drainage varied under different irrigation systems a total of 57 5 of the applied water drained out under the furrow irrigation system though this amount was zero before the fifth event a total of 18 and 21 of the applied water was drained out under the drip and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively fig 3 drainage response time the time difference between the first irrigation event and the first drainage event min et al 2015 was also calculated and it was found to be around 40 days under the furrow system a quicker response 21 days for the drip system and 16 days for the sprinkler system in the deep drainage was observed after the fifth event 95 days for the drip system and 90 days for the sprinkler system from the first irrigation with identical soil horizons in the three irrigation systems the variability in deep drainage was due only to the amount of water applications under the different irrigation systems 3 numerical investigation 3 1 methods 3 1 1 numerical model and soil hydraulic properties numerical simulations of the irrigation flow dynamics and root water uptake were investigated using the hydrus 1d software package šimunek

θ was the volumetric water content l3 l 3 h was the pressure head l s was a sink term accounting for root water uptake t 1 z was vertical spatial coordinate l t was time t and k was the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function lt 1 the sink term s represented the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to plant water uptake root water uptake was modeled using the function feddes et al 1978 3 s h α h s p where the water stress response function α h was a prescribed dimensionless function of the soil water stress response 0 α 1 to account for reductions in uptake due to drought stress and sp was the potential water uptake rate t 1 for α h the functional form of feddes et al 1978 using hydrus default parameter values for wheat i e h1 0 cm h2 1 cm h3 900

boundary condition with a surface layer was selected at the top of the profile for the three irrigation systems the latter condition allowed water to build up on the surface the height of the surface water layer increased due to precipitation and decreased due to infiltration and evaporation and the value was assumed at 11 cm in the model a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the profile and the initial conditions were measured using tdr sensors and linearly interpolated along the vertical axis the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were described using the

characterization of flow behavior in the layered profile requires a large number of parameters several parameterizations were investigated in this study using different combinations of four layer parameters θr θs ks α and n the parameters were calibrated only when the differences between the calculated and measured water content were larger than the standard deviation uniqueness and stability of the inverse solution were tested repeatedly using different initial estimates for the calibrated parameters to reduce the parameter uncertainty both soil water content and matric potential rather than only soil water content were used to calibrate the model the root mean square error rmse and r squared coefficient r2 were calculated to quantify the deviation of the modeled results from the observed data the calibrated and validated model was then used to assess pgr using long term nov 1997 june 2017 meteorological data the downward flux at the bottom of the soil column below the root zone was assumed to be equal to pgr these recharge simulations were intended to explore the overall water balance of the vadose zone including precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration potential groundwater recharge and change in soil water storage the effects of different irrigation systems on pgr were calculated based on the long term 1 november 1997 31 june 2017 simulated drainage data the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the penman monteith equation and daily values of the potential evapotranspiration etp following allen et al 1998 7 e t p k c e t 0 where kc was a dimensionless crop coefficient and was extracted following allen et al 1998 for all stages of plant growth due to lack of leaf area index lai data potential evaporation ep was calculated from the etp following jiménez martínez et al 2009 8 e p e t f t where the function f t was specified as follows a during mid growing season the ground was fully covered and the effective evaporation was zero or f t 0 b during early growth stages or after planting the ground cover was almost nonexistent thus the potential evaporation was maximum or f t 1 and c the remaining growth stages were modelled using a sigmoid curve jiménez martínez et al 2009 assuming f t 1 at planting to f t 0 at the beginning of the mid growing season eventually daily potential transpiration tp was calculated by subtracting ep from etp dividing etp into ep and tp was necessary as input parameters for hydrus 1d model as atmospheric boundary condition was used in this study the actual amount and the time of irrigation application during the past 20 years were not available however the irrigation time and irrigation amounts were estimated following published works min et al 2015 sun et al 2010 and the farmers irrigation schedule for winter wheat table 2 the irrigation schedule was approximated as follows a rank the annual rainfall events in descending order and b calculate the probability of exceedance of the rainfall events using the hazen method hazen 1930 if the precipitation was greater than the precipitation at 25 probability of exceedance only key irrigation periods must be irrigated as listed in table 2 however if the precipitation was less than the precipitation at 25 probability of exceedance extra irrigation events were included in the schedule values indicated in the parentheses 3 2 results 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the initial simulation of soil water dynamic was not quite in agreement with the observed data when measured soil hydraulic parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity was used however the inverse module of hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2005 improved the estimation of the soil hydraulic parameters table 1 and was found to be an effective tool for evaluating soil water dynamics kandelous et al 2012 ramos et al 2012 there were differences in the measured and inversely predicted hydraulic conductivities table 1 this can be related to the improved results of hydrus 1d simulation when its input parameters are calibrated against dynamic flow measurements kandelous and šimůnek 2010 in general there were good agreements between the observed and simulated soil water content and the pressure heads during calibration of the model the rmse varied between 0 0036 and 0 0244 cm3 cm 3 for water content fig 4 and 13 16 17 49 cm for pressure head fig 5 at different depths the r2 ranged between 0 85 and 0 97 for water content and 0 86 and 0 99 for pressure head at different depths it should be noted that the pressure head was only monitored in the furrow system and used during the calibration step a similar range of validation results were observed using the measured data under the drip and sprinkler systems the r2 varied between 0 83 and 0 93 and 0 87 and 0 94 for drip and sprinkler systems respectively table 3 a slight improved performance of the simulation was observed for the sprinkler system over the drip system this may be related to the atmospheric type of boundary condition which showed strong promise for the sprinkler system while the sprinkler system allowed almost uniform infiltration over the entire surface the infiltration was almost localized under the drip system this may lead to the delay in reaching the infiltration water from the emitter to the sensors though overall there was good agreement between the simulated and measured soil water content some smaller differences may be attributable to spatial heterogeneity and observation errors vazifedoust et al 2008 3 2 2 recharge estimation using numerical modeling fig 6 shows the monthly pgr and input water under the three irrigation systems the estimated monthly pgr varied between 1 and 115 5 mm with an average of 8 6 mm under the furrow system from 1997 to 2017 fig 6a the long term estimated pgr under the drip system was almost zero fig 6b there was only one peak in the monthly pgr began in late december 2011 and became zero after a one year cycle this was due to the high amount of monthly precipitation in october 2011 127 4 mm estimated monthly pgr rates under the sprinkler system showed three non zero cycles and were related to the excessive amounts of water input fig 6c overall the furrow system consistently contributed to higher groundwater recharge over water saving systems drip and sprinkler especially in the months when farmers rely more on groundwater and less on precipitation fig 6 along with the total pgr the rates also varied among different irrigation systems the highest rate was 15 98 mm d 1 0 003 mm d 1 and 0 12 mm d 1 for furrow drip and sprinkler systems respectively the pgr rates started to increase in late february and reached the maximum in april fig 6a the lag of 20 50 days between peak input water and maximum recharge was attributed to the antecedent moisture accumulation fig 6a under the furrow system the maximum value was observed in late april 2003 there was an episodic wet period during this time consisting of up to 13 consecutive days about 80 mm of rainfall between two irrigation events increasing the total amount of water stored in the soil profile eventually the higher antecedent water content increased water movement from following the irrigation events skaggs et al 2010 and led to an increased pgr rate this showed the complexity of the recharge process in arid and semi arid regions application of a fraction of rainfall and irrigation events as recharge might be appropriate in wet areas with a regular irrigation schedule and continuous recharge process however the use of such a method could be an over simplified approach in arid and semi arid regions with episodic rainfall and irregular irrigation events the total estimated pgr also varied greatly under different irrigation systems fig 7 the cumulative pgr was 222 7 1 4 and 8 3 cm under furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation systems during the simulation period respectively additionally the actual transpiration was frequently lower than the potential rate because soil water at various times was insufficient to sustain the potential uptake rate jiménez martínez et al 2009 overall considering the same cropping system and land use there was less pgr and transpiration as less water was applied through irrigation while a high percentage of the applied water under the furrow system was not used by plants and percolated down to recharge groundwater water saving irrigation systems eliminated this potential liu et al 2012 wang et al 2008 3 2 2 1 long term water balance components simulated annual water budget components under the three irrigation systems are summarized in table 4 in the long term irrigation increased actual evapotranspiration and accelerated the field water cycle the percentages of the applied water precipitation p irrigation i contributed to recharge of the groundwater were 14 83 under the furrow system 0 14 under the drip system and 0 8 under the sprinkler system this was in par with other studies carried out in the same region or elsewhere with similar climate for example recharge coefficient was reported between 0 13 and 0 27 using tritium and bromide tracing data for wheat and maize wang et al 2008 variation of 4 38 7 using lysimeter data for wheat by jafari et al 2012 18 using water budget method by mohammadi et al 2014 and 0 34 using lysemeter data for cotton hu et al 2017 for drip irrigation 53 return flow was reported in cotton by li et al 2016 and 23 by hu et al 2017 for sprinkler irrigation wang et al 2008 estimated coefficients between 0 08 and 0 1 for wheat and maize the demonstrated variability of the recharge rate reflects the influence of different crops cultivation practices irrigation systems soil types climatic conditions and time scale scanlon et al 2006 the recharge under furrow irrigation was estimated in the range of 19 228 mm yr 1 with an average of 111 3 mm yr 1 annual input water p i for the same period varied between 627 and 1042 mm yr 1 with an average of 750 mm yr 1 unlike this the sprinkler system contributed to a total of 4 1 mm and drip system contributed to a total of 0 7 mm to recharge the groundwater this clearly showed that despite its higher water use efficiency the water saving irrigation systems with low deep drainage rates create a lack of excess water to recharge groundwater unless other recharge methods are in use therefore short term water saving under these systems may affect the long term sustainability of groundwater the amount of groundwater that was available after 20 years of planting was substantially higher 222 7 cm under the furrow system than that of the water saving systems table 4 as these methods use groundwater as a source even low rates of pgr may affect the future available groundwater resources however paying for the same amount of water may increase the irrigation area with no significant change in the total water supply which may lead to a further decrease in the quantity of water infiltration liu et al 2012 3 2 3 soil water storage variations soil water storage is an important parameter for considering soil water fluxes which are related to applied water plant growth surface and subsurface runoff li et al 2016 soil water storage of the soil profile 0 200 cm over the simulated period was investigated under different irrigation systems fig 8 soil water storage decreased during the fallow periods and dry months the magnitude of soil water fluctuations was smaller in water saving systems it indicated that water saving systems decelerated the field water cycle the amount of water stored in soil profile under surface irrigation system was in average 5 cm compared to water saving systems as it can be seen from the fig 8 the amount of stored water in water saving system decreased to 25 cm the minimum value of soil water storage dividing this value by the soil profile thickness resulted in a value 0 125 closer to residual water content on the other hand there was no estimated considerable pgr for these systems it reminds that under water saving systems with minimum deep percolation most of the irrigation and precipitation water was lost through evapotranspiration and or changes in soil water storage as a result this form of irrigation systems may be great for the area with shallow water table in such areas applying water saving irrigation can prevent deep percolation and results in decline water table depth to remove the fluctuation effects on the root zone however in arid and semi arid regions with deep groundwater level where irrigation return flow is one of the main sources of recharge water saving systems may disconnect the relation between root zone and unsaturated zone for long term agricultural activities 3 2 3 1 uncertainty and sensitivity assessment the experimental and numerical approach used in the present study may be affected by several potential sources of uncertainty uncertainty may exist in building the soil column the daily reference evapotranspiration rate et 0 crop coefficient kc model parameters such as the soil hydraulic parameters and the long term amount of irrigation input water however in previous studies the model parameter uncertainty has been investigated using simple sensitivity analysis in order to avoid the complexity of considering all parameters jiménez martínez et al 2009 lu et al 2011 min et al 2015 this was achieved by perturbing increasing or decreasing the soil hydraulic parameters in eqs 4 and 5 by 10 20 and 30 one at a time in all soil layers while other parameters were kept unchanged table 1 the changes in the magnitude of recharge rate due to different soil hydraulic parameters were investigated fig 9 shows the order of sensitivity of the parameters including θs n α θr and l for groundwater recharge except for the lower bound of ks these changes were relatively small and somewhat expected for simulations in which rainfall irrigation and evaporation rates were mostly imposed as boundary conditions lu et al 2011 reducing the ks by 30 resulted in an increase of 45 in the estimated recharge this may be due to the low hydraulic conductivity in the root zone which keeps the surface soil close to saturation for a long period of time such that the uptake might have been reduced according to eq 3 and hence the increase of simulated drainage jiménez martínez et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis for atmospheric boundary conditions and effects of climatic data appear to be included in et0 kc causes a similar effect to etp according to eq 7 and it is not included in this analysis perturbations in et0 caused greater change in the estimated recharge rates for sprinkler system table 5 with regard to the water inputs i e irrigation and precipitation the greatest change in recharge is not always due to changes in irrigation but also to variations in precipitation for water saving systems table 5 changing water saving system s water input caused greater uncertainty than furrow system it reveals in the case the magnitude of the recharge rate is small relative to that of other variables small inaccuracies in values of those variables commonly result in large uncertainties in the recharge rate scanlon et al 2002 however the irrigation amount could not be supplied accurately for long term simulations as the irrigation activity of farmers was not administered uniformly and consistently it can affect the change in recharge rates by up to 20 min et al 2015 the present study estimated that though the water saving irrigation systems reduced water consumption it almost impaired the recharge of groundwater groundwater recharge estimation in the karaj region showed that the irrigation system can change groundwater recharge intensity and duration as irrigation return flow is one of the main sources of recharge in the karaj region the recharge intensity of groundwater became weaker in water saving irrigation than in the traditional furrow system 4 summary and conclusions the present study used an experimental and numerical method to investigate the long term impact of different irrigation systems on potential groundwater recharge pgr in a semi arid region in iran a large soil column with three sections was constructed and instrumented to collect accurate soil water data under three different irrigation systems including furrow drip and sprinkler over a 140 day period 26 december 2016 15 may 2017 overall there was minimal change in soil water content at deep layers under water saving irrigation systems e g drip and sprinkler however when there was a very high amount of water application either rainfall or irrigation deep drainage took place in this case 18 and 21 of the applied water drained during the very high application rate under drip and sprinkler systems respectively the antecedent soil water content also affected the wetting front and deep drainage the response time for deep drainage was around 40 days under furrow irrigation the system drained the maximum amount of water the laboratory measured soil water content and pressure head data under furrow irrigation were then used to calibrate the hydrus 1d model in addition the soil water content data under drip and sprinkler irrigation were used to validate the model the results show a strong agreement r2 as high as 0 97 between the measured and estimated data the calibrated model was then used to simulate long term natural pgr under different irrigation systems between 1997 and 2017 while the furrow system contributed to groundwater recharge at the maximum level 222 7 cm in the last 20 years the groundwater recharge under water saving methods was minimal 1 4 and 8 3 cm under drip and sprinkler systems respectively the recharge coefficients were 14 83 0 14 and 0 8 for the furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively estimated groundwater recharge after 20 years of planting was substantially higher 222 7 cm under furrow irrigation as compared to water saving systems in arid and semi arid regions with sporadic rainfall events irrigation return flow is the main source of groundwater recharge from the mass balance model it can be inferred that groundwater recharge would be higher with furrow irrigation which was already expected shifting from furrow irrigation to water saving irrigation systems can reduce soil water storage in soil profile in the long term it may disconnect the relation of flow dynamics between root zone and unsaturated zone in arid and semiarid regions however there are many external possibly negative effects that were not considered such as water quality nitrate leaching etc many limitations may affect the results especially tracking water inputs thus it is recommended there be further investigation on the inputs and outputs of different irrigation systems water quality effects and other methods of groundwater recharge should be considered acknowledgments this research was supported by a research fund of the soil conservation and watershed management research institute scwmri of iran and the natural

china changjiang survey planning design and research co ltd wuhan 430015 china corresponding author this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of purna chandra nayak associate editor short term power generation operation is an important content in the hydropower station management because of the limitation of forecast accuracy there is error between the forecasted runoff process and actual runoff process when the hydropower station operation is near the water level boundaries such as normal water level or dead water level this error is likely to bring the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in order to precisely evaluate the near boundary operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model was proposed in this paper by taking the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable the coupling of hydrological forecasting error and the short term operation risk of hydropower station based on credibility theory was realized and the solving process of the model based on fuzzy simulation technology was provided in detail different near boundary operation risks of hydropower station can be analyzed and evaluated by the simulation with different water level combinations in this model the high risk area and suggested operation area of jinxi hydropower station in different near boundary operation situations were clearly identified in the case study the intuitive results of this model can provide a strong technical support for the decision making of the dispatchers when making the power generation plans in the actual production so that to avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and effectively improve the efficiency of water resources utilization keywords power generation runoff forecasting error near boundary panoramic fuzzy risk analysis credibility theory 1 introduction in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station the power generation plan is a very important basis for the actual production shayesteh et al 2016 li et al 2014 it is essentially the standard of production activities for the hydropower station in the next day wang et al 2013 and it has the normative effect and cannot be changed under normal circumstances peng et al 2015 however due to the accuracy limitation of runoff forecasting yuan et al 2016 lu et al 2015 there are uncertain factors in the next day s hydropower station operation which causes the non matching of formulation and implementation of power generation plan existed objectively ji et al 2014a ge et al 2014 so in the actual operation the reservoir water level usually goes beyond the limited water levels because of the runoff forecasting errors and this leads to a large number of abandoned water or output shortage under the normal circumstances due to the storage capacity and regulation of reservoir zmijewski and wörman 2016 the effect of water level deviation caused by the runoff forecasting error can be ignored li et al 2015 but when the operating water level of reservoir is already near the boundary such as close to the normal water level or the dead water level the available reservoir storage volume that can be used to store or supply water is decreased thus the regulation function of reservoir is greatly reduced at this moment that may result in a large number of abandoned water or output shortage lu et al 2009 therefore it is very necessary to carry out the risk analysis for the near boundary operation of hydropower station based on the runoff forecasting uncertainty and quantify the risks of hydropower station in different near boundary operation cases so that to provide a scientific basis and decision support for the runoff forecasting based short term power generation operation the near boundary operation of hydropower station and the corresponding control belong to the category of risk scheduling thus the risk analysis is very necessary in the risk analysis of hydropower generation operation based on runoff forecasting the forecasting error is one of the most important risk factors zhang et al 2011 at present the research in this field has already obtained a lot of achievements but the researches mostly focus on the random characteristics of forecasting error and the risk analysis methods are mainly based on probability theory and mathematical statistics yan et al 2014 such as the typical probability distribution function calculation method mondal et al 2012 fares et al 2014 the bayesian theorem based risk rate calculation method biondi and luca 2013 chen et al 2018 and probability combination method lagadec et al 2016 etc the research on the fuzziness of forecasting error are still rare nowadays the mathematical methods used to describe and study the objective phenomenon are generally divided into deterministic methods and uncertainty methods and the latter mainly includes random methods and fuzzy methods however due to the complexity of the objective world and the constantly changes caused by perpetual motion the random phenomena in fact is not inherently random when people use the random methods to deal with it in addition to randomness it also has a more general fuzzy uncertainty jiang et al 2015a as we known the hydrological forecasting model is affected by input uncertainty its own structure uncertainty parameter uncertainty and many other artificial uncertainties it is complex and difficult to be described accurately cheng et al 2015 li et al 2018 thus in a runoff forecasting the forecasting error is influenced by many objective and subjective factors huang et al 2014 and its size does not have a definite limit in quantity it not only has randomness but also has a lot of fuzziness jiang et al 2016 that the forecasted runoff value falls into a certain range as shown in fig 1 therefore the single study on the randomness of hydrological forecasting error cannot fully express the uncertainty of error and it also cannot effectively reflect the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in the short term hydropower station operation so it is necessary to carry out the risk analysis for the short term hydropower station operation based on the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error there are three types of measures in fuzzy mathematics i e probability measure necessity measure and credibility measure lu et al 2011 in the probability measure theory an event with the probability measure of 1 indicates that the event is most likely to happen but does not necessarily happen and an event with the probability measure of 0 indicates that the event is most unlikely to happen but it doesn t mean that it doesn t happen so this is easy to cause the decision chaos in comparison the credibility theory has the self duality i e the event with the credibility measure of 1 must happen and the event with the credibility measure of 0 must not happen liu and peng 2005 thus the fuzzy evaluation result based on credibility measure is more accord with people s thinking habits and it is easy to understand and accept and it also eliminates the decision chaos that the traditional membership degree calculation may cause so on the whole it is more appropriate to use the credibility measure to study the fuzziness of forecasting error zeng et al 2014 nowadays fuzzy set theory has made a great progress and has been applied in many practical fields sun et al 2016 in 2004 liu successfully established the axiomatic system of credibility measure liu 2004 i e the credibility theory which is similar to the axiomatic system of probability theory the credibility theory is a new mathematical branch to study the quantitative law of fuzzy phenomena and its emergence based on axiomatic approach provides a new way to explore the new fuzzy risk analysis method liu 2009 at present the fuzzy risk evaluation method based on credibility theory has been successfully applied in many fields jiang et al 2015b davari et al 2014 such as power system operation risk assessment feng et al 2008 hu et al 2011 unit combination problem ju et al 2016 skulimowski 2013 economic scheduling problem xin and xiao 2011 reliability evaluation zhao and liu 2005 power grid planning ernster and srivastava 2012 enterprise investment portfolio huang 2006 capital budget issues huang 2007 and the optimal allocation of water resources zhong et al 2013 etc which greatly promoted the spread and development of credibility theory however this theory is rarely used on the research of risk analysis of hydropower station operation based on the fuzziness of forecasting error especially on the optimal fuzzy control of near boundary operation of hydropower station therefore the credibility theory can be used to describe the fuzzy characteristic of runoff forecasting error and carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation in view of this this paper proposed a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model based credibility theory this model can not only make the fuzzy characteristic of forecasting error be effectively expressed in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station sampath and ramya 2014 but also realize the interdisciplinary application and cross integration of new mathematic theories and technologies in water resources management and further develop and improve the risk control theory in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station which has a far reaching theoretical significance particularly in practical point of view through the proposed model different near boundary operation risks can be analyzed for the hydropower station by the simulation of formulating and implementing the power generation plan with different water level combinations so the high risk area of hydropower station in short term operation can be clearly identified and the intuitive results i e the risk distribution map of the model can provide a strong technical support for the dispatchers to avoid the high risk situations in making the power generation plan in actual production so that to effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization it has a far reaching practical application value the following parts of this paper are organized as follows section 2 is the methodologies including a detailed formulation of short term power generation operation model of hydropower station a brief introduction of credibility theory the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model of hydropower station operation near the boundary and its solution section 3 presents a case study of jinxi hydropower station in china and the results will be presented and analyzed in this section finally the conclusions of this study will be provided in section 4 2 methodologies 2 1 short term power generation operation model and its solving method in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station two models are involved one is used to make a power generation plan and the other is used to implement the determined power generation plan taking the operation of a single reservoir as an example the two models are presented as follows 1 model for making a power generation plan and its solving method power generation is a significant benefit derived from the reservoir system the short term operation aims at maximizing the power generation by developing an optimal plan over the entire planning horizon while satisfying all kinds of physical and operational constraints generally the forecasted inflow process the initial and final water levels of operation period are determined in this model and the objective function of the model can be represented as 1 e max t 1 t n t q t h t δ t where n t k q t h t where e is the total hydropower generation for all stages over the entire planning horizon in kwh nt is the output function of the tth stage which is determined by k qt and h t k is the efficiency coefficient of the hydropower station qt is the outflow through the turbines in the tth stage in m3 s ht is the average water head of the hydropower station in the tth stage in m t is the total number of stages over the entire planning horizon t is the stage index δt is the duration of an operation stage in second the constraints including ① the water volume balance equation 2 v t 1 v t i t q t q l o s s t δ t where vt is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of the tth stage in m3 vt 1 is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of the tth stage in m3 qlosst is the outflow through flood discharge gate in the tth stage in m3 which is unused for power generation i t i it is the total inflow of the reservoir in the tth stage in m3 s ② reservoir volume limits 3 v t min v t v t max where vt max is the upper limit of reservoir storage volume in the tth stage in m3 vt min is the lower limit of reservoir storage volume in the tth stage in m3 ③ power generation limits 4 n t min n t n t max where ni t is the output of the hydropower station in the tth stage in kw nt min is the lower limit of ni t nt max is the upper limit of ni t ④ water resources required at downstream reservoir limits 5 q t min q t q t max where qt is the total outflow of the reservoir in the tth stage in m3 s and qt qt qlosst qt max is the upper limit of qt which is usually determined by the downstream river channel capacity qt min is the lower limit of qt which is usually determined by the ecological flow of downstream ⑤ boundary conditions limits 6 v 0 v begin v t v end where v 0 is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of the first stage in m3 vbegin is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of entire planning horizon in m3 vt is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of the tth stage in m3 vend is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of entire planning horizon in m3 dynamic programming dp can be used to solve this model which is good at solving multi stage optimization decision problems recursively dividing the reservoir operation into sub operations based on operation intervals dp yields the optimal solution to the whole problem by using the solutions of sub operations a recursive procedure is involved in the application of dp to reservoir operation optimization problem the recursive equation for the tth stage is 7 f t v t 1 m 1 max d t n t v t 1 m 1 q t f t 1 v t m 2 f t 1 v t m 2 0 where qt is the decision variable which is determined by beginning state vm 1 t 1 and end state vm 2 t vt is the state variable dt is decision variables set in the tth stage ft vm 1 t 1 is the optimal cumulative output of beginning state m1 at the tth stage ft 1 vm 2 t is the optimal cumulative output of beginning state m2 at the t 1 th stage the dp model consists of two procedures which are reverse recursion procedure and chronological order recursion procedure in the reverse recursion procedure starting from the last stage the output is calculated up to the first stage and the line of the optimal operation can be obtained at last by the calculation with chronological order recursion procedure the solving steps of this model by dp can be summarized as follows and the schematic diagram of dynamic programming is shown in fig 2 step 1 in the last stage t there are s discretized points for the storage volume of reservoir at the beginning of this stage because the storage volume is fixed at the end of this stage the optimal candidate path of each discretized point is unique at this moment step 2 in stage t 1 the storage volume of reservoir is not fixed at the end of this stage so there are also s discretized points for the storage volume for any discretized point at the beginning of this stage such as the second point as shown in fig 2 with the solid line circle its optimal candidate path can be found out by traversing the s discretized points of the storage volume at the end of this stage assuming that it is the third point as shown in fig 2 with the dotted line circle and then save the optimal candidate path and the cumulative output in the memory for the usage of next stage step 3 repeats step 2 then the calculation of stage t 1 can be finished by implementing the same work for the other s 1 discretized points at the beginning of this stage step 4 repeats steps 2 and 3 then the whole calculation of all stages over the entire planning horizon can be finished by this reverse recursion procedure and the optimal candidate path of each discretized point and its optimal cumulative output can be obtained after the calculation step 5 calculates the route and other details of the optimal operation by the chronological recursion process the calculation flowchart of reverse recursion and chronological order recursion is shown in fig 3 ji et al 2014b 2 model for implementing the power generation plan and its solving method in this model the known conditions are the actual inflow process the determined generation plan and the initial water level of operation period this model is established to meet the demand of power generation and there is a deterministic calculation process the main constraint in the calculation is the power balance constraint which can be represented as 8 n t plan n t actual t t where nt plan is the planed output of hydropower station in the tth stage in kw nt actual is the actual output of hydropower station in the tth stage in kw besides the above power balance constraint the constraints represented by formulas 2 5 are also involved in this model in addition for the boundary conditions constraints only the initial water level is fixed in this model and the final water level is not fixed this is different from the model of making the power generation plan the solving steps of this model can be summarized as follows step1 deriving the end water level ht 1 according to the output formula nt kqtht the known beginning water level ht the inflow it and the planed output nt plan the average water head ht used in calculating nt is determined by the beginning water level ht the end water level ht 1 and the downstream tail water level hdown i e ht ht ht 1 2 hdown where hdown is determined by the total outflow qt of reservoir in the tth stage and qt happens to be determined by ht and ht 1 according to the formula 2 thus the iterative computation is used in calculating the end water level ht 1 and the flowchart of this iterative computation process is shown in fig 4 here ht is corresponding to vt and ht 1 is corresponding to vt 1 because of the one to one mapping relationship between reservoir water level and reservoir volume step2 if ht 1 high water level boundary let ht 1 high water level boundary and calculate the output nt actual once again and no iterative computation is required at this moment and the nt actual is not equal to nt plan otherwise turn to step 3 step3 if ht 1 low water level boundary let ht 1 low water level boundary and calculate the output nt actual once again and no iterative computation is required at this moment too and the nt actual is not equal to nt plan otherwise turn to step 4 step4 let t t 1 taking the end water level of the tth stage of reservoir as the beginning water level of the t 1 th stage turn to step 1 until the t t 1 step5 output the details of each stage of the operation period such as the water level variation output variation and abandoning water flow etc 2 2 some fundamentals of credibility theory fuzzy set theory was introduced by zadeh in 1965 zadeh 1965 and it has been employed to solve a variety of practical problems since then in fuzzy set theory credibility measure is parallel to probability measure and it plays the role of probability measure thus a set of axiomatic system based on credibility measure is promoted which is the credibility theory 1 possibility and necessity measure in fuzzy sets there are three important types of measures i e possibility necessity and credibility let θ be a nonempty set and let p θ be the power set of θ for any event a p θ the possibility measure of event a is described by pos a in fuzzy theory let the triplet θ p θ cr be a possibility space for any event a p θ the necessity measure of event a is described by nec a 1 pos ac where a c is the opposite event of a 2 credibility measure credibility measure is similar to probability measure and it is defined as an average of the possibility measure and the necessity measure which can be represented as 9 cr a 1 2 p o s a n e c a 10 orcr ξ a 1 2 sup μ x x a 1 sup μ x x a c where μ is the membership function of fuzzy variable ξ 3 fuzzy variable and membership function fuzzy variable is a measurable function from a credibility space θ p θ cr to the set of real numbers liu 2002 let ξ be a fuzzy variable defined on the credibility space θ p θ cr liu and liu 2002 then its membership function can be derived from the credibility measure by 11 μ x p o s θ θ ξ θ x x r membership function is the basis of fuzzy control and the proper construction of membership function is one of the key factors in fuzzy control hong 2014 the membership function of fuzzy variable can be expressed as triangle distribution trapezoidal distribution cauchy distribution zhou et al 2016 and so on for example cauchy distribution can be described as following if the membership degree of fuzzy variable ξ is subordinate to cauchy distribution then the μ ε can be expressed as 12 μ ε 1 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 1 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 where eq and eq respectively represents the statistical average of positive and negative values in measured data σ is the weighting factor 4 credibility distribution let ξ be a fuzzy variable the credibility distribution of ξ can be expressed as φ x cr θ θ ξ θ x that is φ x is the credibility that fuzzy variable ξ takes a value less than or equal to x generally speaking the credibility distribution φ is neither left continuous nor right continuous according to formulas 10 and 12 for ε r the credibility distribution of fuzzy variable that obey cauchy distribution can be expressed as 13 c r ξ ε 1 1 2 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 1 2 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 5 fuzzy simulation technology as a computer implementation technology of fuzzy programming in credibility theory a large number of numerical experiments have verified the effectiveness of fuzzy simulation in solving fuzzy programming problem according to the concept of credibility measure the credibility cr f ξ 0 can be obtained approximately by the following formula 14 l cr f ξ 0 1 2 max 1 k n μ ε k f ξ ε k 0 min 1 k n 1 μ ε k f ξ ε k 0 the fuzzy simulation processes for computing cr f ξ 0 can be briefly summarized as follows step1 let k 1 step2 randomly generate εk from the δ level cut sets of fuzzy variable ξ and make sure μ εk δ step3 set k k 1 turn back to step 2 if k n otherwise turn to step 4 step4 return l for the detailed expositions on credibility theory the interested readers may consult the book by liu 2004 2 3 panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model in the short term operation of hydropower station according to the determined water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period a corresponding generation plan can be made using the forecasted inflow process however there are errors for the forecasted inflow process and the actual inflow is not necessarily the same as the forecasted inflow when the generation plan is implemented with the actual inflow process it is possible to make the reservoir water level beyond the boundaries especially when the reservoir water level is already near the boundary which means the storage capacity of the reservoir is greatly reduced at this moment therefore there is a big risk of water abandoning or output shortage the schematic of this risk is shown in fig 5 therefore how to evaluate the short term operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error is the main problem need to be discussed as mentioned above the risk occurs only when the reservoir water level is near the boundaries so in order to analysis the risk the possible scope of water level which determines the near boundary must be determined first in general there is a certain limit to the fluctuation of water level in the actual short term operation of hydropower station so this near boundary can be determined according to the amplitude of the water level variation in operation period for example if the water level fluctuation of a hydropower station shall not exceed 1 0 m in short term operation then 1 0 m below normal water level or 1 0 m above the dead water level can be as the scope of the near boundary after determining the near boundaries the water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period can be discretized and the water level combinations can be obtained for each combination the comprehensive risk of hydropower station operation can be derived by the simulation calculation including power generation plan formulation and implementation in order to fully reflect the comprehensive risk of hydropower station in the future short term operation various frequencies and forecasting errors of inflow should be considered in the simulation calculation as shown in fig 6 the lines in fig 6 indicate the variations of credibility for different water level combinations and the area closed by the credibility curve x axis and y axis or x 100 is the comprehensive risk it is important to note that the water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period are both fixed in making the power generation plan but there is no limit to the end water level in implementing the power generation plan in addition the relationship between cr and frequency in fig 6 is not necessarily monotone decreasing or monotone increasing in actual situation taking the operation near the normal water level as an example the output plan under a big inflow rate will be larger than a small inflow rate so the risk of water abandoning under a big inflow rate is not must be greater than that of a small inflow rate but if the same output plan is made for different inflow rates the relationship between cr and frequency should be monotone decreasing or monotone increasing in the derivation of the comprehensive risk of hydropower station near boundary operation the variable factors need to be considered are the different water level combinations and the possible future forecasting inflows with different frequencies in addition the different fuzzy forecasting errors also need to be considered for any fuzzy forecasting error there will be a corresponding output shortage or abandoned water in the simulation calculation so when deriving the comprehensive risk of each water level combination not only the possible future forecasting inflows need to be traversed but also the different forecasting errors this is what the word panoramic means in fuzzy risk analysis as shown in fig 7 through the description above it can be known that how to couple the runoff forecasting error into the risk of power generation operation is the key of realizing the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis for hydropower station near boundary operation fortunately the credibility theory offers the potential to solve this problem the specific implementation process of solving this problem by credibility theory can be descripted as follows in order to realize the coupling of forecasting error and the risk of hydropower generation operation the mathematical description of runoff forecasting error is firstly needed and to realize the accurate mathematical description of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment the relative error of runoff forecasting can be defined firstly if we use the variable ξ to represent the relative runoff forecasting error its definition can be expressed as follows 15 ξ q forecast q actual q forecast 100 where qactual and qforecast is respectively the actual and forecasted inflow the relative forecasting error ξ contains the positive and negative error positive error means the forecasting value is greater than the actual value negative error means the forecasting value is smaller than the actual value according to formula 15 the forecasting error considered actual inflow qactual can be expressed as a function of relative forecasting error ξ and forecasted inflow qforecast as shown below 16 q actual q forecast 1 ξ as mentioned in the introduction the relative forecasting error ξ is affected by many objective and subjective factors such as the input structure parameters of model and artificial uncertainties so it can be regarded as a fuzzy variable therefore the realization of the accurate mathematical description of fuzzy forecasting error is the basis of parsing its fuzzy distribution characteristics and it is also the breakthrough point of carrying out the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation in credibility theory the fuzzy membership function is used to describe the distribution characteristics of fuzzy variable as described in section 2 2 there are many kinds of fuzzy membership functions so the appropriate fuzzy membership function should be determined to describe ξ according to the actual series of forecasting error data and the process can be described by fig 8 in the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation credibility measure can be combined with the membership function of forecasting error to describe and characterize the risk of water abandoning or output shortage so that to realize the coupling of fuzzy forecasting error and the risk of hydropower station near boundary operation and complete the transformation of hydrological forecasting uncertainty to hydropower station operation risk in this paper we mainly use the fuzzy simulation calculation to get the value of the following two expressions based on credibility theory 17 cr d w w actual w planed 0 18 cr de e planed e actual 0 where w actual is the amount of abandoned water in implementing the power generation plan and w planed is the amount of abandoned water in making the power generation plan similarly e actual is the total power generation in implementing the power generation plan and e planed is the total power generation in making the power generation plan the formula 17 represents the operation of hydropower station close to the high water level and the formula 18 represents the operation of hydropower station close to the low water level now the value of cr w actual w planed 0 and cr e planed e actual 0 needs to be calculated which is respectively equivalent to cr f z b it nt plan 0 and cr g z b it nt plan 0 where f and g represent the calculation function in implementing the power generation plan when the hydropower station operation close to the high water level boundary and low water level boundary the return value of f is dw and that of g is de considering the fuzzy variable ξ cr f z b it nt plan 0 and cr g z b it nt plan 0 is respectively equivalent to cr f ξ 0 and cr g ξ 0 thus the correlation between hydropower station operation risk and fuzzy variable ξ is built at this moment and it realizes the coupling of fuzzy forecasting error and operation risk according to the concept of credibility measure cr f ξ 0 and cr g ξ 0 can be calculated by formula 14 with the fuzzy simulation the flowchart of solving the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model based on credibility theory is shown in fig 9 the specific solving steps of panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model for hydropower station near boundary operation are summarized as follows step1 classify the inflow and get the empirical frequency according to the inflow data for different inflow classifications qm forecast and the corresponding frequencies pm m 1 2 m determine the fuzzy membership function of forecasting error using the error data step2 determine the scope of near boundary and discretize the water level in the near boundary scope and get the water level combinations zi zj i j 1 2 num and do the following calculation for each water level combination zi zj step3 for one of the inflow classification qm forecast make an optimal power generation plan according to the water level combination zi zj and dp step4 for the same inflow classification in step3 carry out the following calculation according to its corresponding fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error step5 randomly generate a series of real numbers εk from the δ level cut sets of fuzzy variable ξ and ensure the membership degree of the fuzzy variables μ εk δ k 1 2 n step6 for one of the ɛk calculate qm forecast 1 ɛk by qm forecast and ɛk then get the forecasting error considered inflow process step7 according to the fixed initial water level the forecasting error considered inflow process and the determined power generation plan implement the power generation plan and get the amount of abandoned water f ξ εk or output shortage g ξ εk then calculate the membership μ εk according to membership function μ step8 for the other ɛk repeat the calculation from step6 to step7 and get a series of μ εk f ξ εk or g ξ εk where k 1 2 n step9 calculate cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 by formula 14 so as to get a data point pm cr that corresponding to the inflow classification qm forecast step10 for the other pm and qm forecast repeat the calculation from step3 to step9 so as to get a series of points pm cr where m 1 2 m accordingly obtain the variation curve of cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 with the change of inflow frequency under a fixed water level combination then the comprehensive risk for this specific water level combination can be obtained step11 for the other water level combinations zi zj repeat the calculation from step 3 to step 10 so that the variation curves of cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 under different water level combinations can be obtained and the comprehensive risk of each water level combination can be obtained at last 3 case study 3 1 basic data yalong river is the first major tributary of jinsha river in china there are twenty two planed hydropower stations on the main stream at present the hydropower resources development of yalong river downstream is completed and five hydropower stations have been put into operation i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tonzhilin the jinxi hydropower station has an annual regulation performance and it is the dominant station of the downstream river whose operation level can directly determine the power generation benefit of the whole downstream cascade reservoirs thus this paper selects jinxi hydropower station as the research object the location of this station is shown in fig 10 and its basic parameters are shown in table 1 the long series measured and forecasted hourly inflow are available from the beginning operation of this hydropower station up to may 2017 which has approximately 35 600 data points the runoff is forecasted by xin anjiang model chen and zhu 2005 in which the runoff is divided into surface runoff subsurface flow and underground runoff in the forecasting moreover the arcgis software is used to extract the underlying surface information of the river basin in the forecasting process and the channel water movement calculation is carried out by muskingum method barbetta et al 2011 the rainfall is calculated by the superposition of the watershed unit and the tyson polygon douinot et al 2017 at present the hydropower station carries out the runoff forecasting every 12 h i e 8 00 a m and 20 00p m the basic structure of xin anjiang model is shown in fig 11 from table 1 it can be seen that the normal water level of jinxi reservoir is 1880 m and the dead water level is 1800 m according to the actual operation situation the water level variation of jinxi reservoir is required no more than 1 5 m in the short term operation so when analyzing the short term near boundary operation risk of this hydropower station the desirable near boundary ranges are 1878 5 1880 and 1800 1801 5 the former interval corresponds to high water level operation and the latter interval corresponds to low water level operation in the short term operation of jinxi hydropower station the length of operation period is one day and the length of an operation stage is 15 min so there are a total of 96 stages in the whole operation period because of the operation characteristics of the four turbine generator units in this station is consistent the inner plant economical operation problem is not considered in this paper the flowchart of making the power generation plan with the forecasted inflow for this station is shown in fig 12 from which it can be seen that this station uses the daily runoff forecasting data of 8p m to make the output plan for the next day from 0 00 to 24 00 and the forecasting period is required to reach 40 h while only the data of the later 24 h is used in making the power generation plan so in this paper the error analysis is carried out by the measured and forecasted data of this period and to obtain the fuzzy distribution law of forecasting error in different runoff frequencies according to section 2 3 it can be known that in the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of short term near boundary operation the water levels at the beginning and the end of operation period need to be discretized so in this case study the water level of the near boundary range is discretized by 0 05 m step length therefore there are a total of 31 31 961 water level combinations for each combination a comprehensive risk of water abandoning or output shortage can be obtained through the fuzzy simulation calculation in which all possible inflows various frequencies and forecasting errors are considered 3 2 results and discussion 1 fuzzy analysis of forecasting error because different inflow with different frequency generally has different error distribution the inflow should be graded according to the actual data before the fuzzy analysis through the actual observed runoff data it is found that the maximum inflow rate of jinxi hydropower station is about 5500 m3 s and the minimum of that is about 100 m3 s so this paper takes the interval 0 5600 m3 s as the future inflow rate scope and 200 m3 s as the discrete step length and to statistically calculate the occurrence frequency of different inflow rates chen and singh 2018 the results are shown in table 2 and fig 13 from fig 13 it can be found that the empirical frequency distribution of inflow is smooth and the greater the inflow rate the smaller the frequency and conversely the smaller the inflow rate the greater the frequency which is consistent with the trend of theoretical frequency curve so the frequency distribution of inflow is reasonable and reliable for different inflow rates with different frequencies the error distribution can be calculated according to the calculated error data according to the method described in section 2 3 it is found that comparing the other membership functions the cauchy distribution can more accurately reflect the membership grade for different forecasting errors jiang et al 2015c therefore the cauchy distribution is selected in this paper and then the fuzzy membership functions of runoff forecasting error under different frequencies can be obtained by the statistic eq and eq as shown in fig 14 where eq is the average relative error when the actual value is greater than the forecasted value and eq is the average relative error when the actual value is smaller than the forecasted value the weighting factor σ is equal to 2 333 liang and liao 2007 su and hsu 1991 the statistic values of eq and eq under different inflow frequencies are shown in table 2 from table 2 it can be found that for the statistic values of eq and eq under different inflow frequencies the maximum value of eq is 68 44 and the minimum value of eq is 18 75 although the maximum value of eq is large only two data points of eq are over 10 i e 68 44 and 10 29 and the rest are all within 10 in addition there are also only two data points of eq lower than 10 i e 11 39 and 18 75 and the rest are all within 10 moreover the foresight period of the runoff forecasting on the main stream can reach 40 h but the accuracy decreases with the extension of the foresight period it is relatively accurate within 24 h and the error is relatively big after 24 h based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the average runoff forecasting level of the xin anjiang model is relatively high and the runoff forecasting accuracy of jinxi is basically in accord with the requirements so the forecasting results can be used for actual reservoir operation but from the results in table 2 it can be seen that the forecasting error is unavoidable for different inflow rates with different frequencies which brings difficulties to the actual reservoir operation therefore it is an effective and necessary way to carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of forecasting errors for different inflow situations and operation boundaries using the proposed model so as to make scientific and reasonable hydropower generation plan it has great significance to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and the joint operation level of cascade hydropower stations in fig 14 only the errors in the scope of 20 20 are presented the reason for this is that on the one hand the actual forecasting errors beyond 20 is very few according to the actual data on the other hand the model can be used in the practical production only when the hydrological forecasting model s error is in the scope of 20 20 2 panoramic fuzzy risk near the high water level boundary according to the panoramic fuzzy analysis model mentioned in section 2 3 the output shortage risk of jinxi hydropower station in the short term operation near the high water level boundary is analyzed and calculated the results are shown in fig 15 in which fig 15 a is the panoramic fuzzy risk space and fig 15 b is the vertical view from fig 15 it can be seen that the water abandoning risk is less than or equal to 0 5 in all water level combinations the reason for this phenomenon is that the risk represented by fig 15 is not simply the risk of abandoning water it is the risk of the abandoned water in implementing the plan more than that in making the plan and it is mainly used to evaluate the risk of additional water abandonment due to the uncertainty of forecasting error besides from fig 15 it can be seen that the higher the initial water level in making the power generation plan the greater the risk of water abandoning especially when the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level i e 1880 m there will be a big risk such as the area shown in the red dashed frame in fig 15 b the reason for this phenomenon is that the higher the initial water level provided in making the power generation plan the operating water level in implementing the plan is closer to the high boundary i e the normal water level which makes the reservoir storage capacity weaker so it is easy to waste the water when the actual inflow is bigger than the forecasted inflow in addition as shown in fig 15 there are some zonal high risk areas and their risks of water abandoning are about 0 2 0 3 as shown in the area of the dark blue dashed frame where the initial water level is located at 1878 5 m 1879 5 m and the end water level is located at 1878 9 m 1880 m and in other cases the risk of additional water abandonment in this hydropower plant is almost zero such as the upper left area of fig 15 b so when the operation of this hydropower station is near the high water level boundary these areas should be considered as far as possible in summary when this hydropower station is operating near the high water level boundary it is important to avoid the high initial water level in making the power generation plan especially when the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level in addition try the best to avoid the zonal high risk area shown in fig 15 3 panoramic fuzzy risk near the low water level boundary similarly for the risk analysis of the short term operation of jinxi hydropower station near the low water level boundary the results are shown in fig 16 in which fig 16 a is the panoramic fuzzy risk space and fig 16 b is the vertical view from fig 16 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is near the low water level boundary the high risk area of output shortage is where the initial water level is low especially when it is close to the dead water level i e 1800 m as shown in the red dashed frame of fig 16 b the reason for this phenomenon is that the lower the initial water level provided in making the power generation plan the operating water level in implementing the plan is closer to the low boundary i e the dead water level which makes the available water smaller during the operation so the output will be insufficient when the actual inflow is smaller than the forecasted inflow in addition as shown in fig 16 there is a zonal high risk area where the initial water level interval is about 1800 8 m 1801 5 m and end water level interval is about 1800 m 1800 7 m and its risk of output shortage is about 0 3 as shown in the area of the dark blue dashed frame the reason for this phenomenon is that when the initial water level is high and the end water level is low in making the power generation plan the reservoir is in the situation of supplying water and the operating water level is gradually reducing and the available water of the reservoir will gradually decrease during the operation so when the actual inflow is smaller than the forecasted inflow in implementing the generation plan the planed output cannot be met and the risk of output shortage appears in other cases the risk of output shortage in this hydropower station is very small and most of them are less than 0 2 so when the operation of this hydropower station is near the low water level boundary these low risk areas should be considered as far as possible thus all in all when the short term operation is near the low water level boundary this hydropower station should avoid the high risk areas as shown in the red and dark blue dashed frame of fig 16 b in making the power generation plan 4 contrastive analysis of risks in different degrees the results described above can provide the risk of water abandoning or output shortage for different water level combinations however it only indicates the risk of the event of water abandoning or output shortage happens it cannot reflect the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in different degrees in the actual reservoir operation the response to the water abandoning or output shortage of different degrees is usually different so it s necessary to respectively calculate the risks of different damage degrees such as 10 20 or 30 so that to obtain a more accurate risk distribution and provide a more accurate guidance for the actual operation of hydropower stations in view of this this paper respectively calculates the risk distribution of additional water abandonment and output shortage in three damage levels i e 10 20 and 30 the results are shown in figs 17 and 18 where fig 17 shows the risk distribution of additional water abandonment and fig 18 shows the risk distribution of output shortage specifically the three pictures from left to right in fig 17 respectively corresponds to the event w actual 1 1w planed 0 the event w actual 1 2w planed 0 and the event w actual 1 3w planed 0 in contrast the part a of fig 15 corresponds to the risk distribution of event w actual w planed 0 similarly the three pictures from left to right in fig 18 respectively corresponds to the event 0 9e planed e actual 0 the event 0 8e planed e actual 0 and the event 0 7e planed e actual 0 in contrast the part a of fig 16 corresponds to the risk distribution of event e planed e actual 0 comparing the fig 15 with fig 17 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is close to the high water level the comprehensive risk distributions shown in fig 17 are basically the same with that shown in fig 15 which means that the amount of water abandoned will be large once the water abandoning happened in implementing the power generation plan and the area where this risk occurs is where the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level as shown in fig 15 comparing the fig 16 with fig 18 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is close to the low water level the comprehensive risk distributions shown in fig 18 are significantly different from that shown in fig 16 especially for the area where the initial water level is low the risk of output shortage is basically zero in the three cases of fig 18 which means that the damage degree of output shortage is relatively small when the initial water level is low in implementing the power generation plan and it is generally less than 10 from the basically same risk distribution of the three cases in fig 18 it can be seen that the large output shortage usually happens in the zonal area where the initial water level is high and end water level is low as shown in figs 16 and 18 4 conclusions considering the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error based on credibility theory this paper proposed a panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model for the hydropower station operation near the boundary the coupling and transformation between the hydrological forecasting error and the risk of hydropower station operation were effectively realized by this model taking the jinxi hydropower station in yalong river basin of china as a research object different near boundary operation risks of water abandoning or output shortage of this hydropower station were evaluated and analyzed by this model the following conclusions can be summarized 1 the proposed methodology in this paper can provide a strong technical support for the actual reservoir operation and effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and it can be used for single as well as multi reservoir operation which will be very beneficial and helpful in the optimal water resources utilization 2 when the operation of jinxi hydropower station is near the high water level boundary the high initial water level should be avoided in making the power generation plan especially the situation of initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level and some zonal high risk areas should be avoided too where the initial water level is located at 1878 5 m 1879 5 m and the end water level is located at 1878 9 m 1880 m a mass of abandoned water may appear in this area 3 when the operation of jinxi hydropower station is near the low water level boundary the low initial water level in making the power generation plan should be avoided and the zonal high risk area should be avoided as far as possible where the initial water level is located at 1800 8 m 1801 5 m and the end water level is located at 1800 m 1800 7 m in this paper through the proposed panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model a certain amount of achievements has been obtained however there is still a lot of work worthy of further research for example 1 the case study object is a single station which is relatively simple while after the joint operation of cascade reservoirs there is a compensation effect between upstream and downstream reservoirs that is more complex but more consistent with the actual situation so the risk analysis of joint operation of cascade hydropower stations near the boundary is a worthy further research direction 2 many scenarios were considered in the proposed panoramic model which leads to a large amount of calculation so the parallel computing research that can greatly improve the solving speed of model is very necessary especially for the joint operation of cascade hydropower stations acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 the national natural science foundation key

china changjiang survey planning design and research co ltd wuhan 430015 china corresponding author this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of purna chandra nayak associate editor short term power generation operation is an important content in the hydropower station management because of the limitation of forecast accuracy there is error between the forecasted runoff process and actual runoff process when the hydropower station operation is near the water level boundaries such as normal water level or dead water level this error is likely to bring the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in order to precisely evaluate the near boundary operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model was proposed in this paper by taking the forecasting error as a fuzzy variable the coupling of hydrological forecasting error and the short term operation risk of hydropower station based on credibility theory was realized and the solving process of the model based on fuzzy simulation technology was provided in detail different near boundary operation risks of hydropower station can be analyzed and evaluated by the simulation with different water level combinations in this model the high risk area and suggested operation area of jinxi hydropower station in different near boundary operation situations were clearly identified in the case study the intuitive results of this model can provide a strong technical support for the decision making of the dispatchers when making the power generation plans in the actual production so that to avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and effectively improve the efficiency of water resources utilization keywords power generation runoff forecasting error near boundary panoramic fuzzy risk analysis credibility theory 1 introduction in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station the power generation plan is a very important basis for the actual production shayesteh et al 2016 li et al 2014 it is essentially the standard of production activities for the hydropower station in the next day wang et al 2013 and it has the normative effect and cannot be changed under normal circumstances peng et al 2015 however due to the accuracy limitation of runoff forecasting yuan et al 2016 lu et al 2015 there are uncertain factors in the next day s hydropower station operation which causes the non matching of formulation and implementation of power generation plan existed objectively ji et al 2014a ge et al 2014 so in the actual operation the reservoir water level usually goes beyond the limited water levels because of the runoff forecasting errors and this leads to a large number of abandoned water or output shortage under the normal circumstances due to the storage capacity and regulation of reservoir zmijewski and wörman 2016 the effect of water level deviation caused by the runoff forecasting error can be ignored li et al 2015 but when the operating water level of reservoir is already near the boundary such as close to the normal water level or the dead water level the available reservoir storage volume that can be used to store or supply water is decreased thus the regulation function of reservoir is greatly reduced at this moment that may result in a large number of abandoned water or output shortage lu et al 2009 therefore it is very necessary to carry out the risk analysis for the near boundary operation of hydropower station based on the runoff forecasting uncertainty and quantify the risks of hydropower station in different near boundary operation cases so that to provide a scientific basis and decision support for the runoff forecasting based short term power generation operation the near boundary operation of hydropower station and the corresponding control belong to the category of risk scheduling thus the risk analysis is very necessary in the risk analysis of hydropower generation operation based on runoff forecasting the forecasting error is one of the most important risk factors zhang et al 2011 at present the research in this field has already obtained a lot of achievements but the researches mostly focus on the random characteristics of forecasting error and the risk analysis methods are mainly based on probability theory and mathematical statistics yan et al 2014 such as the typical probability distribution function calculation method mondal et al 2012 fares et al 2014 the bayesian theorem based risk rate calculation method biondi and luca 2013 chen et al 2018 and probability combination method lagadec et al 2016 etc the research on the fuzziness of forecasting error are still rare nowadays the mathematical methods used to describe and study the objective phenomenon are generally divided into deterministic methods and uncertainty methods and the latter mainly includes random methods and fuzzy methods however due to the complexity of the objective world and the constantly changes caused by perpetual motion the random phenomena in fact is not inherently random when people use the random methods to deal with it in addition to randomness it also has a more general fuzzy uncertainty jiang et al 2015a as we known the hydrological forecasting model is affected by input uncertainty its own structure uncertainty parameter uncertainty and many other artificial uncertainties it is complex and difficult to be described accurately cheng et al 2015 li et al 2018 thus in a runoff forecasting the forecasting error is influenced by many objective and subjective factors huang et al 2014 and its size does not have a definite limit in quantity it not only has randomness but also has a lot of fuzziness jiang et al 2016 that the forecasted runoff value falls into a certain range as shown in fig 1 therefore the single study on the randomness of hydrological forecasting error cannot fully express the uncertainty of error and it also cannot effectively reflect the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in the short term hydropower station operation so it is necessary to carry out the risk analysis for the short term hydropower station operation based on the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error there are three types of measures in fuzzy mathematics i e probability measure necessity measure and credibility measure lu et al 2011 in the probability measure theory an event with the probability measure of 1 indicates that the event is most likely to happen but does not necessarily happen and an event with the probability measure of 0 indicates that the event is most unlikely to happen but it doesn t mean that it doesn t happen so this is easy to cause the decision chaos in comparison the credibility theory has the self duality i e the event with the credibility measure of 1 must happen and the event with the credibility measure of 0 must not happen liu and peng 2005 thus the fuzzy evaluation result based on credibility measure is more accord with people s thinking habits and it is easy to understand and accept and it also eliminates the decision chaos that the traditional membership degree calculation may cause so on the whole it is more appropriate to use the credibility measure to study the fuzziness of forecasting error zeng et al 2014 nowadays fuzzy set theory has made a great progress and has been applied in many practical fields sun et al 2016 in 2004 liu successfully established the axiomatic system of credibility measure liu 2004 i e the credibility theory which is similar to the axiomatic system of probability theory the credibility theory is a new mathematical branch to study the quantitative law of fuzzy phenomena and its emergence based on axiomatic approach provides a new way to explore the new fuzzy risk analysis method liu 2009 at present the fuzzy risk evaluation method based on credibility theory has been successfully applied in many fields jiang et al 2015b davari et al 2014 such as power system operation risk assessment feng et al 2008 hu et al 2011 unit combination problem ju et al 2016 skulimowski 2013 economic scheduling problem xin and xiao 2011 reliability evaluation zhao and liu 2005 power grid planning ernster and srivastava 2012 enterprise investment portfolio huang 2006 capital budget issues huang 2007 and the optimal allocation of water resources zhong et al 2013 etc which greatly promoted the spread and development of credibility theory however this theory is rarely used on the research of risk analysis of hydropower station operation based on the fuzziness of forecasting error especially on the optimal fuzzy control of near boundary operation of hydropower station therefore the credibility theory can be used to describe the fuzzy characteristic of runoff forecasting error and carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation in view of this this paper proposed a novel panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model based credibility theory this model can not only make the fuzzy characteristic of forecasting error be effectively expressed in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station sampath and ramya 2014 but also realize the interdisciplinary application and cross integration of new mathematic theories and technologies in water resources management and further develop and improve the risk control theory in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station which has a far reaching theoretical significance particularly in practical point of view through the proposed model different near boundary operation risks can be analyzed for the hydropower station by the simulation of formulating and implementing the power generation plan with different water level combinations so the high risk area of hydropower station in short term operation can be clearly identified and the intuitive results i e the risk distribution map of the model can provide a strong technical support for the dispatchers to avoid the high risk situations in making the power generation plan in actual production so that to effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and improve the efficiency of water resources utilization it has a far reaching practical application value the following parts of this paper are organized as follows section 2 is the methodologies including a detailed formulation of short term power generation operation model of hydropower station a

station in china and the results will be presented and analyzed in this section finally the conclusions of this study will be provided in section 4 2 methodologies 2 1 short term power generation operation model and its solving method in the short term power generation operation of hydropower station two models are involved one is used to make a power generation plan and the other is used to implement the determined power generation plan taking the operation of a single reservoir as an example the two models are presented as follows 1 model for making a power generation plan and its solving method power generation is a significant benefit derived from the reservoir system the short term operation aims at maximizing the power generation by developing an optimal plan over the entire planning horizon while satisfying all kinds of physical and operational constraints generally the forecasted inflow process the initial and final water levels of operation period are determined in this model and the objective function of the model can be represented as 1 e max t 1 t n t q t h t δ t where n t k q t h t where e is the total hydropower generation for all stages over the entire planning horizon in kwh nt is the output function of the tth stage which is determined by k qt and h t k is the efficiency coefficient of the hydropower station qt is the outflow through the turbines in the tth stage in m3 s ht is the average water head of the hydropower station in the tth stage in m t is the total number of stages over the entire planning horizon t is the stage index δt is the duration of an operation stage in second the constraints including ① the water volume balance equation 2 v t 1 v t i t q t q l o s s t δ t where vt is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of the tth stage in m3 vt 1 is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of the tth stage in m3 qlosst is the outflow through flood discharge gate in the tth stage in m3 which is unused for power generation i t i it is the total inflow of the reservoir in the tth stage in m3 s ② reservoir volume limits 3 v t min v t v t max where vt max is the upper limit of reservoir storage volume in the tth stage in m3 vt min is the lower limit of reservoir storage volume in the tth stage in m3 ③ power generation limits 4 n t min n t n t max where ni t is the output of the hydropower station in the tth stage in kw nt min is the lower limit of ni t nt max is the upper limit of ni t ④ water resources required at downstream reservoir limits 5 q t min q t q t max where qt is the total outflow of the reservoir in the tth stage in m3 s and qt qt qlosst qt max is the upper limit of qt which is usually determined by the downstream river channel capacity qt min is the lower limit of qt which is usually determined by the ecological flow of downstream ⑤ boundary conditions limits 6 v 0 v begin v t v end where v 0 is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of the first stage in m3 vbegin is the storage volume of the reservoir at the beginning of entire planning horizon in m3 vt is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of the tth stage in m3 vend is the storage volume of the reservoir at the end of entire planning horizon in m3 dynamic programming dp can be used to solve this model which is good at solving multi stage optimization decision problems recursively dividing the reservoir operation into sub operations based on operation intervals dp yields the optimal solution to the whole problem by using the solutions of sub operations a recursive procedure is involved in the application of dp to reservoir operation optimization problem the recursive equation for the tth stage is 7 f t v t 1 m 1 max d t n t v t 1 m 1 q t f t 1 v t m 2 f t 1 v t m 2 0 where qt is the decision variable which is determined by beginning state vm 1 t 1 and end state vm 2 t vt is the state variable dt is decision variables set in the tth stage ft vm 1 t 1 is the optimal cumulative output of beginning state m1 at the tth stage ft 1 vm 2 t is the optimal cumulative output of beginning state m2 at the t 1 th stage the dp model consists of two procedures which are reverse recursion procedure and chronological order recursion procedure in the reverse recursion procedure starting from the last stage the output is calculated up to the first stage and the line of the optimal operation can be obtained at last by the calculation with chronological order recursion procedure the solving steps of this model by dp can be summarized as follows and the schematic diagram of dynamic programming is shown in fig 2 step 1 in the last stage t there are s discretized points for the storage volume of reservoir at the beginning of this stage because the storage volume is fixed at the end of this stage the optimal candidate path of each discretized point is unique at this moment step 2 in stage t 1 the storage volume of reservoir is not fixed at the end of this stage so there are also s discretized points for the storage volume for any discretized point at the beginning of this stage such as the second point as shown in fig 2 with the solid line circle its optimal candidate path can be found out by traversing the s discretized points of the storage volume at the end of this stage assuming that it is the third point as shown in fig 2 with the dotted line circle and then save the optimal candidate path and the cumulative output in the memory for the usage of next stage step 3 repeats step 2 then the calculation of stage t 1 can be finished by implementing the same work for the other s 1 discretized points at the beginning of this stage step 4 repeats steps 2 and 3 then the whole calculation of all stages over the entire planning horizon can be finished by this reverse recursion procedure and the optimal candidate path of each discretized point and its optimal cumulative output can be obtained after the calculation step 5 calculates the route and other details of the optimal operation by the chronological recursion process the calculation flowchart of reverse recursion and chronological order recursion is shown in fig 3 ji et al 2014b 2 model for implementing the power generation plan and its solving method in this model the known conditions are the actual inflow process the determined generation plan and the initial water level of operation period this model is established to meet the demand of power generation and there is a deterministic calculation process the main constraint in the calculation is the power balance constraint which can be represented as 8 n t plan n t actual t t where nt plan is the planed output of hydropower station in the tth stage in kw nt actual is the actual output of hydropower station in the tth stage in kw besides the above power balance constraint the constraints represented by formulas 2 5 are also involved in this model in addition for the boundary conditions constraints only the initial water level is fixed in this model and the final water level is not fixed this is different from the model of making the power generation plan the solving steps of this model can be summarized as follows step1 deriving the end water level ht 1 according to the output formula nt kqtht the known beginning water level ht the inflow it and the planed output nt plan the average water head ht used in calculating nt is determined by the beginning water level ht the end water level ht 1 and the downstream tail water level hdown i e ht ht ht 1 2 hdown where hdown is determined by the total outflow qt of reservoir in the tth stage and qt happens to be determined by ht and ht 1 according to the formula 2 thus the iterative computation is used in calculating the end water level ht 1 and the flowchart of this iterative computation process is shown in fig 4 here ht is corresponding to vt and ht 1 is corresponding to vt 1 because of the one to one mapping relationship between reservoir water level and reservoir volume step2 if ht 1 high water level boundary let ht 1 high water level boundary and calculate the output nt actual once again and no iterative computation is required at this moment and the nt actual is not equal to nt plan otherwise turn to step 3 step3 if ht 1 low water level boundary let ht 1 low water level boundary and calculate the output nt actual once again and no iterative computation is required at this moment too and the nt actual is not equal to nt plan otherwise turn to step 4 step4 let t t 1 taking the end water level of the tth stage of reservoir as the beginning water level of the t 1 th stage turn to step 1 until the t t 1 step5 output the details of each stage of the operation period such as the water level variation output variation and abandoning water flow etc 2 2 some fundamentals of credibility theory fuzzy set theory was introduced by zadeh in 1965 zadeh 1965 and it has been employed to solve a variety of practical problems since then in fuzzy set theory credibility measure is parallel to probability measure and it plays the role of probability measure thus a set of axiomatic system based on credibility measure is promoted which is the credibility theory 1 possibility and necessity measure in fuzzy sets there are three important types of measures i e possibility necessity and credibility let θ be a nonempty set and let p θ be the power set of θ for any event a p θ the possibility measure of event a is described by pos a in fuzzy theory let the triplet θ p θ cr be a possibility space for any event a p θ the necessity measure of event a is described by nec a 1 pos ac where a c is the opposite event of a 2 credibility measure credibility measure is similar to probability measure and it is defined as an average of the possibility measure and the necessity measure which can be represented as 9 cr a 1 2 p o s a n e c a 10 orcr ξ a 1 2 sup μ x x a 1 sup μ x x a c where μ is the membership function of fuzzy variable ξ 3 fuzzy variable and membership function fuzzy variable is a measurable function from a credibility space θ p θ cr to the set of real numbers liu 2002 let ξ be a fuzzy variable defined on the credibility space θ p θ cr liu and liu 2002 then its membership function can be derived from the credibility measure by 11 μ x p o s θ θ ξ θ x x r membership function is the basis of fuzzy control and the proper construction of membership function is one of the key factors in fuzzy control hong 2014 the membership function of fuzzy variable can be expressed as triangle distribution trapezoidal distribution cauchy distribution zhou et al 2016 and so on for example cauchy distribution can be described as following if the membership degree of fuzzy variable ξ is subordinate to cauchy distribution then the μ ε can be expressed as 12 μ ε 1 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 1 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 where eq and eq respectively represents the statistical average of positive and negative values in measured data σ is the weighting factor 4 credibility distribution let ξ be a fuzzy variable the credibility distribution of ξ can be expressed as φ x cr θ θ ξ θ x that is φ x is the credibility that fuzzy variable ξ takes a value less than or equal to x generally speaking the credibility distribution φ is neither left continuous nor right continuous according to formulas 10 and 12 for ε r the credibility distribution of fuzzy variable that obey cauchy distribution can be expressed as 13 c r ξ ε 1 1 2 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 1 2 1 σ ε e q 2 ε 0 5 fuzzy simulation technology as a computer implementation technology of fuzzy programming in credibility theory a large number of numerical experiments have verified the effectiveness of fuzzy simulation in solving fuzzy programming problem according to the concept of credibility measure the credibility cr f ξ 0 can be obtained approximately by the following formula 14 l cr f ξ 0 1 2 max 1 k n μ ε k f ξ ε k 0 min 1 k n 1 μ ε k f ξ ε k 0 the fuzzy simulation processes for computing cr f ξ 0 can be briefly summarized as follows step1 let k 1 step2 randomly generate εk from the δ level cut sets of fuzzy variable ξ and make sure μ εk δ step3 set k k 1 turn back to step 2 if k n otherwise turn to step 4 step4 return l for the detailed expositions on credibility theory the interested readers may consult the book by liu 2004 2 3 panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model in the short term operation of hydropower station according to the determined water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period a corresponding generation plan can be made using the forecasted inflow process however there are errors for the forecasted inflow process and the actual inflow is not necessarily the same as the forecasted inflow when the generation plan is implemented with the actual inflow process it is possible to make the reservoir water level beyond the boundaries especially when the reservoir water level is already near the boundary which means the storage capacity of the reservoir is greatly reduced at this moment therefore there is a big risk of water abandoning or output shortage the schematic of this risk is shown in fig 5 therefore how to evaluate the short term operation risk of hydropower station caused by runoff forecasting error is the main problem need to be discussed as mentioned above the risk occurs only when the reservoir water level is near the boundaries so in order to analysis the risk the possible scope of water level which determines the near boundary must be determined first in general there is a certain limit to the fluctuation of water level in the actual short term operation of hydropower station so this near boundary can be determined according to the amplitude of the water level variation in operation period for example if the water level fluctuation of a hydropower station shall not exceed 1 0 m in short term operation then 1 0 m below normal water level or 1 0 m above the dead water level can be as the scope of the near boundary after determining the near boundaries the water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period can be discretized and the water level combinations can be obtained for each combination the comprehensive risk of hydropower station operation can be derived by the simulation calculation including power generation plan formulation and implementation in order to fully reflect the comprehensive risk of hydropower station in the future short term operation various frequencies and forecasting errors of inflow should be considered in the simulation calculation as shown in fig 6 the lines in fig 6 indicate the variations of credibility for different water level combinations and the area closed by the credibility curve x axis and y axis or x 100 is the comprehensive risk it is important to note that the water levels at the beginning and the end of the operation period are both fixed in making the power generation plan but there is no limit to the end water level in implementing the power generation plan in addition the relationship between cr and frequency in fig 6 is not necessarily monotone decreasing or monotone increasing in actual situation taking the operation near the normal water level as an example the output plan under a big inflow rate will be larger than a small inflow rate so the risk of water abandoning under a big inflow rate is not must be greater than that of a small inflow rate but if the same output plan is made for different inflow rates the relationship between cr and frequency should be monotone decreasing or monotone increasing in the derivation of the comprehensive risk of hydropower station near boundary operation the variable factors need to be considered are the different water level combinations and the possible future forecasting inflows with different frequencies in addition the different fuzzy forecasting errors also need to be considered for any fuzzy forecasting error there will be a corresponding output shortage or abandoned water in the simulation calculation so when deriving the comprehensive risk of each water level combination not only the possible future forecasting inflows need to be traversed but also the different forecasting errors this is what the word panoramic means in fuzzy risk analysis as shown in fig 7 through the description above it can be known that how to couple the runoff forecasting error into the risk of power generation operation is the key of realizing the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis for hydropower station near boundary operation fortunately the credibility theory offers the potential to solve this problem the specific implementation process of solving this problem by credibility theory can be descripted as follows in order to realize the coupling of forecasting error and the risk of hydropower generation operation the mathematical description of runoff forecasting error is firstly needed and to realize the accurate mathematical description of runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment the relative error of runoff forecasting can be defined firstly if we use the variable ξ to represent the relative runoff forecasting error its definition can be expressed as follows 15 ξ q forecast q actual q forecast 100 where qactual and qforecast is respectively the actual and forecasted inflow the relative forecasting error ξ contains the positive and negative error positive error means the forecasting value is greater than the actual value negative error means the forecasting value is smaller than the actual value according to formula 15 the forecasting error considered actual inflow qactual can be expressed as a function of relative forecasting error ξ and forecasted inflow qforecast as shown below 16 q actual q forecast 1 ξ as mentioned in the introduction the relative forecasting error ξ is affected by many objective and subjective factors such as the input structure parameters of model and artificial uncertainties so it can be regarded as a fuzzy variable therefore the realization of the accurate mathematical description of fuzzy forecasting error is the basis of parsing its fuzzy distribution characteristics and it is also the breakthrough point of carrying out the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation in credibility theory the fuzzy membership function is used to describe the distribution characteristics of fuzzy variable as described in section 2 2 there are many kinds of fuzzy membership functions so the appropriate fuzzy membership function should be determined to describe ξ according to the actual series of forecasting error data and the process can be described by fig 8 in the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station near boundary operation credibility measure can be combined with the membership function of forecasting error to describe and characterize the risk of water abandoning or output shortage so that to realize the coupling of fuzzy forecasting error and the risk of hydropower station near boundary operation and complete the transformation of hydrological forecasting uncertainty to hydropower station operation risk in this paper we mainly use the fuzzy simulation calculation to get the value of the following two expressions based on credibility theory 17 cr d w w actual w planed 0 18 cr de e planed e actual 0 where w actual is the amount of abandoned water in implementing the power generation plan and w planed is the amount of abandoned water in making the power generation plan similarly e actual is the total power generation in implementing the power generation plan and e planed is the total power generation in making the power generation plan the formula 17 represents the operation of hydropower station close to the high water level and the formula 18 represents the operation of hydropower station close to the low water level now the value of cr w actual w planed 0 and cr e planed e actual 0 needs to be calculated which is respectively equivalent to cr f z b it nt plan 0 and cr g z b it nt plan 0 where f and g represent the calculation function in implementing the power generation plan when the hydropower station operation close to the high water level boundary and low water level boundary the return value of f is dw and that of g is de considering the fuzzy variable ξ cr f z b it nt plan 0 and cr g z b it nt plan 0 is respectively equivalent to cr f ξ 0 and cr g ξ 0 thus the correlation between hydropower station operation risk and fuzzy variable ξ is built at this moment and it realizes the coupling of fuzzy forecasting error and operation risk according to the concept of credibility measure cr f ξ 0 and cr g ξ 0 can be calculated by formula 14 with the fuzzy simulation the flowchart of solving the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model based on credibility theory is shown in fig 9 the specific solving steps of panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model for hydropower station near boundary operation are summarized as follows step1 classify the inflow and get the empirical frequency according to the inflow data for different inflow classifications qm forecast and the corresponding frequencies pm m 1 2 m determine the fuzzy membership function of forecasting error using the error data step2 determine the scope of near boundary and discretize the water level in the near boundary scope and get the water level combinations zi zj i j 1 2 num and do the following calculation for each water level combination zi zj step3 for one of the inflow classification qm forecast make an optimal power generation plan according to the water level combination zi zj and dp step4 for the same inflow classification in step3 carry out the following calculation according to its corresponding fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error step5 randomly generate a series of real numbers εk from the δ level cut sets of fuzzy variable ξ and ensure the membership degree of the fuzzy variables μ εk δ k 1 2 n step6 for one of the ɛk calculate qm forecast 1 ɛk by qm forecast and ɛk then get the forecasting error considered inflow process step7 according to the fixed initial water level the forecasting error considered inflow process and the determined power generation plan implement the power generation plan and get the amount of abandoned water f ξ εk or output shortage g ξ εk then calculate the membership μ εk according to membership function μ step8 for the other ɛk repeat the calculation from step6 to step7 and get a series of μ εk f ξ εk or g ξ εk where k 1 2 n step9 calculate cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 by formula 14 so as to get a data point pm cr that corresponding to the inflow classification qm forecast step10 for the other pm and qm forecast repeat the calculation from step3 to step9 so as to get a series of points pm cr where m 1 2 m accordingly obtain the variation curve of cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 with the change of inflow frequency under a fixed water level combination then the comprehensive risk for this specific water level combination can be obtained step11 for the other water level combinations zi zj repeat the calculation from step 3 to step 10 so that the variation curves of cr f ξ 0 or cr g ξ 0 under different water level combinations can be obtained and the comprehensive risk of each water level combination can be obtained at last 3 case study 3 1 basic data yalong river is the first major tributary of jinsha river in china there are twenty two planed hydropower stations on the main stream at present the hydropower resources development of yalong river downstream is completed and five hydropower stations have been put into operation i e jinxi jindong guandi ertan and tonzhilin the jinxi hydropower station has an annual regulation performance and it is the dominant station of the downstream river whose operation level can directly determine the power generation benefit of the whole downstream cascade reservoirs thus this paper selects jinxi hydropower station as the research object the location of this station is shown in fig 10 and its basic parameters are shown in table 1 the long series measured and forecasted hourly inflow are available from the beginning operation of this hydropower station up to may 2017 which has approximately 35 600 data points the runoff is forecasted by xin anjiang model chen and zhu 2005 in which the runoff is divided into surface runoff subsurface flow and underground runoff in the forecasting moreover the arcgis software is used to extract the underlying surface information of the river basin in the forecasting process and the channel water movement calculation is carried out by muskingum method barbetta et al 2011 the rainfall is calculated by the superposition of the watershed unit and the tyson polygon douinot et al 2017 at present the hydropower station carries out the runoff forecasting every 12 h i e 8 00 a m and 20 00p m the basic structure of xin anjiang model is shown in fig 11 from table 1 it can be seen that the normal water level of jinxi reservoir is 1880 m and the dead water level is 1800 m according to the actual operation situation the water level variation of jinxi reservoir is required no more than 1 5 m in the short term operation so when analyzing the short term near boundary operation risk of this hydropower station the desirable near boundary ranges are 1878 5 1880 and 1800 1801 5 the former interval corresponds to high water level operation and the latter interval corresponds to low water level operation in the short term operation of jinxi hydropower station the length of operation period is one day and the length of an operation stage is 15 min so there are a total of 96 stages in the whole operation period because of the operation characteristics of the four turbine generator units in this station is consistent the inner plant economical operation problem is not considered in this paper the flowchart of making the power generation plan with the forecasted inflow for this station is shown in fig 12 from which it can be seen that this station uses the daily runoff forecasting data of 8p m to make the output plan for the next day from 0 00 to 24 00 and the forecasting period is required to reach 40 h while only the data of the later 24 h is used in making the power generation plan so in this paper the error analysis is carried out by the measured and forecasted data of this period and to obtain the fuzzy distribution law of forecasting error in different runoff frequencies according to section 2 3 it can be known that in the panoramic fuzzy risk analysis of short term near boundary operation the water levels at the beginning and the end of operation period need to be discretized so in this case study the water level of the near boundary range is discretized by 0 05 m step length therefore there are a total of 31 31 961 water level combinations for each combination a comprehensive risk of water abandoning or output shortage can be obtained through the fuzzy simulation calculation in which all possible inflows various frequencies and forecasting errors are considered 3 2 results and discussion 1 fuzzy analysis of forecasting error because different inflow with different frequency generally has different error distribution the inflow should be graded according to the actual data before the fuzzy analysis through the actual observed runoff data it is found that the maximum inflow rate of jinxi hydropower station is about 5500 m3 s and the minimum of that is about 100 m3 s so this paper takes the interval 0 5600 m3 s as the future inflow rate scope and 200 m3 s as the discrete step length and to statistically calculate the occurrence frequency of different inflow rates chen and singh 2018 the results are shown in table 2 and fig 13 from fig 13 it can be found that the empirical frequency distribution of inflow is smooth and the greater the inflow rate the smaller the frequency and conversely the smaller the inflow rate the greater the frequency which is consistent with the trend of theoretical frequency curve so the frequency distribution of inflow is reasonable and reliable for different inflow rates with different frequencies the error distribution can be calculated according to the calculated error data according to the method described in section 2 3 it is found that comparing the other membership functions the cauchy distribution can more accurately reflect the membership grade for different forecasting errors jiang et al 2015c therefore the cauchy distribution is selected in this paper and then the fuzzy membership functions of runoff forecasting error under different frequencies can be obtained by the statistic eq and eq as shown in fig 14 where eq is the average relative error when the actual value is greater than the forecasted value and eq is the average relative error when the actual value is smaller than the forecasted value the weighting factor σ is equal to 2 333 liang and liao 2007 su and hsu 1991 the statistic values of eq and eq under different inflow frequencies are shown in table 2 from table 2 it can be found that for the statistic values of eq and eq under different inflow frequencies the maximum value of eq is 68 44 and the minimum value of eq is 18 75 although the maximum value of eq is large only two data points of eq are over 10 i e 68 44 and 10 29 and the rest are all within 10 in addition there are also only two data points of eq lower than 10 i e 11 39 and 18 75 and the rest are all within 10 moreover the foresight period of the runoff forecasting on the main stream can reach 40 h but the accuracy decreases with the extension of the foresight period it is relatively accurate within 24 h and the error is relatively big after 24 h based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the average runoff forecasting level of the xin anjiang model is relatively high and the runoff forecasting accuracy of jinxi is basically in accord with the requirements so the forecasting results can be used for actual reservoir operation but from the results in table 2 it can be seen that the forecasting error is unavoidable for different inflow rates with different frequencies which brings difficulties to the actual reservoir operation therefore it is an effective and necessary way to carry out the fuzzy risk analysis of forecasting errors for different inflow situations and operation boundaries using the proposed model so as to make scientific and reasonable hydropower generation plan it has great significance to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and the joint operation level of cascade hydropower stations in fig 14 only the errors in the scope of 20 20 are presented the reason for this is that on the one hand the actual forecasting errors beyond 20 is very few according to the actual data on the other hand the model can be used in the practical production only when the hydrological forecasting model s error is in the scope of 20 20 2 panoramic fuzzy risk near the high water level boundary according to the panoramic fuzzy analysis model mentioned in section 2 3 the output shortage risk of jinxi hydropower station in the short term operation near the high water level boundary is analyzed and calculated the results are shown in fig 15 in which fig 15 a is the panoramic fuzzy risk space and fig 15 b is the vertical view from fig 15 it can be seen that the water abandoning risk is less than or equal to 0 5 in all water level combinations the reason for this phenomenon is that the risk represented by fig 15 is not simply the risk of abandoning water it is the risk of the abandoned water in implementing the plan more than that in making the plan and it is mainly used to evaluate the risk of additional water abandonment due to the uncertainty of forecasting error besides from fig 15 it can be seen that the higher the initial water level in making the power generation plan the greater the risk of water abandoning especially when the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level i e 1880 m there will be a big risk such as the area shown in the red dashed frame in fig 15 b the reason for this phenomenon is that the higher the initial water level provided in making the power generation plan the operating water level in implementing the plan is closer to the high boundary i e the normal water level which makes the reservoir storage capacity weaker so it is easy to waste the water when the actual inflow is bigger than the forecasted inflow in addition as shown in fig 15 there are some zonal high risk areas and their risks of water abandoning are about 0 2 0 3 as shown in the area of the dark blue dashed frame where the initial water level is located at 1878 5 m 1879 5 m and the end water level is located at 1878 9 m 1880 m and in other cases the risk of additional water abandonment in this hydropower plant is almost zero such as the upper left area of fig 15 b so when the operation of this hydropower station is near the high water level boundary these areas should be considered as far as possible in summary when this hydropower station is operating near the high water level boundary it is important to avoid the high initial water level in making the power generation plan especially when the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level in addition try the best to avoid the zonal high risk area shown in fig 15 3 panoramic fuzzy risk near the low water level boundary similarly for the risk analysis of the short term operation of jinxi hydropower station near the low water level boundary the results are shown in fig 16 in which fig 16 a is the panoramic fuzzy risk space and fig 16 b is the vertical view from fig 16 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is near the low water level boundary the high risk area of output shortage is where the initial water level is low especially when it is close to the dead water level i e 1800 m as shown in the red dashed frame of fig 16 b the reason for this phenomenon is that the lower the initial water level provided in making the power generation plan the operating water level in implementing the plan is closer to the low boundary i e the dead water level which makes the available water smaller during the operation so the output will be insufficient when the actual inflow is smaller than the forecasted inflow in addition as shown in fig 16 there is a zonal high risk area where the initial water level interval is about 1800 8 m 1801 5 m and end water level interval is about 1800 m 1800 7 m and its risk of output shortage is about 0 3 as shown in the area of the dark blue dashed frame the reason for this phenomenon is that when the initial water level is high and the end water level is low in making the power generation plan the reservoir is in the situation of supplying water and the operating water level is gradually reducing and the available water of the reservoir will gradually decrease during the operation so when the actual inflow is smaller than the forecasted inflow in implementing the generation plan the planed output cannot be met and the risk of output shortage appears in other cases the risk of output shortage in this hydropower station is very small and most of them are less than 0 2 so when the operation of this hydropower station is near the low water level boundary these low risk areas should be considered as far as possible thus all in all when the short term operation is near the low water level boundary this hydropower station should avoid the high risk areas as shown in the red and dark blue dashed frame of fig 16 b in making the power generation plan 4 contrastive analysis of risks in different degrees the results described above can provide the risk of water abandoning or output shortage for different water level combinations however it only indicates the risk of the event of water abandoning or output shortage happens it cannot reflect the risk of water abandoning or output shortage in different degrees in the actual reservoir operation the response to the water abandoning or output shortage of different degrees is usually different so it s necessary to respectively calculate the risks of different damage degrees such as 10 20 or 30 so that to obtain a more accurate risk distribution and provide a more accurate guidance for the actual operation of hydropower stations in view of this this paper respectively calculates the risk distribution of additional water abandonment and output shortage in three damage levels i e 10 20 and 30 the results are shown in figs 17 and 18 where fig 17 shows the risk distribution of additional water abandonment and fig 18 shows the risk distribution of output shortage specifically the three pictures from left to right in fig 17 respectively corresponds to the event w actual 1 1w planed 0 the event w actual 1 2w planed 0 and the event w actual 1 3w planed 0 in contrast the part a of fig 15 corresponds to the risk distribution of event w actual w planed 0 similarly the three pictures from left to right in fig 18 respectively corresponds to the event 0 9e planed e actual 0 the event 0 8e planed e actual 0 and the event 0 7e planed e actual 0 in contrast the part a of fig 16 corresponds to the risk distribution of event e planed e actual 0 comparing the fig 15 with fig 17 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is close to the high water level the comprehensive risk distributions shown in fig 17 are basically the same with that shown in fig 15 which means that the amount of water abandoned will be large once the water abandoning happened in implementing the power generation plan and the area where this risk occurs is where the initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level as shown in fig 15 comparing the fig 16 with fig 18 it can be seen that when the hydropower station operation is close to the low water level the comprehensive risk distributions shown in fig 18 are significantly different from that shown in fig 16 especially for the area where the initial water level is low the risk of output shortage is basically zero in the three cases of fig 18 which means that the damage degree of output shortage is relatively small when the initial water level is low in implementing the power generation plan and it is generally less than 10 from the basically same risk distribution of the three cases in fig 18 it can be seen that the large output shortage usually happens in the zonal area where the initial water level is high and end water level is low as shown in figs 16 and 18 4 conclusions considering the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error based on credibility theory this paper proposed a panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model for the hydropower station operation near the boundary the coupling and transformation between the hydrological forecasting error and the risk of hydropower station operation were effectively realized by this model taking the jinxi hydropower station in yalong river basin of china as a research object different near boundary operation risks of water abandoning or output shortage of this hydropower station were evaluated and analyzed by this model the following conclusions can be summarized 1 the proposed methodology in this paper can provide a strong technical support for the actual reservoir operation and effectively avoid the occurrence of water abandoning or output shortage of hydropower station and it can be used for single as well as multi reservoir operation which will be very beneficial and helpful in the optimal water resources utilization 2 when the operation of jinxi hydropower station is near the high water level boundary the high initial water level should be avoided in making the power generation plan especially the situation of initial and end water levels are both close to the normal water level and some zonal high risk areas should be avoided too where the initial water level is located at 1878 5 m 1879 5 m and the end water level is located at 1878 9 m 1880 m a mass of abandoned water may appear in this area 3 when the operation of jinxi hydropower station is near the low water level boundary the low initial water level in making the power generation plan should be avoided and the zonal high risk area should be avoided as far as possible where the initial water level is located at 1800 8 m 1801 5 m and the end water level is located at 1800 m 1800 7 m in this paper through the proposed panoramic fuzzy risk analysis model a certain amount of achievements has been obtained however there is still a lot of work worthy of further research for example 1 the case study object is a single station which is relatively simple while after the joint operation of cascade reservoirs there is a compensation effect between upstream and downstream reservoirs that is more complex but more consistent with the actual situation so the risk analysis of joint operation of cascade hydropower stations near the boundary is a worthy further research direction 2 many scenarios were considered in the proposed panoramic model which leads to a large amount of calculation so the parallel computing research that can greatly improve the solving speed of model is very necessary especially for the joint operation of cascade hydropower stations acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national key r d program of china 2017yfc0405900 the national natural science foundation key

7019,the large heterogeneity in soil surface conditions makes it impracticable to obtain reliable estimates of soil hydraulic parameters for areas larger than few squared kilometers however identifying these parameters on a global scale is essential for many hydrological and climatic applications in this study a new approach named drainage from drydown dfd is proposed to estimate the coefficients of drainage using soil moisture observations dfd firstly selects multiple drydown events when surface runoff and evapotranspiration rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate secondly by inverting the soil water balance equation the drainage coefficients are obtained synthetic experiments are carried out in order to tune the overall procedure dfd is then tested with in situ observations at 8 different sites worldwide characterized by different climates and soil types the reliability of the dfd is evaluated by using the dfd drainage coefficients in a physically based soil water balance model swb for simulating soil moisture and a rainfall estimation model sm2rain the results indicate that the climate and the soil conditions exert an important role in the occurrence and magnitude of drainage rate dfd is found capable of correctly identify periods in which drainage rate is the dominant process drainage coefficients obtained from dfd are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties based on the soil texture and land cover at each site by using dfd drainage coefficients to estimate rainfall and soil moisture via sm2rain and swb promising results are obtained with median correlation of 0 83 and 0 91 between estimated and in situ data however in sites characterized by high rate of evapotranspiration 700 mm year and low permeable soil e g clay the dfd performance is reduced overall dfd demonstrates the ability to decouple drainage and evapotranspiration processes and to estimate the drainage coefficients from in situ observations keywords dfd drainage drydowns sm2rain water balance soil moisture 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties shp are important parameters controlling the partitioning of water and energy in the soil vereecken et al 2016 and parametrization of shp is essential for land surface and hydrological modeling montzka et al 2017 soil properties are usually estimated through field survey but shp are often not included among the measurements patil and singh 2016 moreover even though shp are normally collected through ground measurements or hydraulic tests they are available at spatial scales much smaller than what is needed in land surface and hydrological models ines and mohanty 2008 mohanty 2013 to overcome this scale gap different approaches were suggested by the soil science community for instance it is often assumed that the system behaves similarly at small and large spatial scales and thus the same equations can be applied however the large spatial heterogeneity in shp appeared to introduce tremendous uncertainty to this over simplification this problem is also tackled using statistical approaches like pedo transfer functions that use the readily available soil data e g soil texture bulk density and soil organic matter to estimate shp wösten et al 2001 however the insufficient number of training samples and the inherent uncertainty in the input variables e g soil texture map limit the accuracy of the estimated shp deng et al 2009 the problem of spatial scale is also dealt with using a top down perspective by inverse modeling mohanty 2013 in this approach physically based hydrological modelling is applied and by minimizing the error between modeled and observed states e g soil moisture sm shp are estimated this method can be also applied over large spatial domains however the governing equation boundary and initial conditions at larger scales become more complex thereby simulation needs considerable computation resources vrugt et al 2008 very recently thanks to the availability of long term satellite sm data from l band smos soil moisture ocean salinity and smap soil moisture active and passive missions entekhabi et al 2010 kerr et al 2001 and c band e g ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos and its successor amsr2 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 bartalis et al 2007 fujii et al 2009 lu et al 2009 we have an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the soil wetting and drying behavior on a global scale in three recent studies mccoll et al 2017 rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 satellite data from smos and smap were used for modelling sm losses through an exponential decay function by appropriately selecting multiple drydowns after precipitation events the results indicated that satellite sensors estimate faster drying rates than in situ measurements this was related to the shallower sensing depth of satellite sensors while the sampling frequency appeared to be not relevant rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 in a very recent study mccoll et al 2017 analyzed drydowns from one year of smap sm data to estimate the e folding time scale τ that is a proxy of sm storage memory using the same approach of shellito et al 2016 and rondinelli et al 2015 koster et al 2017 also introduced a method for estimating the loss function drainage plus evapotranspiration et from smap sm data with the purpose of nowcasting and forecasting few days ahead near surface moisture by using current satellite measurements and observed forecasted precipitation the estimation of the loss function for each pixel was carried out by fitting a simplified soil water balance model to smap observations and hence deriving a piecewise linear soil loss function empirically however this function is optimized only for spring and summer 2015 and its extension for other seasons has been not yet investigated koster et al 2017 in all the studies mentioned above the estimated loss function accounts for both drainage and et in drying of the soil the drainage rate dominates only at the beginning of drying process when the soil is above the field capacity mccoll et al 2017 thereby the analyzed loss function is mainly characterizing the et process however in many applications the magnitude of each drying process is required separately and particularly the drainage rate that incorporates information on shp the decoupling of et and drainage processes is not simple as they interact with each other in drying of the soil and their relative role is function of the climate soil type land use and sm conditions laio et al 2001 in this study a model called drainage from drydown dfd was developed to estimate drainage rate by analyzing multiple drydowns right after rainfall in long term sm time series in this model to decouple drainage from the et in drying events constraints are imposed on the selection of drydowns that are depending on climate and soil texture in section 2 we describe the test study sites and the datasets used the dfd concept the criteria for the selection of drydowns and the usage of sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b and a physically based surface water balance swb model brocca et al 2014a b as validating tools are described in section 3 finally the results are discussed and the reliability of drainage coefficients derived from dfd is investigated through qualitative and quantitative assessments 2 data we selected eight sites characterized by different climates and soil types across the world 4 sites from europe 2 sites from africa 1 site from

section firstly we describe the concept behind the dfd model and its formulation secondly we conduct a synthetic experiment to test the model performance under controlled conditions and to find a robust criterion for the selection of drainage driven drying events thirdly we describe a physically based surface water balance swb model and the sm2rain algorithm which are used for indirectly assessing the reliability of the drainage coefficients obtained through dfd 3 1 drainage from drydown dfd model dfd estimates the rate of drainage by considering discrete drydown events after rainfall in this method the water balance equation is written for the drydown periods in which surface runoff and et rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate 1 nz ds dt d where t is the time s is the relative sm content eq 2 n is the soil porosity z is the soil layer depth and d is the drainage rate for d we assume a power law relation between drainage rate and sm eq 3 famiglietti and wood 1994 2 s sm s m min s m max s m min 3 d a s b where sm min is minimum observed sm s m max is the maximum observed sm in the sm time series and a and b are coefficients to be determined by substituting eq 3 in eq 1 and applying the logarithmic transformation we obtain 4 ds dt a z s b log ln ds dt l n a b l n s l n z where z is the soil water capacity i e z times n by plotting sm recession scatter plot sm rsp i e the soil drying rate against sm for all selected drydowns in log log scale and by assuming z known the drainage coefficients are simply obtained by solving a linear regression the scientific challenge in this study is the selection of the drainage dominated drying events which is initially achieved by combination of two approaches 1 by selecting periods in which et rate is negligible i e choosing drydowns during the night in which et is low and 2 by selecting periods where drainage rate is dominant i e when sm is close to saturation 3 2 synthetic experiment to test the dfd model reliability under controlled conditions and to understand the interaction between the two processes in drying of the soil drainage and et synthetic sm time series are generated for different soil types and climates by using the soil water balance model developed by brocca et al 2008 2014a b specifically we used precipitation and air temperature data from sites mentioned in table 1 while the model parameters including the drainage coefficients are obtained as a function of soil texture information based on brocca et al 2016 as it is shown in table 2 as a preliminary step to check if the model is working properly the et rate is imposed to be equal to zero and synthetic sm time series are generated identified as smsynth noet then for each soil type and climate synthetic sm time series by including also et are obtained smsynth the dfd model is applied to the synthetic data to check if it can reproduce the true drainage coefficients used as input parameters of each synthetic experiment specifically the impact of et on the shape and dispersion of sm rsp is investigated by imposing different set of constraints on the drydown periods selection the best criteria that reproduce the true drainage coefficients are identified 3 3 validation of dfd 3 3 1 using swb model for validating dfd a physically based swb model which is already used for generation of synthetic soil moisture time series is employed for validation of dfd model this model that is developed by brocca et al 2008 is using soil surface water balance equation for simulation of soil moisture time series using eq 5 5 z d θ t dt f t e t g t in this equation z is the soil depth θ is the volumetric soil moisture content f t is the infiltration that is estimated using green ampt method e t is evapotranspiration and g t is drainage that is estimated by equation 3 the model parameters including drainage parameters are estimated through minimization of root mean square error between simulated and observed soil moisture data the simulation that uses these parameters to generate sm data is called swb opt on the other hand to test dfd performance the drainage parameters from dfd are employed in brocca s swb model to simulate the soil moisture temporal evolution from now on this simulation is called swb dfd which then compared with swb opt previous studies have proved that swb opt simulations are reliable brocca et al 2014a melone et al 2008 morbidelli et al 2011 for instance this model was able to successfully simulate the soil moisture and its temporal evolution with root mean square error rmse less than 0 024 m 3 m 3 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns that is an assessment of predictive ability of the hydrological model nash and sutcliffe 1970 higher than 0 68 at three european sites with different climate and soil type thus by comparing the swb opt with swb dfd the performance in terms of correlation coefficient r rmse and ns is evaluated 3 3 2 using sm2rain for the validation of dfd sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b is a bottom up approach to estimate rainfall from variations in sm content in sm2rain it is assumed that the soil is preserving a memory of the antecedent rain events thereby it can be used as a natural rain gauge to estimate rainfall entering into the soil indeed by writing the soil water balance equation during precipitation events and by assuming that the rate of et and runoff are negligible brocca et al 2015 we obtain eq 6 6 p z ds dt a s b where p is the rainfall rate and the other terms are already defined above in the previous applications of sm2rain e g brocca et al 2014a b the drainage coefficients a and b and z are estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between simulated rainfall and gauge data in this study we exploited dfd model for estimating the drainage coefficients a and b and we set the z value constant by considering the soil layer depth of the in situ sensors and by assuming a constant soil porosity of 0 5 which in this specific application of sm2rain holds true see fig s9 in the supplementary material the constant value of soil porosity might be relaxed but we found it has a small influence on the results the sm2rain results with model parameters estimated through dfd sm2r dfd i e independent from rainfall observations are compared with the classical implementation of the model in which z is fixed and a and b parameters are calibrated against rainfall observations sm2r zfixed for sm2r zfixed calibration we used the minimization of rmse against in situ rainfall observations the performance of the models are assessed in terms of r rmse and ns as it is done for in the previous validation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic experiment if drainage is the only process involved in the soil drying the sm rsp is a line smsynth noet in the log log scale when we incorporate the et smsynth sm rsp shows points above the drainage only line see fig 2 the drainage line is located at the right end sector of sm rsp where sm is close to saturation in other words the drainage rate is high only when the soil is near the saturation this area here referred as drainage dominance zone ddz changes based on the soil type indeed the ddz is wide narrow for high low values of the soil hydraulic conductivity also referred as soil permeability in the sm rsp the impact of the climate is mainly evident on the number of points contained in the right edge of the plot see fig 2 in humid climate with frequent rainfall and low rates of et the number of points in the ddz is large fig 2a and b and the opposite occurs for arid climates fig 2c and d as the et can dominate the drying process also for sm values close to the saturation especially in clayey soils fig 2d in these conditions the identification of the ddz is more challenging the shape of sm rsp varies mainly based on the soil type in sandy soil the shape is like an oblique triangle which implies a wide range of sm values actively involved in the drying of the soil by increasing the clay content the permeability decreases and the sm rsp is gradually changing to a transverse trapezoid shape in clayey soil the drainage rate is negligible and usually et is the main drying process and the sm rsp is like a rectangle since the sm rsp is reflecting the rate of water loss both climate and the soil type are influential in the shape of this plot in other words the shape of the sm rsp for the same soil type can be different in arid and humid climates therefore the analysis of the shape of the sm rsp for guessing the soil type should also consider the climatic conditions a summary of the characteristics of sm rsp at two extreme climates arid and humid and 3 soil types with different level of permeability clayey loamy and sandy is provided in table 3 one of the most important steps in dfd method is the selection of drydowns events mainly driven by the drainage process based on the result from the synthetic experiment the steps for selecting drydown periods and finding the drainage coefficients are fig 3 1 selecting drydowns after rain events in the whole period that satisfy the below criterions a the drydowns should last for at least 6 h 6 consecutive drying events and not more than 48 h b the total water loss in each drydown should be more than 2 c the minimum water loss for each drying event is 0 1 2 plotting the sm rsp scatter plot to have a first guess of soil type according to the shape of sm rsp and the 95th percentile of observed soil moisture column 3 and 4 in table 3 3 finding the ddz based on the soil type first guess the number of standard deviations from the mean of observed soil moisture and other ddz characteristics mentioned in column 5 7 of table 3 in humid climate ddz is expected to start where soil moisture is above one standard deviation away from the mean however in the arid climate due to strong effect of et ddz needs to be at least two standard away from the mean 4 bin the data within the ddz and find the lower 5th percentile of ds d t in each bin here the minimum drying rate is not chosen to account for possible noises in sm time series that can lead to the underestimation of drainage rate the number of bins has a direct impact on identifying the lower edge of the sm rsp in ddz whenever the et is dominating the drying process either because of high climatic demand arid climate or low drainage rate clayey soil the number of bins is decreased to find lower local minimum and hence closer points to the drainage only the opposite applies to lower rate of et compared to drainage sandy soil and humid climate i e the number of bins is increased in order to increase the number of points used for the linear fitting we choose 5 8 bins for arid clay 8 12 bins for humid clay 15 20 bins for arid sand and 20 30 bins for humid sand combination of climate soil type 5 a line in logarithmic scale is fitted to the points obtained in 5th percentile of each bin the slope and the intercept of the line are the scale once removed the soil water capacity term ln z and the exponent in the drainage equation eq 3 4 2 dfd application to in situ data after finding the best criteria for the selection of drydowns dfd is applied to the real soil moisture data but once we move from synthetic to real dataset different source of uncertainty are also triggered the noise in the soil moisture data can introduce error by either creating spurious drydowns or truncating real drydowns to prevent this a moving average filter with window size of 10 is applied and the smoothed soil moisture data is used for identifying the drainage dominated drydowns although the real soil moisture and ds dt data are adopted for plotting sm rsp and estimation of drainage parameters on the other hand the soil type might not be exactly same as the ones that are used in the synthetic study table 2 which can affect the shape of sm rsp plot however it is expected that they still fall in to one of the above mentioned categories i e rectangular transverse trapezoidal or triangular shape that is enough for identifying the ddz see fig 4 another underlying assumption in the dfd model is that drainage is actively involved in all drying events within the ddz however in lower soil moisture the drainage rate can be substantially decreased laio et al 2001 and if the start of ddz is not accurately identified drying events dominated by et can possibly be selected in the lower 5 percentile of ds dt we admit that this can introduce error to the model but by applying 5 steps drydown selection fig 3 it is expected that the drainage dominated drying events outnumber the ones dominated by et especially in higher soil moisture content most of the drying events in ddz and the fitted line to the lower 5 percentile mainly characterize by the drainage taking in to account these sources of uncertainty dfd is applied to the 8 study sites reported in table 1 the sm rsp for these sites and the first guess of the soil type is shown in fig 4 for 6 selected sites characterized by 2 different climates columns and 3 soil types rows apart from the shape of sm rsp the 95th percentile of observed soil moisture is also different in each row this is mainly related to the ability of the soil to retain the water i e in sandy soil the sm residence time is lower and by increasing the clay content the residence time increases resulting in larger sm values at 95th percentile of observed soil moisture this fact helps to distinguish between niger and benin see table 3 in low permeable soil the ddz is narrower and the drainage rate is low in this situation being in an arid climate in which et is actively involved in the drying process even in ddz the number of drainage driven drying events is small and the uncertainty in the fitting procedure increases table 4 shows the number of drydowns and drying events that are used for identifying the drainage parameters at each site this problem is handled by decreasing the number of bins in the selection of drydowns especially in australia site hence increasing the sample size used for the computation of 5th percentile points drainage coefficients are obtained by fitting a line to the 5th percentile of ds d t in the ddz of each site fig 5 illustrates the drainage rates obtained by the drainage coefficients estimated through dfd for all sites along with three lines representing the drainage rate in clayey loamy and sandy soils these three lines are plotted by using eq 3 with the drainage coefficients obtained from table 2 according to fig 5 the drainage rate at the vob niger and res are close to loamy sand france1 usa2 and benin are loamy and the australia1 and bib are clayey these results are consistent with the soil textures reported in table 1 except for usa2 the low reliability of in situ sm data for usa2 characterized by anomalous sudden changes in sm time series might be the reason for this result 4 3 dfd validation 4 3 1 dfd validation through swb model to take advantage of all available observed data in the validation of dfd drainage parameters obtained from dfd are used in the swb model swb dfd for simulation of soil moisture the model performance are then compared with the classical swb in which drainage parameters are estimated through calibration with observed soil moisture data swb opt the results indicate that swb dfd performance is close to swb opt in terms of correlation r but considering rmse and ns swb opt is doing slightly better see table 5 generally in sites where the drainage is the dominant term in the soil drying and the climatic demand is low for et res and vob the model has the best performance in niger though despite the good performance of swb dfd in the wet season the rate of drainage is underestimated during the dry season but it is well captured by swb opt a closer look to the diagrams reveals that most of the underestimation in the drainage rate are occurred at low soil moisture values where the drainage is not the dominant term see fig 6 this suggests that part of the estimated drainage by swb opt must account for the et swb dfd performance is also good in sites with low permeable soil benin and bib by estimating reasonably low drainage rate as expected in australia1 site both swb dfd and swb opt has a relatively large error thereby it seems that swb has problem in capturing the hydrological process at this site in usa2 the swb dfd performance is not satisfactory this appear to be related to the instrumental error indeed the sm rsp at this site has some horizontal lines at low ds dt that can be related to instrument measurement accuracy i e instrument not being able to measure low drying rate and record same value repeatedly to lower extent the same problem is also observed at france1 site although the model has still a good performance in terms of r and ns the summary of the swb dfd and swb opt performance in terms of rmse r and ns is shown in table 4 moreover a sample of simulation by these models for benin is shown in fig 6 for the other sites see the figs s9 s15 in the supplementary material 4 3 2 dfd validation through sm2rain here the drainage coefficients estimated through dfd are indirectly validated by using them as drainage parameters in sm2rain sm2r dfd these simulations are compared with the classical application of sm2rain in which a and b parameters are calibrated with in situ rainfall observations sm2r zfixed results of sm2r dfd and sm2r zfixed are illustrated in fig 7 as box plot of the three selected performance scores r rmse and ns and in fig 8 for rainfall time series the results confirm that the sm2rain drainage parameters can be obtained by dfd with satisfactory accuracy in most of the sites with median r rmse mm and ns mm2 of 0 83 5 12 and 0 5 for sm2r dfd and 0 84 4 15 and 0 7 for sm2r zfixed respectively in sites characterized by arid climate and low permeable soil benin and australia1 detecting the drying process associated from the drainage is difficult and thus the dfd performance is less satisfactory the sm2r dfd performance in australian site is better than benin benin has intensive rainy seasons in which soil moisture is almost always close to saturation see fig s3 this along with the low permeable soil can cause large fraction of rain to turn into runoff which is known to have a significant effect on sm2rain outcome due to elimination of run off in the simulation and cause underestimation in simulated precipitation this is less important in the australian site due to its semi arid climate change in soil type can improve the model performance for instance in niger site the climate is similar to benin but the soil is highly permeable thus making dfd performance acceptable at sites like usa2 and france1 the sm2r dfd performance is lower than sm2r zfixed however for france1 the model performance is not good in sm2r zfixed as well that can be driven by either inconsistency between sm time series and rainfall or from errors in the measurements for usa2 the dfd might have some problems in estimation of the drainage coefficients as explained in the previous section since sm2r zfixed is working reasonably well at res which is characterized by similar climate and soil type the model performance is relatively good it can be attributed to the deeper probe installation less affected by the surface processes the high permeable soil and the better quality of in situ observations while for almost all sites rmse is less than 8 mm at vob while correlation is in line with the other sites rmse is relatively large 19 mm this suggests that sm2r dfd overestimating rainfall but it is able to reproduce the day by day rainfall variability correctly high r value considering the accumulated rainfall curve for this site in fig 8 green and red lines there is jump in spring of 2008 and after that the distance between observed and simulated rainfall remained almost the same indeed 2008 is among the wettest years in valescure catchment with approximately 2400 mm of rainfall almost three times larger than previous year annual rainfall however in may 2008 due to malfunctioning of the main station used in this study the precipitation data is replaced by another station with almost 20 lower rainfall records tramblay et al 2010 which might result in reporting substantially lower observed precipitation rate and the large overestimation by sm2r dfd 4 4 the limitation and the possible application to the satellite data soil water losses consist of three phases when the soil moisture is high the drainage is the dominant drying process by decreasing the soil moisture drainage rate decreases and the evapotranspiration et takes control of the drying process if soil moisture remains sufficiently high water evaporates from the soil at maximum rate depending on the atmospheric demand this is called stage i of et below a certain level of soil moisture et is controlled by soil moisture and the evaporation can be less than atmospheric demand this phase is called stage ii of et laio et al 2001 according to a recent global study by mccoll et al 2017 the drainage and stage i of et usually happen quickly in most cases less than 3 days and not longer than 5 days current available l band satellite soil moisture products from smap or smos have an almost 3 days revisiting period which means roughly one drying events in each drydown can be used for capturing drainage process on the other hand dfd relies on the shape of sm rsp for having the soil type first guess and identifying the ddz therefore to get a better estimate of drainage parameters adequate number of drying events are needed to make a reliable sm rsp in this respect it is likely that soil moisture products with a higher temporal resolution like ascat or indirect soil moisture estimation algorithms using thermal and optical product like triangle method or thermal inertia with daily temporal resolution might yield a better results carlson 2007 verstraeten et al 2006 dfd provides more accurate results on humid climate and high permeable soil as the number of drying events are larger and a better shaped sm rsp is obtained thus it is suggested that pixels with these characteristics be chosen for the analysis the other limitation caused by the larger sampling frequency f of the satellite f 1 1 1 3 d 1 compare to the gauge data used in this study f 1 1 h r 1 is underestimating the drying rate and thus drainage see fig 9 the drainage is related to soil moisture by a power law equation in which the exponent of sandy soil is smaller than 1 and close to zero and for clayey soil is close to 1 laio et al 2001 mccoll et al 2017 therefore in soils with higher sand fraction the water can drain quickly before it can be capture by the next satellite overpass and as it can be seen in fig 9 lower rate of drainage will be reported this is in contrast with what is proposed by shellito et al 2016 regarding the negligible impact of sampling frequency on capturing the drying process however since the main drying process considered in their study is stage ii of et in which the soil moisture variation is small extending the time step does not have a great impact on their estimated loss function one of the other precautions that should be taken into account is the difference in the sensing depth between satellite and in situ measurements satellites are observing a shallower depth compared to the probes used in this study which might result in observing a faster drydowns and hence overestimation of drainage rate rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 on the other side hydrological fluxes are better correlated with root zone soil moisture rzsm than surface soil moisture ssm however in humid climate or wherever surface and deeper soil layer are hydrologically connected rzsm and ssm have a good correlation mccoll et al 2017 thus drainage parameters estimated from dfd using satellite data can be used although with care we also underline that in special geological cases like presence of a hydraulically impermeable layer under the soil surface the application of this method would be limited finally the scale difference can influence the results and dfd should be used with care the pixels are suggested to be homogenous in terms of climate soil type and land cover 5 conclusions valuable information regarding the processes involved in the soil drying is encoded in the sm drydowns many studies have investigated the total losses including et drainage and runoff by analyzing sm drydowns but none has attempted yet to decouple these processes in this study a new data driven approach is introduced for estimating drainage from soil moisture drydowns dfd eight different sites characterized by different climates and soil types are selected and the drainage coefficients are obtained by applying dfd to hourly in situ sm data the results indicate that dfd can well capture the drainage at these sites and the drainage coefficients are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties obtained from soil texture information to further validate the dfd model the drainage coefficients a and b are used in two models i e a physically based water balance model swb and sm2rain to estimate soil moisture and precipitation to this end first the dfd drainage parameters a and b are used in swb model to estimate soil moisture two configurations are considered for swb 1 swb opt which estimates model parameters a and b through calibration with soil moisture gauge data and 2 swb dfd which uses dfd drainage parameter in the swb model the swb dfd performance median r equal to 0 91 at almost all sites is quite close to the swb opt median r equal to 0 92 second the a and b along with the probe installation depth z and the soil porosity n are used as model parameters in estimating rainfall through sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b two sm2rain configurations are considered as well 1 sm2r zfixed that estimates model parameters a and b through calibration with rain gauge data and 2 sm2r dfd in which a and b are obtained from dfd in both cases an assigned value of the soil water capacity z zn is used the results indicate that sm2r dfd estimates rainfall with good accuracy median r equal to 0 83 with performance quite close to the estimation obtained by sm2r zfixed median r 0 85 in sites with high permeable soil and humid climate e g res in northern italy dfd provides the most reliable results both in sm2r dfd and swb dfd at sites in which drainage is not the dominant process as in the soils with high clay content or in arid climates the model performance decreases suggesting an effective separation between evapotranspiration dfd estimates are the first independent measures of drainage obtained solely from sm observations that can be used to infer large scale soil hydraulic properties that are essential parameters for global land surface and hydrological models however the smaller sampling frequency and lower sensing depth of the satellite can limit the application of the model dfd can also contribute to develop a self calibrated rainfall dataset from satellite sm data only via sm2rain i e without the need of

7019,the large heterogeneity in soil surface conditions makes it impracticable to obtain reliable estimates of soil hydraulic parameters for areas larger than few squared kilometers however identifying these parameters on a global scale is essential for many hydrological and climatic applications in this study a new approach named drainage from drydown dfd is proposed to estimate the coefficients of drainage using soil moisture observations dfd firstly selects multiple drydown events when surface runoff and evapotranspiration rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate secondly by inverting the soil water balance equation the drainage coefficients are obtained synthetic experiments are carried out in order to tune the overall procedure dfd is then tested with in situ observations at 8 different sites worldwide characterized by different climates and soil types the reliability of the dfd is evaluated by using the dfd drainage coefficients in a physically based soil water balance model swb for simulating soil moisture and a rainfall estimation model sm2rain the results indicate that the climate and the soil conditions exert an important role in the occurrence and magnitude of drainage rate dfd is found capable of correctly identify periods in which drainage rate is the dominant process drainage coefficients obtained from dfd are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties based on the soil texture and land cover at each site by using dfd drainage coefficients to estimate rainfall and soil moisture via sm2rain and swb promising results are obtained with median correlation of 0 83 and 0 91 between estimated and in situ data however in sites characterized by high rate of evapotranspiration 700 mm year and low permeable soil e g clay the dfd performance is reduced overall dfd demonstrates the ability to decouple drainage and evapotranspiration processes and to estimate the drainage coefficients from in situ observations keywords dfd drainage drydowns sm2rain water balance soil moisture 1 introduction soil hydraulic properties shp are important parameters controlling the partitioning of water and energy in the soil vereecken et al 2016 and parametrization of shp is essential for land surface and hydrological modeling montzka et al 2017 soil properties are usually estimated through field survey but shp are often not included among the measurements patil and singh 2016 moreover even though shp are normally collected through ground measurements or hydraulic tests they are available at spatial scales much smaller than what is needed in land surface and hydrological models ines and mohanty 2008 mohanty 2013 to overcome this scale gap different approaches were suggested by the soil science community for instance it is often assumed that the system behaves similarly at small and large spatial scales and thus the same equations can be applied however the large spatial heterogeneity in shp appeared to introduce tremendous uncertainty to this over simplification this problem is also tackled using statistical approaches like pedo transfer functions that use the readily available soil data e g soil texture bulk density and soil organic matter to estimate shp wösten et al 2001 however the insufficient number of training samples and the inherent uncertainty in the input variables e g soil texture map limit the accuracy of the estimated shp deng et al 2009 the problem of spatial scale is also dealt with using a top down perspective by inverse modeling mohanty 2013 in this approach physically based hydrological modelling is applied and by minimizing the error between modeled and observed states e g soil moisture sm shp are estimated this method can be also applied over large spatial domains however the governing equation boundary and initial conditions at larger scales become more complex thereby simulation needs considerable computation resources vrugt et al 2008 very recently

al 2009 we have an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the soil wetting and drying behavior on a global scale in three recent studies mccoll et al 2017 rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 satellite data from smos and smap were used for modelling sm losses through an exponential decay function by appropriately selecting multiple drydowns after precipitation events the results indicated that satellite sensors estimate faster drying rates than in situ measurements this was related to the shallower sensing depth of satellite sensors while the sampling frequency appeared to be not relevant rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 in a very recent study mccoll et al 2017 analyzed drydowns from one year of smap sm data to estimate the e folding time scale τ that is a proxy of sm storage memory using the same approach of shellito et al 2016 and rondinelli et al 2015 koster et al 2017 also introduced a method for estimating the loss function drainage plus evapotranspiration et from smap sm data with the purpose of nowcasting and forecasting few days ahead near surface moisture by using current satellite measurements and observed forecasted precipitation the estimation of the loss function for each pixel was carried out by fitting a simplified soil water balance model to smap observations and hence deriving a piecewise linear soil loss function empirically however this function is optimized only for spring and summer 2015 and its extension for other seasons has been not yet investigated koster et al 2017 in all the studies mentioned above the estimated loss function accounts for both drainage and et in drying of the soil the drainage rate dominates only at the beginning of drying process when the soil is above the field capacity mccoll et al 2017 thereby the analyzed loss function is mainly characterizing the et process however in many applications the magnitude of each drying process is required separately and particularly the drainage rate that incorporates information on shp the decoupling of et and drainage processes is not simple as they interact with each other in drying of the soil and their relative role is function of the climate soil type land use and sm conditions laio et al 2001 in this study a model called drainage from drydown dfd was developed to estimate drainage rate by analyzing multiple drydowns right after rainfall in long term sm time series in this model to decouple drainage from the et in drying events constraints are imposed on the selection of drydowns that are depending on climate and soil texture in section 2 we describe the test study sites and the datasets used the dfd concept the criteria for the selection of drydowns and the usage of sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b and a physically based surface water balance swb model brocca et al 2014a b as validating tools are described in section 3 finally the results are discussed and the reliability of drainage coefficients derived from dfd is investigated through qualitative and quantitative assessments 2 data we selected eight sites characterized by different climates and soil types across the world 4 sites from europe 2 sites from africa 1 site from

section firstly we describe the concept behind the dfd model and its formulation secondly we conduct a synthetic experiment to test the model performance under controlled conditions and to find a robust criterion for the selection of drainage driven drying events thirdly we describe a physically based surface water balance swb model and the sm2rain algorithm which are used for indirectly assessing the reliability of the drainage coefficients obtained through dfd 3 1 drainage from drydown dfd model dfd estimates the rate of drainage by considering discrete drydown events after rainfall in this method the water balance equation is written for the drydown periods in which surface runoff and et rates are negligible compared to the drainage rate 1 nz ds dt d where t is the time s is the relative sm content eq 2 n is the soil porosity z is the soil layer depth and d is the drainage rate for d we assume a power law relation between drainage rate and sm eq 3 famiglietti and wood 1994 2 s sm s m min s m max s m min 3 d a s b where sm min is minimum observed sm s m max is the maximum observed sm in the sm time series and a and b are coefficients to be determined by substituting eq 3 in eq 1 and applying the logarithmic transformation we obtain 4 ds dt a z s b log ln ds dt l n a b l n s l n z where z is the soil water capacity i e z times n by plotting sm recession scatter plot sm rsp i e the soil drying rate against sm for all selected drydowns in log log scale and by assuming z known the drainage coefficients are simply obtained by solving a linear regression the scientific challenge in this study is the selection of the drainage dominated drying events which is initially achieved by combination of two approaches 1 by selecting periods in which et rate is negligible i e choosing drydowns during the night in which et is low and 2 by selecting periods where drainage rate is dominant i e when sm is close to saturation 3 2 synthetic experiment to test the dfd model reliability under controlled conditions and to understand the interaction between the two processes in drying of the soil drainage and et synthetic sm time series are generated for different soil types and climates by using the soil water balance model developed by brocca et al 2008 2014a b specifically we used precipitation and air temperature data from sites mentioned in table 1 while the model parameters including the drainage coefficients are obtained as a function of soil texture information based on brocca et al 2016 as it is shown in table 2 as a preliminary step to check if the model is working properly the et rate is imposed to be equal to zero and synthetic sm time series are generated identified as smsynth noet then for each soil type and climate synthetic sm time series by including also et are obtained smsynth the dfd model is applied to the synthetic data to check if it can reproduce the true drainage coefficients used as input parameters of each synthetic experiment specifically the impact of et on the shape and dispersion of sm rsp is investigated by imposing different set of constraints on the drydown periods selection the best criteria that reproduce the true drainage coefficients are identified 3 3 validation of dfd 3 3 1 using swb model for validating dfd a physically based swb model which is already used for generation of synthetic soil moisture time series is employed for validation of dfd model this model that is developed by brocca et al 2008 is using soil surface water balance equation for simulation of soil moisture time series using eq 5 5 z d θ t dt f t e t g t in this equation z is the soil depth θ is the volumetric soil moisture content f t is the infiltration that is estimated using green ampt method e t is evapotranspiration and g t is drainage that is estimated by equation 3 the model parameters including drainage parameters are estimated through minimization of root mean square error between simulated and observed soil moisture data the simulation that uses these parameters to generate sm data is called swb opt on the other hand to test dfd performance the drainage parameters from dfd are employed in brocca s swb model to simulate the soil moisture temporal evolution from now on this simulation is called swb dfd which then compared with swb opt previous studies have proved that swb opt simulations are reliable brocca et al 2014a melone et al 2008 morbidelli et al 2011 for instance this model was able to successfully simulate the soil moisture and its temporal evolution with root mean square error rmse less than 0 024 m 3 m 3 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns that is an assessment of predictive ability of the hydrological model nash and sutcliffe 1970 higher than 0 68 at three european sites with different climate and soil type thus by comparing the swb opt with swb dfd the performance in terms of correlation coefficient r rmse and ns is evaluated 3 3 2 using sm2rain for the validation of dfd sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b is a bottom up approach to estimate rainfall from variations in sm content in sm2rain it is assumed that the soil is preserving a memory of the antecedent rain events thereby it can be used as a natural rain gauge to estimate rainfall entering into the soil indeed by writing the soil water balance equation during precipitation events and by assuming that the rate of et and runoff are negligible brocca et al 2015 we obtain eq 6 6 p z ds dt a s b where p is the rainfall rate and the other terms are already defined above in the previous applications of sm2rain e g brocca et al 2014a b the drainage coefficients a and b and z are estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between simulated rainfall and gauge data in this study we exploited dfd model for estimating the drainage coefficients a and b and we set the z value constant by considering the soil layer depth of the in situ sensors and by assuming a constant soil porosity of 0 5 which in this specific application of sm2rain holds true see fig s9 in the supplementary material the constant value of soil porosity might be relaxed but we found it has a small influence on the results the sm2rain results with model parameters estimated through dfd sm2r dfd i e independent from rainfall observations are compared with the classical implementation of the model in which z is fixed and a and b parameters are calibrated against rainfall observations sm2r zfixed for sm2r zfixed calibration we used the minimization of rmse against in situ rainfall observations the performance of the models are assessed in terms of r rmse and ns as it is done for in the previous validation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic experiment if drainage is the only process involved in the soil drying the sm rsp is a line smsynth noet in the log log scale when we incorporate the et smsynth sm rsp shows points above the drainage only line see fig 2 the drainage line is located at the right end sector of sm rsp where sm is close to saturation in other words the drainage rate is high only when the soil is near the saturation this area here referred as drainage dominance zone ddz changes based on the soil type indeed the ddz is wide narrow for high low values of the soil hydraulic conductivity also referred as soil permeability in the sm rsp the impact of the climate is mainly evident on the number of points contained in the right edge of the plot see fig 2 in humid climate with frequent rainfall and low rates of et the number of points in the ddz is large fig 2a and b and the opposite occurs for arid climates fig 2c and d as the et can dominate the drying process also for sm values close to the saturation especially in clayey soils fig 2d in these conditions the identification of the ddz is more challenging the shape of sm rsp varies mainly based on the soil type in sandy soil the shape is like an oblique triangle which implies a wide range of sm values actively involved in the drying of the soil by increasing the clay content the permeability decreases and the sm rsp is gradually changing to a transverse trapezoid shape in clayey soil the drainage rate is negligible and usually et is the main drying process and the sm rsp is like a rectangle since the sm rsp is reflecting the rate of water loss both climate and the soil type are influential in the shape of this plot in other words the shape of the sm rsp for the same soil type can be different in arid and humid climates therefore the analysis of the shape of the sm rsp for guessing the soil type should also consider the climatic conditions a summary of the characteristics of sm rsp at two extreme climates arid and humid and 3 soil types with different level of permeability clayey loamy and sandy is provided in table 3 one of the most important steps in dfd method is the selection of drydowns events mainly driven by the drainage process based on the result from the synthetic experiment the steps for selecting drydown periods and finding the drainage coefficients are fig 3 1 selecting drydowns after rain events in the whole period that satisfy the below criterions a the drydowns should last for at least 6 h 6 consecutive drying events and not more than 48 h b the total water loss in each drydown should be more than 2 c the minimum water loss for each drying event is 0 1 2 plotting the sm rsp scatter plot to have a first guess of soil type according to the shape of sm rsp and the 95th percentile of observed soil moisture column 3 and 4 in table 3 3 finding the ddz based on the soil type first guess the number of standard deviations from the mean of observed soil moisture and other ddz characteristics mentioned in column 5 7 of table 3 in humid climate ddz is expected to start where soil moisture is above one standard deviation away from the mean however in the arid climate due to strong effect of et ddz needs to be at least two standard away from the mean 4 bin the data within the ddz and find the lower 5th percentile of ds d t in each bin here the minimum drying rate is not chosen to account for possible noises in sm time series that can lead to the underestimation of drainage rate the number of bins has a direct impact on identifying the lower edge of the sm rsp in ddz whenever the et is dominating the drying process either because of high climatic demand arid climate or low drainage rate clayey soil the number of bins is decreased to find lower local minimum and hence closer points to the drainage only the opposite applies to lower rate of et compared to drainage sandy soil and humid climate i e the number of bins is increased in order to increase the number of points used for the linear fitting we choose 5 8 bins for arid clay 8 12 bins for humid clay 15 20 bins for arid sand and 20 30 bins for humid sand combination of climate soil type 5 a line in logarithmic scale is fitted to the points obtained in 5th percentile of each bin the slope and the intercept of the line are the scale once removed the soil water capacity term ln z and the exponent in the drainage equation eq 3 4 2 dfd application to in situ data after finding the best criteria for the selection of drydowns dfd is applied to the real soil moisture data but once we move from synthetic to real dataset different source of uncertainty are also triggered the noise in the soil moisture data can introduce error by either creating spurious drydowns or truncating real drydowns to prevent this a moving average filter with window size of 10 is applied and the smoothed soil moisture data is used for identifying the drainage dominated drydowns although the real soil moisture and ds dt data are adopted for plotting sm rsp and estimation of drainage parameters on the other hand the soil type might not be exactly same as the ones that are used in the synthetic study table 2 which can affect the shape of sm rsp plot however it is expected that they still fall in to one of the above mentioned categories i e rectangular transverse trapezoidal or triangular shape that is enough for identifying the ddz see fig 4 another underlying assumption in the dfd model is that drainage is actively involved in all drying events within the ddz however in lower soil moisture the drainage rate can be substantially decreased laio et al 2001 and if the start of ddz is not accurately identified drying events dominated by et can possibly be selected in the lower 5 percentile of ds dt we admit that this can introduce error to the model but by applying 5 steps drydown selection fig 3 it is expected that the drainage dominated drying events outnumber the ones dominated by et especially in higher soil moisture content most of the drying events in ddz and the fitted line to the lower 5 percentile mainly characterize by the drainage taking in to account these sources of uncertainty dfd is applied to the 8 study sites reported in table 1 the sm rsp for these sites and the first guess of the soil type is shown in fig 4 for 6 selected sites characterized by 2 different climates columns and 3 soil types rows apart from the shape of sm rsp the 95th percentile of observed soil moisture is also different in each row this is mainly related to the ability of the soil to retain the water i e in sandy soil the sm residence time is lower and by increasing the clay content the residence time increases resulting in larger sm values at 95th percentile of observed soil moisture this fact helps to distinguish between niger and benin see table 3 in low permeable soil the ddz is narrower and the drainage rate is low in this situation being in an arid climate in which et is actively involved in the drying process even in ddz the number of drainage driven drying events is small and the uncertainty in the fitting procedure increases table 4 shows the number of drydowns and drying events that are used for identifying the drainage parameters at each site this problem is handled by decreasing the number of bins in the selection of drydowns especially in australia site hence increasing the sample size used for the computation of 5th percentile points drainage coefficients are obtained by fitting a line to the 5th percentile of ds d t in the ddz of each site fig 5 illustrates the drainage rates obtained by the drainage coefficients estimated through dfd for all sites along with three lines representing the drainage rate in clayey loamy and sandy soils these three lines are plotted by using eq 3 with the drainage coefficients obtained from table 2 according to fig 5 the drainage rate at the vob niger and res are close to loamy sand france1 usa2 and benin are loamy and the australia1 and bib are clayey these results are consistent with the soil textures reported in table 1 except for usa2 the low reliability of in situ sm data for usa2 characterized by anomalous sudden changes in sm time series might be the reason for this result 4 3 dfd validation 4 3 1 dfd validation through swb model to take advantage of all available observed data in the validation of dfd drainage parameters obtained from dfd are used in the swb model swb dfd for simulation of soil moisture the model performance are then compared with the classical swb in which drainage parameters are estimated through calibration with observed soil moisture data swb opt the results indicate that swb dfd performance is close to swb opt in terms of correlation r but considering rmse and ns swb opt is doing slightly better see table 5 generally in sites where the drainage is the dominant term in the soil drying and the climatic demand is low for et res and vob the model has the best performance in niger though despite the good performance of swb dfd in the wet season the rate of drainage is underestimated during the dry season but it is well captured by swb opt a closer look to the diagrams reveals that most of the underestimation in the drainage rate are occurred at low soil moisture values where the drainage is not the dominant term see fig 6 this suggests that part of the estimated drainage by swb opt must account for the et swb dfd performance is also good in sites with low permeable soil benin and bib by estimating reasonably low drainage rate as expected in australia1 site both swb dfd and swb opt has a relatively large error thereby it seems that swb has problem in capturing the hydrological process at this site in usa2 the swb dfd performance is not satisfactory this appear to be related to the instrumental error indeed the sm rsp at this site has some horizontal lines at low ds dt that can be related to instrument measurement accuracy i e instrument not being able to measure low drying rate and record same value repeatedly to lower extent the same problem is also observed at france1 site although the model has still a good performance in terms of r and ns the summary of the swb dfd and swb opt performance in terms of rmse r and ns is shown in table 4 moreover a sample of simulation by these models for benin is shown in fig 6 for the other sites see the figs s9 s15 in the supplementary material 4 3 2 dfd validation through sm2rain here the drainage coefficients estimated through dfd are indirectly validated by using them as drainage parameters in sm2rain sm2r dfd these simulations are compared with the classical application of sm2rain in which a and b parameters are calibrated with in situ rainfall observations sm2r zfixed results of sm2r dfd and sm2r zfixed are illustrated in fig 7 as box plot of the three selected performance scores r rmse and ns and in fig 8 for rainfall time series the results confirm that the sm2rain drainage parameters can be obtained by dfd with satisfactory accuracy in most of the sites with median r rmse mm and ns mm2 of 0 83 5 12 and 0 5 for sm2r dfd and 0 84 4 15 and 0 7 for sm2r zfixed respectively in sites characterized by arid climate and low permeable soil benin and australia1 detecting the drying process associated from the drainage is difficult and thus the dfd performance is less satisfactory the sm2r dfd performance in australian site is better than benin benin has intensive rainy seasons in which soil moisture is almost always close to saturation see fig s3 this along with the low permeable soil can cause large fraction of rain to turn into runoff which is known to have a significant effect on sm2rain outcome due to elimination of run off in the simulation and cause underestimation in simulated precipitation this is less important in the australian site due to its semi arid climate change in soil type can improve the model performance for instance in niger site the climate is similar to benin but the soil is highly permeable thus making dfd performance acceptable at sites like usa2 and france1 the sm2r dfd performance is lower than sm2r zfixed however for france1 the model performance is not good in sm2r zfixed as well that can be driven by either inconsistency between sm time series and rainfall or from errors in the measurements for usa2 the dfd might have some problems in estimation of the drainage coefficients as explained in the previous section since sm2r zfixed is working reasonably well at res which is characterized by similar climate and soil type the model performance is relatively good it can be attributed to the deeper probe installation less affected by the surface processes the high permeable soil and the better quality of in situ observations while for almost all sites rmse is less than 8 mm at vob while correlation is in line with the other sites rmse is relatively large 19 mm this suggests that sm2r dfd overestimating rainfall but it is able to reproduce the day by day rainfall variability correctly high r value considering the accumulated rainfall curve for this site in fig 8 green and red lines there is jump in spring of 2008 and after that the distance between observed and simulated rainfall remained almost the same indeed 2008 is among the wettest years in valescure catchment with approximately 2400 mm of rainfall almost three times larger than previous year annual rainfall however in may 2008 due to malfunctioning of the main station used in this study the precipitation data is replaced by another station with almost 20 lower rainfall records tramblay et al 2010 which might result in reporting substantially lower observed precipitation rate and the large overestimation by sm2r dfd 4 4 the limitation and the possible application to the satellite data soil water losses consist of three phases when the soil moisture is high the drainage is the dominant drying process by decreasing the soil moisture drainage rate decreases and the evapotranspiration et takes control of the drying process if soil moisture remains sufficiently high water evaporates from the soil at maximum rate depending on the atmospheric demand this is called stage i of et below a certain level of soil moisture et is controlled by soil moisture and the evaporation can be less than atmospheric demand this phase is called stage ii of et laio et al 2001 according to a recent global study by mccoll et al 2017 the drainage and stage i of et usually happen quickly in most cases less than 3 days and not longer than 5 days current available l band satellite soil moisture products from smap or smos have an almost 3 days revisiting period which means roughly one drying events in each drydown can be used for capturing drainage process on the other hand dfd relies on the shape of sm rsp for having the soil type first guess and identifying the ddz therefore to get a better estimate of drainage parameters adequate number of drying events are needed to make a reliable sm rsp in this respect it is likely that soil moisture products with a higher temporal resolution like ascat or indirect soil moisture estimation algorithms using thermal and optical product like triangle method or thermal inertia with daily temporal resolution might yield a better results carlson 2007 verstraeten et al 2006 dfd provides more accurate results on humid climate and high permeable soil as the number of drying events are larger and a better shaped sm rsp is obtained thus it is suggested that pixels with these characteristics be chosen for the analysis the other limitation caused by the larger sampling frequency f of the satellite f 1 1 1 3 d 1 compare to the gauge data used in this study f 1 1 h r 1 is underestimating the drying rate and thus drainage see fig 9 the drainage is related to soil moisture by a power law equation in which the exponent of sandy soil is smaller than 1 and close to zero and for clayey soil is close to 1 laio et al 2001 mccoll et al 2017 therefore in soils with higher sand fraction the water can drain quickly before it can be capture by the next satellite overpass and as it can be seen in fig 9 lower rate of drainage will be reported this is in contrast with what is proposed by shellito et al 2016 regarding the negligible impact of sampling frequency on capturing the drying process however since the main drying process considered in their study is stage ii of et in which the soil moisture variation is small extending the time step does not have a great impact on their estimated loss function one of the other precautions that should be taken into account is the difference in the sensing depth between satellite and in situ measurements satellites are observing a shallower depth compared to the probes used in this study which might result in observing a faster drydowns and hence overestimation of drainage rate rondinelli et al 2015 shellito et al 2016 on the other side hydrological fluxes are better correlated with root zone soil moisture rzsm than surface soil moisture ssm however in humid climate or wherever surface and deeper soil layer are hydrologically connected rzsm and ssm have a good correlation mccoll et al 2017 thus drainage parameters estimated from dfd using satellite data can be used although with care we also underline that in special geological cases like presence of a hydraulically impermeable layer under the soil surface the application of this method would be limited finally the scale difference can influence the results and dfd should be used with care the pixels are suggested to be homogenous in terms of climate soil type and land cover 5 conclusions valuable information regarding the processes involved in the soil drying is encoded in the sm drydowns many studies have investigated the total losses including et drainage and runoff by analyzing sm drydowns but none has attempted yet to decouple these processes in this study a new data driven approach is introduced for estimating drainage from soil moisture drydowns dfd eight different sites characterized by different climates and soil types are selected and the drainage coefficients are obtained by applying dfd to hourly in situ sm data the results indicate that dfd can well capture the drainage at these sites and the drainage coefficients are consistent with the expected soil hydraulic properties obtained from soil texture information to further validate the dfd model the drainage coefficients a and b are used in two models i e a physically based water balance model swb and sm2rain to estimate soil moisture and precipitation to this end first the dfd drainage parameters a and b are used in swb model to estimate soil moisture two configurations are considered for swb 1 swb opt which estimates model parameters a and b through calibration with soil moisture gauge data and 2 swb dfd which uses dfd drainage parameter in the swb model the swb dfd performance median r equal to 0 91 at almost all sites is quite close to the swb opt median r equal to 0 92 second the a and b along with the probe installation depth z and the soil porosity n are used as model parameters in estimating rainfall through sm2rain brocca et al 2014a b two sm2rain configurations are considered as well 1 sm2r zfixed that estimates model parameters a and b through calibration with rain gauge data and 2 sm2r dfd in which a and b are obtained from dfd in both cases an assigned value of the soil water capacity z zn is used the results indicate that sm2r dfd estimates rainfall with good accuracy median r equal to 0 83 with performance quite close to the estimation obtained by sm2r zfixed median r 0 85 in sites with high permeable soil and humid climate e g res in northern italy dfd provides the most reliable results both in sm2r dfd and swb dfd at sites in which drainage is not the dominant process as in the soils with high clay content or in arid climates the model performance decreases suggesting an effective separation between evapotranspiration dfd estimates are the first independent measures of drainage obtained solely from sm observations that can be used to infer large scale soil hydraulic properties that are essential parameters for global land surface and hydrological models however the smaller sampling frequency and lower sensing depth of the satellite can limit the application of the model dfd can also contribute to develop a self calibrated rainfall dataset from satellite sm data only via sm2rain i e without the need of
